Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 15th, 2017 halfway through the month of May. Oh Jesus Christ. Do you know Bobby or scored that fucking overtime goal on mother's Day to win the Stanley Cup back then? You know, I think you only had to win eight. It was like fucking 12 teams. He had the original six and the expansion six, the original six really weren't the original six. They would just to six leftover after fuck in the stock market crash or some shit. They were the only guys left or after World War One. I can't remember. Didn't like the Lusitania sink. And then that like half the players on them fucking Montreal maroons were on it. I don't know. What does his stump the fucking shwarmy over here. You don't? He has been been, uh, she's been recording um, the sports jeopardy, Aka Buffalo wild wings. Jeopardy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       I would tell you, even as a sports fan, it's not easy, but, oh, do I seem like a smarty when I'm watching that show to the point, Nia goes, if they ever do any sort of fucking, you know, comedian, uh, sports jeopardy thing where you can give the money to a charity. I love that shit. It's like I'm going to go on TV onto a game show, one of the hardest game shows out there. Jeopardy. Granted it's all going to be about sports, but they do a lot of shit of like, you know, you know, who was the first free agent to fucking get new a fight with Al Davis, Amsterdam. I don't fucking know. Right. I'm named the last three owners of the Seattle Seahawks. Like they take it to that level, you know what I mean? Um, but I love how you know, you, me, he was like, oh, you should go on then just, you know, give the money to a charity. Fuck the charity. I do enough benefits as a comedian. I can't go on TV and try to win some money from me.

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       You know, hit a couple of categories, sitting there going, well, you know, I'm going to go on TV and expose how limited my fucking, I don't know my world is, I don't know. I'm going to go on TV and make an ass of myself and then give it to some dirty face kid afterwards. I'm gonna lose. And then what some kid who grew up in a fucking chimney is going to sit there crying cause I went there and basically did the babe Ruth thing, a kid. I'll go out there and hit a home run for you today, except I'll do it with my mind man. And I'm going to go out there and I'm going to fucking lose cause they're gonna be like, ah. Yeah. What brand of baseball glove did goose Gossett's use when he was still on the fucking Oakland ace? A Rawlings?

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       Oh no, sorry. The correct answer was a Wilson douchebag family with the chance to steal. Um, I actually did, uh, you know, if I can remember the category, my problem with those shows is sometimes like, I don't understand the, uh, you know, they'll say like get Carter and it takes like me for like fucking three in a row to understand like, oh, these are, everybody's got the last thing. Carter, I got the hardest one too. Or maybe I'm just the oldest. They brought up the fucking, the dude on Michigan who then I think went to the fucking USFL. I'm like this fucking Anthony Carter number one first started watching college football. He was demand out there with the wolverines. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       Popped bar, Bar bar, Bar, Bar, Bar, Bar bar.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       That doesn't look great. Fucking fight songs of all time to Michigan world. Lorene's yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       That uh, that uh, that uh, that uh, that Duh, I'm fine.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       Go with you. I know why. What goes hail to factors value and I was singing the Notre Dame song. Oh, Jesus is tank Milo Jay. Sheesh. They go on foot. Two point conversion there. Jesus, what do you got to say? Well, you know, I mean, if they make it, they make it. I mean, I love everything buddy. Get out of this fucking locker room. You Baird it hippie. That's what happened. If Jesus came back, Jesus ever went to the locker room and Newt Rockne was in there, right? Oh, five foot, nothing of them considered fucking average height. Way Back in the day before they put the horse tranquilizers in the fucking horse meat that they fed to the horses that they then fed to the cows. Right. That then in my burger.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       maybe that's why I have such a fucking disposition. I eat a lot of red meat.

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       This is how much red meat I eat. I don't consider hamburger red meat. To me, red meat is, I had a steak. I have a burger man. It's, it's a, it's not, it's not red. After I'm done cooking it, you know? Actually it's not even true. I like, I like all of it. Medium rare and what I've been told by a life freaks where they're like, look, you can have a steak medium rare. That's a lot less of a risk because that's just one cap. You know, you rolling the dice, it's like your bang one hooker without wearing a glove, a Chase's bill. Right. And then hamburger though, it's like you bank Vietnam. I don't know. Oh, I picked Vietnam some reason I went to fucking full metal jacket. Hey Baby, you got go from Vietnam. It's like you banged a fucking country or that, that's what hamburger is.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       Cause it's just a bunch of cows all fucking mulch together. Right. You have a stake. It's like you just fucked one cow. That's what I'm trying to, or steer I should say. What's the stair? Well that's a bow without his balls buddy. All right. And take off it's fucking horns. Um, I don't know what it is anyways. And if you have hamburger that's like, you know, you know, you're just Freddie mercury running around fucking the whole free world. Isn't that basically it? I mean, I'm not, you know, I'm not, I don't know my way around the kitchen enough to s to know if that analogy worked or not. But, uh, I will say that I, let's just get back to the original point. Okay. What was the original point? Yeah. I don't consider hamburger red meat or was it that I'm not giving some fucking kid who lives in a chimney.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       I don't know why. A chimney, you know, you know what, seeing broke children is always sad unless they're white. This just something fucking funny. But yet, you know, I think it's just a relief as a white person that the guilt goes away. You don't know. You know, anytime you see somebody from another race broke, you know, white people fucking pushed him out. They put a Walmart down, right? They put one of those, Derek's in there. They started sucking all the fucking shit out of it. You know, I wonder if people around the world when they watched the beginning of the Beverly hillbillies start crying. You know, when they just see the white man, even though the first they laugh like, oh my God, it's toothless, broke white people hilarious. And even they discover oil and they get to keep it solely loaded up. The drunk animal, the Beverly Hills. That is um, I wonder if they cry when the children cry. You know, nobody gets to movie. I was talking about, I kept references. We had problems with defeat and we baggy shit.

Speaker 3:          00:07:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Um, anyway, so let's apply. Speaking of that, children cry. That's white line. Everybody when the children cry was actually a hit. That's how fucking off the rails music went at one point.

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       Little Chat [inaudible] I was like on the top 10. I remember watching it. I didn't give a fuck about that song, but I was like that lead guitar instead of all these fucking guys trying to be Eddie van Halen. Am I saying this guy was there trying to do the shit that Eddie did? That fucking guy in white line. He came the closest, you know, out of all the white bands, you know the white lions, the fucking, who else was it? A, it was white Lion Jews. Great White. It was white snake. It was eight Aye. It was a little known all white funk band. Cause then what people used to yell when they want to say, I can't remember how it goes. I Dunno. Um, anyways, speaking of children crying, my condolences to, uh, all the fans of the Washington capitals. And you know what happens when you hit the fucking wall for the third time when you win the president's trophy, you know, under two different presidents.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       Okay. When Obama brings you to, and Donald Trump comes in with his tie hanging all the way down, his tie would still touch the ground. Even if he was wearing skates. He comes walking in the locker room and he gives you that fucking trophy. You're right, you're on your second damn president. You've left the ugliest uniforms in the history of the fucking game of hockey, possibly. Definitely up there. Those blue ones with that gold fucking eagle, you know, it just looks like they put a stamp, like the, like the post office had a limited stamp thing, you know? Then all those weird fucking smelly people, you know, people who don't bathe, collect stamps, you know, and I'm not saying that, you know, with all this stuff, like what do you identify with a man or a woman, you know, being a man, I don't, I, I'm a man, but I don't identify as, don't identify where he imagined the fucking emptiness of that every day.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       Waking Up, shave and going, what the fuck is this? I can't relate to this fucking beard on my face, man. You know, when am I, Ted's going to come in. I just, I can't imagine that. But whenever there's other people that can't, you know, they don't identify with other human beings, forget about, they don't identify with their own gender. There's another group of people that we all need to care about and wear a certain color on a certain day or maybe a ribbon for, and these are people that can identify with other people. They just can't identify with human beings in general. And these people collect stamps, you know, they just sit in their room. They're not bothering anybody. Taking that big giant fucking book off that shelf, you know, blowing the dust off it. Cause they finally got the Washington Capitols fucking horrific Jersey from the mid to early two thousands whenever they had that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       It was that awful period. That's why in the NHL, the added too many fucking teams and everybody changed their uniforms. I should put it all on the capitalist, Washington DC. Fucking horrific. Thank God they went back to the red, white and blue. You know, I mean, you are there in DC for fuck sakes. You know, if anybody shoved the color of the flag, you should be you guys. You know the Buffalo Sabers, that fucking IHL horseshit they had, you know, where they put a sheep on the front of even was like a bull anymore. It was terrible. Fucking terrible. Um, props to them. By the way, when they, they finally admitted that they made a fucking mess. That was such a horrible period. They had that strike that. They lost a whole season of the NHL. All right. They added a bunch of fucking teams. Too many goddamn teams.

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       They had the Atlanta thrashers, they had the fucking Florida Marlins, right? That's right. They played hockey first before. They suck so bad. They were like, you know what? Let's just fucking play baseball now. If the Florida panthers, the lightning, the coyotes, and I think the north stars moved down to become the stars, at least they kept the kind of the there are right, cause they kept the same fucking uniforms. Then of course they knocked down that stadium in Minnesota and they put up the mall of America there. But it's so sad that you know the place would dino Sorelli smashed a stick over that fucking guy's head. You can now sit there standing there eating frozen yogurt without a care in the world, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       Or did what? Was that a road game anyways? Um, fuck am I talking about here? That's right. So then you had all these new teams in the NHL and then on top of that, all these teams that had been established all changed their fucking uniforms. So you, you, you come back after the strike and you just watching like, dude, is this the fucking Olympics? Well actually that's not true cause that, or they started doing that in the 90s because when the Sabres, the Sabres got fun in 1999, you know, back when you could even have a fucking shoelace. Tough like fucking shoe leather. That mood Sarell Huh? Who knows that one? There's another obscure tough like fucking shoe leather, that Mozzarella, Mozzarella, whatever the fuck you said Mozzarella. Huh? Who knows that one?

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       If you're religious, you might know that. That's a hint. The title has something religious. Every religious figure in it and it's not Jesus Christ superstar. That's the last hint I'm going to give you. Um, yeah, the savers got fucking 1999. Was it Brett Hall? Was it fucking, uh, uh, Danny Mashburn? I don't know who the fuck was. Joe B Joe Barry Carroll who had that foot in the fucking crease. I can't remember. But the whole year they're calling it until the biggest goal of the year. The one that decides to Stanley Cup Classic NHL. Yeah, that new rule. That's been fucking everybody all year round. Yeah, forget it. We've decided to change the rule and over time in the clinching game of the Stanley Cup playoffs, that's how we do it. That's right. That's how we do it. We take breaks every 20 minutes and a, we have rules that all of a sudden the rules go away.

Speaker 1:          00:13:57       So anyways, my condolences to the city, to the district of Columbia capital fans, man, they fucking did it. T again. You know, when you keep showing up cause you real fans, you know what's going to suck. Now they're going to dismantle the entire fucking team. Hopefully they keep a veggie skin. You guys are out of your fucking minds. If you get rid of him, are they going to blame it all on him? Did you see that picture of his leg? I'll fucking bruised up. He looked like somebody tried to get information out of him and he wouldn't give it up, you know, fucking vein sticking out. Um, uh, my daughter's crying in there. Oh Jesus Christ. And I feel like a bad dad, but he is in there. Okay. He is handling it. Don't worry. Can you hear that? Yeah. This is the time of night. Like she's so like wants to know everything that's going on that she does.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       She won't nap enough during the, and by the way, fuck all your suggestions. I don't want to hear a million suggestions. Put one of her shirts in in the bath than that. We've tried everything. Okay. It's just, you know, it's a phase she's going through and I am done listening to fucking people who are not wearing lab coats and if you don't have a lab coat on and you don't have a fucking little degree hanging on a wall behind you, just keep your fucking ideas to yourself. Okay. The level of shit that parents talk every fucking one of them as a Goddamn cure for every fucking thing that happens. Every one of them just glided through fucking being a parent or four figured it all out and for some stupid reason they didn't cash in on it and write a book. Why would you do that when you can just show up to somebody's house and vomit all your fucking ideas on a, if any of your people's fucking ideas work, you should put it in a book and go on the Oprah channel and you guys can sit there holding each other's fucking hands and she tells you how amazing you are.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       Instead of coming over here, boring me with it and then I go and try it. You know? Actually, you know what the shirt one worked, the shirt one did work. I will say that. I should, I shouldn't have fucking said that because a relative suggested to me and it was fucking great. That's just the first thing that popped in my head. I was actually thinking about somebody else that annoyed the shit out of me with something else. I'm trying to feed my kids solid food three months into her life. Oh no, it's fine. It's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       Oh God. This is, this is the danger of riffing. Cause you ended up shitting on the person you're not upset with. Um, anyways, plumbing ahead. Uh, where am I? Oh yeah, the condolences. You know, so I would, I would definitely keep Ovechkin you got to build around the guy, build around the guy again in a, you know, get a coach with a neck and, you know, you know, maybe he can see if something was off sides and not, and he could, he could throw the flag or whatever you do to challenge it instead of sitting there with his, his, his spine fused. Um, somebody made the joke said that every coach in the NFL in the NHL looks like a bond villain. And uh, it is true. I, I gotta go with that. You know what I mean? Um, although I would say that closed Julian closed.

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       Julian looks like that, that dude in the swamp thing that when he got turned into a monster became that little guy running around. That was such a weird fucking movie where, I don't even remember the name of the movie. The whole thing about the movie was it was this chicken shed, these giant fucking tits and you're just waiting for her to go into the lake. So they'd show a little side boob. Now, this is the early eighties. That was a big fucking thing when you were like 12 years old. All right, so the deal with the swamp thing, which is where I got that thing I had broken with the, and we Becky's, that's, that's where it's from. It's from the swamping. I'm obviously fucking with you. Um, what am I talking about? Yeah, the swamp thing. Right. So how that worked. He was, he was, I forget what headed the guy was walking near a swamp, you know the usual thing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       And then a telephone pole falls into the fucking swamp. He gets electrocuted and then he becomes the swamp thing and he's as strong as shit and there's some fucking bad guy. So they figure out how he became the swamp thing. So then the bad guy wants, he wants a swamp thing, have him send army a swamp thing. So whatever you can take over all the swamps. I don't, I don't remember. Right. So this fucking little weasel, he dude, he does the same thing. And when he turns into a monster, he says, little as fucking weasely monster. So then the bad guy goes, well, how come he didn't turn into what you are? And it says, well, you know, when you get electrocuted in the swamp and you turn into a swamp thing, it just enhances your personality. All right? So if you're a fucking stud like me who even know I look like a swamp thing, I could still bang that big tinted hor over there and the lake.

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       Uh, if you're a little weaselly con you just become an ugly weasley con with like mud and leaves for skin. They go people and I, you know, I can't think of a bet. Sorry, just blew out years there. I can't think of a better time to read a little bit of advertising. What do you say? What do you say that, what do we got here? Oh wait, I've got to finish. So you know. Okay, well I think I can say to DC fans is a, when you finally fucking went it, it makes it all the sweeter. Just going through all of this shit. All right. I watched the Bruins from about 79 80 and I had to wait til like 2011 so what's that? A a nine 99 2009 I watched him for about 33 years. All right. Um, and I know you guys. Woo Woo Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       Oh, shut up. Shut up. All right. You got all those monuments. She could fucking walk around Ya. Cheer up. Did look at the window. The wizits forced the game. Seven. I'll talk about that a little later after I'd read a couple of fucking advertisements here. Hell, x everybody. Helix. You're unique. Oh, you're a special little fucking content yet. You don't walk like everyone else. Talk like everyone else. Sleep shoot, chariot like anyone else. So let me ask you this, why is your mattress one size fits all? I hate this question. It's just because there's a general height that okay, from a little baby all the way up to like if you make a mattress that fits somebody about six foot four, you're covering like babies all the way to like 90% of adults. It has to be right. I don't know. What do I know about mattresses?

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       About as much as I know about reading out loud, but I'm going to continue because a truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until now.

Sorry. No, what really happens is the most comfortable mattress you've ever slept on shows up, right? You lady lays in it. She's like, oh my God, this is great, right? She reaches over for your fucking Meat Hammer and next thing you know you need to buy a new mattress.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       He likes customers report a 30% improvement in overall sleep quality and for couples. They customize each side of the mattress. The beginning of the end of your marriage, um, is when you have the custom telling you that's the beginning end of it. That starts with that. And then he goes, you know, it'd be great if your tits were a little bit bigger, right? And then she starts redoing herself like Matt Damon in the Liberace movie. And then one day just gets rid of her. And maybe nowadays with millennials, it probably goes the opposite way. The way these broads a slap and the guys around in the shows now, it's unbelievable hanging them off of fucking balconies and stuff. Your mattress arrives at your door in about a week and shipping is 100% free. That's why everyone from GQ magazine to Forbes are all talking about helic sleep. That's what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:29:20       Oh, he fucking went off on me. He fucking put me in his place when he sat down in his goddamn keyboard. I'll get to this in a minute. I will get to this in a minute. I like this guy who gives me shit about the airline bumping. You know why? Because it's very few people out there that defend the man. All right? Anybody can attack the man every once in a while. It takes a fucking a fucking, I dunno, the Internet version of that. Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western guy coming into town with his little fucking Mike Tyson's colorful Mike Tyson towel over his fucking head. Bye. That's how broke Mike Tyson was when he was a pony. First started out, he was like, I want to dress like Clint Eastwood. And they said, all right, we'll get you his underwear, his boots, and we'll get that little fucking, that little Sharley puts over. But you know, we can't afford to put any color on it, you know? And that's the kind of thing that leads you to bite somebody's ear off. I'm just saying, I'm not trying to say that what he did was right, but I'm just saying I understand. Um, hey, how you doing up there in Montreal? Everybody Moray all Canada. How's things going up there? Enjoying the fucking off season. God knows you're gonna have enough time to come and see me in June.

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       This is what I'm loving about the predators. All right. Although they seem like they're losing right now, I'm taping the game, but I'll fuck, I'll fuck myself over here and I'll just look it up right now. Oh, look at that. The little time trial thing and you're going to fucking load for me. I think the ducks were up five to two or five to three. How fucking weird are these playoffs this year? You know? Anyways, now you know, I always give you guys shit about pet, the curse of Patrick Wa. You humiliated that guy. I mean, what you guys did to him when you watch like, like horror movies, you know what I mean? When somebody like, you know, thinks their prom queen and then you'd dump a bunch of blood on them or they think that they're going to go make a wish in a well and then their mother pushes them to the bottom of it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       You know what I mean? They think they get, you know that, that all of that shit, all of that Shit, right? Somebody drowns in a fucking lake. You guys did the hockey version of that to Patrick Wa, you know, he thought you guys loved them. They see why there was like Kerry, he came out there, you know, has one fucking bad game. You won't pull him. You leave him in there, you fucking do a mock cheer. When this guy who redefined the position, first ballot hall of Famer, continuing the tradition of winning fucking Stanley Cups, you know, and he wanted to earn the real era when there was like 30 fucking teams, 28 teams, not all those cups that Canadians and maple leafs one back in the day when it wasn't even the state, it was like a fucking shot glass. It seemed skating around with the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       Let's say a fucking baton, you know, before it became that giant Goddamn thing. Um, anyways, they booted him out of town. So ever since then there's been the curse of Patrick Wa and I think the next fucking part in the next chapter of the curse, okay, is PK sue. But you know, you know what? They ran him out of fucking tee ran that guy at attempt. Now this wasn't your fans. I think it was the organization. I also think it's because I'm a Bruins. I just love giving you guys shit cause what am I going to do? Talk about championships. You guys are going to destroy me. So this is this little fucking little thorn I can put in the underneath your fucking elephant foot here. All right. What? PK was a fucking great dude and he gave too much money. That children's hospital, he started becoming bigger than the Canadians and the Canadians could fucking handle it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       Like when Colby couldn't handle shack and he said, look, either he goes awry, go and they said, okay Colby. And they sent shack to Miami and then he went to fucking title there, right. Then they had to bring Phil Jackson back and another 50,000 fucking free agents as they always fucking do. You know, I, you know, I just give Koby Shit for the first, the first three rings, get the Fuck Outta here. The last two. I'll give you those, you know, even with the officiating in that second time you played the Celtics, hey, let's call fucking 38 files on one team and 17 on the other. That's, that makes for a good game. Seven doesn't it? Not Saying that we would've won, but it would have been nice to see the Lakers beat the Celtics that year. Just saying, um, anyways, plowing ahead. So now the predators are up one to nothing against the fucking Emilio s Istem as is the Shane's. Whenever the fuck you call them down there, the mighty, the mighty Shane's. Okay. The Anaheim s Devis is the mighty ducks. I don't like the ducks. I don't like ducks. Don't give a fuck. I just don't like them. Okay. I don't like the Honda Center. Okay. I you go there, there's no fucking vibe. There's no vibe in Anaheim. It's just a fucking, it's just, I don't know what it is. It's just a strange God damn place. Anaheim is fucking weird.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       It's whole fucking La Aries weird. Like people weren't supposed to live here. You know what I mean? They weren't supposed to fucking live here. It's a fucking desert. We still water the whole, the whole thing's weird, but at least you know this, this cool shit to look at. You know? Except when you go to Anaheim, I don't know what you look at. All right, and you go down there, there's no fucking vibe. Maybe it's better. I went to a ducks game in the late nineties they were still early, right? There was still the mighty ducks. They still had Donald duck with the broken bill in the front. Isn't that what they had for their logo? I don't know. So anyways, what if, what if, what if p k leads the Nashville predators to a Stanley Cup championship this year? I'm just throwing that out there for everybody up there on St Catherine Street. You know with the acute little pocket squares that matches the color of your socks. You know, what the fuck are you going to do then Nashville, that Banjo play in fucking washboard down by the fucking river. You haven't been to Nashville. I mean half the structures there still have dirt floors. It's unfuckable. It's ridiculous. You know like when they went this day, when they went to Nashville this year and they were like, you know who you voting for for for president, they allowed like I'll tell you one thing, I ain't bought Bill Lincoln.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       Are you all just afraid slaves? That's how backward Nashville is. You know? I know there's all this shit out there saying it's this growing city, you know, and they're trying to get people to move there. The reason why they're trying to do that is because so many of the structures still have dirt floors. Okay. Now if he can go down there, all right. And, and, and fucking lead them to the Stanley Cup, the big boys Stanley Cup, not that little shot glass that you and Martin the you and fucking Toronto one like fucking 15 times each. You know, I'll give the Canadian say last 10 cups, but I, I look at him like, Dang, I can't even say they're equal Detroit because Detroit was back then when it was a shock list, you know, sort of a fancy shot glass. Um, anyways, um, I'm just fucking with you. I, I've no idea how the fucking predators are in the finals, the western conference finals with the ducks and then the Ottawa senators. What the fuck is going on with when, when is, when is the, the glass slip are going to turn back into a fucking Punkin.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       I'm telling you, if Ottawa goes any deeper into the playoffs, they're actually going to sell out a home game. Ms Unbelievable. Did you see the first game of the Rangers Beer? 2000 of the Rangers series. They had 2000 empty seats. That's because they stopped playing the Bruins. You know what I mean? And the Bruins were just close enough to Ottawa that that shuttle flight wasn't, it wasn't too expensive, you know, then they played the rangers and God knows Rangers, fans, all those fucking Manhattan cops. They got the money to fly up to Ottawa. But then New Yorkers don't. What, why would I? They got boy's head. They got a slice of cheese. Why would I travel? Look over there and see empire state building.

Speaker 5:          00:37:31       Ooh,

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       that's what New Yorkers are. They, they're, they're fucking, they're like country people. You don't have to be low Lee fucking Skaggs in the fucking five boroughs. Um, I am in an extra country mood and I am just trashing people that I have no right to trash. Okay? My team is not in the playoffs. Okay? My team has not won as many championships as the fucking Canadians. My city doesn't have as many skyscrapers as New York City. A don't fuck with my shitty. You just fucked with the wrong Shetty. I have problem with Bailey baggies. If you touch my family, oh fucking kill you. Those lines will never get old in Hollywood. You don't get another fucking hacky thing. I'm so sick of every other fucking show doing the speed dating fucking scene. How many times can you do that and one fucking lunatic after and maybe it's not that bad. Jesus fucking Christ people showing up with like half an ax and that side of their head. People live with their mother. The person who's actually gay pretending to be straight the fucking side. I mean, Eddie Murphy did this shit fucking and then coming to America in 1989

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       Jesus Christ. Why don't you just have somebody come in and slip on a banana peel and then get a pie in their face and then do the dating thing. Hey Bill, you're so talented. Why don't you come up with something new? Because I'm limited

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:39:01       all right. I never said I fucking, I would reinvent something. Um, all right. Unfortunately I have to take a little bit of break and I'm going on a nice little roll here. I'm on a nice little roll here, but I have a, yeah, I got something I've got to take care of, which is why I'm doing this. At nine o'clock on a Sunday, you know, but why do I need to tell you guys? Cause this is only gonna be a fucking second of your life. Um, alright, hang on. Hang on a moment.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       Okay, I'm back. I'm back and I am is illiterate as ever. Right? You want to listen to somebody just fucking tearing me a new one here. So I was talking about a fucking United Airlines and Delta and them just yanking people off of flights and like what happened to customer service and all of this types. You know, I felt guilty flying United the way they just dragged that Chinese dude off the plane though. The two going to China, just assuming he was Chinese, Asian. You can give me that right? Who knows, who knows? They wait, I'm so fucking hard. I don't know. You know, fucking fucking. Anyways, airline bumping, he said, he says, Hey, you uninformed cunt and I'll tell you and nothing makes the reader want to read more when you just start off with the insults. He said Congress and the passenger's bill of rights have led to more passengers getting bumped due to more cancellations.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       And do you think he gives any examples? No, he just moves on to his next point. Also, if people showed up for the flights, they booked, the airlines wouldn't be overbooked. Many passengers book multiple flights. How about if you buy, so you're just assuming that the guys that they're yanking off the flights, that those people, I don't do that. I buy one fucking ticket and I show up. That's how I do it. So you're telling me that that Chinese do to that other fucking person on Delta. You're telling me that, that, that those are those people. So they said, Hey, you book like 20 flights. You only showed up for one, Eh, get out of that. Fuck. I said, yeah, you're telling me that's what happened or are you telling me that because other people do that because the guilty people did it that United and Delta's now just going to grab some random innocent person and throw them off the fucking flight. I heard the reason why they did it was because they had another plane that they had to get a flight crew to and they just fucking yanked the guy off. That has nothing to do with that other shit as far as I know. But I hate what am I am just uninformed. Cont evidently you who just like me just make statements with no fucking evidence behind it. Alright, plowing ahead. He goes, how about if I buy a ticket for a flight and miss it for whatever reason, you lose it. Question Mark.

Speaker 1:          00:41:51       Is that how you run your shows? Was that a point? How about if I buy a ticket for a flight and miss it for whatever reason, comma, you lose it. Oh, how about if I don't have a problem with that? I don't have a fucking problem with that at all. I'm on the same page. I hate when I show up on time for the security line and somebody else shows up super late and then they get rewarded and get breezed through the fucking line. Like they're in that t like they're part of the TSA party. They're the precheck people.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       dude, you bringing up all this other shit that has nothing to do with a fucking, just somebody who bought a ticket and sits on the plane. I drive a car. Other people steal cars. Should I be yanked out of my fucking car cause other people are stealing cars. This makes no sense. I might be an uninformed cunt, but you are a pompous, arrogant, uninformed continent. I could say that cause I'm in show business and you know we're all down to earth. All right, let me read some more of your air quote points. All right? Is that how you, is that how you run your shows? No, I don't run my shows like that. You know, this is my fucking, this is how I've run my fucking show. I don't have anybody kicked out ever. He can be the biggest cunt ever. I kicked the first fucking person out in 10 years because he was so fucking drunk.

Speaker 1:          00:43:15       I'm a hell of a guy. I don't give a fuck. I'm a great guy when it comes to that shit. How dare you lump me in with United Airlines and Delta, you, you, you, you hateful so and so. All right, let me, let me at least finish this point here. Is that how you run your shows or if someone buys a ticket to your show and misses it due to traffic leaving the house late, et Cetera, do you honor their ticket to the next show? I will tell you this. I've had plenty of people fucking reach out to me and I have hooked plenty of people up with tickets. Okay, how about that? Has everyone reached out to me? Has AV, I've seen every fucking email. No, but I hook people up. I've run into fucking people walking down the street, driving by in a Kygo and I'll fuck, I didn't know. You're like, Duh, hey, can I go to the show? And I'm like, it's all soda. I go, fuck it. What's your name? I've done that countless times today. He goes, sir, I don't know what you're talking about. So the equivalent to that is I fucking pull up and stand outside the gates of the airport. Go, hey, you guys fly to Minneapolis? Uh, yes sir. We are. Could I, can I buy a chicken? Sorry, though. It's all sold out. Oh, bombing. I don't worry about it. Don't worry. We'll get you on the plane and then they fucking Yank someone. They yanked somebody off.

Speaker 3:          00:44:36       I don't know

Speaker 1:          00:44:37       why they pick the Asian guy. Huh? Why couldn't they pick some fucking white dude in a suit? You know why? You know why? All right. Uh, leaving the house late, do they? Okay. Well that is what the airlines do. If you miss a flight, they put you on another one. So fuck off you nonreading pigment and paired con. That's not what they do. That's what they do sometimes. Other Times they yank you off the plane. Other Times they tell you to go fuck yourself. Other times they say, hey, you have 200,000 miles. You can't use them when you want to use them and if you don't use them by next Wednesday, we're taking them all back. Other times they say, hey, which is charging extra because it's post nine 11 we lost all this money, which is charging for food, but eventually we'll fucking stop overcharge and we'll stop charging for this shit for all the money that we lost in nine 11 which you know, we're now going to pass onto our fucking customers. So they take the hit when was fucking nine 11 I know I'm an unknown or uninformed con as far as my calculation. We're coming up on the 16th anniversary this September. You still paying for Pringles, aren't Ya

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       sir? I'm all for defending the fucking man when it's, when it's for, I mean I don't know what you just fucking, you just brought up a bunch of, but I guess behavior by for the frequent flyer people. So then evidently I should get yanked off the plane at some point because other people overbook and shit. You know what you're, you're the kind of person that probably likes that dead where they call it the trap ride or the trick car, whatever that fucking show is. You probably like that show. You probably think that that's a good fucking show, right? That shit, I can't even believe that fucking show was on television for the, it's on true TV. We should change the name, the fucking horrific TV they fucking take. They drive down to like the fucking projects and they take, I believe a car with the door open keys in it running and then they wait for someone to fucking steal it and then they act like they got a bad guy off the fucking street and I was reading comments underneath the, you know, I love that they're going to go out of their fucking way to go down there and try to get someone to go to jail.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       Why don't you go down there and try to help somebody out? I saw one guy, he actually stole the fucking car. He knew it was the trap car or whatever. He's driving with the door open because he knows that they just locked, they fucking hit the locks. He can't get out. And he's saying he knows it's the trap car he's waving to the camera and all that. They asked him if he knows a trap car, why did you do it? He said, I don't know, maybe I just want to get on TV. And then he left and everybody's like, tech guy's crazy. I want to party with that guy. That guy's a dope or anything. It was, it was, to me it was fucking depressing like that. That's the level of options this guy has in his fucking life that he would do something like that and somebody else brought up a great point. Okay. Like why don't they take that car around the fucking suburbs to the whites, the sax. Why don't they do that? And he was still cut the fuck they don't. They absolutely do. And I'll tell you, there's a point in my fucking life I would've done that. I absolutely would've done that just for this stupid fucking, just to have the story so I could talk about it loudly around chicks that I liked because I didn't know any other way to approach them.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       If they ever did that in a fucking suburb, in a bunch of white kids, started going to jail over that shit. That shit would not, there'll be entrapment. It wouldn't be held up in court and the fucking show would be shut down. All I'm saying. Okay. You, sorry. You probably liked that type of shit. You probably liked that show. Do you think that's a good show and hey, let's, let's, uh, you know, rather than giving this guy an opportunity, you know, they could just as easily couldn't true TV, have a fucking show where they go down there and they try to give somebody a fucking job, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       I Dunno. Anyways, plowing ahead, making your own baby food a Billy burp. Um, had my first kid a couple of years ago, congratulations. A friend suggested we make our own baby food because it's easier to get them to transition to real and healthy foods. We tried it and it was fun.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       For instance, that we make our own baby food because it's easier to get them to transition. Okay. All right. We could, hi, there's another fucking guy. No lab coat. No degree. We couldn't do it 100% of the time, but it was totally worth it. My kid isn't that picky of an eater and I liked that. Thank, I think that days of pulverizing fruits, vegetables and oats into tasting meals. Oh, it's because of that. I'm sure you can afford that. Good stuff for the little lady, but just thought I'd throw it out there. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself yet. I don't know too. I don't know what to tell you. I'll cross that fucking road running. Everybody's always like, you know, you've got all these goddamn suggestions. There was somebody fucking, you know everybody talking about like private schools versus public schools. It's like these fucking kids, they don't even get to be kids anymore. They should be out fucking, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       this whole fucking thing that you know from day one, like he gets gotta be like, you've seen what it does. Look in these countries that fucking push their kids too hard. They, they have like ulcerated fucking bottles. Like they've been working on fucking Wall Street for 60 goddamn years and then like seven. The level of stress that they put on them. Fuck that. My Kid's going to be a God damn kid. All right. I flunked everything fucking in in high school. I fucked up everything. I got arrested for drinking and driving. I was unloading trucks. I did all of this shit. And then one day I just figured out what the fuck do I, what do I want to do? You know, found a passion. And I followed it and I was fine. And I remember back in the day, they used to fuck, oh, you need two years of a language. If you don't have two years of a fucking language, you can't love all that. It's all fucking bull. You know, I used to say that the fucking language teacher, fuck everybody. Fuck everybody. Let your kid be a Goddamn kid and fuck all these fucking private schools within nine zillion dollar fucking, you know. Oh, you better get in when the kids are just playing with blocks. The early you you get in, the better chance you have for your kid to continue on. In other words, start fucking line in our pockets now.

Speaker 1:          00:50:51       You know, why don't you just have you, I don't know, want to be cheaper to just have your kid homeschooled. You're going to drop all that fucking cash, like he's already going to Yale and fucking going to school and they go on the wheels on the bus go round and round. Round air. That'll be enough. Yeah. The credit card didn't work. Yeah. I can't teach you the rest of the song. All right. Birthday Boat Party. A bill, a bald headed eagle. Jesus. Go and fucking old school on that one. Um, hey, a Chesler. Hey, a sidewinder. Recently my girlfriend dumped me over a text message. I swear to God if that, if that existed back in the day, I would, I would fucking be lightened phones up if that wasn't bad enough. I got the texts just as I was walking into a movie with a buddy. She told me straight that she didn't love me anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       I took a like a man, watch the movie, went home and cried like a bitch. I honest guy. Two days later I went to a party on a boat. I spotted my now ex. We made eye contact and she looked away. So now I'm trapped on a boat for four hours. You didn't know that she was going to be there with a bunch of drunk cons. I don't want to be around. And of course her, I made an attempt to ask her why the fuck she didn't have the balls to dump me face to face, but she ignored me totally. As she's young and immature, I then saw her walk over to a guy and start kissing him. Jesus Christ. I commend you, sir, for not throwing yourself in them also overboard and fucking double murder. Slash suicide bill. I have no fucking idea. I didn't punch this con, but I decided not to.

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       I now wish I had punched his stupid fucking face. And my question is, what should I, should I have done something? Fuck now, why are you punching him? He's doing what he's supposed to be doing. He supposed to be out there trying to fucking hook up with women. All right? Any bad feelings you have should be towards her. But here's the thing, dude. You know, in the long run she did your favor because she didn't love you. Okay. And eventually she could've done that while you had two kids with her and you actually had to pay her fucking money. She did you a favor. All right? Yeah. Don't ever do that. That's the dumbest shit ever. When people fucking date somebody and then they get dumped and then they're fucking dating somebody else. I mean, and then you go over and you confront the other fucking birthday that they're outside the circle, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       So, um, what should he have done? You should just been a fucking gentleman. That's what you should have done. You just be a fucking gentleman. Just be like, hey, you know, evidently, you know, she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I mean, dude, I know. Listen, I got dumped. I know fucking hard. This is, I'm on time. I actually fucking was talking to somebody's heart on the table. This woman dumped me out of fucking nowhere. And I'm in a bar, of course, and I'm talking to a buddy of mine. And, and the problem was he got dumped like four years earlier and he still wasn't over it and he fucking hated women. So this is why I'm pouring my heart out to, and I was like, you know, I mean I thought everything was going fine. What the fuck? And I did all that shit and he just goes, hey, you know, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Maybe she wanted to fuck somebody else. And I just said, you know what to I said, you know what? Fuck you. I actually flipped out. I was like, fuck you. You fuck. That has nothing to fucking do with this. That has to do with that fucking shit. That fucking cunt. You dated four fucking years ago. You still not over and I've been having a fucking carry you off the field like Kellen Winslow after that fucking overtime game for laugh on every fucking bar for the last four years. You can't sit there. He's like, dude, I'm sorry. Tag Off. Fuck off. Not just part of a bad memory. I'm actually, did I say that? That's probably what I said on the way home. I think I said that on the way home. I think I just said, fuck you. And I walked out of the bar. That's right. That's what happened. That's how old I am. I'm so old. My memory is the fantasy.

Speaker 3:          00:55:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       My memory is what I should've said. I did say fuck you. And I walked down Zocalo you know, just fucking walked up. Uh, one of the few times I didn't pay for my round of beers, I was just like, fuck you walked out. Um, anyways, he said, hope you're well, thanks and go fuck yourself dude. You took it like a man. What are you going to do? And um, you know, keep taking it like a man and keep going home and private and cry it out here. That's what women do. Fucking they cried out of them and then they can move on. Uh, the fact that she dumped you and then of course it does immediately make an hour with this guy is really suspect. But you never know with them. You never know. That could have just, she could've just picked that guy.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       because you were there. You have no fucking idea. And here's the thing, dude, even if she was already banging that fucking Douche, wow, I'll make an hour. That douche when she was with you, then that's the time. That's who you are with. So good fucking riddance. Alright. That's what you had you, you thought you drafted somebody in the first round that didn't fucking work out. And you know what? That guy just picked up her contract for you. You know, so now you got all this cap space. All right, go cry or out of your fucking heart. You know, but don't go around hating women. That's what I did. Big fucking mistake. All that does is it stop you from meeting a fucking sweetheart because you know who loves an angry woman hater. A fucking psycho chick. All right, there you go. All right. Russian girlfriend, a Billy blue balls.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       Hey Man, I was well, hey man, I was wondering if you could give me some advice. I'm a 27 year old from New Zealand and current resident and current. Oh Jesus. And current currently residing is what you should have said instead of current residing here. Current resident here. Currently designing here. Okay. I've met and recently started dating a girl from Russia. We've been officially dating for about five months now. Everything is going great. Never been happier. If she ever asked you to take a boat ride, don't get on the fucking boat. All right. And I'm not talking about because of the last thing. All right, this one, you show up as a couple other shifty guys there and then, uh, your identity gets stolen and we never see you again. All right. She's hot. Best in bed I've ever had and I've had a lot. Ha Ha got a great personality and someone I could see going further into the future with.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       Okay, well you're writing me so I know the other shoe's going to drop. The only issue is that our visa is about to run out in a few months. Oh, before she moves back. Unless we can, she can find a decent job here. The only issue with that is the job market over here for the type of work she is after is very small, a translator. We've been checking the job sites and whatnot over the past month with not much luck. So I've put up the idea of maybe heading over to Russia and try to start a life over there. Oh No, fuck no, but that's a great way to see if she's with you because she wants to be with you though. A, my qualification could take me anywhere in the world, but I'm still skeptical on, well, should I just uplift my whole life and move to a country that doesn't really speak much English? Apparently with my girlfriend that I've only known for a few months, plus not knowing much Russian. Yeah. Plus you don't know how that country fucking works.

Speaker 4:          00:58:38       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       You have no idea how that fucking country works, dude.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       You're talking like you're dealing with the fucking mob.

Speaker 4:          00:58:48       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       Hang on one second. All right. Sorry. I just realized I double book myself. I had to fucking figure something out. Yeah, dude, you have no idea. Like what's going on over there? Like if that's a whole different fucking animal over there, that's a whole different government. The level of influence that the mob has. I mean that shit is fucking hardcore over there. Russia is no joke. What the fuck did you say you account from? You've gone from New Zealand or Russia. You gave him the gardening. Fucked up, dude. Fuck that. Fuck debt

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       Get her a job interview. They'll see how beautiful she is in, you know, you know, do what you can fucking do,

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       dude. Fuck that. Fuck that

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       repeat. Fuck that. I mean, I remember when I had been reading the rest of this. Fuck that. Do not move from fucking New Zealand to Russia. Jesus fucking Christ. Do not do that. Please don't do that. Okay? I never beg in the podcast, but I'm begging you right now. Do not fucking do that. Jesus can go from the fucking garden of Eden to then. Now you're the immigrant. Now she's trying to get you a fucking job. You know what kind of money you're gonna make over there.

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       I got no fucking, I def. Fuck that. All right. Soccer coach rips off shirt after rejection. Hey Billy. Dad. Sec.

Speaker 4:          01:00:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       Oh, that was as original as Billy Bald Eagle was a not all right. Saw this video and thought it might interest you during a recent soccer game. And Argentinian player accidentally knocks a player out from the other team and ends up getting a [inaudible] from the game. As a result, after he gets ejected, the coach freaks out. Yeah, watch the clip, starts yelling at the refs, then he gets ejected. So when he realizes that he's also objected, he rips his shirt off only to reveal, and he's an older guy too, you know? I don't know. I can't tell all the guys. Somewhere between 40 and 50 rips his shirt off only to reveal that not only is this dude fucking shredded, but also his whole back is covered in tattoos, making him look like he spends his free time going to bare knuckle brawling down by the shipyard.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       Thanks for all the laughs and go fuck yourself. Yeah, I watched the clip of this. This guy looks like a, this guy looks like he's done some time in prison. What's amazing is the rest of his body that you can see, he has no tattoos. And then on the back it's just like, I don't know what the fuck he's got going on, but his entire back is covered. And it's all of those, you know, uh, you know, if you touch my family, I will fucking kill you. It's those kinds of tattoos. It's not the A, I was in a frat and I got drunk one night and uh, all right, this is my old girlfriend's name and we fucking turned into a swan or whatever the fuck they do. This is like hardcore, you know, this guy's going to punch you in the throat.

Speaker 4:          01:01:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:57       It's a great clip. I really appreciate it. All right, let me make sure I did everything here. A Russian girlfriend do not stay in New Zealand birthday boat party. Yep. A, you got a lot of cap space. Good for you making your own baby food. Yes. You know, I'll, I'll see about that airline bumping a agree to disagree, but I like the fact that you went out there and stuck up for the airlines. [inaudible] I think that's it. He's right. All the things, right. Oh, I didn't talk about the f one race motherfucker. Did you guys watch it? They have. I got, I know, I know. After Nias just absolutely eviscerated watching racing. I hope if you were going to watch a race, the Spanish Grand Prix was a great one. Lewis Hamilton had the pole. Sebastian Vettel uh, I think was, yeah, it was in the second position. And then, uh, Boris Karloff Leboeuf I can't keep forgetting his name.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       Fucking Lewis Hamilton's um, uh, driving mate there. His fucking car caught on fire. But the first guy, the other guy who drives for Ferrari, whatever, fucking his, whatever his name is, Ricky Ricardo. I can't remember. Um, no. Daniel Ricardo drives for force India. No, he doesn't. He drives for red bull. Why don't I just fucking go on and look up the Goddamn names? Cause most of you guys don't watch this shit seat on it. You don't know what you guys know as much as I fucking know. So here's what happened. All right. The race starts and uh, what's his face? Lewis Hamilton has always gets a bad fucking start. Sebastian Vettel goes around them. That'll drives the Ferrari's. Lewis Hamilton's with Mercedes. Uh, Vettel is out in front on how many fucking points he was ahead. He was like 15 points ahead of some shit. And uh, in the old days last year when I wive on watching for a year, the old days, which is Monaco of last year, when I started watching, if you, if you went to the turn first, whoever won got, got through the first turn first in first place, drove in the clean air.

Speaker 1:          01:03:54       That was it. You won the fucking race unless you messed up a pit stop or you, your car shit the bed. So he gets out in front. Um, and then his is his buddy there. The other Ferrari guy gets knocked out of the race. Okay. And they fucking, they cut to a, this kid in the stands were in this Ferrari thing. Where are the drivers? Why is it so difficult? Drivers, here we go. Here we go. I should add this all ready to go. I'm sorry. I'm like slowing this the fuck down. The Reagan in guy gets knocked right out of the race. And this little fucking kid, they cut to him, he's wearing all Ferrari gear and he's just crying his eyes out and in they're sitting there going, well, like federal still in first place while he must've been a big uh, Reagan and fan over the fuck he say his name and they showed him twice bawling his eyes out.

Speaker 1:          01:04:47       I couldn't believe a kid this little was that into racing. I thought it was really cool. And uh, later on, um, the driver got knocked out of the race Ferrari. They actually, they brought the kid in and he took a picture with them and everything. So I ended up being a good deal, although he probably cried again when Lewis Hamilton went around and, but um, anyways, it was a great race from front to back. These new fucking tires, I guess. I have no idea why they got more grip that's more passing. Um, Lewis Hamilton past, um, Sebastian Vettel I think on like lap light. It's like 20 laps to go, which never happened last year. The second place guy just could never get around the first place guy once he was out there. Um, I dunno, it was a great race. And then Lewis Hamilton for some reason was like fucking out of breath when he was talking cause he was saying because they got the fatter tires they could pull more gs in like just the physically what the fuck they were going through.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       And Lewis Hamilton didn't have any drinks on board. I didn't know they had drinks on board. I then never even dawned on me, but he didn't want to add any more weight to his car, so he lost like four and a half pounds. So they go, you know that actually, you know this people out here in Hollywood that have enough money now that the day before they have to go to like a red carpet event. They're gonna fucking, you know, drive around in a fucking race car for three hours so they can drop that final fucking four and a half pounds. I'm telling you, it's going to happen. So I believe the next, next race is in Monaco. Um, I don't know. I'm enjoying watching it and he has got me all self conscious about talking about it. Now I'm going to blame her then I wasn't prepared to talk about it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       Um, was there anything else on my, my little list here. So as you nerds always wanted to rift the whole thing? Pretty much. Pretty much. But I make like a setlist a shit. Didn't want to talk to, if I can fucking find it. Where the hell is it? I give up. I fucking give up with this shit. What did I have on here? I don't know what that is. We'll close this window. This is the most anticlimactic ending to a podcast ever. All right. I said predators. Louis Han Hamilton, Sebastian Vale, Daniel Ricardo, first time he was on a a podium this year. Oh, he had to give a shout out to a force. India still rocking the Fuchsia, whatever color that is. Um, I think that was it. Oh, happy mother's Day. Belated Mother's Day to all the mothers out there at a great time. We went to brunch. Yep. That's where I am right now.

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       I went to brunch. My parents came out, met their granddaughter there over the, over the moon, loving her. She was so cute and was just, didn't cry at all the whole meal. And then she got in the car and then that was it. She had friggin had it and was just crying up a storm. And uh, but it was, we ended up having a great day and I came home and I was like, it was crazy. You know, I've just finally entered this part of my life, you know, my parents are older. I got a little one, I'm at Brunch and I have no say in the matter. And you know what? It feels good. I had a great time, you know, we had all kinds of family, had a big crew, seven or eight people and we went to this fucking insane brunch and everybody threw down and uh, had like 3000 calories each.

Speaker 1:          01:08:05       Great conversation, great people. It's just, it was awesome. All kinds of pictures and that type of shit. And, uh, other than the fact I forgot my fucking wallet because I decided to wear a suit and I was going to be the big shot picking up the fucking check and I had to go to my parents. So now, now, you know, when a few days when I'd take him to the airport, I've got to give him the fucking money back. But Oh god, it was embarrassing. Really embarrassing. Um, so anyways, that was my mother's Day. Uh, go fuck yourselves. I will check in on you on Thursday and let's go predators. And um, I don't know. I mean, I got a bunch of friends. I, you know, in Pittsburgh. I'm just rooting for extra hockey at this point. I hope both series go seven games. I don't want to be this little fucking Cunty Gargoyle shitting on the ducks.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       I don't want to fucking do that. You know, why? Why do I gotta bring it to predators? Success and then shit on Canadians fans, you know, all their pocket squares are all soaking wet from them blowing the noses and crying about losing to the ranges. I don't need to do that. Not to mention I have no bragging rights. My team that fucking bounced out, you know, I'm going to try to be a, I'm gonna try to go cutlass for the rest of the Stanley Cup playoffs. How about that? Uh, Celtics first, the Wiz, ease on down. Ease on down the road tomorrow. Um, my brain says it could go either way, but my heart says this no fucking way. There's no way they come in to the garden even though it's not the garden. It's the fleets at the garden. Fucking slash whatever fucking Gossett jr whatever other fucking tags they have for that thing.

Speaker 1:          01:09:43       And uh, I just don't see them doing, I feel like, you know what it is to Celtics. They got that sound in their crowd the same way the Yank old Yankee stadium had it, you know, knowledgeable fans put a history of success and they that can push your team to fucking win. And I think they're going to do it. Oh, by the way, Derek Jeter. Huh? I missed it. I was at Brunch. I missed it. But that's a what? A fucking class act, man. He's such a class act. He can go into New York and wing his speech and still kill it.

Speaker 4:          01:10:14       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       that statement, they're artists, single numbers. See if I can do it. Billy Martin, number one. Number two, Derek Jeter, number three, Babe Ruth. Number four. I was fucked this up. That scared five is Dimaggio and six. I looked up today cause that's the one I always forgot, but they said it was Joe Tory, but I thought somebody else had six.

Speaker 4:          01:10:38       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       sevens. Mickey Mantle. Number eight is fucking Yogi Baron. Somebody else. Nine is Roger Maris. 10 is Chris Chambliss. 11 is Gary Sheffield. I don't know the rest of them. Thurman Munson's 15, a little store. I remember Reggie Jackson, they added retires. That was 44. A Bode Diaz with somebody. What do you were 30? I don't fucking know. All right, that's it. That's the podcast. I will, uh, I will check in on your Thursday. And uh, God bless all the mothers out there.

Speaker 4:          01:11:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       Work with the family. Becky's all alright, I'm done.
