Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Two one. Boom. All right. We're live. Thank you very much for doing this, man. I really appreciate it. I've been absorbing your information and listening to you talk for quite a while now. So it's a, it's great to actually meet you. Thanks for having me. My pleasure. My pleasure. You are one of the rare guys that is a, you're a big investor. You are, um, you're deep in the tech world, but yet you seem to have a very balanced perspective in terms of how to live life as opposed to not just be entirely focused on success and financial success and tech investing, but rather how to live your life in a happy way. That's, uh, it's, uh, that's not balance.

Speaker 2:          00:00:45       Yeah. You know, I think the reason why people like, uh, hearing me is because like, if it's like if you go to a circus and you see a bear, right? That's kind of interesting, but not that much. If you see a Unicycle, that's interesting, but you see a bear on a Unicycle, that's really interesting. So when you combine things, you're not supposed to combine. I get interested. It's like Bruce Lee, right? And striking thoughts, philosophy plus martial arts. And I think it's because at some level, all humans are broad. We're all multivariate. But we get summarized in pithy ways in our lives and at some deep level, we know that's not true, right? Every human basically is capable of every experience and every thought, uh, you know, your UFC, comedian, commentator, podcasts here, but you're also more than that. You're also father a lover, you know, a thinker, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       So I like the model of life that the ancients had, the Greeks, the Romans, right, where you would start out and when you're young, you're just like going to school, then you're going to war, then you're running a business, then you're supposed to serve in the Senate or the government, then you become a philosopher. This sort of, this arc to life where you try your hand at everything. And uh, as one of my friends is a specialization is for insects, right? So everyone should just be able to do everything. And so I don't believe in this model anymore of trying to focus your life down on one thing. You've got one life, just do everything you're going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And I think that sometimes people find certain success in whatever the endeavor is and then they think that that is their niche and they stick with it and they never change. And they almost out of fear.

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       Well it's, it's hard because there's a, you know, there's analogy around mountain climbing. Like if you find a mountain and you start climbing and you spend your whole life climbing it and you get say two thirds of the way and then you see the peak is like way up there, but you're two thirds of the way. Yeah. But is still really high up. But not to go the rest of the way. You're going to have to go back down to the bottom and look for another path. Nobody wants to do that. People don't want to start over. And it's the nature of later in life that you just don't have the time. So it's very painful to go back down and look for a new path. But that may be the best thing to do. And that's why when you look at the greatest artists and creators, they have this ability to start over that nobody else does. Like Elon will, you know, be called an idiot and start over doing something brand new that he supposedly is not qualified for or when Madonna or Paul Simon are you to come out with a new album. Their existing fans usually hate it because they've adopted a completely new style that they've learned somewhere else and a lot of times they'll just miss completely. So you have to be willing to be a fool and kind of have that beginner's mind and go back to the beginning to start over. If you're not doing that, you're just getting older.

Speaker 3:          00:03:29       Yeah, I mean I don't even know if it's willing to be a fool. It's just to me that the most exciting thing is to try and get better at something and to learn things. I mean it's, it's really exciting when you just have incremental progress in something that you're completely new to.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       Yeah. I live for the Aha moment, that moment when you connect two things together that you hadn't connected together before and it fits nicely in solidly and it kind of helps form a steel framework of understanding in your mind that you can then hang other ideas off of. That's what I live for. That curiosity fulfilled and it's what little children do to, you know, my, my little son is always asking why, why, why, why, why, and I always try and answer him and half the Times I realized, actually I don't really understand why. I just have a memorized answer for you, but that's not really understanding.

Speaker 3:          00:04:15       Yeah. Those are weird conversations, right? When you're, you're talking to your kids and you say, look, uh, the reality is I don't know a lot of things. Yes. I've just memorize a lot of, yeah. And there's certain things that you just can't know. Yeah. You realized that you know, you have, you have answers for a few things that you've thought through. Then you sort of have coverups like, like trap doors. Like don't go here. This is just a cover up. I don't really know the answer to what the meaning of life is or how we got here. And then you've got a whole bunch of memorize stuff because a lot of your, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       a lot of intelligence these days, just the external brain pack of civilization. I know it's out there and are, the answers are out there and I'll have to look them up and I've memorized some of them and I kind of understand how money works in the Federal Reserve prints it and what this government thing is, but not really.

Speaker 3:          00:04:59       Right. Um, so not good enough to teach it in university. Yeah. Uh, I think people do that with almost everything in life these days. In terms of like have a, like a, a one page of one sheet, like a brief summary of what the explanation for what this very complex subject might be. Tldr, right? Yes. Give me the don't give you the lecture. Gave me the book. Don't give me the book. Give me the blog posts. Don't give me the blog posts. Give me the tweet. Don't give me the tweet. I just, I already know. Yeah. I got really fascinated by the way you read because I thought there was something wrong with me by doing that. But you, you don't really just read a book to completion. You read and then you pick something else up and you just kind of go based on your whims, whatever you're interested in.

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       Raised by my mom, I was raised by a single mom in New York and she used the local library as a daycare center because it was a very tough neighborhood. And so she would basically say, when you get back from school, go straight to the library and don't come out until I pick you up late at night. So I used to basically live in the library and I read everything. I read every magazine I read every pictograph or what every book or every map. I just ran out of stuff to read. I just read everything. So I got over this idea of that reading a large number of books or reading a book to completion as a vanity metric because it really, when people are putting a photos on Twitter, Instagram of looking at my pile of books that I'm reading, it's a show off thing. It's a signaling thing.

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       Yeah sure. And the reality is I would rather read the best hundred books over and over again until I absorbed them rather than read all the books. Yeah. Cause your, your brain has find that information, uh, and find its space. Uh, you get enough advice. It all cancels to zero. Um, there's a lot of nonsense and books out there too. So I don't read any more to complete books. I read to satisfy my genuine intellectual curiosity. And it can be anything. It could be nonsense. It could be history, it could be fiction, it could be science, it could be Psi Phi these days. It's mostly Scifi philosophy, science cause that's just what I'm interested in. But I will read for understanding. So a really good book I will flip through. I won't actually read it consecutive in order and I won't even just even finish it. I'm looking for ideas, things that I don't understand and when I find something really interesting, I'll reflect on it, I'll research it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       Uh, and then when I'm bored of it I'll drop it or I'll flip to another book. Thanks to electronic books. I've got 50, 70 books open at any time and my kindle or I books and I'm just bouncing around between them. Uh, it's also a little bit of a defense mechanism to how in modern society we get too much information too quickly and sort attention spans are very low. So you get Twitter, you get Instagram, you get Facebook, you just used to being bombarded with information so you can take that to you. You can view that as a negative and be like, I have no attention span. Or You could view that as a positive. I multitask really well and I can dig really fast. I can, if I find a thread that's interesting, I can follow through five social networks through the web, through the libraries, through the books, and I can really get to the bottom of this thing very quickly. It's like the library of Alexandria that I can research at my disposal. So I no longer track books, read or even care about books. Read. It's about understanding concepts.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       Yeah. You brought up two awesome points. First of all, the social media aspect of, of books and basically anything, it's like, it's such a weird way to display your life cause it's, you know, you're displaying the best aspects of your life and some sort of a glass case, you know, just, it's an unrealistic version of your life that you cultivate and you curate

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       and I'm, I'm as guilty of that as anybody. Everybody's guilty of it. I'm guilty of it too.

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       Yeah. You know what I mean? I pose with my dog every time I run.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       Yeah. We're always signally rather than really looking at yourself, you're looking at how other people look at you like this one, remove mental image, and it's kind of a disease because social media is making celebrities of all of us and celebrities and the most miserable people in the world, right? Because they're this strong self image that gets built up. It gets built up by compliments. Every time somebody pays you or me, a compliment and we're like, oh, well thank you. Right? Then that builds up an image of who we are and then one idiot comes along, one out of 10, one out of a hundred, and they can easily tear it down because it doesn't take many insults to cancel out a lot of compliments. And now you're carrying around this big weighty self image and it's just very easy to be attacked and because you're, you're famous or you're well known, people want to attack you. So, uh, being a celebrity is no good. It's actually a problem. Like one of my tweets is, and these are all reminders to myself, is you want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous, right? There's benefits to it of course, of course. But we wouldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       Unusual problems that you don't get trained for and you really will not understand unless you experience it. You know, it goes having this conversation with my wife, we were talking about um, people that just come up to you and they don't care what you're doing. They don't care if I'm with my daughter, if I'm holding her, if I'm feeding her for, you know, we're in the middle of an intense conversation, she's crying, she could be crying and some bro, we'll come over and just immediately have to take a picture, doesn't care his needs, supersede the daughter. And my wife was saying that before she knew me, she used to think that that's just part of the price of being famous. That people, people like you, that's just part of the price, be famous. And now when it interrupts her life and you know, interrupts the children and interrupts friends and you know, she now she's like, this is annoying. Like this is not, this is not healthy. This is not a smart way to, to interact with people and that people have this weird challenged, this weird thing that if you're, if he become famous, there's this weird challenge where people just want to come to you, especially today, because if they can get a photo of you, then that boost their social media profile. Like, Hey, I'm sitting here with evolve. Look at this.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       Anonymity is a privilege. Uh, on the other hand is self inflicted. I mean, we brought it on ourselves. We don't think we knew what it was though we did, but we carry on. So it tells us we are getting something out of it. So there are times when some of the approached me in public and I'm a little resentful and then other times they're just like, actually, I'm really grateful that you know, I've worked for this, I got this right. This is the payoff. Just embrace it. Smile, Grin and bear. It meets someone of a different, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       sort of celebrity too, right? You're a, you're a hero amongst investors and amongst

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       tomorrow among young male Geeks, which is just some of my favorite people. Right. But that's not the kind of celebrity I think most people set out to get, especially the most guys. Right, right, right. You want the cute females? Yeah. I look at my brief little youtube clips. I'd have a tiny little podcasts going now and it's like 95% male. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. This

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       is very highly 18 to 35, right? Yeah. We, what are we, what is the numbers and said, yeah, it's in the nineties. Yeah. Um, you, you did that one. You do that one very small podcasts where you just have small, like three or four minute clip.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       Yeah. So what it was, I did a tweet storm, uh, called how to get rich without getting lucky and it got pretty popular in Twitter. Uh, and uh, it's really about wealth creation. I just used the click baity title and it's trying to basically lay out timeless principles of wealth creation that if you absorb them, you become the kind of person who can create wealth, create business, make money. Uh, and my theory behind that is like, there are three things everybody wants. There's actually more than three. But let's see, let's just start with three. The three basics. Everybody wants to be wealthy, everybody wants to be happy and everybody wants to be fit. And I know there's a lot of which she was signaling that goes on, like we don't want to money. And you know, I don't care about being happy and happiness is for stupid people, but let's face it, like you want to be rich and happy and healthy.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       That's the TRIFECTA. Now of course you also want to internally calm state of mind. You want a loving household. So there are other things that come into it, but those three I think they can actually be taught right? And a fitness. I'm not going to teach. There are a lot of people who you've had on here, including yourself, who know a heck of a lot more about fitness and health than I do. Um, but I was born poor and miserable and uh, I'm now pretty well, often very happy. Uh, and I don't, and I worked at those. And so I've learned a few things. There's some principles. And so I try to lay them out, but in a timeless manner where you can kind of figure it out yourself. Because at the end of the day, I can't really teach anything. I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you can remember things when they happen or put it, put a name to them.

Speaker 2:          00:13:29       So this podcast actually ended up explaining this tweet storm. So there's a tweet storm was like 36, 38 tweets, got very famous, got translated dozens of languages. Um, and these were principles that I came up with for myself when I was really young, around 13, 14. Uh, and I've been carrying them in my head for 30 years and I'd been sort of living them. And over time I just realized like sadly or fortunately, the thing that I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that and do it in a very longterm kind of way. Not, not the, you know, banker crashed, the economy get bailed out kind of way. But you know, build businesses and help people and provide value kind of way, especially when applied to modern technology and leverage in this age of infinite leverage that we live in a, so the podcast is just explaining each tweet.

Speaker 2:          00:14:23       So these are little three, four, five minutes snippets. I don't like to say the same thing twice. Uh, I don't like to explain in detail. Uh, I just, I feel like if you have something original and interesting to say should say it, otherwise it's probably been said better. So that podcast tries to be information dense. It tries to be very concise, it tries to be high impact and tries to be timeless. Uh, and it has all the information. I think you need the principles that if you absorb these and you work hard over 10 years, you get what you want. Um, so I've got the one on wealth creation. I'm going to attempt to do one on happiness is a big word, but you know, happiness and inner peace and calm and all that. Because what you want is you don't want to be the guy who succeeds in life while being high strung, high stress and unhappy and leaving a trail of emotional wreckage, whether you and your loved ones,

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       which is more common than not.

Speaker 2:          00:15:15       Yeah. Because you got to focus and it's very hard to be great at everything. You want to be the guy or the Gal who gets there calmly, you know, quietly without struggle. Uh, you want to be the person who the e when there's a crisis going on, you want to be the calmest, coolest cucumber in the room who still also figures out the correct answer.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Hmm. If you can be, you were in, one of the things that you were saying is that you feel like happiness is something that you can learn and then you can teach yourself to be happy, even just by adopting the mindset that you are happy person and proclaiming that to your friends. And so you've sort of developed a social contract. I'm a happy person and the law, I have to live up to that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       Yeah. I've got hundreds of techniques, but develop that one. Oh, well, there's this, uh, there's social consistency, right? Humans have a need to be highly consistent with their past pronouncements. So the way I started my first tech company was I was in a, in working inside of a larger organization and I told everybody that I was going to go start a company. I was like, I hate this place. I'm going to do my own thing. I'm going to be a successful entrepreneur. Six months past, nine months pass. Then people start saying, you're still here. I thought you were going to go start a company or when you're lying, right? That was the implication. So we kind of know this, right? Social contracts are very powerful. Like if you want to give up drinking, right? And you're not serious about it, you'll say, I'm going to cut back.

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       I'm going to have only one drink a night. I'm going to only drink on weekends. You tell yourself, but if you're serious, you'll announce it on Facebook. You'll tell all your friends, you'll tell your wife, you'll say, I'm done drinking. I'm throwing everything out of the house. You'll never see me drinking again. When you say that you know you're serious. So I think a lot of these are choices that we make and happiness is just one of those choices. Uh, and this is unpopular to say, cause there are people who are actually depressed, you know, chemically or what have you. And there are people who don't believe that it's possible because then it creates a responsibility on them. It says, oh, now if I'm, you're saying if I'm not happy, that's my fault. Not saying that, but I'm saying that just like fitness can be a choice. Health can be a choice. And nutrition can be a choice. Working hard and making money can be a choice. Happiness is also a choice. If you're so smart, how come you aren't happy? How come you haven't figured that out? That's my challenge to all the people who think they're so smart and so capable. If you're so smart and capable, why can't you change this?

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       Hmm. There are a bunch of people though that actually take pleasure in being miserable there. There's something about the pursuit of excellence and have success that supersedes

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       all other pursuits that in in their eyes, it is. It is that the peak, the pinnacle, the most important thing. It's not a trade off. I would argue that now when I say happy, happy is one of those words that means of zillion different things, right? It's like love, right? What does that mean? Right? I love cheese. Yeah. Before that, a little bit more tightly, right? So let's go back to desire, right? This is old, old Buddhist wisdom. I'm not saying anything original, but desire to me as a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. Okay? And I keep that in front of mine. So when I'm unhappy about something, I look for what is the underlying desire that I have that's not being fulfilled. It's okay to have desires. You're a biological creature. Can you put on this earth?

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       You have to do something. You have to have desires. You have a mission, but don't have too many. Don't pick them up unconsciously. Don't pick them up randomly. Don't have thousands of them. My coffee's too cold. It doesn't taste quite right. I'm not sitting perfectly, oh, I wish it would warm. Or uh, you know, oh my dog pooped in the lawn. I didn't like that. Whatever it is, pick your one overwhelming desire. It's okay to suffer over that one, but on all the others, you want to let them go so you can be calm and peaceful and relaxed and then you'll perform a better job. Most people, when you're unhappy like a depressed person, it's not that they have very clear calm mind. They're too busy in their mind. The sense of self is too strong. They're sitting indoors all the time, their minds working, working, working.

Speaker 2:          00:19:18       They're thinking too much. Well, if you want to be a high performance athlete, how good of an athlete are you going to be if you're always having epileptic seizures? If you're always like twitching and running around and like jumping in your, your, your limbs are flailing out of control the same way. If you want to be effective in business, you need a clear, calm, cool, collected mind. Warren Buffet Plays Bridge all day long and goes for walks on the side. He doesn't sit around like constantly loading his brain with nonstop information and, and, and getting worked up about every little thing. We live in an age of infinite leverage. What I mean by that is that your actions can be multiplied a thousand fold either at broadcasting, at a podcast or by investing capital or by having people work for you or by writing code. So because of that, the impacts of good decision making are much higher than they used to be because now you can influence thousands or millions of people through your decisions or your code.

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       So a clear mind leads to better judgment leads to better outcome. So a happy, calm, peaceful person will make better decisions and have better outcomes. So if you want to operate at peak performance, you have to learn how to tame your mind, just like you have to learn how to attain your body. I love what you're saying. Um, Warren Buffet might not be the best example because he drinks like, I think six coca is a day and eats mostly Mcdonald's and he's still alive somehow. So that shows you that low stress is more shit. Like how old is he? I mean, he's a fairly old man, Charlie, I think in his nineties.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Right? Yeah. It's made it really far. I wonder what Warren's doing, you know, I mean just he's got it. No, that's bad for him, but if it's terrible, doesn't care. He doesn't care. I think he's just a little stress. Stress is a big key. Right. So he's just enjoys that Coca Cola and that's probably, maybe there is a trade off, right? Like maybe him and join that junk food and that coke just ah, that the pleasing of the mind is maybe better than him just eating wheat grass shots and, and be pillar salads and just being, yeah, just super worked up about everything. It's like if you need your glass of red wine and de stress and calm down, that's probably better than you flying off the rails. Right, right. And I think that that's applicable not just in business but in probably any pursuit. And I like what you're saying about allow that one thing to be your obsession, but everything else, you know, learn how to learn, how to let things go. Pick your battles.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       And we'd like to think that we'd like to view the world as linear, which is I'm going to put an eight hours of work, I'm going to get back eight hours of output, right? Doesn't work that way. The guy running the corner grocery store is working just as hard or harder than you and me. How much output is he getting? What you do, who you do it with, how you do it. Way more important than how hard you work. Right? Outputs are non linear based on the quality of the work that you've put in the right way. That work is like a lion. You don't, you and I are not like cows were not meant to graze all day. Right? We're meant to hunt like lions were closer to carnivores in are omnivorous development than we are to herbivores. Um, we don't tell vegans. Yeah, sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       Look, I wish all that stuff worked. I don't want to eat meat. This future generations will look back at us as worse than slavers. You know, because the Holocaust, we're committing with the animals, but they'll have artificial meets that taste in or healthier is better than the real thing. So allegedly, allegedly, but so as a, as a modern knowledge worker athlete, as an intellectual athlete, you want to function like an athlete, which means you train hard, then you sprint, then you rest, then you reassessed, you get your feedback loop, then you train some more than you sprint again, then you rest. Then you reassess this idea that you're going to have linear output just by cranking everyday at the same amount of time saying that's that's machines. You know machines should be working nine to five humans are not meant work. Nine o'clock are not meant to work nine to five.

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       No, I agree whole heartedly. But that's for people that are working for someone, there's not really that option. So that's unfortunately the, the rub, right? That that's kind of where my tweet storm starts, which is first of all the first thing. If you're going to make money is that you're not going to get rich renting at your time. Even lawyers and doctors who are charging three, four, $500 an hour, they're not getting rich because their lifestyle is slowly ramping up along with their income and they're not saving enough. Uh, they just don't have that ability to retire. So the first thing you have to do is you have to own a piece of a business. You need to have equity either as an owner and an investor, shareholder or a brand that you're building that accrues to you to gain your financial freedom. Yeah, and I was really fascinated by another thing that you were bringing up about working for yourself that you feel in the future, whether it's 50 or 100 years from now, virtually everyone is going to be working for themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:24:06       And I believe the way you put it is that the information age is going to reverse the industrial age. Yeah. If you go back to a hunter gatherer times how we evolved, we basically work for ourselves. We communicated and cooperative within tribes, but each hunter, each category stood on their own and then combine their resources for the family unit. But there was no boss hierarchy, hierarchy, hierarchy where you're like the third middle manager down in the farming age. We became a little bit more hierarchical as we had to run farms, but even those were still mostly family farms. It's industrial work with factories that sort of created this model of thousands of people working together on one thing and having bosses and schedules and times to show up. The reality is if you have to go, I don't care how rich you are, I don't care whether you're like a top Wall Street banker, if you have to go, if somebody has to tell you, if somebody can tell you when to be at work and what to wear and how to behave, you're not a free person.

Speaker 2:          00:25:02       You're not actually rich. So we're in this model now where we think it's all about employment and jobs and intrinsic in that is that I have to work for somebody else, but the information age is breaking that down. So Ronald Coase is an economist who has this coast theater. I'm very famous Theorem, but it basically just talks about why is a company the size that it is. Why is the company one person instead of 10 people instead of a hundred instead of a thousand? And it has to do with the internal transaction costs versus the external transaction costs. Let's say I want to do something, uh, let's say I'm building a house and I need someone to come in and provide the lumber. I'm a developer, right? Do I want that to be part of my company or do I want that to be an external provider? A lot of it just depends on how hard it is to do that transaction with someone externally versus internally.

Speaker 2:          00:25:50       If it's too hard to keep doing the contract every time externally, I'll bring that in house. If it's easy to do externally and it's a one off kind of thing, I'd rather keep it out of the house. Well, information is making it easier and easier to do these transactions externally. It's becoming much easier to communicate with people. GIG economy. I can send you small amounts of money. I can hire you through an APP, I can rate you afterwards, so we're seeing an atomization of the firm we're seeing the optimal size of the firm is shrinking. It's most obvious in silicon valley. Tons and tons of startups constantly coming up and shaving off little pieces of businesses from large companies and turning them into huge markets. So what looked like the small little vacation rental market on craigslist is now suddenly blown up into airbnb. One example, that's one example, but what I think we're going to see is whether it's 10 2050 a hundred years from now, high quality work will be available.

Speaker 2:          00:26:45       We're not talking when I'm driving an Uber, we talking about super high quality work will be available in a gig fashion where you'll wake up in the morning, your phone will buzz and you'll have five different jobs from people who have worked with in the past or had been referred to you. It's kind of like how Hollywood already works a little bit with how they're organized for a project. You decide where to take the project or not, the contract is right there in the spot. You get paid a certain amount and you get rated every day or every week you get the my delivered and then when you're done working, you turn it off and you go to Tahiti or wherever you want to spend the next three months. And I think the smart people have already started figuring out that the Internet enables this and they're starting to work more and more remotely on their own schedule, on their own time and their own place with their own friends in their own way.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       And that's actually how we are the most productive. So the information revolution by making easier to communicate, connect, and cooperate is allowing us to go back to working for ourselves. And that is my ultimate dream. Even when I run a company and I have employees, I always tell those people, hey, I'm going to help you start your company when you're ready. Because I think that's the highest calling. Maybe not everybody will get there, but it would be fine if we were even working at 10 person company or a 20 person company is way better than working in a thousand person company, a 10,000 person company. So this idea that we're all factory like cogs in a machine who are specialized in have to do things by rote memorization or instruction is going to go away. And we're going to go back to being small groups of creative bands of individuals setting out to do missions. And when those missions are done, we collect our money, we get rated, and then we arrest and reassess until we ready for the next sprint.

Speaker 3:          00:28:19       Has there ever been a study done on happiness as it regards to the size of companies? Not that I'm aware of, but to me it's obvious. It's just

Speaker 2:          00:28:28       yes, the smaller the company, the happier you're going to be. The more human year relations are, the less you have rules to operate under, the more flexible, the more creative, the more you'll be treated like a human. Just because you were able to do multiple things.

Speaker 3:          00:28:39       Yeah. Um, this brings me to what is a, a subject that keeps getting brought up nowadays is universal basic income with the oncoming apocalypse of automation is this is how it's being portrayed by Andrew Yang, who's running for president. I sat down and talked to them about it's very compelling and he's a very smart guy and he's an entrepreneur himself. And when he starts talking about automation and how it's going to just eliminate massive amounts of jobs and leave people stranded, what do you, when I know you're a guy that thinks about the future and I'm going to take this unpopular point of view on this, I think it's a non solution to a non problem. Mm. Ooh. And I mean that in the sense that automation has been happening since the dawn of time. Mainly electricity came along that put a lot of people out of work, did it right. A lot of people carrying buckets of water and you know, lighting lamps and all those kinds of things. And this was the concern with factories as well, or apps, everything. Literally every single thing that comes in the printing press. Absolutely. And what it does is it frees

Speaker 2:          00:29:38       people up for new creative work. So the question is not is going to eliminate jobs. There is no finite number of jobs. We're not like sitting around dividing up the same jobs that were around since the stone age. So obviously in new jobs are being created and they're usually better jobs, more creative jobs. So the question is, how quickly is this transition going to happen and what kinds of jobs will be eliminated and what kinds of jobs will be created. It's impossible. Looking forward to predict what kinds of jobs will be created. If I told you 10 years ago that podcast it was going to be a job or that, uh, you know, playing video games is going to be a job or commentating and video games, it's going to be a job you would have laughed me out of the room. Those are nonsense jobs.

Speaker 2:          00:30:16       But yet here we are. So society will always create new jobs. Civilization creates new jobs, but it's impossible to predict what those jobs are. So the question is, how quickly is that transition happening? All the reality is, even though everybody keeps talking about this automation apocalypse, where did record low unemployment? Explain that. Where does the transition Donald Trump, that's how it, all I'm saying is it's, it's, it's, I don't see it in the numbers. I don't see it actually happening. The question is how quickly can you retrain people? So it's an education problem. The problem with the UBI, there's a couple of problems that ubi. One is you're creating a straight, you creating a slippery slide transfer straight into socialism, right? The moment people can start voting themselves money combined with a democracy, it's just a matter of time before the bottom 51 votes themselves. Everything in the top 49 and it just, it, and by the slippery slope fallacy is not a philosophy.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       And I know people like saying that, but they haven't thought it through. Um, but the moment you start having a direct transfer mechanism like that in a democracy, you're basically doing it with capitalism, which is the engine of economic growth. You're also forcing the entrepreneurs out or telling them not to come here. Uh, the estimate I saw for 15 k a year, a basic income for everybody will be three quarters of current GDP. And of course GDP was shrinking responses. All the entrepreneurs fled. So you would essentially bankrupt the country. Uh, another issue with Uva is that people who are down on their luck, they're not looking for handouts. It's not just about money, it's also about status. It's about meaning. And the moment I started giving money to you and put you on the Dole, I have lowered your status. I've made you a second class citizen.

Speaker 2:          00:31:56       So I have to give you meaning and meaning comes through education and capability I have. You have to teach a man to fish, not to basically throw your writing leftover carcasses that haven't say here, eat the scraps. So it doesn't solve the meaning problem. And lastly, it's nonsense. The hand 15 k out to everybody you want to means test people. There's no reason to give it to you and me. So you end up back towards the welfare system where you do have to figure out who needs it and who doesn't. So I think the better route is that we actually establish a set of basic substance services that you have to have and we provide those in abundance to technology based automation. So get basic housing, get basic food, get basic transportation, get high, high speed Internet access, get a phone in your pocket. Those are the kinds of things you want to give people.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       Um, and finally, in terms of the rate of automation, I think we can educate people very quickly. One of the myths that we have today is that adults can't be reeducated. We view education as this thing where you go to school, you come out when you're out of college and you're done. No more education. Well that's wrong. You have all these great online boot camps and coding schools coming up. They're ones that are even pay you to go there. Now. Um, you can educate people and mass and you can educate them into creative professions. People who are talking about Ai, automating programming. I've never really written serious code. Coding is thinking it's automated structure. Thinking an AI that can program as well or better than humans is an AI that just took over the world. That's end game. That's the end of the human species.

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       Uh, and I can give you arguments why I don't think that's coming either. Um, people who are thinking, and I know I take the opposite side from some very famous people in this debate, but we're nowhere near close to General Ai, not in our lifetimes. You don't have to worry about it. Even in our lifetimes really. It's so overblown. Uh, it's a, it's another, it's a combination of Cassandra complex. You know, it's fun to talk about the end of the world. Um, combined with a god complex, like people who have lost religion. So they were looking for meaning and some kind of end of history. Um, the reason why I don't think AI is coming anytime soon is because a lot of the advances and so so-called AI today or what we call narrow AI, they really pattern recognition, machine learning to figure out like, what is that object on the screen or how do you find the signal and all that noise.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       There's nothing approaching what we call creative thinking, uh, to actually model general intelligence. You run into all kinds of problems. First. We don't know how the brain works at all. Number two, we've never even modeled a paramecium or an Amoeba, let alone the human brain. Number three, there's this assumption that all of the computation is going at the cellular level, at the neuron level, whereas nature is very parsimonious. It uses everything at his disposal. There's a lot of machinery inside the cell that is doing calculations that is intelligent, that isn't accounted for. And the best estimates, I would take 50 years of Moore's law before we can simulate what's going on inside a cell near perfectly and probably a hundred years before we can build a brain that can simulate inside the cells. So putting it at saying that, I'm just going to model neuron is on or off and then use that to build the human brain is overly simplistic. Furthermore, I would pause it. There's no such thing as general intelligence. Every intelligence is contextual within the context of the environment that it's in. So you have devolved an environment around it. So I think a lot of people who are peddling general AI, the burden of proof is on them. I haven't seen anything that would lead me to indicate we're approaching general AI. Instead we're solving deterministic, closed set finite problems using large amounts of data, but it's not sexy to talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:25       If you, you're talking about mirroring the actual abilities of cells or are you talking about recreating the actual mechanism? Like what? What is going on inside

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       cells and biological organisms that we just don't know how intelligence works. We don't know. No idea. So most of the AI approaches basically say we're going to try and model how the brain works, but then model at the neuron level, which is saying this neurons on that neurons off, they're combining their signal, but I'm saying in the neuron is a cell inside the cell there's all this machinery going on that's operating the neuron that is also part of the intelligence apparatus. You can't just ignore that and abstract that out. You have to model it down to the inside the cell level. It's also a part of the biological organism itself. Exactly and it has all these needs that you know, the biological organism has to have food and rest and it's actually, it's a balance going on. But when you eliminate all that, when there is none of that, and it's just calculations and we get to a point where it's just this thing that we've created, whether you call it a computer where it doesn't have to be a moving thing even, but a thing that you've created that stores virtually all the information that's available in the world, star stores, all of the patterns of all the thinking of all the great people that have ever lived, all the writers, all the people that have ever published anything on the people that have ever spoken, any words, stores, all of their points, all of their counterpoints, other contradictions, applies logic and reason and some sort of sense of the future and starts improving upon these patterns and then starts acting on its own based on the information that's been provided with, well first you would have to actually simulate a structure of the human brain that can hold all that information.

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       You're basically talking about tens of thousands of brains worth of information, right? We can't even build one brain the next decade or two or three. Well, in terms of an actual physical brain, yes, but what about something that recreates the abilities of a brain then? Like I said, nature is parsimonious. So we've got this three pound wetware objects that can hold all this data. Nature has been very efficient in evolving kind of how we get there. I just don't think computers are anywhere close to that. Like that. It can hold that amount of data with that complexity with like the holographic structure of the brain working recall in many, many different ways. Uh, and then I don't think you can evolve a creature to be intelligent outside of the boundaries of feedback in a real medium. Like if you evolve, if you raised the human being a concrete cell with no input from the outside, they wouldn't have any feedback from the real world.

Speaker 3:          00:38:12       They wouldn't evolve properly. So I think just dumping information into, into a thing isn't enough. It has to have an environment to operate and to get feedback from. It needs to have context, but isn't that biological? I mean, what if you, if you have just the, all the information that people have accumulated and the lessons that people have learned and you programmed that into the computer. Like if, if we can take a computer that can beat someone at chess, the, the real question was, well, can we make some sort of an artificial intelligence that could beat someone a go, which is far more complex than chess. They figured out how to do that too, and that was a giant shock, right? These are still manmade, very closed bounded games. They're, they're not, they're not on the road to the unbounded game of life. They are completely artificial.

Speaker 3:          00:38:59       But this didn't go well. Didn't that give you like a little bit of a pause? A little bit go is not go or league of legends or Fort Night. They're not completely deterministic, but they're still very artificial and very bounded games. Being good at go doesn't mean that you can then suddenly figure out how to write great poetry, right? The creativity for sure is something that's, creativity is the last frontier. So I do believe that automation over a long enough period of time or replace every non creative job or every, not creative work, but that's great news. That means that all of our basic needs are taken care of. And what remains for us is to be creative, which is really what every human wants. Yeah. When, what are you doing right now? This is the creative job. Sure. Um, that, that brings us back to the idea of meaning and universal basic income.

Speaker 3:          00:39:47       Uh, I think the idea of giving someone $15,000 a year doesn't necessarily cause whatever, whatever one would worry about is people being on the Dole. You would have a bunch of listless people out there with no meaning in life. But the idea is that $15,000 a year, and I'm not necessarily sure I agree with this, I'm not, I'm not even endorsing this, but that $15,000 a year, we just provide you with the necessities to get by in life. It would give you food. They would give you shelter. Well, that's not gonna stop at 15 because the moment people are like, I'm getting 15 or like, then people will demand more Bernie Sanders and beyond the, I'm 16, 17, 18, 19 these companies are too big. Yeah. That could, it doesn't, it doesn't stop. It just, it just goes all the way to bankruptcy. And the concern is a slide to socialism.

Speaker 3:          00:40:34       It's obvious. I mean, heck, if I was on, if I was not working and I was getting my 15 year, I would happily voted for the guy who would give me 20 or 25. It's just common sense. What do you say to the people that don't believe that there is such a thing of ethical as ethical or compassionate capitalism? And then there's many people today that are espousing Marxism and they're espousing some sort of a socialist society where they believed that capitalism is screwed people over and, uh, eliminated the middle class and they're absolutely problems with capitalism. I think monopolies are a problem. I think that, uh, crony capitalism is a problem with the government, you know, kind of gets in bed with them and sort of forces things. Uh, I think the bankers have really, you know, rape society and the rest of us are suffering literally. Yeah. They have essentially taken huge risks where they prioritize the gains and the socialize the losses. So when it fails, they basically get bailed out and bankrupt everybody else. Uh, so the capitalism has gotten a really bad name. Let's talk about as free exchange. Free

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       markets, free markets and free exchange are intrinsic to humans from when the first person started a fire and somebody came along with a deer and said, hey, if I cooked my dear in your fire, I'll share some of it with you. Right? So specialization of labor, we trade that's built into the human species. Basic math comes from accounting, keeping track of debts and credits and so on. We need to be able to engage in free trade. The correct criticism of capitalism is when it does not provide equal opportunity. And so we should always strive to provide equal opportunity. But people confuse that with equal outcome. When you have equal outcome that can only be enforced through violence because different people, free people make different choices and when they make different choices, they have different outcomes. If you don't let them suffer the consequences of bad choices or reap the rewards from good choices, then you are forcibly redistributing through violence.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       It's interesting that there isn't. There are no socialist working socialist examples that exist without violence. You basically need someone to show up with a gun and say, okay, you're not allowed to do that. You hand this over to that person. So one of the reasons why this podcast is because I believe everybody can be wealthy. Everybody. It's not a zero sum game. It is a positive sum game. You create something brand new, you exchange with me for something brand new I've created, there's higher utility for both of us. The some of the value created is positive. It's not like status where it's like you're higher up. I'm lower down your presidents. I must be vice president. You're a plus one I'm a minus one. It has to cancel the zero. We should all be all for playing positive, some ethical games. The problem is because of these looters who have ruined capitalism's name, that then you get socialists coming in and saying, burn the whole system down.

Speaker 2:          00:43:14       You burn the whole system down. We end up like Venezuela or the former Soviet Union, you know, you don't want to be a fail socialist states with Mac to teens hunting cats on the streets to eat. Right. That's literally what happens in some of these places. Uh, so I think it's very important not to destroy the engine of progress that brought us here. Yeah. The idea that socialism just hasn't worked yet, that it needs to the, we just need to do it right. If we do it right, we can. If you ever hundred a hundred million dead and yeah. Well let's keep trying all over the world. Yeah. And every single time it's implemented. Yeah. Have you ever had a conversation with someone who's a socialist? Were we, many times some of my better friends are socialists. Really? We really get into that. Yeah. What is the, I mean there's anyone have a compelling perspective at all.

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       I think really socialism comes from the heart, right? Y'All. We all want to be socialist. Capitalism comes from the head because they're always cheaters in any system. And there's incentives in any system. So when you're young, if you're, if you're not a socialist, you have no heart. When you're older, if you're not a capitalist, you have no head, right? You haven't thought it through. So I understand where it comes from. I always like Nassim Taleb framing on this where he said, with my family, I'm a communist with my close friends, I'm a socialist. Uh, you know, at my state level politics, I'm a Democrat at, you know, higher levels. I'm a, I'm a Republican. And that the federal level and the Libertarian, right? So basically the larger the group of people, you have mass together who have different interests, the less trust there is, the more cheating there is, the better the incentives have to be aligned, the better the system has to work.

Speaker 2:          00:44:49       The more you are towards capitalism, the smaller the group you're in, you're in a Kibitz you and you're a, and you're in your house, you in your tribe. By all means, be a socialist with my aunts, with my brother, with my cousins and my uncles and my mom. But family, I'm a socialist. That's the right way to live. A loving, happy, integrated life. But when you're dealing with strangers, I mean you want to be a real socialist. Great. Open all your doors and windows tomorrow please. Everybody come take what you want. See how that works out.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       Yeah. Um, this idea of income inequality, that always strikes me as a very, it's a deceptive term. Income inequality.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       Well, let's flip it around. It comes from outcome inequality. Yeah. And the outcome inequalities there because you made different choices. Now again, going back, if it was because he didn't have the same opportunities, that's a problem. So society should always try to give people equal opportunities. So for example, instead of basic income, what if we had a retraining program built into our basic social fabric, which said that every four years or every six years or whatever it is, maybe it's every 10. You can take one year out and we'll pay for you to go retrain completely. And you can go into any profession you like that has some earning power and output, uh, hopefully a creative longterm profession and you can reeducate yourself. That would be much better for society on all levels. Then basically just saying, now you're going to be the Dole for the rest of your life.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       MMM. Yeah. Just you'd have to lead that horse to water and then make them drink. It requires people to put in some effort. Yes. We can all just sit around. It's just not well, that's my perspective on income inequality. There's always effort, inequality, and thought inequality. There's just certain people that are obsessed. And if those people become successful, it doesn't mean they stole from you. It just means that they put in the amount of energy and effort that is required to reach where they're at.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       And there's a lot of Richard's signaling that goes on now where people say, well, it's cause you're privileged. You know what the greatest privileges you're alive, 85% of humanities dead. So how privileged are you then? You're living in the first world. Then you're, you know, you have four limbs, et cetera. So you can take that argument all the way. It's kind of a nonsense discussion.

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       Well, it's a very weird progressive argument and it as it pertains to a race is always a weird one, right? Because white privilege to me is, although you could look at what they're saying on paper, like yes, yeah, I'm sure there's more black people that are harassed by the police. I'm sure there was more black people who are treated suspiciously by shop owners in the light. But the problem isn't the people who aren't treated poorly. The problem is the people who treat the people poorly. The problem is racism. The problem is not people that didn't ask to be born white or whatever they are, and they don't get harassed that, so this idea of white privilege or male privilege or whatever it is, that's not the problem. You're, you're just looking at someone who's not a victim of this particular problem that you're highlighting, but you're not looking at the perpetrators of the problem. You're making people perpetrators by simply existing and having less melanin in their skin or having their answer

Speaker 2:          00:47:58       assessors come from that's just racism by another. It's another sneaky way being racist and then they say you can't be racist. It's not racist because you're white. That's right. That is this hilarious. If you can't be racist against white people, that one as a variation of the whole still while I hit you argument, you know, stop struggling while I'm hitting you, but it's just so silly. You've just completely change what racism means. What's hilarious is it mostly the people who are yelling racist and not the minorities? What I look on my Twitter or my social media or on my news, it's white on white violence, virtue signal. It's white on white violence was mostly going on is it's elitist whites, blue state whites, college educated whites beating up on high school, educated whites, blue collar. It's a white collar versus blue collar war that's going on and the rest of us are just kind of watching like, oh, that's kind of interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       Well it's also a side effect of the ability to broadcast, right? Like everyone with a Twitter handle has the ability to broadcast. Everyone with a Facebook page has the ability to pontificate and have these long rambling, these huge statements that people put out when you read them. It's like, how much time did you put in this and what the fuck do you put that much time of your kids or your job or your job or your life or your future planning for your, you know, how much do you work out a day? I mean you just, these some, I've read some people's Facebook posts. I'm like, this is a preposterous amount of effort that you put in the saying virtually nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       Let's see. Humans are being creative. It's the Ai do that. Well that's true. It is create. It's, it's okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       Creative in a very odd way, right? Cause it's creative and that they're trying to elicit a response from people in there trying to raise their, their social value or raise their position, the social

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       totem pole. It's signaling and it's easy signaling because of the kind of thing that everybody has to agree with you on it because nobody wants to be seen as a horrible person. And it's a very hard to make the nuanced arguments against than it is to just kind of go along.

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       Right. Well it's also, it's, some of it is so cliche that it seems like, I know one guy who poses as a woman on on Twitter, but he does it just obviously, what is the name? Tatiana Mcgrath

Speaker 2:          00:50:06       graph? Yes. Yeah. Used to be Godfrey Elwick. Yes. Oh, is that the same guy thing? So yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah, I did not. They killed his account. They can't get the same one for that hundred percent sure for pretending to be trans racial. That's right. They didn't leave. He basically says all the crazy stuff that people on the left say, but he says the craziest yes. And kind of just shows how it's okay to say it. Like I think I saw a tweet from recently just said or her that it's not okay to be white. Yes. And then some people agree, but it's, it's so close to what they say. It's so close that it's like the most artful form of subtle parody because if you replace in half of these things that you replaced the word white with black or Asian, what's the Lynch mob descended on you?

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       Yeah. It's, it's a strange time in that respect that there's a famous old saying, if you want to see who rules over you see who you are not allowed to criticize. Mm, excellent. Yeah, that is a, that's so true, right? Yeah. That's so true. I wonder where this is going. I really do. I'm, I wonder because this is, it seems like this new found ability to broadcast that we have with, whether you have a youtube page or whether you have a Twitter or whatever, you're doing, this new found ability to spread whatever you're trying to say to so many people with very little understanding on the most part, from what it's actually a great thing overall. Yeah. It means that any human can broadcast to any other human on the planet at any time. So, for example, if you know a totalitarian dictator where to come to power and someone was beating up, you know, had fascist beating up an old women like that would get broadcast out instantly there would be an instant outrage, hue and cry rallying.

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       So in that sense, it helps bring attention to the plight of anybody. But right now we're going through the phase where we have this new found power to assemble mops and people don't know how to deal with that. So it becomes very easy to set up a mob and have it attack somebody. Take all the context out. Like even this conversation, I'm sure people will take out snippets to put him on social media and try and get somebody's outraged. Of course. Uh, and so you have to learn how it, first of all, society just has to get over to this idea of outrage. Like to me, like outreach people are the people who get easily outrage of the stupidest people on social media. Those are the people I block instantly. Uh, it's just kind of very low level thinking, right? These are the foot's off the, these are the foot soldiers in the mob.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       Eventually society just has to get over it. They have to understand that these are all snippets being taken out of context. These are doctored video clips. These are just someone who's trying to get outraged over something. Eventually, there'll also be anti mob tactics. Like for example, if, if I go to someone's Twitter feed and all it is, it's full of political, political, ranting, raving conspiracy theories. Do I want to work with this person doing associate with this person? Do want to be friends with this person? Their mind is just cluttered with junk. I don't necessarily blame them. I think that the human brain is not designed to absorb all of the world's breaking news. 24 seven emergencies injected straight into your skull with clickbait headline news. If you pay attention to that stuff, even if you're well meaning, even if your sound of mind and body, it will eventually drive you insane.

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       This is goes to clockwork orange where he's, you know, has his eyes opened up this forced to watch the news. But I think that's what's happening right now because these are addictive, right? Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, these are weaponized. You have social statisticians and scientists and researchers and people in lab coats. Literally best minds of our generation and figuring out how to addict you to the news and if you fall for it, if you get addicted, you're brain will get destroyed. And I think this is the modern struggle, like the modern struggle. So the ancient struggle used to be the tribal struggle. You had your tribe of friends and family, you had your religion, you had your country, you had your loyalty, their nationality, at least you had meaning and support. But now you would struggle against other tribes. Modern life, we're so free. Everything's become atomized.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       We stand alone. You live in your apartment alone, you live in your house alone and your parents don't live nearby. Your friends don't live nearby. You don't have any tribal meaning. You don't believe in religion anymore. You don't believe in country anymore. It's fine. You've got a lot of freedoms, fantastic. But now when they come to attack you, you're alone and you can't resist. So how do they attack you? It's all well meaning I don't fault capitalism, I love capitalism. But look at how it happens. Social Media, they've massaged all the mechanisms to addict you, like a Skinner pigeon or a rat who's just going to click, click, click, click, click camp, put the phone down, the food they've taken sugar and the weaponized it, they've put it into all these different forms and varieties that you can't resist eating drugs, right? They've taken pharmaceuticals and plants and they've synthesize them.

Speaker 2:          00:54:57       They've grown them in such a way that you can't, you get addicted, you can't put them down point, right? If you're a young male, you want to around the internet, it'll like SAP away your libido and you're not going out in real life society anymore. Cause you've got this incredibly stimulating stuff coming at you video games, another way to Dick People. So you have this, you have entire large factories of people that are working to addict you to these things and you stand alone. So the modern struggle as an individual is learning how to resist these things in the first place. Drawing your own boundaries and there's no one there to help you.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       Oof. That's terrifying. I mean, it is, if we do road that needs to be navigated by young people that are, there's no map, there's no guidebook on how to handle this.

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       Our generation is the transition generation. I think our kids will know how to handle it better cause they'll grow up with, I hope, I hope.

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       I hope too, because you're seeing some ridiculous behavior from people today that's so common. I mean, I don't know if you've been paying attention to this, but there was a guy who, he made a, uh, a video of, it turns out it wasn't even him that made the video. At least that's not what he said. But it was a video where he sort of doctored Nancy Polosi talking. It made it look like she was drunk. And then a bunch of people retweeted it and like, oh my God, look, she's drunk. And, and so one of the online publications, uh, uh, some website tracked him down

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       and doxed him and turned out he's just a day labor who is an African American Trump fan. And thought it would be funny to do that. And it turns out that he didn't even, at least according to him, he actually just put it up on his Facebook page. What's even more disturbing is Facebook gave up his information to this website. Right. For what? Cause he made something funny that made people seem drunk. There's a million of those about me. I mean, you could find them mean I think Facebook and Twitter and a bunch of these other social media platforms are committing slow motion suicide through these kinds of activities. That was a stunning one though, that they would give up this guy who's a labor because he made a parody video or he made someone look foolish with editing. Well, you now have basically the media views it as their job to go after individuals they don't like.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       Yeah. I used media with air quotes in that regard. Yes. I don't think this is something that the New York Times would have done us anything responsible, but the media is getting more and more desperate, right? Because what happened was before the Internet, you could have two local newspapers in every town and you could have two local news stations, TV stations in every town. And then CNN came along and started commoditizing the news 24, seven broadcast, and then the internet came along. And that was the final nail in the coffin. Because what the Internet did was it said, actually, if there's a fact that's news, you can distribute that immediately. It can go on Twitter, it can go on Facebook. It gets reprinted and Google news a thousand times, you know, you go on Google News, you're like, okay, what's the piece of news? Which source? And 3000 other articles.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       Too many, right? So news has become commoditized. So the entire news media has shifted into peddling opinions and entertainment. And so now they've become a variation between like cheerleaders, shock troops, enforcers, uh, you know, talking heads. So these are now tribal, these are not propaganda machines signaling for their tribes. It's a right wing. One is left wing one, right? There's the alt right, there's a control left. And the two of them were just fighting it out using their various media organs in memes. So basically when you see one of these news organizations, doxing, an individual that's like a tank running over a soldier, that's what's going on. It's just a war. And so there's no, there's no such thing anymore. Less than neutral media commentator. The, the illusion of objectivity that journalism had is lost. There is no longer one guy, like a Walter Cronkite that everyone's going to listen to.

Speaker 2:          00:58:44       It's now the shock troops fighting wars with each other. How does this play out? Have you thought about it? Yeah, a little bit. Uh, so what the Internet does, a lot of this is internet driven. What the internet does is the Internet creates one giant aggregator or two for everything. One taxi dispatcher, one ecommerce store, one search engine, one uh, you know, one social media site for friends and family, one for business, et cetera. So the Internet is this giant aggregator where it creates one big hedge Amman for everything. And it creates an atomized long tail of millions and millions of individuals. What it gets rid of is the medium, medium size ones in the middle. So for example, you might've had like seven Hollywood studios. What's Origami? Netflix. You had a, you know, like, uh, 10 large ecommerce players had commerce players from Walmart to Costco to, you know, Kmart and whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       Nope, not just going to be Amazon and a ton of small individual brands. So that's the world that we're headed towards. One Hedge Amman and millions of individuals. So we're ends up longterm is media will be a few gigantic outlets. You know, it could be the New York Times, it could be Facebook, a few like that. And there's going to be just a really long tail of millions of independent people. So this idea of who is a journalist and who's not, you know, is a Sandra journalists are not everyone's a journalist. That's the world that we're headed towards. I do think that extreme power, the most powerful people in the world today, and this is not well known, but the most powerful people in the world today are the people who are writing the algorithms for Twitter and Facebook and Instagram because they're controlling the spread of information.

Speaker 2:          01:00:26       They're literally rewriting people's brains. They're programming the culture, and they're doing it very subtly like Google. I believe that, you know, one of their execs got up in front of Congress and the Congressmen asked him, uh, you know, do you manipulate search results? And he said, no, we do not manipulate search results. Really, that's your job. That is literally all Google does. Google has one job, which is to manipulate search results to pull them out of the noise and rank them properly. And the, the precise algorithms of how they do that is very hidden, very complex, but influences the hearts and minds of everybody, including all the voters. Now, if Google, Facebook and Twitter had been smart about this, they would not have picked sides. They would have said, we're publishers, whatever it goes through our pipes goes through our pipes. If it's illegal, we'll take it down, give us a court order.

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       Otherwise we don't touch it. It's like the phone company. If I call you up and I say something horrible to you on the phone, the phone company doesn't get in trouble. But the moment they started taking stuff down, that wasn't illegal because somebody screen, they basically lost the right to be viewed as a carrier and now all of a sudden they've taken on liability. So they're sliding down the slippery slope into ruin, sloping to ruin where the left wants him to take down the right, the right ones. And I take down the left and now they have no more friends. They have no allies. Traditionally the libertarian leaning Republicans and Democrats would have stood up in principle for the common carriers, but now they won't. So my guess is as soon as Congress, and this is, this day is coming, if not already here, it might even been here today actually because you saw something related in the news. The day is coming. When the politicians realize that these social media platforms are picking the next president, the next congressman, they are literally picking and they have the power to pick. So they will be controlled by the government. In what way? How do you think they're going to be controlled? We think they're going to have to adhere to strict principles of freedom of speech. Now, no,

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       unfortunately is headed the opposite direction, right? Yeah. I wish it was freedom of speech. Uh, much more likely they're going to be in the short to medium term. They're going to be hauled in for hearings. Uh, they're going to be pressured, massively do this, don't do that. My concern about that is the hearings that I saw with Zuckerberg, those people were completely incompetent. They are and seem to understand them. They don't, but they're just applying pressure. They just trying to scare him. So he'll do what they want. And what do they want them to do? They want them to basically suppress the other side. So if you're right wing, you want to suppress the left wing for left doing. You want to suppress the right wing. And if you just see where these companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley, um, all the sensors, and that's really what they are.

Speaker 3:          01:02:58       There are sensors working inside these companies that are just called, they're called by different names obviously, right? Doublespeak you call it the department defense wants the Department of war. So in this case, the Department of safety and trust, when really it's the department of censorship, the sensors are inside Silicon Valley. So it's going to reflect Silicon Valley's politics, which is extremely progressive. Left ring. And if you're not that, you really have no place. There's, that's right. Try being a conservative and open conservative at Google. Good Lord. Now you get lynched. Yeah, that's crazy. I mean, I don't think that there was ever a thing like that that was so influential and so politically, ideologically one sided. Yeah. There's a, there's a little saying on the Internet thing. It's called conquest law, that any organization that's not explicitly left right wing eventually becomes left wing. And I don't know why that's true, but it does seem to me to be true.

Speaker 3:          01:03:51       What's a, it's a fascinating battle that's going on right now. I mean, it really is. And conservatives in, in as far as social media is concerned that they're just getting chopped off at the Hams left and right. Yeah. What will eventually happen is that, uh, whenever you suppress speech, the organism metastasizes, then it has to start turning towards other means. If you're unlucky goes towards violence, uh, if you're lucky they find other outlets. Uh, I think what will happen is we will start creating decentralized media that's not owned by any single entity that can't be suppressed or shutdown. That will then start spreading these various things and that will take the place of Twitter or Facebook or whatever, but it's going to take 10 years, 20 years. It's not overnight. Well, uh, you know, Twitter took 10 years to get to the point where it's at this mess right now.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       But it was so interesting too to have Jack Dorsey in to talk to him about where it's going, where you thinks is going on in his own principles, which he believes that it's a fundamental right and he believes that freedom of speech is something that we all should have and that these platforms should essentially be like, like utilities, like the electric company I think is correct and he has the right vision. It's just he's in an organization where the other individuals in the organization feel differently, very differently. So the organization itself can get hijacked and his timeline for changing things, it's like it's decades. I mean, I don't, I shouldn't say decades. I mean I was like, when do you think that something where there was a park that was one idea of having an uncensored Twitter, like one Twitter, that's the wild west. Like you can have regular Twitter or you could try wild west Twitter like, well that that already existed and that were called Gab.

Speaker 3:          01:05:33       Yeah. Such as APP isn't even wild west Twitter they did when when people, docs people, they remove things like that. Yeah. I mean, I think there's certainly lines around violence and reality that you don't want to cross. But yes, gab is closer to free speech platform. Uh, but it's still not decentralized. It can still get shut down. I can still get taken out. It's also suppressed heavily. Yes. So there, and the people on there right now are extremely right wing, so it's not a pleasant place for someone like me to hang out. So that people that have been kicked off of something. That's right. That's right. Try going over there and being moderate. Try going over there and there's no room for you. Yeah, unfortunately, because I don't identify as any party here, any creed, you know, it doesn't work for me. Does that a problem in silicon valley when you don't identify as anything?

Speaker 3:          01:06:17       Do, do you get pressure? It totally. It used to be okay. It's not okay anymore. When was it? Okay. 10 years ago I would say it was okay. And then you start seeing a shift. Yeah. And now you have to pick sides, otherwise you'll automatically the enemy real. Yeah. Struggle sessions and all that. Okay. God struggle sessions. I'm exaggerating for effect, but it definitely has that oppressive feeling to it. Right. And you also have to be politically outspoken. It can't, it can't be something that you just stay neutral about. Right. It's like when a Tim Ferriss, I think at some point put out a tweet about how you can't just say anything anymore and you know, people are being suppressed and a whole bunch of people who allowed them from Silicon Valley pilot and said, what is it that you can't say? What are you afraid to say?

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       You can say whatever you want him. Go ahead. What are you afraid of? Like baiting. Yeah. Yeah. What was he trying to say? Wow. We have to put them in that box. One is someone who was thinking about saying something he shouldn't have said it. Exactly. Now we know one great tweet us was, you know, the left one, the culture wars and other just driving around shooting the survivors. Wow. That's hilarious. Yeah. I wonder, uh, I wonder who as has one, the cultural war, the certainly a battle that's been one in terms of like control, social media control, social media is absolutely laughable, but this is unfortunate for conservatives, but technology is a force that also pushes left. So if you look all throughout human history, like the left essentially grows and grows and grows, right? Why is that? Why is it an extra believe that as some commentators have said, Leviathan slouches left, right?

Speaker 3:          01:07:42       For the Leviathan is the government, why does it smell? She left? And I think a lot of that has been because of technology. Technology has made it so that it makes more like industrial revolution technology. We all band together, awards awarded the state, right? Contraception is a technology that kind of helps lean leftward. It takes away from the family unit. Abortion is a technology, right? It wasn't possible thousands of years ago. Um, so technology actually empowers the individual. The individual means that you have the breakdown of family structure and religion and all that. And I'm not necessarily opposed to that, but it does mean that there's

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       a leftward shift to it. Now we're getting a small set of technologies that actually can take you more, right word, uh, encryption as an example because the encryption makes it easier to have privacy. It makes it easier to have money that is outside of the state. Um, guns, three d printing of guns and example of a technology that is more of a rightward shift. Um, but generally technology leads the world left.

Speaker 1:          01:08:39       Yeah. It's also usually highly educated people that are involved in technology in the first place. And I think when you look at universities in particular, they tend to lean left in this country as well.

Speaker 2:          01:08:53       Well, universities, uh, what happened with the university is very interesting. Universities first one, you know, became the arbitrators of, uh, data, intellectual ism, and know what's right and wrong. So that the time period when it was like, should we be doing that or not? Well, let's look at the university. What do they have to say? What are the smartest people, the professors that think tanks have to say? And the universities got this, this credibility from the hard sciences. So they got this from a, you know, physics and math and computer science and chemistry because these deliver real things. The Manhattan project, the microprocessor, the space vehicles and so on, the electric car. So they gained this mantle of authority and legitimacy from the hard sciences. So then come the social sciences kind of sneaking. Then you get economy economics and microeconomics is a real discipline, real science, real math behind it, logic reason.

Speaker 2:          01:09:46       And then you get macro economics, which can be politicized a little bit more voodoo. And then you get social studies and then you get gender studies and then you get blah blah blah blah blah, blah, blah, blah blah. And so what happened is that because we took scientists to be the high priests of our new world, science itself has gotten corrupted and the social sciences, and you can tell they're fake scientist because they, the word science tacked on at the end have come in and hijack the universities and become the new think tanks. And so essentially what you see going on today in the universities is a war between the social sciences in the physical sciences. And the crossover point is biology, right? Where you can see like the whole gender is a social construct movement is attacking biology and evolutionary biology. Um, just like in the social sphere, they're coming after the comedians. Right. But you can see the struggle going on in the universities and I would say the physical sciences are essentially losing that war.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       What can be done? Or is it just something that has to play out? Is it, do we have to realize the consequences of the foolishness and the good news of the physical sciences have a reality on their side? Yeah. But it's not even, I mean, in many ways it's not respected.

Speaker 2:          01:10:55       Yeah. But at the end of the day, you're, your aircraft still has to fly. Uh, you know, you're a microprocessor still has to compute. So there's only so far they can, they can take it. Uh, but I do see, for example, in biology, a lot of biologists are facing this difficult thing where they have to say things that they know are not true to keep their job. Like, Oh, you had Bret Weinstein on here. Right. So that's a, that's a clear example. So it, there's just the crossover line of what is acceptable and what's not is entering into biology and biology will probably suffer the most. Um, synthetic biology for example. Uh, will, you know, a lot of this will end up in China, um, because it won't be, you won't be able to map facts and reality and actions together. You won't be able to get grants. He won't be able to get the adulation of your peers. Um, I don't, I don't know enough here's the nom and shaky territory, but it's just my sense that that crossover battleground right now as an evolutionary biology economics lost. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       it certainly in terms of gender in the, that, that sort of, that seems to be one of the major battlegrounds. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:58       I mean, it's also going to happen if we have a blank slate theory, you know, are we nature or are we an immature? Um, it's kind of a socially unacceptable to say that, you know, a lot of it is in nature and not nurture or vice versa. Depending on which side you're on. Those kinds of discussions get corrupted. They do get corrupted. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:15       It's really unfortunate because that's an unbelievably important thing to understand. Like what makes a person a sociopath? What makes a person a super successful person, a winner. Right? But what makes a person a drug addict? What, what are, what are these factors?

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       You can't have a reasonable conversation about climate science anymore. Right? It's not a science, it's all politicized. You can't even bring it up. Everyone's got their minds made up already.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       Well, it's, what's uncomfortable to me is people have their minds made up and they don't even have it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:44       Yeah. Well, on most of these topics, people are talking past each other anyway and talking about different things. Like when you get into, uh, you know, when you, when you get into gun control, for example, right? One side is talking about the right to bear arms in case I to radical ruler king tried to take over the country the other time. The other side is talking about school shootings and you know, protecting people in their homes, right from crime. So they're just talking about two different things, right? Uh, and it's just not politically acceptable to even talk about the same thing. Or when you get to immigration, the Wright is talking about, uh, you know, uh, the, the, the left is like bundling together illegal immigration and legal immigration into one thing, right? Whereas in the, on the right, sometimes you got racist siting in there so it doesn't help their cause.

Speaker 2:          01:13:28       Right? They're talking about two different things. If they were talking about the same thing, which is how many immigrants should we let into the country and you know, what are the criteria for that? That would be a very different conversation than no immigrants are. Everybody comes in. And then also on the left, you know, you had this benefit that everybody who's currently coming in illegally is going to vote for the left because of where they're coming from and their socioeconomic circumstances. Um, to me the test of any good system is you build a system handed over to your enemies to run for the next decade. So for example, if you want a censorship on Twitter or Facebook, you should build that system and then hand it over to the other side to run. So if you're a left winger who is promoting a censorship, let somebody else running.

Speaker 2:          01:14:09       Same with immigration. If you immigration system, build the system then handed over to the other side to run in there. So, you know, it's a good system. There's no room for nuance when you're dealing with these political battle grounds, when, when you're dealing with right versus left. And one side has a clearly established stance that you're supposed to take. Like gun control is a great example of that, right? There's no room for, what about mental health? What about the fact that so many of these people are on psych medication, right? What, why is that not being discussed? You're running one of the greatest, uh, mental health experiments in history when we're building great buddy up in Sris and maybe you get 30 million people Sris maybe like 29.9 million are a lot happier and then you have a fraction that commit suicide or detonate. Yeah. You're basically trading the mean for the variants.

Speaker 2:          01:15:01       You have blow up risk. Yeah. There's no room for nuance, which is why I stay out of politics. Largely. Do they drag you in though? Sometimes. I always try. I mean even conversations conversation you get to get dragged in, but I'm sure there's going to be some people. Here's the thing about politics because there we have a first past the post system. What that means is that whoever wins 51% of the vote in this country, he gets a lot of the power, right? It's not like proportional representation where the Greens have 10% and you know libertarians of 3% or whatever. It's just like you're all Democrat in power now are all Republican. Because of that, to win, you have to pick one of these two sides, right? You have, you have to choose. You can't just, you can't just, you can't just basically say, I'm going to be, uh, you know, nuanced about it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       You can't vote for third party to throwing away your vote, right? I have a friend who's tried to fix that. He started this thing called a good party where like, you kickstart your vote. So you combine all your votes, you hold them in reserve, and then when you have enough to win, then you vote that person in power, right? You don't, you don't throw away your boat. But outside of those hacks, we're never going to get a third party get elected. So because of that, all of your beliefs have to neatly fit into the Democrat bundle, other Republican bundle. And so when you get into that tribe, uh, if you signal outside of that tree, out of that bundle, you get attacked. So it's literally, it's making you into an unclear thinker. It's making you into a muddle thinker. If all of your beliefs line up into one political party, you're not a clear thinker. If all your beliefs are the same as your neighbors and your friends, you're not a clear thinker. You're literally just your beliefs. They're socialized, they're taken from other people. So if you want to be a clear thinker, you cannot pay attention to politics. It will destroy your ability to think.

Speaker 2:          01:16:40       But what dread most of modern life, all our diseases are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity, right? All Times I may have starved. Uh, I'm, you know, all times if I've got sugar, that was a wonderful thing. I should've eaten all the sugar to get my hands on. If I got an a piece of news or gossip that was interesting data that would have helped my life and move me forward. Um, if I had gotten some brief amount of entertainment, whether through video games or magazines or whatever, that would have been good. Now it's all diseases, abundance. We are overexposed to everything. So the way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic. It is to retreat from society. There's too much society everywhere you go, society and your phone, society in your pocket, society in your ears, you're being socialized right now by listening to this podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:17:25       We're socializing. You were programming you. Everyone's trying to program everybody. The only solution is to turn it off. The only solution is to turn it off and concentrate on your breathing. Meditation. Yeah, I, yes, it works. It's, it's been a lifesaver for me. Oh, I do it and I do it whenever I get like spare time. I was at the doctor's office this morning and uh, I knew it was going to be 20 minutes, so I just sat there with my eyes closed for 20 minutes and I meditated. You know, when I was growing up, there was this statement, I think it was pascal. He said, you know, all of man's problems arise because he cannot sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes alone. And it's very true. I always needed to be stimulated. And when the iPhone came along, boredom was dead. I would never be bored again.

Speaker 2:          01:18:08       If I'm standing in line, I'm on my iPhone and I thought it was great. And when I was a kid I used to try and over clock my brain be like, how many thoughts can I think at once? The answer is only one. But I would try to like think multiple thoughts at once. And I was proud of that as proud that my brain was always running. This engine was always moving and it's a disease. It's actually the road to misery. And now that I'm older, I realize that you actually want to again, rest your mind. You want to learn how to settle into your mind. And now I look forward to solitary confinement. You leave me alone for a day, it'll be like the happiest day I've had in a while. And that is a super power that I think everybody can attain. The superpower of learning to be alone and enjoying it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:48       Yeah. Yeah. Well I think it's critical and I, and I do think that this, this, these times where you just think about things, just be alone and think about things are so rare these days. And I think during those rare times is when you really get to understand what you actually believe or don't believe. Yeah. It's, it's funny, when I first started meditating, it was really hard, right? Cause everybody, I think a lot of people who are listening to the broadcast ever heard of meditation that has a good reps. Everybody tries it, they struggle, they kind of give it up. It's one of those things that everybody says they do, but nobody actually does. Right. It's like not eating sugar. Right. Everyone talks about how, yeah, I don't need sugar with like, yeah, then then the dessert tray rolls around and everyone's going for the cookies.

Speaker 2:          01:19:33       Yup. Right? Yup. So it's become one of those things and in fact, it's not even become a signaling thing where it's like, oh, how much did you meditate? I meditated this much. Right. You know, there are people now wearing headbands saying with tweety, birds Chirp and then when they're in deep meditation, I don't know, I don't know how they make it work, but they'll be like, I got a lot of trips today. How many trips did you get? Oh right. Oh, you're a meditation technique is wrong when it's right, but really all it is is the art of doing nothing. Okay. And it's important because I think when we, when we grow up, right, it's all this stuff happening to you in your life and some of it you're processing some of ear absorbing and some of it you should probably think a little bit more about and work through, but you don't, you don't have time.

Speaker 2:          01:20:13       So it gets buried in you and it's all of these preferences and judgments and unresolved situations and issues and it's like your email inbox, it's just piling up email after email after email that's not answered going back 10 2030 40 years. And then when you sit down to meditate, those emails start coming back at you. Hey, what about this issue? What about that issue? Have you solved this? Did you think about that? Your regrets there, you have issues there and that gets scary. People don't want to do that. Like it's not working. I can't clear my mind. I better get up and not do this. But really what's happening is it's, it's, it's self therapy. It's just that instead of paying a therapist to sit there and listen to you, you're listening to yourself and you just have to sit there. As those emails go through one by one, you work through each of them until you get to the magical inbox zero and there comes a day when you sit down, you realize the only thing is you're thinking about or things that happen yesterday because you've processed everything else.

Speaker 2:          01:21:02       Not necessarily when resolve that, but at least listen to yourself and that's when meditation starts and I think it's a, it's a very powerful thing that everybody should experience and that's when you arrive upon the art of doing nothing. Well, I think it's even a problem that most people are getting their meditation from an APP. I will not use an APP. It's key. I mean Sam Harris was a very good meditation. Now I should say that, but you should be able to just do it and many people, it is literally the art of doing nothing. So all the initiative for meditation is just sit down, close your eyes, comfortable position, whatever happens, happens. If you think you think, if you don't think you don't think, don't put effort into it, don't put effort against it all you need. Do you concentrate on your breath or do you have a specific nothing, nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:21:44       Now you just said, he just said, I think about my breath. That's all I do. I just to try to only concentrate on breathing. I used to do that, but at some level, all the concentration, every meditation technique is leading you to the same thing, which is just witnessing and concentration is a technique to still your mind enough that you can then drop the object of concentration. So you could also just try going straight to the end game. The problem with what I'm talking about, which is not focusing on your breath, is you will have to listen to your mind for a long time. It's not going to work. Let's do at least an hour a day and preferably at least 60 days before you kind of worked through a lot of issues, so it will be held for awhile, but when you come out the other side, it's great.

Speaker 2:          01:22:24       You get rid of the chatter or when the chatter comes, it's in the background, it's dimmer, it's smaller. You've heard it before. You see the patterns. Uh, it's more recent. It's something you need to resolve any way. And you will get moments of actual silence. What is your, what's your ultimate state when you meditate? Like is there a state where you've achieved rarely if ever, where you just, you, you are, you're in bliss or you're in harmony or urine enlightenment. Like whether it's kind of, it's kind of indescribable, uh, because when you're really meditating, you're not there. When there's no thoughts, there's no experience, there's nothing, there's just nothing. Uh, so it's, it's hard to describe, but I would say that, uh, it's like, uh, you can definitely, every psychedelic state that people encounter in using so called plant medicines can be arrived at just through pure meditation.

Speaker 2:          01:23:19       And I've definitely hit some of those states. You've hit some transcendent psychedelic states where you're anticipating the whole deal. Had trippy visuals. I've had the kind of the lights and colors. I've had been the so called downloads. I've had the realizations, I've had the bliss, I've had the light of the colors, but not every time. No, it's really an in fact I would say that, that that's uh, that's also like an experience that you can start craving, which will then actually take you out of meditation. Um, where you really, I, and I'm not enlightened or anything close to it, so not even the Ballpark, but my own experience and this is just personal experience is the place where I ended up the most. That is really the one that I, I, I want to be at his peace. Just peace. Peace, happy. Yeah. Peace. To me, peace is happiness at rest and happiness is kind of piece in motion.

Speaker 2:          01:24:08       You can convert peace to happiness anytime you want, but pieces what you want most of the time. That's interesting. You can convert peace to happiness and time you want. Yeah. If you're a peaceful person, anything you do will be happy activity. And by the way, being on social media, engaging in politics will not bring you peace. There's nothing less peaceful. Right. And today's Day and age, the way we think you get peace is by resolving all their external problems. But there's unlimited external problems. So the only way to actually get pieces on the inside by giving up this idea of problems, who thinks you can get piece by resolving external problems other than politicians, everybody. That's what everybody is struggling to do. Right? Why are you trying to make money to solve all your money problems while you're trying to win it politics? Cause then you'll be at peace because your people will have one.

Speaker 2:          01:24:57       It's a daunting task to get your shit together. It's easier to change yourself and to change the world. That's true. And the best way to change the world is to change yourself. Exactly. It's all, yeah, it's all these people who are shouting on social media. The best way is just to actually live the life that you want other people to live. Uh, like I went down to New Zealand and there's this guy that I met with and uh, you know, everyone's on social media shouting about environmentalism and conserve and sustain. And I go to this guy's house and he was doing a very quietly, very gently, he was doing a two week long, a zero waste experiment where he was throwing out nothing. So every package that he opened he would keep and he would like clean it up so he could keep his Amazon boxes.

Speaker 2:          01:25:40       You'd keep the look and handed him a tea bag. If he opened a tea bag he has to figure out how to compost the tea inside, how to make the tea itself useful, how to make the tea bag like a little storage item so there was no trash. He was literally living with zero trash waste and he was doing it and it was really inspirational. Meeting people like him made me far more environmentally conscious than you know any amount of people yelling at me on social media ever will. How long did he do that for? I think it was two weeks. It was hard. What the fuck are you going to do with tea bags? He had quite the collection was filling them with little things. Yeah. Sounds like you're crazy hoarder, like a hoarder person stacks a tea bags in his house for a pretty impressive guy.

Speaker 2:          01:26:19       Yeah, that's a strange way to go about things. I, I appreciated that. I mean look, it is entirely possible to somehow or another engineer, all of our cups and all of our things and all are about to be biodegradable. If you know the struggle with the modern environmental movement is that they identify the correct problem, which is finite earth spaceship. This is all we got. Don't ruin it. But they don't have the solution. So what they say is no growth, no growth, no growth on. The problem is you got 3 billion Indian and Chinese who aren't going to stay in poverty. They're going to grow whether you like it or not. So you can yell at them, you can scream at them, you can yell at us and scream at us. But that's not going to happen. So the only way out unfortunately is again, through technology, which is you have to build green technology.

Speaker 2:          01:27:05       And I give Musk a lot of credit for being one of the few people who's out there trying to do that. So you build things that are biodegradable and good for you and healthier and everybody wants to be healthier in Chinese, want to be healthier. India's want to be healthier, they want to be cleaner. If you say, I can clean up your rivers, I can clean up your forests, I can have your children not get sick with cholera and diphtheria, typhoid, I can cure your diseases. That can help make your immune system stronger. I can give you clean drinking water. Like that is what causes people to become environmentalists, not shouting and screaming at them that they shouldn't grow and they should stop pumping things into the sky. And you know, they have no concept of that. They're just trying to get out of poverty.

Speaker 2:          01:27:44       So I think the modern environmental movement identifies the correct problem, but then doesn't come up with the right set of solutions that are appealing to people. People are not going to give up economic growth. They're going to have to get rich first. That's, yeah, that's a very good point. But how do you do, how do, how do you do both? You lower the price of cre, clean technologies massively. So you basically make clean technologies cost competitive through subsidy technologies. Innovation. Ideally you can subsidize in the short to medium term until the innovation curve is crossed. I mean, like Tesla doesn't have any patents, right? Right. Or they freely give away their patents. That's an example of how you can do it. Um, so you know, someone, if you want to get rid of plastic straws, yeah, you can do it here and there. You can get San Francisco to ban plastic straws, but China's not going to blend banned plastic straws.

Speaker 2:          01:28:35       Not until you build a paper Straw that is, you know, same cost, good durability, and then you in, and then you educate and Chinese like, Hey, this is petroleum. Uh, you know, this plastic that you're doing this patrolling. This is bad for you. Here's the chemical composition. Here's the things that are going in your bloodstream. And they want healthy, happy kids also. So they going to have their kids use paper straws. Maybe straws aren't the best example, but you can, you know, this is true with fossil fuels, for example, that's probably the best one. Or replacing a lot of plastics with glass and paper and so on.

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       Yeah, there's a new technology that was just Rhonda Patrick cut in on her Twitter today about they're, they're able to convert plastic waste into fuel and that there's companies that are actively trying to do that now. So then in that way, plastic waste will become valuable, right? And then it'll become a commodity and it becomes something that people are resource. Now there's certain problem

Speaker 2:          01:29:27       this doesn't solve, this doesn't solve carbon, this doesn't solve deforestation, you know, so there you kind of have to step in with other means. So for example, you look at the Amazon, right? Everyone's complaining about the Amazon being deforested. Well, you're not the poor Brazilian farmer, right? Right. So you're, you're sitting here in your comfortable chair, like social media, hammering away at, you know, the evil Brazilians for deforesting, the Amazon. But the Amazon has incredible resources. If we really care about it, we should turn it into an incredible tourist park. And put your money where your mouth is, start doing ecotourism and the Amazon started paying for it and then maybe take the future rights for all the pharmaceuticals that are going to come out of all the incredible plants there and start selling those off so that people, so that maybe give the pharmaceutical companies and incentive to preserve the biodiversity in the Amazon. Say, Hey, if you buy this patch of the Amazon, you consider that and you can serve it whatever plant medicines that come out of there that you can then license, you get the patent for 20 years or 30 years or whatever. So I think there are solutions where we as the first world who have money can put our money where our mouth is and go and rescue these kinds of properties.

Speaker 1:          01:30:31       That's a very interesting solution. But I could see immediate pushback from people that don't think the pharmaceutical companies should have the rights to this natural plant or the, or the government does it and then the government gets the patents and the government, we'll auction off the patents later or they'll worse or the license them or whatever it is. Right. The often like just this, the often the problem is there is no really good solution. There's a bunch of solutions that also have drawbacks. That's life. Yes. That's the trade offs as being humans. Very messy.

Speaker 2:          01:31:04       Yeah. It's a constraint environment. Obviously I skew more towards a private property capitalist type solutions because even though they're not perfect, they had been proven to actually work. Right. When something is your property, you take care of it, right. You're not gonna, you're not going to crap all over your own house. Um, but it should probably be temporary property, not permanent property. You see a lot of countries in the world and not doing this, no foreign ownership of land thing, for example. Or Mexico has no private ownership of beaches. Right. So you can draw the line at certain points.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       [inaudible] yeah. Do you enjoy doing this kind of thing where you break things down and give your perspective on things and try to illuminate certain complex objects? I'm not, I'm not trying to eliminate so much as

Speaker 2:          01:31:48       you know, talking to you. I learn as much as I say, and I learned it from myself because I'm being forced to articulate it. I can sit around and think my thoughts all day, but it's a lot of, it's going to be nonsense. It's not, I'm going to, cause there are gaps in thinking where you make leaps because you're kind to yourself that you don't realize you're making. But when you're forced to write it down, and this is why I tweet or when you have to talk to somebody, you have to complete those gaps and make it a proper logical chain. And the mistake that I made when I was young was, you know, I always want to seem like the smartest kid in the room. Uh, you know, like, just like you probably want to seem like the funniest kid in the room where the toughest kid in the room, right?

Speaker 2:          01:32:27       We're all losers starting out. We want to be winners. So we picked the thing we're good at and we doubled down on it. So I always want to be the smartest kid in the room. So what did I do? I read a lot of books, I memorize a lot of things and then whatever I hadn't memorized as pre pre-google I made it up. So that sounded good. Pre-Google after Google fact checking started and I had to get better, right? So Google improve me that way. A lot of people. Exactly. So now what I realize is that the biggest mistake was memorization, right? Because when you're actually trying to live your life in Congress with reality, you, you want to have a deep understanding of what you do and why you do it. And so it's much more important to know the basics really well there is to know the advanced.

Speaker 2:          01:33:08       Knowing Calculus wouldn't help you today. It doesn't help you in business, doesn't help you in most things. But knowing arithmetic, really what will help you really, whether it's at the corner grocery store counting change to figuring out the value of your podcast business, to figuring out how to do the probability math on you know, some action that you want to take. So understanding basic mathematics cold is way more important than memorizing calculus concepts. And the problem is, and this is true of, I think all reasoning, it's much better to know the basics from the ground up. Solid Foundation of understanding of steel frame, of understanding that it is to just have a scaffolding. We just memorizing advanced concepts. This is why there are a lot of people I'm sure that you listen to who are really smart. They use a lot of jargon and you can't quite follow their reasoning.

Speaker 2:          01:33:50       You don't know how they're putting things together and you're this deep down suspicion. They don't even really understand, right? So if you look at the, the the most powerful thinkers, especially the ones where money or life is on the line, they have to understand the basics really, really well. Richard Fineman, the famous physicist, was able to, he had this piece in one of his lectures where he takes you from counting numbers on your hand all the way to calculus in four pages of texts that orally but written down it's four pages of text and it's a complete unbroken logical chain that takes you through geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, analytic geometry, graphs, everything, all the way to calculus. He understood numbers at a core level. He didn't have to memorize anything. When you're memorizing, it's an indication that you don't understand. You should be able to read, derive anything on the spot.

Speaker 2:          01:34:39       And if you can't, you don't know it. So do you apply that to things other than mathematics and everything? Everything. Everything. You don't even make attempt to memorize things. Just make an attempt to understand them. You can't help but memorize things. But if you can't, and this is where Twitter is great for me as I try to understand, and then I tried to write it down in such a way that I could remember it. Just the basic hook that'll point towards the deeper understanding. And I'm forced to explain it to people and that's how I know I understand something. So this is what I meant originally. We talked about reading a good book. I'll read one page in the night and then I'd spend the rest of the night thinking about it. Or I'm chasing down references and Wikipedia or weird blog posts trying to understand it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:21       Um, you know, so for example, there was a, I was dealing with, this is a few months back, I was dealing with a question of stupid topic, but the meaning of life, right? Let's see. How could that be stupid though? Well, it's trite, it's trite. You're not supposed to think about it. It's something you ask your parents when you're young, they tell you don't worry about it. Are they still get the job? Exactly. Good job. You fricking hippie. Or here's God. God is the meaning of life, right? Yeah. And so I was just trying to resolve for myself. Like what could the answer be right? Not what is the answer, but what could the answer be? And so at a core level, I was forced to kind of hunting down all these weird little things and really understand for myself, and it's gotta be personal, right? But as they established for myself what it could and could not be, and that gave me some level of peace.

Speaker 2:          01:36:06       So now I don't have to keep asking that question of what is the meaning of why, uh, I mean you, you sh I think the question is more interesting than the answer. Everyone should explore this on their own, but let me just explore a few parts with you, right? Okay. So first is if I gave you an answer, if I said the meaning of life is to please God. Well, which God, okay. Judeo Christian God. Well, okay, why that one? Why this thing? The problem is it's a why question. You can keep asking why forever, right? Any answer I give you, you'll just ask why again? Why again, again, that's right. And you end up in a place called a grip as trilemma. Okay. This is a philosophical exercise, but I kind of thought it through. Then Google around and there's a thing called a grip as trilemma and a grip was trauma says that any questioning like this, why will always end in one of three places.

Speaker 2:          01:36:57       Okay? First is infinite regress, right? Why? Because of this, why that and just keep going forever. The second is circular reasoning. Well, a why a cause? It'd be, well, why beat because of a fight to get trapped in that. Or the third is an axiom and the most popular axiom is God, but it could be anything cause of math because the science, because the big bang, because the simulation, right? These are all axioms. These are all just stopping points. Saying simulation we're in a simulation or saying is the big bang is just another way of saying God. It's just God's a dirty word. So we don't use it as much anymore. But same thing. So you end up in one of these three dead ends essentially. Right? So there is no answer. Uh, the real answer is because what is the meaning of life? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:37:41       You get to make up your own answers. The beauty. If there was a single answer, we would not be free. We will be trapped because then we would all have to live to that answer. Then we'd be bored like robots, each one competing with each other to fulfill that single more than the others. Back to signaling like I'm better at it than you are. But luckily there is no answer. So you just do whatever you want. The meaning of life. It's funny that that w w that's the basis of all existential angst that you don't, you don't know why you're here and you have this feeling that it could be meaning less. It is. I mean if you, when you start pondering the, the multiverse, the universe, the galaxies, solar system, the planet, the organism, the cells inside the organism, the bacteria, the parasites, the symbiotic relationship we have to our environment.

Speaker 2:          01:38:37       And you start going, Jesus Christ, what am I? Just a little piece of this thing? It's like, well, the answers to all the great questions are paradoxes. Yeah. So for example, you're asking like, do I matter? That's like really the question you asked, right? Well, how do I matter in this infinite universe? Well, you know, on the one hand you're separate. No two points are the same. Every point is every two points are infinitely different. You're completely separated. No one will have your thoughts, your emotions, your feelings, your experience. So your life as a single player game. You're trapped inside your head and you're just aware of a bunch of things going on. And that's it. On the other hand, I cannot say the word Joe Rogan without invoking the entire universe. Joe Rogue alien comes along, says, what's that Joe Rogan? What's Joe Rogan Rogan's a human. What's a human bipedal ape?

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       What's an ape on the earth? What's the Earth Planet? What's a planet solar system where it was the carbon made inside starts, right and says, I have to create the entire universe to just say the words Joe Rogan. So in that sense, you're connected to everything. It's inseparable. So the answer to that question of do I matter is I am nothing and I am everything. And you'll find this with all the great questions. The answers are all paradoxes, which is why at some level it's sort of pointless to pursue them to find a trite answer like I'm giving, but the act of pursuing them is actually really useful because then it gives you certain intrinsic understanding in your life that brings a level of peace. I feel like there's with many people, this stress of this question is also accentuated by unhappy lives. It's unsexy accentuated by unhappy choices, by being trapped.

Speaker 2:          01:40:11       There's a big difference between not knowing what the meaning of life is and God, I gotta get the fuck out of this job. I have to, I can't live my life this way. What's the meaning of life? If this is my life, which is why I always start with let's get you rich first. That's why very practical about it, because look, you know, Buddha was a prince, okay? He started out really rich and then he got to go off in the woods. In the old days, what happened was if you want it to be peaceful inside, you would become a monk. You would renounce everything. You'd become an aesthetic. You would give everything up. You renounce women, men, you'd renounce children, you do announce money, you renounce politics, science, technology, everything. And you would go out in the woods by yourself, you to give everything up to be free inside.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Well today we have this wonderful invention called money or you can just store stuff up in her bank account. Okay? And you can basically save, you can, you can work really hard, you can do great things for society and society will give you money for giving it things that it wants and it doesn't know how to get. And then you can save that up and you can live well below your means and you can find a certain freedom in that and that will give you the time and the energy to pursue your own internal peace and happiness. So I believe the solution to making everybody happy is to give them what they want. Let's get them all rich, let's get them all fit and healthy and then let's get them all happy is are those things even possible? Can absolutely. Everyone can be written, everyone can be recovery.

Speaker 2:          01:41:35       Here's my thought exercise for now. It seems like we're in an infomercial. Everyone can be really not selling any my home, this is my Rolls Royce. Yeah, so, so that's a good point. So everything that I've ever created on this topic of how to make money, I will never charge a dollar for because that would ruin it. That would show that I'm just another huckster who's trying to get rich off of you. There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just somebody else trying to get rich off of you. Right. So it's, so to me it's more of a philosophical contribution where for it to have meeting and to be legit, I can't charge you anything for it. But yes, everybody can be rich. And let me give you a thought exercise. Okay. Imagine if tomorrow we could wave a wand and everybody was trained as a scientist or an engineer.

Speaker 2:          01:42:19       Everybody, even if you weren't very good, you had enough understanding of computer. Did you write some code and you can build some hardware and don't tell me people can't do it because they can. That's just the attorney of soft expectations. That's just you looking down on somebody else, they can do it. They just have to be educated. Now, if they're educated all as hardware, software engineers, scientists, biologists, technicians, hard sciences, not the social sciences. We would all be done within five years. Robots would be doing everything from cleaning toilets to cooking food to flying airplanes and driving Uber's and what would we be doing? We would be doing all creative jobs to entertain each other and researching science and technology. We will have wonderful lives. So it is really just a question of education. Nothing else. Is this a scale issue though? I mean you're talking about it as if this would work with 300 million people, it will work with 10 billion people.

Speaker 2:          01:43:07       It will work. This space fairing race with 100 trillion people. Just we have the resources, we have the ability. The Universe is infinite resources. You build it, you know, have you heard of a Dyson sphere? You know, you pull the Dyson sphere on a star and you gather all its energy like that. There's so much energy out there. One asteroids got all the minerals that we need. One son, one solar system has got all the power we will need for a long, long time. Uh, you know, we can extract it of nuclear fusion. You know, we're, we're not that far from those kinds of technologies working. Uh, it's just a question of gut and, uh, you know, an interest like we should be building nuclear fusion test plants on the moon. The moon should be littered with F. It's no downside, right? Yeah. If you could, how would that work?

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       Is send a bunch of people up there to work on. The problem with robots, the problem with fishing nuclear fission is that, you know, nature creates energy through nuclear energy, right? Like the sun creates energy, nuclear energy. Now for transmission reviews, photons, because photons don't interact. And so photons are great for information transmission, but they're actually not great for energy transmission for energy creation. You want nuclear to work. And the problem is because nuclear energy, you know, we built it with a bomb. We have dirty nukes, all those kinds of problems with Fukushima, three mile island, Chernobyl, we don't innovate anymore. Nukes. Imagine if when the first steam engine blew up, we said, oh no more steam engines for awhile, or very carefully regulated billion dollars a regulation. You can't innovate that way. When the first airplane crashed, we said no more innovation in airplanes. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:44:41       So we need a way to iterate on nuclear efficient and eventually fusion and get them working safely, cleanly, passive, say failure, etc. If we're going to find our way out of the energy trap and the best place to do that is someplace like on the moon or Mars, do you think that it's actually a possibility that they could get nuclear power to the point where it's not a detriment? Because when everyone's worried about is a meltdown, right? Yeah. And we do have these old plants that are running, that are running on this. This is 50 year old technology. It's crazy cause they, there's no ability to shut them off, right? Very old technology. They do now have gen four nuclear reactors that are passive, fail safe. So in other words, when they fail, they fail until you pull the plug on them. They fell into a state where there's no leakage, there's no problem.

Speaker 2:          01:45:27       There are default is a positive outcome as opposed to the current ones, the old ones where if you unplug them like, and these, even these gen four or just gen four, they're not gen five, gen 80, gen hundred where we are microprocessors. Right? And that should be something that people are working towards. I hope so. I mean, in an ideal world we would do that. The problem is if you have nuclear energy on the moon, how do you get at home? Right? So what you actually got to do is you've got to read it on the moon and you're using it there maybe to launch more satellites, more rockets further out into the solar system. And that's the initial use case. Um, but then eventually the technology gets so good you can bring it home. Now I want to go back to this idea of getting people rich that somehow or another that's going to make people happy.

Speaker 2:          01:46:09       How do you stop that? The, the natural progression that people have of, you know, Oh, you know, I have got a nice Chevrolet. Yeah, but I really want to BMW. I've got a nice BMW, but now I want a Mercedes. I have mercy. I want to for Ron. Yeah. How do you stop that material possession trap? Because you can't at some level. But I think most smart people over time realize that possessions don't make them happy. It's just you have to go through that and you have to buy your stupid car to realize that it doesn't attract attractive girls that actually just attracts other dudes who are like, Hey, I like that car, man. Right? Like, like you have some expensive out there, some fancy cards. Tell me how you know how much that attracts women versus men. Well, I'm married. Those are for me.

Speaker 2:          01:46:55       I just enjoy machines. Yeah. So let me their toys. That's a particular thing where you enjoy machines. But I think as you get older, you just realize that there's no happiness in material possessions. Now, lack of material possessions can make you very unhappy. So being poor can make you unhappy. But being rich is not gonna make you happy. And what happens. Unfortunately, a lot of people struggle through their whole lives to make money. They make some, they were exhausted and then they're like, well now why am I not happy? I guess I'm just not a happy person and smart people aren't happy. That's like a great little way to, people feel better about it. They say, well, if you're smart, you're not happy. Right? Whereas I positively, other way, if you're smart, you should be able to figure out how to be happy. Otherwise you're not that smart.

Speaker 2:          01:47:37       Yeah. That is an offensive statement that if you're smart, you're not happy. I've heard that before and I just do not understand the logic of that other than self justifying. I understand where it comes from. It comes from if you're smart, it's usually cause you thought things through and you are very busy mind and so busy mind can often rob you have peace of mind because when the piece that we seek is not peace of mind, it's piece from mind. Right? So if you look at all the crazy activities you do to be happy, right? Whether it's like trying to get laid and have an orgasm or extreme sports or looking at something beautiful or taking a psychedelic. You're trying to get out of your own mind. You're trying to get your monkey mind to stop chattering at you for a moment. You're trying to get peace from the mind and there are other better ways to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:48:23       Most of the ways we try to get peace from mind, our indirect, um, whereas if you understand things, if you see things properly, you will naturally slowly develop piece from mind. Sorry if I went on a tangent there. No, it's a good tangent. It's a good tangent because I think oftentimes the pursuit is what's thrilling to people and the possibility that one day they'll be able to rest and that they'll reach this goal. That's the fundamental delusion that there is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever. Yeah. Golden years there is, it's called death. Oh, I'll take care of everything. That's the great leveler. But when people look at, particularly social media was bring it back to that. When you see someone who, you know, you see them posed in front of their mansion there, beautiful car and they're leaning against it with their designer clothes on, they're expensive. Watch you. Ah, I want that. That's what I want. What you really want is freedom. You want freedom from your money problems. And I think that's okay. So people, once someone can solve their money problems either by lowering their lifestyle or by making enough money, uh, and you know, essentially what you want to get everybody to the retirement but not retirement and the, I'm 65 years old sitting in a nursing home collecting a check retirement, different definition. Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          01:49:50       Mm. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:49:52       Today is complete in an of itself. You're retired and so how do you get there? Well, one is you can have so much money saved up that just your passive income off of that without your having to lift a finger coverage, your burn rate, keep your burn rate low, right? A second is you just drive your burn rate down to zero. You become a monk. A third is you're doing something you love, you enjoy it so much. It's not about the money. So there are multiple ways to that path. But the most common is people just say, I need to make more money. And the kind of wealth creation that I talk about is about creating timeless principles and adapting yourselves that making money won't be an issue and you can do it by doing what you love, right? Like we get into this model of I must work for other people, work my way up the ladder.

Speaker 2:          01:50:35       Uh, I must like do what that person is doing to make money. But really today in society, you get rewarded for creative work, for creating something brand new that society didn't even know yet that it wanted, that doesn't know how to get other than through you. So the most powerful moneymakers are actually individual brands. People like yourself or elan or Kanye or Oprah or Trump, right? These are individual brands, eponymous name brands who themselves are leveraged. Like you're leveraged. You have podcasts, media going out to everybody that's leveraged the podcast work for you and you sleep. They have knowledge that nobody else has, which is your knowledge is the knowledge of being Joe Rogan. I mean, who else is a UFC fighter and a commentator and a podcaster and a comedian and you know, interested in all these things and knows all these people can't replace you.

Speaker 2:          01:51:20       Um, so we have to pay you what you're worth. And was I never fought in UFC though. Oh you did? Okay. Sorry. Um, or you know, your, whatever you're, you're, you're involved in that whole scene. You just have a unique set of skill sets. Um, so because of this unique, what I call a specific knowledge, because of the accountability that you have with your name, because the leverage that you have through your media, your money making machine, you're, I'm sure at this point I could make you start over tomorrow, wipe out your bank card. You'd be rich again, no time. Because you have all the skillsets. So once people have those skill sets and the beauty is, the way you've done it is you don't have any competition. There's no substitution. If Joe Rogan were to disappear off the air tomorrow, it's not like random podcasts and number 12 with step in and fill that thing.

Speaker 2:          01:52:02       No, it's just gone. So the way to get out of that competition trap is actually to be authentic. The way to retire is actually to find the thing that you know how to do better than anybody. And you know how to do that better name because you love to do it. No one can compete with you if you love to do it. Be Authentic and then figure out how to map that to what society actually wants. Apply some leverage, put your name on it so you take the risks, but you gain the rewards, have ownership and equity in what you do and then just crank it out.

Speaker 1:          01:52:30       I think people have to be very careful to not get trapped along the way with things that you can afford with your current lifestyle, like the way you're living in the way you're earning, but they're also imprisoning you and the fact that you are now to have to work this

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       40 hour week job in order to get this thing that you can afford, but now you are saddled down to this job. You've no, you're not saving, you're not, you're not putting things in a, in a good place and you're working for these things. Working for things as rewards is a real trap that a lot of people fall into. It's the biggest one. Let's see, until I've also says that, uh, you're under two great addictions, heroin in a monthly salary and that's why you can't get rich renting out your time because you know, when you start charging more and more for your time, it's a slow upgrade loop and then you upgrade your house at the same time you have in your car at the same time you move in the neighborhood. You really also have to get used to ignoring your peers or upgrading or changing the definition of your peers.

Speaker 2:          01:53:30       There are a lot of, a lot of people here who are poor here, but there'll be rich if they were living in Thailand and Bali, and if they have the luxury of a remotely doable job, they may want to be living there and saving up money. But the ignoring the peers is an issue because the keeping up with the Jones, this is a real phenomenon. Yeah. And makes the world go around. Yeah. And then there's this other thing that people have to avoid, even allowing their mind to think when they're hearing what you're saying and all this logical, fantastic advice. There's these six dirty words that's easy for you to say. Yeah. That is a terrible trap. And look, I grew up as a first generation immigrant in Jamaica, Queens, uh, with zero money, single mom, two kids working day and night, go to school.

Speaker 2:          01:54:19       Uh, you know, I washed dishes. Uh, I was [inaudible] catering jobs, I was mowing lawns. I was working since the age of 11 on and off here and there, um, didn't have 2 cents to rub together, you know, uh, I had to borrow $400 to go to college, like literally a short $400 to 400. I had to find $400. I didn't have it. Uh, you know, got rejected from a job at Dunkin donuts. So like, okay. It's not to say that it's easy, it's not easy. It's actually really fricking hard. It is the hardest thing you will do. But it's also the rewarding thing. You know, look at the kids who are born rich, no meetings, their lives, you're terrible place. Yeah, you're real. You're real resume is just a cataloging of all your suffering. If I were to ask you to describe your real life to yourself, when you look back on your deathbed, you're going to go back and say, what are the interesting things I've done?

Speaker 2:          01:55:11       And it's all going to be around the sacrifices that you've made in the hard things that you did. Anything you were given, doesn't matter. You know, you, you have your four limbs, you have your brain, you have your head, you have your skin yet. So that's all from granted. So you have to do hard things anyway to create your own meaning in life. Um, making money as a fine one. Yes. Struggle. It is hard. I'm not gonna say it's easy. It's a really hard, but the tools are all available. It's all there. There's also this, these traps that people sort of establish in their own mind of giving themselves excuses or giving themselves in unsurmountable obstacles, insurmountable d paths, terrain mentality. Yeah. It's somebody else's fault. That's my skin color's fault. It's the system's fault. Yeah. Those people are sinking. I feel bad for them.

Speaker 2:          01:55:57       I want to shake them out of it and say, actually, you can get out of it. You just have to stop thinking. It's everybody else. I'll do the perspective. Yeah. It's so difficult for people to do. It's one of the most difficult things for people to do is to change the way they approach approach reality itself. At the end of the day. I do think even despite what I said earlier, life is really a single player game. It's all going on in your head. You know, whatever you think you believe will very much shape your reality, both from what risks you take and what actions you perform, but also just everyday experience of reality. If you're walking down the street and you're judging everyone, you're like, I don't like that person because their skin color. I don't like that. Oh, she's, she's not attractive. That guy's fat. This person's a loser.

Speaker 2:          01:56:39       Oh, who put this in my way? You know, the more you judge, the more you're gonna separate yourself and you'll feel good for an instant because you'll feel good about yourself. I'm better than that, but then you're going to feel lonely and then you just gonna see negativity everywhere. The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgements to a tree. There's no concept of right or wrong or good or bad, right? You're born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences and stimulations and lights and colors and sounds. And then you die. And how you choose to interpret that is up to you. You do have that choice. So this is what I meant, that happiness is a choice. If you believe it's the choice, then you can start working on it. And I can't tell you how to find it because it's their own conditionings that are making you unhappy.

Speaker 2:          01:57:21       So you have to uncondition yourself. It's just like I can't fix your eating habits for, you can give some general guidelines, but you got to go through the heart habit forming of how to eat right. But you have to believe it's possible and it is absolutely possible. I was miserable. I'm happy as a clam and it's not just the money I got there before the money. You got happy before the money? Mostly. Yeah. How did you get happy before the money? I started getting older. You know, I just realized like life is short. I'm going to die again. Try it. Right. Try It, try anyways. Yeah. Well, Confucius had a great saying that, uh, you know, every man has two lives and the second starts when he realizes he has just one.

Speaker 4:          01:57:57       Ah,

Speaker 2:          01:57:59       and I read that it was one of those book dropping lines. You know, it's like Mike drop. Confucius had a lot of microbes. Confucius was a bad motherfucker. He was, that's a crazy one. That was a great one. Um, or another one is next time you get sick, you know, cause everybody gets sick every now and then. It's like a happy person once 10,000 things, a sick person just once. One thing, right? So it's your, it's your unlimited desires that are clouding your piece, your happiness have desires. You are biological creature that stands up and says, I can do something. I move, I resist, I live. But just be very careful of your desires. This is the oldest most trade wisdom. Desire is suffering. That's what it means, right? Every desire you have is an access where you will suffer. So just don't focus on more than one desire to time. The Universe is rigged in such a way that if you just want one thing and you focus on that, you'll get it. But everything else you gotta let go.

Speaker 1:          01:58:53       Did you make a gradual shift to happiness or was it a radical change? It's ongoing. It's gradual. Everyday. You're happier today than you were a month ago. Yeah. Allegedly. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very happy these days deliriously, so it's actually a hard for me to hang out with normal people. Really. Yeah. So you, you've made a significant shift over the period of like how many years? Eight years. Eight years, yeah. Wow. And is this something that you've pursued through certain books or is it just like you, you've made an understanding or gained an understanding in your own mind and then started pursuing it based on, I don't understand that.

Speaker 2:          01:59:33       Yeah, it's very, very personal. Uh, it's basically, you have to decide it's a priority. And then I tried every hack I possibly could. I used to, you know, I tried all the, I tried meditation, I tried witnessing, uh, you know, I even tried an Ssri just to see what it would feel like. How did it feel? Uh, it was, it turned me from a pessimist or an optimist, but I didn't like the physical side effects and all that. I want to be in a drug for sustained basis. So I dropped it and I felt it turn you into an optimist. Yes. At the time I used to be a pessimist. Yeah. Um, I started doing things like I would start looking at the, uh, you know, in every moment and everything that happens, you can look on the bright side of something. Right. And so I used to do that forcibly and then I trained it until it became second nature.

Speaker 2:          02:00:14       So for example, like a friend of my wife's was over and she, when we were dating and she took all these photos, she took like hundreds of photos and then she sends them all to us. And my immediate reaction was like, why are you dumping hundreds of photos on my phone? I don't need a hundreds of photos, have some judgment. That was my immediate reaction. And then I could say actually how nice of her, she sent me hundreds of photos I could pick. The one that I like, right? There are two ways of seeing almost everything. There are a few things that are like high suffering. So you can't do that other than just saying, well, this is a teacher, right? But I slowly worked through every negative judgment that I had until I saw the positive and not second nature to me. I also realized that like what you want is you want to clear minds.

Speaker 2:          02:00:53       You want to let go of thoughts, happy thoughts disappeared. I had automatically very easy to let go of them. Negative thoughts linger. So we interpret the neck, the positive and everything. Very quickly. You let it go, right? You let it go much faster. Um, simple hacks. Get more sunlight, right? Learn to smile more, learn to hug more. These things actually released serotonin and reverse. They aren't just outward signals of being happy. They're actually feedback loops to being happy. Um, spend more time in nature. You know, these are obvious. Watch your mind. Watch your mind all day long. Watch what it does, not judge it and not try to control it. But you can meditate. 24 seven meditation is not a sit down close your eyes, activity meditation is just basically watching your own thoughts. Like you would watch anything else in the outside world and say, why am I having that?

Speaker 2:          02:01:39       Does that serve me anymore? Is that conditioning from when I was 10 years old? Like for example, getting ready for this podcast. You got Ready? I didn't but good. I did, but I did. But I did. But you couldn't help it. And what happened was the few days leading up to this, my mind was just running. And normally my mind is pretty calm and it was just running and running and running. And every thought I would have, I would imagine me saying it to you, my brain couldn't help but rehearse what it's doing is just rehearsing all the time to talk to you. And then I was even rehearsing, rehearse, telling you about the rehearsal, right? So it was all playing all these Meta games and I was just like, shut up, stop it. What is going on? And it took me a while to figure out, oh yeah, you know what it is.

Speaker 2:          02:02:23       When I was a kid in queens and I had no money and I had nothing and I need to save myself. The way I got out was by sounding smart, not being smart, sounding smart. That was the skill I perfected. So I am hardwired to always rehearse things so I will sound smart. It's a disease that keeps me from being happy so but when you see that, when you realize that when you understand something then it naturally calms you down. So after that I stop rehearsing as much, but it's still a train habit. That is

Speaker 1:          02:02:55       really interesting point that you want to sound smart that that many people do that and especially young people and it's you. You see someone who is smart or someone who appears smart, they say smart things. You kind of want to sound smart. I want people to think about me the same way I think about that person,

Speaker 2:          02:03:13       that that is my disease. That is my feeling is what clutters my mind. I, the the thing I have to ask myself now is if I can, would I still be interested in learning this thing if I couldn't ever tell anybody about it? Uh, that's how I know it's a real, that's how I know it's something I actually want to know.

Speaker 1:          02:03:29       Common thing though, I know I suffered from that when I was young. The desire to sound smart,

Speaker 2:          02:03:36       that's very, very common. All of us start out. You know, every, everything. You're the winner now in your life. You were to you. It's because you are a loser. At some point, if you had gotten all the girls, if you had all the money, if you had everything you want, you're a good looking. And in junior high or high school, uh, you wouldn't have done anything with your life and you would have peaked early. It's like the Bruce Springsteen glory days song, right? You would have married your high school sweetheart. You'd be living in your home town. You know, you'd be a manager at the local Mcdonald's, whatever that first dream job you had. Thank God we didn't all get what we wanted when we were young. Right. Right. Or we would be trapped in that. So you have to be able to break out of where you came from. I don't know where I was going.

Speaker 1:          02:04:20       That is interesting too about people who peaked too early. Yeah. Or maybe those people that peak too early can do the Ilan Mustang and just abandon it and start something new and then learn the, the joys of sucking at something.

Speaker 2:          02:04:33       Yeah, and actually the, in our professions, especially when you're high visibility, the problem with Peking is that you then get drowned in, in death of a thousand cuts. People have expectations of you. Hey Joe, can you come to my event? Hey Joe, can you look at my business plan? Hey Joe can give me advice on this. Can you talk to my friend? Can you come in as podcast? You're just being assaulted all the time with inbound opportunities. So you have no time to start over with anything. So you have to ruthlessly ruthlessly disappoint everybody. Eliminate and clear your schedule, drop all the meetings, not even respond to the emails. The only way you're gonna be able to start over with anything.

Speaker 1:          02:05:09       Yeah, and I, we've talked about this and I'd love your approach to meetings that if they're not life or death, I'm the same way. I avoided a good one recently, and this was someone that was just tracking me down as a high profile person in a big organization. And I'm like, can we just talk on the phone? And then we talked on the phone list. There was nothing to say. It was just they wanted to get me in the office and

Speaker 2:          02:05:33       yeah, meeting hardly be phone calls. Phone calls should be emails and emails should just be texting. Right. Many of them, right. With meetings. I mean, I, I despise meetings. I used to own the domain. I don't do coffee.com I eventually had to go, but I used to respond from the violet. I don't do coffee, you know? Oh, that's hilarious. It was a little bit of a jerk move, but it really, what it comes from is when I was young, one of my principals was I knew I had to make money. It was my overwhelming desire. And, uh, one of the things I did was I said, okay, I'm never going to be worth more than what I think I'm worth. Okay. No one's gonna pay me more than what I think I'm worth. So what am I worth? So I picked an hourly rate for myself that I was worth.

Speaker 2:          02:06:10       And I said, I'm never going to squander my time for less than this. So if originally is 500 bucks an hour, then I upgrade the 5,000 bucks an hour. And you know, it's ludicrous. But pick an aspirational hourly rate, aspirational. It has to be a little ludicrous. And then what I would do is if I have to return something, I'm standing in line to return something and it's below my hourly rate, I'll throw it away if I have to, if I, or give it away. If I have to do some tasks and I can hire somebody to do it for less than my hourly rate, I would hire them. And so I just became extremely jealous of my time. Which doesn't mean you can't have fun rest leisure, spending time with your friends and family. That's all great. Don't count that. But if you're doing anything you don't want to do, which is the definition of work, it's a set of things that you have to do that you don't want to do if you're working it better be for your hourly rate otherwise don't do the work.

Speaker 2:          02:07:00       And so once it came out of that, then I just realized the cost of meetings, a costume meetings is so high, especially given all the people who are in their right, one person's talking, seven people listening, you're literally just dying an hour at a time. So you have to just drop nonurgent meetings or figure how to be more efficient with them if you're going to do anything great. The extreme example is business travel. Getting on a plane to fly halfway around the world for one meeting, which never amounts to anything. And then like wasting your whole little life there and then flying back. So about five years ago I resolved. I am never going to travel for business. Wow. And I haven't traveled for business since. I only travel if the travel experience will be so entertaining, enjoy us because I have friends or it's a place I want to see or whatever that it will be complete in and of itself because I know that whatever the business meeting it came from is, is never worth it.

Speaker 2:          02:07:52       Wow. And actually that principle applies larger than just travel. It applies to life in general. The this, one of the secrets to happiness is to really embrace what you're doing in that moment. That's trite. But where that, where that comes from is saying, I only want to do actions that are complete in and of themselves. Right. If I'm looking for some ulterior motive down the line is not going to materialize and, and if you think it is, maybe even if it does, it'll be very short lived. Anything you want in your life, whether it was a car or whether it was a girl over those money. When you got it a year later, you're back to zero. Your brain had had dynamically adapted to it and you're looking for the next thing.

Speaker 1:          02:08:33       That's a great statement. Had dauntingly adapted. That's that is what happens to people and you get accustomed to whatever it is. I realized that when I first got a new apartment, it was a nice apartment and after awhile I got used to it. I was like, oh, okay. Yeah, so just an apartment. It was just where I live. I'm used to, it's nice, but I'm used to it.

Speaker 2:          02:08:52       Yeah. We all go through this learning. It's it's, you know, it's riding the Ferris wheel of life. It's like you get at the bottom, you're like, oh, I want to get the top. This is so exciting. You divide it up, you get a little dopamine rush and get a little serotonin. Then you ride it back down is that wears off. Then you need another high. Then you write it back up and you write it back down. In fact, the more high as you get, the harder it gets to go around the wheel. More board. You get it in, the harder it goes to go back up.

Speaker 1:          02:09:15       So what lights your fire in now? Like what, what gets you motivated to do things and to act?

Speaker 2:          02:09:20       Art. Art. This is art. Oh, okay. Art Is this creativity. It's just anything that's done for its own sake. So what are the things that are done for their own sake? There's nothing beyond uh, loving somebody. Uh, creating something, playing art. To me, creating businesses play. I create businesses early stage cause it's fun cause I, I mean to the product, even when I invest, it's because I liked the people. I like hanging out with them. I learned from them. And I think the product is really cool. Um, so these days I will pass on all kinds of great investments because I'm like, I just, the product's not interesting. It's boring. I'm not gonna learn anything. That's a beautiful luxury. It is a luxury part and learning. Yeah, it is a luxury. These are not 100% or zero things, right? You can in your life start moving more and more towards that goal. It's a goal. When when I was younger, I used to be so desperate to make money that I would've done anything. Right. If you'd shown up and said, hey, I got a sewage trucking business and you're going to go into that. I was like, great, let's do it. I'm going to make money. Thank God no one gave me that opportunity. I'm glad that it went down the road of technology and science, which I genuinely enjoy. Uh, and so I got to combine my vocation, my avocation.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       I mean, what are you doing? You're playing, you're having fun, you're doing art. You're not, you're not working. No. That's what I always say when people say work hard. I'm like Sarda. No, not really. I'm always working, but it looks like work to them, but it feels like play to me and that's how I know no one can compete with me on it because I'm just playing 16 hours a day and if they want to compete with me and they're going to work, they're going to lose because they're not going to do it 16 hours a day, seven days a week. Well, listen, man, there are some gems of wisdom in this conversation in the, I hope people pull things out of this and apply them to their own life, and I'm certainly going to listen to you again and, and try to apply some of this to my own life stuff that I'm not already applying, but I really appreciate your time and I really appreciate you coming in here. Thanks for having me. And please tell people you do small little podcast is just the Navarro podcast, right? Yeah. Best way to find me is on Twitter, actually just at Nepal. Then I have a website at Nav dot. A L I have a youtube channel novel, and I have a podcast in the wall. That's it. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Bye everybody.
