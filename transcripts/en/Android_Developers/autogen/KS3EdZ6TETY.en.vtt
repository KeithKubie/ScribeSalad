 Our goal is to empower everyone in the world 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.420
 From learning a new language 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.430
 We achieve it through 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.300
 Provide high quality educational courses for users 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.700
 Designed in-house and equipped with conversations 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.354
 With speakers in the original language 

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.270
 So you learn a language 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.210
 It should be done with people who speak it 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 This is what users like about our app 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.300
 It is social interaction 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.282
 To date, more than 65 million people have used it 

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:35.150
 Application Busuu to learn language 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.870
 And four of the top five markets 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.790
 Markets for Android are for countries with emerging markets 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.181
 Turkey, Russia, Brazil and India 

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.680
 We realized that many emerging markets 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.490
 It has limited storage and memory capabilities and has a slow connection 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.760
 Internet or intermittent, so we started to offer more to support 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.330
 Users in those countries 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.510
 Network log is the first tool 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330
 We used it 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.440
 And we were able to reduce 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.300
 The amount of data being exchanged 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.260
 Because we were able to process some errors in the app icon 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.040
 The other tool we use is the Memory Analyzer, 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.190
 And by which we were able to ascertain 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.490
 Memory only includes the necessary content 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.520
 Without any unnecessary additions 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.550
 We offer language learning applications 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.986
 We allow the use of different languages ​​for the interface 

00:01:22.986 --> 00:01:25.490
 The Lint tool is great for us 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.950
 And by which we were able to ascertain 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.510
 Our data is complete and 100% 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.610
 While focusing on performance 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.940
 We noticed that the database is huge 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.970
 So we decided to get rid of the database 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.280
 And rely on Internet connection 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.660
 We were able to reduce the APK size from 60MB 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.750
 To 25 MB 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.890
 This was a great development for us 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.640
 We received more downloads from emerging markets 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.840
 And to continue our work on improving performance 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.530
 Average weekly ratings rose from 4.1 to 4.5 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.521
 It is the highest rating we have received 

00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:05.020
 It is the duties of every software developer 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.870
 Ensure compliance 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.360
 With all kinds of devices and all usage environments 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.030
 And using more tools to improve performance 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.689
 The life of the developer will be easier 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.480
 Performance is a key factor 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.840
 Can not be ignored or overlooked 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.500
 You have to make an effort 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.570
 To instill in the culture of business activity.
