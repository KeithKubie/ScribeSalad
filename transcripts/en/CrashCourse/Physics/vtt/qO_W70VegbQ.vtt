00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.280
One of the strangest ideas ever proposed in physics
was that light can be both a particle and a wave.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.860
And in 1923, a French physicist named
Louis de Broglie proposed an even more
radical extension of that idea:

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.500
What if the wave-particle duality didn’t
just apply to light?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.940
What if it applied to basically everything?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.300
What if all matter had a wave associated
with it?

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.520
Turns out, he was right.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.920
Applying the wave-particle duality to matter led to the
development of a way to analyze the behavior of tiny
particles more accurately than ever before.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.820
And it also helps us understand that there are
some things about the physics of the very small
that we'll never be able to describe accurately.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.540
I’m talking about uncertainty.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.350
I’m talking about how a thing can be in
more than one place at the same time.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.420
And, yes, I’m talking about a little cat
in a box.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:59.420
[Theme Music]

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.360
De Broglie was a big believer in the idea
that there’s symmetry in nature.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.700
His reasoning was that if light could
behave like both a particle and a wave,
then matter should do it too.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.680
What’s more, the math seemed to work out.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
Light’s momentum is equal to the Planck
constant divided by the light’s wavelength.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.160
So according to de Broglie’s proposal, the
same equation would hold true for matter –

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.700
meaning that you could find the wavelength of
any bit of matter as long as you knew its momentum.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.460
The easiest way to test this was by using
electrons.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280
Remember the double slit experiment?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.020
That was one of the key ways physicists showed
that light can behave like a wave.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.920
When you shoot rays of light through two slits,
they interfere with each other like waves,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.600
creating a certain, predictable pattern,
known as a diffraction pattern, on a screen
placed behind the slits.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.160
To see if matter could also behave like
a wave, physicists tried the same experiment,
but with a beam of electrons instead of light.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.480
They shot this beam of electrons at a plate with
two slits cut into it, with a screen behind the plate
that glowed wherever it was hit by an electron.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.580
And they found that the electrons created
a diffraction pattern, just like light did!

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.060
Meaning, the electrons were acting like waves
and interfering with each other!

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.120
This discovery was a really big deal.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.540
It showed that de Broglie was right – electrons
do behave like both waves and particles.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.420
And so does all other matter – atoms, molecules,
everything.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.150
So a ball flying through the air?

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.190
That has a corresponding wavelength.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.020
When you’re driving your car down the highway,
it has a wavelength.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.920
Even your body can have a wavelength.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.290
Which is just totally counter to the human
experience of the universe.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.060
But that’s quantum mechanics for you.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.100
By now, you’re probably wondering: if all objects
can have wavelengths, why don’t we see them?

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.840
Well, remember: the wavelength is equal to
Planck’s constant divided by the momentum.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.770
But Planck’s constant is a tiny number.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.280
And the larger the momentum, the tinier the
wavelength.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.000
For anything that’s big enough to see with the
naked eye, the wavelength is so small that there’s
no way we’d ever be able to detect it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.980
Take a baseball with a mass of 0.2 kilograms,
for example, flying through the air at 40.2
meters per second.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.820
The ball’s wavelength is equal to Planck’s
constant divided by its momentum.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.860
And its momentum is equal to its mass times
its velocity.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.540
So, to find the ball’s wavelength, you divide Planck’s
constant by the ball’s mass times its velocity,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.380
which comes out to a wavelength
of 8.24 x 10^-35 meters.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.060
In other words, to write out the fraction
of a meter that the wavelength is equal to,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.340
you’d have to write down a decimal point,
then 34 zeroes, then the numbers 824.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.020
Compare that to the radius of a hydrogen atom,
which is about 2.5 x 10^-11 meters.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.600
So the ball’s wavelength is unimaginably
small.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.340
We have no way to measure waves that tiny,
so you can’t see that your baseball is also a wave.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.240
But it is.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.600
A lot of quantum mechanics has to do with
the wave properties of matter – and probability.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.520
Let’s take a look at the double slit experiment
with electrons again.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.420
If you just let the electrons go through the
slits slowly, it sort of looks like they’re landing
on the screen in random spots.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.860
It’s only after a while that you start to notice the
diffraction pattern, because more electrons land in the
spots that correspond to the bright bands in the pattern.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.240
That’s because for electrons, and matter in
general, probability is a huge factor in how
they behave on the quantum level.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.460
When quantum mechanics looks at the wave
nature of matter, it’s mostly concerned with the
probability that particles,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.880
like electrons or even entire atoms or molecules,
will be in certain places at certain times.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.860
That probability is predicted by the wavefunction,
an equation that relates some of the properties of a
quantum mechanical system, like an electron or atom.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.020
The equation was developed by Austrian physicist
Erwin Schrödinger in the 1920s.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.300
There’s a lot of advanced calculus that
goes into actually using Schrödinger’s equation.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.420
But one of the main reasons the equation is useful
is that you can use it to predict the probability of
finding a particle at any given point in space,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.640
known as the probability density function.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.000
You know those electron clouds you’ll sometimes
see in models of atoms?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.580
Those show the probability of finding the
atom’s electrons in the space around the nucleus.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.000
They’re a graphical representation of the
probability density function –

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.120
meaning that the shapes of the clouds are
calculated using Schrödinger’s equation.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.040
One of the most intense debates in quantum
mechanics is about what it actually means for a
particle to have a probability density function.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.020
Say you have an electron in a box.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:09.380
The electron’s probability density function tells you
that at a given moment, there’s a certain probability that
the electron will be in various locations in the box.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.420
But if you opened the box to check where the
electron is, you’d see that it’s only in one specific spot.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.780
So, what does it mean that there’s a probability
of the electron being in a bunch of different places?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.720
Here’s where quantum mechanics gets weird
and counterintuitive again.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.880
Many physicists think that the electron is
never in a specific place, at least not until
you look at it.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.300
Instead, in a way it’s in all these different
places at once.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.140
But it’s still just one electron.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.940
Then, once you observe or measure the electron
in some way, it’s only in one place.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.740
Somehow, you measuring it forces the electron
to be in one spot.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.620
The idea that a particle can be in more than
one state at the same time is an example of
quantum superposition,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.980
and it’s the idea that Schrodinger was trying to explore
in his famous thought experiment with the cat.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.880
The thought experiment goes like this:

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.740
You have a cat in a box, with a device that
releases poison only when a radioactive atom decays.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.980
Quantum superposition says that as long as
you don’t know what state the atom is in

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.460
– and therefore whether the poison has been released
– the cat is both alive and dead at the same time.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.180
Schrodinger came up with this thought experiment
as a way to demonstrate that the idea was ridiculous

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.510
– and it IS ridiculous, but it’s
also probably accurate.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.080
It’s just one of those things that’s totally
counter to the way we experience the world.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.260
Now, let’s say you do measure an electron.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.640
There’s still going to be some uncertainty in
that measurement, because of something called
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.780
This principle says that no matter how
good your measuring instrument is,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.900
you can only know the position and
momentum of a particle, like that electron in a box,
up to a certain level of precision.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.340
After that, you could get a better measurement of
your electron’s position, but you’d have a much less
precise measure of its momentum.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.320
Likewise, you could get a better measurement
of the electron’s momentum, but then you’d have
to sacrifice some knowledge of its position.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.260
Why?

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.020
It has a lot to do with that whole wave versus
particle thing.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.140
Like we said earlier, a wave’s momentum is
just Planck’s constant divided by its wavelength.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.800
So, if you’re using the wavefunction to describe your electron as a wave, you can know its exact momentum.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.660
The problem is, that wave is spread out, with
no exact position.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.380
So by describing the electron in a way that
allows you to measure its momentum, you lose
the ability to measure its position.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.660
Now, you could try describing the electron
as a particle and get its position that way,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.040
but then you’d have a similar problem: the
equations involved wouldn’t allow you to measure
the electron’s momentum.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.360
So, quantum physicists try to make the best
of both worlds by describing things like electrons
using what’s known as a wave packet –

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.280
basically, a collection of waves all added together.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.300
They use Schrodinger’s equation to calculate different waves that describe a quantum mechanical system, like that electron you’ve been trying to measure.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.600
When all those different waves are added together,
you can get some idea of the electron’s position –

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.720
but you also end up with some uncertainty
when it comes to the electron’s momentum.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.420
So there’s a limit to how precisely you
can measure position and momentum combined.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:52.360
It turns out that there will always be an
uncertainty that’s at least equal to Planck’s
constant divided by 4 times pi.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.100
In a classical world, this uncertainty isn’t
that much of a big deal.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.280
If you’re measuring the width of your desk,
for example, the uncertainty is so tiny that
it isn’t going to matter.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.360
When you’re trying to measure tiny things like atoms
or electrons, though, it can be a real problem.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.380
You can’t always know an electron’s position as
precisely as you’d like, because then you’ll have a
less precise measurement of its momentum.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.220
So quantum mechanics tells us that there’s a
built-in limit to how much we can learn about particles.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.580
When people say quantum mechanics is weird,
they aren’t kidding.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.480
The more you learn about quantum, the more
weirdness you’ll find.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.040
But it’s still the best way to describe
the behavior of very tiny things.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.930
Today, you learned about how the wave-particle
duality applies to matter.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.520
We also talked about Schrodinger’s equation
and the meaning of the probability density function.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.439
Finally, we covered the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle.
