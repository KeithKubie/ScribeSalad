00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.480
There are some chasms so deep and so wide,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.040
we find it hard to imagine
how we'll ever make it to the other side.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.360
That space between who we are
and who we want to be,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.736
the gaps between our high ideals

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.640
and our base realities.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.896
The distance between what we say

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.360
and what we really mean.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.656
The raging river that flows
between what actually happened

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.456
and our convenient memories.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.336
The lies we tell ourselves are lakes,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.736
overflowing their banks,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.240
flooding our speech with waters,
caustic and rank.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.416
The only bridge is the truth,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.080
passing through me and you,
as we look one another eye to eye.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.656
But so often, that look
is filled with our hesitations,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.080
and we can't help but glance to the side.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.896
See, we've long ago let go of the language

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.136
with which we describe our softer parts.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.296
We learn early that those
with softer hearts suffer.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.976
So we allow lean emotion to reign,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.416
never noticing that only strain
has been the fruit of our restraints.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.336
We haven't escaped pain.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.656
And our battle scars are far from faint.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.176
Yet and still, despite our desire
and willingness to heal,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.416
we often find ourselves
fighting hard in the paint,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.040
holding onto false images
of everything we ain't.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.816
So while our dream coincide,
our fears collide.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.160
And we want to know one another,
but think we can't.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.256
The gulf between empathy and equity

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.936
is as unfathomable as the fissures
that line our collective integrity.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.216
And we spend eternal eternities

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.080
trying to translate that into virtue.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.120
Perhaps you have met one or two
of the virtuous on your path.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.736
They are only very few,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.936
and I know that I have, from time to time,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.616
mistaken pretenders for real,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.480
yet still make room for the possibility
that it's I who's been pretending.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.336
Please, bear with me, I'm still mending,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.696
but I'm no longer bending
to the will of my injuries,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.816
nor my injurers.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.856
I much prefer to stretch my arms
like Nüt until I become the sky.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.256
I'd rather stretch my tongue with truth,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.360
our bridge to cross
when we look one another in the eye.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.480
But the tongue,
like the heart, gets tired.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.576
The weak make it hard
for the strong to stay inspired,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.096
like the lost prevent the found
from escaping the mire,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.016
and the degraded stop the enlightened
from taking us higher.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.576
But no matter what you hear
from the mouths of these liars,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.576
we are one people

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.416
with one destiny and the common enemy,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.456
that's why it really stresses me
to see our hearts so tattered,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.856
our minds so scattered,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.096
our egos so easily flattered.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.336
We're enslaved, yet think
of our shackles as gifts.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.736
Rather than resist our masters,
we let them widen our rifts,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.016
like mindless, material junkies,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.720
we seek that which lowers, not lifts.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.976
But somewhere in our midst,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.880
there's been a paradigm shift.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.216
Justice is getting restless in its chains.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.176
Our youth find it useless
to separate their souls from their brains,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.576
their truth is ingrained,
their integrity insustained.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.216
Let me call your attention
to those who serve as examples.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.136
Those who daily give their all,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.256
but their reserves are still ample.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.256
Those who battle friend and foe,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.976
yet their hope is never trampled,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.096
they make music, never sample,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.536
and the world's ugly could never cancel

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.400
the fullness and the sweetness
of their composition.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.360
Nor the unadulterated truth
of their mission.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.760
It's time we shut our mouths and listen.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.976
Close our eyes and pray

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.856
for the humility and the guidance

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.840
to follow them to the way.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.816
Thank you.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.416
(Applause)

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.136
(Cheers)

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.376
Thank you.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.480
(Applause)

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.375
(Cheers)

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.696
Thank you.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.960
(Applause)

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.936
Thank you all so much,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.640
you have no idea how fulfilling
and energizing that is.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.936
For the past three years,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.496
I've had the privilege
of codesigning with my neighbors

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.440
a space in New Orleans
known as Under the Bridge.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.896
In 1966, Interstate 10
landed on the Tremé neighborhood,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.176
displacing 326 black-owned businesses,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.696
over 300 live oak trees,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.456
effectively destroying the region's
most successful black commercial district,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.976
disrupting intergenerational wealth

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.056
and truly unraveling the fabric

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.000
of the nation's oldest
African American neighborhood.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.776
Today, after 45 years
of community advocacy,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.216
after 500 hours of community engagement

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.576
and 80 hours of community design,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.256
we are so excited that in 2018,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.856
after capturing the voices
of thousands of residents

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.296
and the support of our local,
federal and philanthropic partners,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.296
as the city celebrates 300 years
of transforming the world,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.816
we will get to transform 19 blocks
under the Interstate into community space,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.576
into black-owned businesses,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.656
in the form of the Claiborne Corridor
Cultural Innovation District.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.496
(Cheers)

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.936
(Applause)

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.136
We will be bridging time,
we will bridge memory,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.136
we will bridge disparity and injustice,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.976
and we can't wait to see you all
on the other side.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.216
Thank you.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.080
(Applause)
