00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:01.070
- Hey everyone.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.604
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.604 --> 00:00:04.416
It's Mark Wiens. I'm in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:08.198
This evening I am eating at
the Talad Rot Fai Ratchada,

00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:09.535
which is the Train Market.

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:12.370
This is one of the most popular
night markets in Bangkok.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.260
There's a ton of street food,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.978
but specifically tonight this evening,

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:20.578
I am here to eat, I think
they call it the XXL.

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:24.054
It's a gigantic bowl of lobster tom yam.

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:25.895
Probably the biggest one I've ever seen.

00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:28.860
So we're gonna eat that and
we're gonna eat some street food

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.451
and I'm gonna share it
all with you right now.

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.313
(rhythmic music)

00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:36.696
(rhythmic music)

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:38.536
It's a really popular night market,

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:40.640
especially with younger
people who come here

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.635
to hang out, to eat street
food, to go shopping,

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:47.167
and just a quick piece of
history about Talad Rot Fai.

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.710
In Thai, it actually directly translates

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.879
to the Train Market.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.669
And I remember years and years ago,

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:54.331
the market actually started
on the railroad tracks.

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:56.888
There was an empty lot so it
actually started right next

00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:59.065
to the railroad tracks near Chatuchak,

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:01.950
but that plot of land, I
believe was eventually sold

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.606
or something changed and
then the market shifted

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:07.294
to two different locations,

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:09.322
this being the most popular location.

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:10.971
So there's no more railroad track,

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:15.084
but the market still retains
its vintage, classic feel to it

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.964
and I am not planning
to eat the XXL jumbo,

00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:20.667
gigantic bowl of tom yam lobster myself.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.907
I'm gonna meet up with my buddy Ramon.

00:01:22.907 --> 00:01:23.874
Hey Ramon!

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:24.895
- How are you?

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:25.909
- [Mark] Awesome. How are you man?

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.080
- [Ramon] Good, good, good.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.881
Hi! Long time no see!

00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:30.372
- [Mark] Have you told Ramon
what we're gonna eat first?

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:31.205
- Nope.

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:32.238
(Mark laughing)

00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:33.155
- What are you gonna eat first?

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:34.284
- [Mark] We are gonna go eat--

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:35.518
- [Woman] I think we should wait.

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:36.351
- [Mark] Oh, okay.

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:37.184
Let's wait.
- Until we order--

00:01:37.184 --> 00:01:38.528
- [Mark] Let's just go wait and see.

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:39.752
(all laughing)

00:01:39.752 --> 00:01:41.583
The main reason why we're here today.

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.441
So everybody say, "Hello", to Ramon.

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:44.798
- Hey, how's it goin' guys?

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:47.026
- We've been friends for
many years in Bangkok,

00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:50.496
but Ramon is an extremely talented artist.

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:54.021
I'll leave his channel in
the description box below.

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:56.122
And Ramon loves to eat.

00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:59.039
(ordering in Thai)

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:02.363
- In the back.

00:02:02.363 --> 00:02:06.699
- [Ramon] Oh, awesome that
we can smell the seafood.

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:07.532
Wow.

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:11.073
- [Mark] She's actually
still preparing all

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:13.340
the tom yam stocks so we
have to wait a little while

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.042
but in the meantime,
right across the lane,

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:17.792
we're gonna try some,

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:22.393
typically Thai khanom krok,

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:23.856
are little coconut griddle cakes

00:02:23.856 --> 00:02:26.534
and they make them in
the half circle shape.

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:27.771
They sizzle away

00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:30.735
and it's kind of a sweet,
savory coconut pudding,

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:33.724
but this one is the most
extreme version I've ever seen.

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:37.473
It kind of look like a
crossbred between a taco yaki,

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:39.012
a Japanese street food,

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:40.710
and Thai khanom krok.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.668
Cheers.

00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:44.806
(rhythmic music)

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:48.014
(rhythmic music)

00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:49.200
- Pretty good.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.683
- Yeah, that is pretty good.

00:02:50.683 --> 00:02:52.334
Crispy and crunchy on the bottom,

00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:53.620
but gooey on the top,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.752
and then you've got that change
of texture with the squid.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:58.409
Dangerously tasty, oily snack.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.226
(rhythmic music)

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:04.108
(rhythmic music)

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:05.478
Imitation crab has never been my favorite,

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:09.301
but it all kinda melts
together kinda nicely.

00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:11.372
- Yeah, it definitely melts,

00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:13.248
and then you got that crunch at the bottom

00:03:13.248 --> 00:03:14.081
that's really good.

00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.914
(Mark agreeing)

00:03:14.914 --> 00:03:15.747
- Perfect timing.

00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:18.209
She's getting started on the lobster.

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.959
(shell cracking)

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:26.494
That's gonna simmer for about 15 minutes,

00:03:26.494 --> 00:03:30.388
and then after that, hopefully,
we'll get them assembling

00:03:30.388 --> 00:03:32.805
the gigantic bowl of tom yam.

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:35.229
- [Ramon] Is that crab, or are those fake?

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.979
(rhythmic music)

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:41.871
(speaking Thai)

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:43.370
- Ramon and I were gonna
walk around as we wait for

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.798
that lobster to boil,

00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:46.216
but we didn't make it far.

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.444
Like literally right across the alley

00:03:48.444 --> 00:03:50.644
from where we are gonna eat the tom yam.

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:51.953
They're female crabs,

00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:53.534
so you can see those eggs blooming,

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:56.199
there are like yolks
pouring out of the crab.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.191
When you order it she makes
it into a green mango salad,

00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:00.366
so she first adds some green mango,

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:01.660
some julienne green mango.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.815
Then she adds the crab on top.

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:04.178
Then she adds some dressing,

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:06.268
which is just loaded
with chilies and garlic.

00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:07.634
- [Ramon] Oh! She's gonna give me a glove.

00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:08.467
Awesome!

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:11.103
- [Mark] (laughing) Thank you.

00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:11.936
Alright.

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:19.168
The spice doesn't kick in until after,

00:04:19.168 --> 00:04:21.282
but that sauce that they have there is

00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:23.532
just really, really potent.

00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:27.928
(rhythmic music)

00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:30.678
(rhythmic music)

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:34.306
Oh that's insane.

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:37.094
Oh, it's so rich, it
just melts in your mouth.

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:37.927
It's so garlicky.

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:39.011
I think we forgot to mention,

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:39.902
it's raw crab.

00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:41.524
Let me scoop up some of that
green mango at the bottom there

00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:43.536
and its just like soaked in that dressing

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:45.619
with chilies all over it.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.268
(rhythmic music)

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:52.581
(rhythmic music)

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:53.462
Perfectly crisp.

00:04:53.462 --> 00:04:56.560
It's refreshing and salty and sour.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.310
(rhythmic music)

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:03.559
They also have normal-sized
bowls of tom yam noodles here.

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.459
She's making a bowl of normal.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:06.876
This is our bowl.

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:10.859
And that's gonna be full soon.

00:05:12.614 --> 00:05:15.384
Oh man, she's just gonna
litter it with seafood.

00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:17.884
Okay, first goes in the squid.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.630
(rhythmic music)

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.463
(rhythmic music)

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.023
They literally emptied
those trays into our giant,

00:05:30.023 --> 00:05:31.891
it's a basin, it's not even a bowl,

00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:32.974
it's a basin.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.337
Dude, Ramon!

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:39.150
I don't know if we should
have eaten those snacks.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.344
(group laughing)

00:05:41.344 --> 00:05:43.594
You gotta come take a look.

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:48.791
- Wow! (laughing)

00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.610
(rhythmic music)

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.443
(rhythmic music)

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.210
- Oh, oh, oh, wow.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.960
(rhythmic music)

00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:03.406
Now comes the soup.

00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:06.743
(rhythmic music)

00:06:06.743 --> 00:06:09.576
(rhythmic music)

00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:15.050
(rhythmic music)

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.408
(rhythmic music)

00:06:18.408 --> 00:06:21.059
(rhythmic music)

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:25.067
(laughing) This thing is
absolutely giganormous.

00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:26.400
It's so massive.

00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:31.225
And you would actually think
that the noodles are below here

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.156
but let me tell you,

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:33.686
there are no noodles in this bowl.

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:35.963
The foundation is all fish.

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:40.380
All the noodles are on a
separate plate over here

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.928
and over here.

00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:43.178
Oh, I just got stabbed by the lobster.

00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:44.802
- You could bathe a newborn in this.

00:06:44.802 --> 00:06:45.781
(both laughing)

00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:46.658
- Actually we did.

00:06:46.658 --> 00:06:48.439
(both laughing)

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.079
This is the most colossal bowl of tom yam

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.704
maybe in the world.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.376
- This is an average bowl.

00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:55.816
- That's a normal. (laughing)

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:56.649
(Ramon laughing)

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:58.044
Just compare. Yeah, just hold that up.

00:06:58.044 --> 00:07:00.070
There's so much seafood
it's hard to even navigate

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.120
where the soup is,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.704
but there is a lot of soup down there.

00:07:02.704 --> 00:07:04.639
Okay, I'm gonna dig in on
this side of the lobster

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.070
and just get some of
that soup broth first.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.903
We gotta--

00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:09.403
- [Ramon] I found a spot here.

00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:14.172
Yeah, that's good.

00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:15.005
- [Mark] Yeah

00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:17.255
It's pretty awesomely
good, really nice and sour.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:18.088
You taste that herbs in there.

00:07:18.088 --> 00:07:19.735
You taste that saku,

00:07:19.735 --> 00:07:20.694
despite being covered in chilies,

00:07:20.694 --> 00:07:21.737
it's not actually spicy.

00:07:21.737 --> 00:07:23.817
You could go swimming in
this with the seafood.

00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:25.150
- [Ramon] Literally.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.310
- [Mark] What do you
wanna dive into first?

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.457
- [Ramon] Lets go straight
for the lobster, yeah.

00:07:29.457 --> 00:07:31.150
- [Mark] We gotta go for
the trophy right there

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.618
in the center and this is
the gigantic centerpiece.

00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:36.194
I think we should just kinda
go in and scoop it out,

00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:38.764
kinda leverage this guy out.

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.136
There's the buttery head juice,

00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:42.944
melting in there.

00:07:42.944 --> 00:07:45.624
Wow, that is a huge chunk. Very muscular.

00:07:45.624 --> 00:07:47.146
- [Ramon] Wanna get a
little bit of soup in there.

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:48.813
- [Mark] Yeah, yeah.

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:54.954
(marketplace bustling)

00:07:57.378 --> 00:07:58.211
- Tender.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.219
- [Mark] Yeah and at the same
time a little bit muscular.

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:04.369
Yeah, just wrapped up in that
salty, sour tom yam broth.

00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:07.353
Alright, lets go for the fish
because the entire foundation

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:11.275
literally the bottom of
this basin is all fish.

00:08:11.275 --> 00:08:13.044
There's so much fish down there,

00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:14.209
and we can kinda like--

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:16.916
Oh, you can dig from there,
you can dig from all over.

00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:18.927
It's just sprouting with fish.

00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:21.343
In Thai the name of the
fish is called plah doree,

00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:23.926
and we have a lot of it to eat.

00:08:30.894 --> 00:08:32.279
It's a very, very soft fish.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:33.786
- Really soft. Really tender.

00:08:33.786 --> 00:08:35.126
- [Mark] Because it's sitting
at the bottom of the bowl

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:37.959
so it definitely absorbed
quite a lot of tom yam.

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:39.961
So that's like a fish tom yam sponge.

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:41.575
(Ramon laughing)

00:08:41.575 --> 00:08:43.949
Whoa, you can grab the
whole bite if you want to.

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:45.907
They are definitely stuck together.

00:08:45.907 --> 00:08:47.973
They have been sitting
here for a little while.

00:08:47.973 --> 00:08:49.405
Yes! (laughing)

00:08:49.405 --> 00:08:50.238
- [Ramon] Hey!

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.646
- You dip this into the soup.

00:08:51.646 --> 00:08:56.174
to rehydrate it in the
soup and then you eat it.

00:08:56.174 --> 00:08:58.924
(rhythmic music)

00:09:01.026 --> 00:09:03.443
Let's try one of the mussels.

00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:06.939
I think what we can kinda do, fill up--

00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:08.910
Oh man, you've got the right idea.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.328
Just scoop up some of the broth.

00:09:11.328 --> 00:09:12.361
Just pour it on there,

00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:13.819
the natural spoon.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:14.652
Cheers!

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:16.069
- [Ramon] Cheers!

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:23.155
That's good.

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:25.822
(Mark agreeing)

00:09:26.718 --> 00:09:28.012
- Mine is only half-cooked

00:09:28.012 --> 00:09:29.648
so it kinda like melts in your mouth,

00:09:29.648 --> 00:09:31.339
but I like it that way.

00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:33.755
You gotta use a lot of different utensils

00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:34.920
for this bowl.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.753
Some things you gotta eat with chopsticks,

00:09:35.753 --> 00:09:37.056
Some things you gotta eat with a spoon.

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:39.055
Some things we just gotta
reach in with our hands.

00:09:39.055 --> 00:09:39.888
- [Ramon] Just dig in.

00:09:39.888 --> 00:09:41.714
- Let's go in for these shrimp.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:44.118
And these are freshwater shrimp I believe.

00:09:44.118 --> 00:09:45.982
The head just sorta falls off,

00:09:45.982 --> 00:09:48.859
but there should be some
goodness inside the head as well.

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:51.444
One of the great things
about this tom yam soup is

00:09:51.444 --> 00:09:53.367
you can dip all your seafood too,

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:55.450
It's a sauce and a broth.

00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:04.188
And then you can suck up all
the goodness from the head.

00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:06.938
(rhythmic music)

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:11.386
Aw man, from the head,
that's where it's at.

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:12.592
That juicy buttery-ness.

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:13.789
- Dripping with goodness.

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:15.701
(both laughing)

00:10:15.701 --> 00:10:16.986
- [Mark] I think crab is next.

00:10:16.986 --> 00:10:19.486
Little crab drumsticks.

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:21.165
(rhythmic music)

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:23.093
Everything is saturated with tom yam.

00:10:23.093 --> 00:10:25.042
- [Ramon] It's soft and spongy.

00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:27.401
- [Mark] You can always just re-dip.

00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:28.234
Rehydrate.

00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:32.013
I'm gonna do that spoon method,

00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:33.943
grabbing a piece of the squid

00:10:33.943 --> 00:10:36.095
with some of the broth all at once.

00:10:36.095 --> 00:10:37.178
- [Ramon] Oh.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.688
- [Mark] At first you think
its gonna be a little rubbery,

00:10:42.688 --> 00:10:44.089
but then it just chews so easily.

00:10:44.089 --> 00:10:44.922
- [Ramon] Yeah.

00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:46.330
- [Mark] Not at all.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.608
- [Ramon] Yeah. So which
one is your favorite?

00:10:48.608 --> 00:10:52.399
- Out of all of the seafood, oh man,

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:55.899
the lobster is just a special trophy item,

00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:58.466
but the mussels are so awesome.

00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:00.136
The mussels are excellent.

00:11:00.136 --> 00:11:00.969
How about you?

00:11:00.969 --> 00:11:01.802
- Actually yeah, I was
gonna say the mussels

00:11:01.802 --> 00:11:02.635
are my favorite I think.

00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:03.468
- The mussels?

00:11:03.468 --> 00:11:04.301
- The mussels are great, yeah.

00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:08.244
- It's soft and you got that
spoonful of tom yam in there.

00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:10.077
It's really flavorful.

00:11:11.948 --> 00:11:14.961
(woman speaking Thai)

00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:16.019
- [Mark] Now that we've tasted everything,

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:18.687
Ramon and I are just kina
snacking on this giant bowl,

00:11:18.687 --> 00:11:21.104
leisurely just nibbling away.

00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:26.408
It's really good,
actually I like the squid.

00:11:26.408 --> 00:11:30.465
It's almost so soft that it
almost has like a cheese,

00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:32.443
like a mozzarella elasticity to it.

00:11:32.443 --> 00:11:35.299
It's not the most fresh
seafood you'll ever had,

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:38.815
but it's pretty decent and
the flavor is pretty good.

00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:42.686
You really just want to eat
this for the ginormous size,

00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:46.186
and just for how awesome it is to look at.

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:48.624
- This is amazing.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:51.237
And you should see the looks on the people

00:11:51.237 --> 00:11:52.187
that walk by because they--

00:11:52.187 --> 00:11:53.432
- Oh man. People--

00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:56.470
- [Ramon] They look and
they take pictures of it.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.972
- Some people actually stop
and put their cell phone

00:11:58.972 --> 00:12:01.707
right above our bowl of
tom yam and take a photo.

00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:04.266
It's great. Absolutely great.

00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:06.054
This is a show stopper.

00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:08.221
- Yeah, attention grabber.

00:12:09.134 --> 00:12:12.428
- [Mark] Ramon's digging out the head.

00:12:12.428 --> 00:12:14.192
The juiciest parts are in here.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.593
- [Mark] If that just like, plops--

00:12:15.593 --> 00:12:17.054
- I don't think I got it all but--

00:12:17.054 --> 00:12:19.554
- [Mark] It looks like a cave!

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:24.374
(rhythmic music)

00:12:25.882 --> 00:12:27.559
- Melts on your tongue.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:29.045
- Yeah.

00:12:29.045 --> 00:12:31.950
(rhythmic music)

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.775
(group laughing)

00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:35.608
Hello!

00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:37.521
- [Ramon] Oh hey!

00:12:37.521 --> 00:12:38.354
- [Man] I watch your YouTube.

00:12:38.354 --> 00:12:40.149
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:12:40.149 --> 00:12:41.874
How's the tom yam?

00:12:41.874 --> 00:12:43.413
- [Group] Good!

00:12:43.413 --> 00:12:44.773
- [Mark] Where are you from?

00:12:44.773 --> 00:12:46.147
- [Group] Singapore!

00:12:46.147 --> 00:12:47.212
- [Ramon] Nice to meet you!

00:12:47.212 --> 00:12:48.045
- [Group] Nice to meet you.

00:12:48.045 --> 00:12:48.878
- [Mark] Quick update,

00:12:48.878 --> 00:12:52.343
we've been eating pretty
steadily for about 30 minutes,

00:12:52.343 --> 00:12:54.965
and we have made a lot of progress.

00:12:54.965 --> 00:12:56.982
Do you think we can do it Ramon?

00:12:56.982 --> 00:12:58.589
- I think so. I think we can do it.

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:00.321
- [Mark] We will
definitely see the bottom.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.478
See the bottom of this.

00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:05.352
(rhythmic music)

00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:08.585
(rhythmic music)

00:13:08.585 --> 00:13:12.027
(rhythmic music)

00:13:12.027 --> 00:13:15.366
We are definitely at the very home stage.

00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:18.308
If you rummage your
chopsticks through here now,

00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:20.946
you'd come up almost empty-handed.

00:13:20.946 --> 00:13:23.761
There's a few things to go fishing for.

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.872
We are pretty much at the finish line.

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:26.705
For a drink.

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:27.538
- [Ramon] Together?

00:13:27.538 --> 00:13:28.461
- [Woman] Are you gonna drink it?

00:13:28.461 --> 00:13:32.553
- [Mark] I don't know if we
can drink it together, can we?

00:13:32.553 --> 00:13:35.303
(Ramon laughing)

00:13:36.897 --> 00:13:40.607
That is a lot of salty
broth at the bottom there.

00:13:40.607 --> 00:13:41.690
Alright Ramon, (laughing)

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.940
it's your turn.

00:13:46.773 --> 00:13:48.883
It's like drinking out of a bathtub.

00:13:48.883 --> 00:13:50.468
Alright Ramon, we gotta do this.

00:13:50.468 --> 00:13:53.385
There's still a few pieces of fish.

00:13:55.717 --> 00:13:58.967
We're like moving extra slow right now.

00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:02.603
- I've had to undo a belt hole.

00:14:02.603 --> 00:14:03.762
- Move down the next notch?

00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:06.645
- Yeah, I had to widen
my pants a little bit.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:09.957
- [Mark] We do have one final bite Ramon.

00:14:09.957 --> 00:14:12.667
(dramatic music)

00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:15.441
(dramatic music)

00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:18.408
(dramatic music)

00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:21.191
(dramatic music)

00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:23.949
(dramatic music)

00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:26.699
(dramatic music)

00:14:28.554 --> 00:14:30.804
(cheering)

00:14:32.302 --> 00:14:33.928
Accomplished.

00:14:33.928 --> 00:14:35.137
Thinking about getting up.

00:14:35.137 --> 00:14:38.430
but we just can't physically
stand up right now.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.263
How are you feeling Ramon.?

00:14:39.263 --> 00:14:44.013
- I feel like I am two kilos
heavier than when I arrived.

00:14:47.098 --> 00:14:49.870
- [Mark] The seafood is still here.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.917
Its at the table.

00:14:50.917 --> 00:14:52.906
But instead of being in the bowl,

00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:55.208
it's now transferred
directly in our stomachs.

00:14:55.208 --> 00:15:00.114
We are gonna be sweating tom
yam for the next three days.

00:15:00.114 --> 00:15:02.822
(rhythmic music)

00:15:02.822 --> 00:15:06.414
(rhythmic music)

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:09.494
We're stumbling out of
that stall, that tent.

00:15:09.494 --> 00:15:12.272
And now when we're leaving
it absolutely packed.

00:15:12.272 --> 00:15:14.742
But the entire market
now is packed as well.

00:15:14.742 --> 00:15:17.267
I feel like I'm just
floating along right now

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:18.959
There's no food in this market

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.320
that looks good to me right now.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.381
Oh yeah! Maybe a shake.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:26.298
(blender grinding)

00:15:28.547 --> 00:15:30.224
Pretty cool. Pretty creative idea.

00:15:30.224 --> 00:15:31.639
This is great.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.005
(rhythmic music)

00:15:34.005 --> 00:15:36.738
(rhythmic music)

00:15:36.738 --> 00:15:39.994
(rhythmic music)

00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:41.902
After all of that salty tom yam,

00:15:41.902 --> 00:15:44.663
watermelon and ice has
never tasted so good.

00:15:44.663 --> 00:15:46.512
That's the most refreshing
things I've ever had

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:49.230
at this moment in my life.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.980
(rhythmic music)

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.632
Yeah, it's nice to have a
different taste in your mouth,

00:15:56.632 --> 00:15:58.916
instead of just bites some tom yam.

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.334
- [Mark] (laughing) I agree!

00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:03.971
(rhythmic music)

00:16:03.971 --> 00:16:06.750
(rhythmic music)

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.499
- [Mark] What are your
final thoughts Ramon?

00:16:08.499 --> 00:16:11.273
- [Ramon] Now that I've
walked around a little bit,

00:16:11.273 --> 00:16:12.106
I think I got a little more room.

00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:14.114
It's a little more room now.
