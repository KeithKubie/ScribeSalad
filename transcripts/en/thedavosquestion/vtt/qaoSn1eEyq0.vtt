00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
&gt;&gt; Sure, there's no doubt about it.
And there should be no discussion around that.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.070
The question is when and how.
I think that we have some fundamental issues.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.300
So if you look at the first 15, 20 years of
economic equalization, we

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.450
were focusing on areas which I guess are priorities
in terms of our

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.720
[INAUDIBLE] investment.
Institutional investment so on and so forth.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.890
Where I think what is coming to fore in the
last 2 or 3 years and also

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.100
seems to me the theme for this year's conference
 -- that's education

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.870
and health, which is getting importance in
other issues like women

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.510
empowerment and so on and so forth.
So I think either assume the center stage

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.280
and they should be important.
Everybody accepting that these challenges

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.850
continue to exist and I think
if we have a game plan with us, I think no

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.019
doubt about it that we will
realize our potential as being a super economic

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:58.389
power.
