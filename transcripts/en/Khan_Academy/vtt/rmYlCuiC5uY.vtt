00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:01.072
- [Voiceover] So let's add

00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:04.085
six over two X squared minus seven

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:06.241
to negative 3 X minus eight

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.238
over two X squared minus seven.

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:10.438
And like always, pause the video

00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:12.807
and try to work it out before I do.

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:13.659
When you look at this,

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.507
we have these two rational expressions

00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:16.898
and we have the same denominator,

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:18.361
two X squared minus seven.

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.356
So you could say, we have six
two X squared minus sevenths

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:24.087
and then we have negative
three X minus eight

00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:27.814
two X squared minus sevenths
is one way to think about it.

00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:29.243
So if you have the same denominator,

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:30.882
this is going to be equal to,

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:33.858
this is going to be equal to...

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:37.761
our denominator is going to
be two X squared minus seven,

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.103
two X squared minus seven,

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.036
and then we just add the numerators.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:47.527
So it's going to be six
plus negative three X,

00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:51.673
negative three X minus eight.

00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:53.327
So if we want to simplify
this a little bit,

00:00:53.327 --> 00:00:55.972
we'd recognize that we can
add these two constant terms,

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.586
the six and the negative eight.

00:00:58.586 --> 00:00:59.820
Six plus negative eight is going to be

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.677
negative two, so it's
going to be negative two

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:04.015
and then adding a negative three X,

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:06.629
that's the same thing
as subtracting three X,

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.663
so negative two minus
three X, all of that over,

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:13.838
all of that with that same blue color,

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:15.628
all of that over

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:19.424
two X squared minus seven.

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:20.192
And we're done.

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:22.942
We've just added these
two rational expressions.

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:24.824
Let's do another example.

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:27.191
So here, we want to subtract

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.213
one rational expression from another.

00:01:29.213 --> 00:01:31.580
So see if you can figure that out.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.845
Well, once again, both of
these rational expressions

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:36.353
have the exact same denominator,

00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:37.703
the denominator for both of them is

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:41.664
14 X squared minus nine,
14 X squared minus nine.

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:45.040
So the denominator of the difference,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.225
I guess we can call it that,

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:50.113
is going to be 14 X squared minus nine.

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.367
So 14 X squared minus nine.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:55.382
Did I say four X squared before?

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.120
14 X squared minus nine,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.477
that's the denominator of both of them,

00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:00.132
so that's going to be the denominator

00:02:00.132 --> 00:02:02.920
of our answer right over here.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.647
And so, we can just
subtract the numerators.

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:07.897
So we're gonna have

00:02:07.897 --> 00:02:12.287
nine X squared plus three

00:02:12.287 --> 00:02:17.135
minus all of this business,

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:22.001
minus negative three X squared plus five.

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.849
And so we can distribute
the negative sign.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.679
This is going to be equal to

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.043
nine X squared plus three, and then,

00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:36.353
if you distribute the negative sign,

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:38.512
the negative of negative three X squared

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:41.610
is going to be plus three X squared

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.398
and then the negative of positive five

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:45.284
is going to be negative five,

00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:47.270
so we're gonna subtract five from that,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.590
and all of that is going to be
over 14 X squared minus nine.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.071
14 X squared minus nine.

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:57.615
And so in the numerator we
can do some simplification.

00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:01.654
We have nine X squared
plus three X squared,

00:03:01.654 --> 00:03:05.590
so that's going to be
equal to 12 X squared.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.561
And then, we have...

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:13.672
we have three plus negative five,

00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:15.204
or we can say three minus five,

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:17.085
so that's going to be negative two,

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:20.044
and all of that is going to be over

00:03:20.044 --> 00:03:22.238
14 X squared minus nine.

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:26.071
14 X squared minus nine.

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.220
And we're all done.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.612
We have just subtracted.

00:03:28.612 --> 00:03:29.360
And we can think about it,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.347
is there any way we
can simplify this more,

00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:32.670
are there any common factors,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.420
but these both could be
considered differences of squares,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.301
but they're going to be
differences of squares

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:38.835
of different things,

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.367
so they're not going
to have common factors.

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:43.404
So this is about as simple as we can get.
