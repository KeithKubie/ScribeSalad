to where you're going you will get lost
 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.800
to where you're going you will get lost
and you might end up in the neighborhood

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
and you might end up in the neighborhood
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109
and you might end up in the neighborhood
that you don't want to visit so it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
that you don't want to visit so it
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.660

now if you're talking to someone who is
acting in opposition to you it's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
acting in opposition to you it's
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.730
acting in opposition to you it's
possible that during your contentious

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
possible that during your contentious
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.129
possible that during your contentious
discussion they will tell you something

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139
discussion they will tell you something
 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.409
discussion they will tell you something
about how you're wrong that's accurate

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:30.419
about how you're wrong that's accurate
 

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:31.940
about how you're wrong that's accurate
now you're not going to be very happy

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
now you're not going to be very happy
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.769
now you're not going to be very happy
about that because like who wants to

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:33.779
about that because like who wants to
 

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:35.599
about that because like who wants to
discover that they're wrong but it's

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609
discover that they're wrong but it's
 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.099
discover that they're wrong but it's
better to figure out that your map is

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109
better to figure out that your map is
 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.589
better to figure out that your map is
inaccurate than it is to get lost and so

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:39.599
inaccurate than it is to get lost and so
 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.909
inaccurate than it is to get lost and so
one of the things you have to remember

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:40.919
one of the things you have to remember
 

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:42.289
one of the things you have to remember
when you're discussing things with

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
when you're discussing things with
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.929
when you're discussing things with
people even if they're out to defeat you

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
people even if they're out to defeat you
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.479
people even if they're out to defeat you
let's say is that there is some

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:47.489
let's say is that there is some
 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:49.370
let's say is that there is some
glimmering of the possibility that you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
glimmering of the possibility that you
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.809
glimmering of the possibility that you
can walk away with more knowledge than

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819
can walk away with more knowledge than
 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.539
can walk away with more knowledge than
you walked in with and that's worth that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
you walked in with and that's worth that
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.279
you walked in with and that's worth that
can be worth paying quite a price for

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289
can be worth paying quite a price for
 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.999
can be worth paying quite a price for
you know and so I've had the opportunity

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
you know and so I've had the opportunity
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.559
you know and so I've had the opportunity
to engage in public debate of an

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569
to engage in public debate of an
 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.569
to engage in public debate of an
exceptionally contentious nature for

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
exceptionally contentious nature for
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.469
exceptionally contentious nature for
let's say 18 months non-stop

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479
let's say 18 months non-stop
 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.979
let's say 18 months non-stop
fundamentally and the and it's been very

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989
fundamentally and the and it's been very
 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.420
fundamentally and the and it's been very
stressful but the upshot

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
stressful but the upshot
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.309
stressful but the upshot
that is that my arguments are in much

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
that is that my arguments are in much
 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.830
that is that my arguments are in much
better shape than they were and I

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
better shape than they were and I
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.050
better shape than they were and I
shouldn't say that my thoughts are much

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
shouldn't say that my thoughts are much
 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.520
shouldn't say that my thoughts are much
more refined than they were at the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
more refined than they were at the
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.839
more refined than they were at the
beginning of this process not my

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849
beginning of this process not my
 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.250
beginning of this process not my
arguments are in better shape it's not

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
arguments are in better shape it's not
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.080
arguments are in better shape it's not
the right way to think about it is that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090
the right way to think about it is that
 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.530
the right way to think about it is that
I'm clearer about what I know I can

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
I'm clearer about what I know I can
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.920
I'm clearer about what I know I can
articulate it better and that's all

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
articulate it better and that's all
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.349
articulate it better and that's all

you have a defeated partner and the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510
you have a defeated partner and the
 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.050
you have a defeated partner and the
defeated partner is not happy and the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060
defeated partner is not happy and the
 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.599
defeated partner is not happy and the
defeated partner is often out to reclaim

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609
defeated partner is often out to reclaim
 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.960
defeated partner is often out to reclaim
the defeat and so as a strategy for

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970
the defeat and so as a strategy for
 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.729
the defeat and so as a strategy for
moving forward with someone who you're

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739
moving forward with someone who you're
 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.729
moving forward with someone who you're
going to wake up beside you know 5,000

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739
going to wake up beside you know 5,000
 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.610
going to wake up beside you know 5,000
times it's not a very advisable strategy

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
times it's not a very advisable strategy
 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.069
times it's not a very advisable strategy
it's better to listen to flesh out the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079
it's better to listen to flesh out the
 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.289
it's better to listen to flesh out the
argument on both sides and to see if you

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299
argument on both sides and to see if you
 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.119
argument on both sides and to see if you
can come to a mutually acceptable

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129
can come to a mutually acceptable
 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.879
can come to a mutually acceptable
negotiated settlement and that's the

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889
negotiated settlement and that's the
 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.920
negotiated settlement and that's the
case in most encounters in life if you

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
case in most encounters in life if you
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.349
case in most encounters in life if you
can manage that so but you know it's

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359
can manage that so but you know it's
 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.860
can manage that so but you know it's
easy to want to win one of the things I

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870
easy to want to win one of the things I
 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.119
easy to want to win one of the things I
do in my in my psychology seminar is I

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129
do in my in my psychology seminar is I
 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.399
do in my in my psychology seminar is I
assign papers to students and then I

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409
assign papers to students and then I
 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.039
assign papers to students and then I
extract out propositions from the papers

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049
extract out propositions from the papers
 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.990
extract out propositions from the papers
and their propositions that are

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000
and their propositions that are
 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.699
and their propositions that are
debatable and so then I outline the pro

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709
debatable and so then I outline the pro
 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.640
debatable and so then I outline the pro
side and I outline the cons side so it's

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650
side and I outline the cons side so it's
 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.140
side and I outline the cons side so it's
like if you agree with this this is what

psychology experiments that demonstrate
this quite clearly so imagine that you

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330
this quite clearly so imagine that you
 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.650
this quite clearly so imagine that you
come into my lab and I ask you whether

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660
come into my lab and I ask you whether
 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.590
come into my lab and I ask you whether
you're pro or pro-abortion or prolife

you're pro or pro-abortion or prolife
 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.350
you're pro or pro-abortion or prolife
and I get you to rate that on a scale

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360
and I get you to rate that on a scale
 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.390
and I get you to rate that on a scale
maybe you say well on a scale of 1 to 10

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400

have to write a 500-word essay that's
opposed to your position ok that's

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250
opposed to your position ok that's
 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.870
opposed to your position ok that's
that's the experiment and then I bring

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880
that's the experiment and then I bring
 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.780
that's the experiment and then I bring
you back two weeks later and I ask you

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790
you back two weeks later and I ask you
 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.200
you back two weeks later and I ask you
to rate your position on the same scale

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210
to rate your position on the same scale
 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.680
to rate your position on the same scale
it will have shifted substantially to

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690
it will have shifted substantially to
 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.950
it will have shifted substantially to
the position that you delineated in your

the position that you delineated in your
 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.590
the position that you delineated in your
written report and the reason for that

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600
written report and the reason for that
 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.510
written report and the reason for that
is that most people's arguments are

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520
is that most people's arguments are
 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.180
is that most people's arguments are
unbelievably shallow they're not

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.640
unbelievably shallow they're not

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.050
arguments they're just perceptual biases
that's that's one way of thinking about

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060
that's that's one way of thinking about
 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.600
that's that's one way of thinking about
them and and if you get people to

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610
them and and if you get people to
 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.120
them and and if you get people to
delineate out the space in any rigorous

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130
delineate out the space in any rigorous
 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.000
delineate out the space in any rigorous
manner then their attitudes shift what

manner then their attitudes shift what
you really want if you're going to

you really want if you're going to
 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.630
you really want if you're going to

of knowledge and it stems partly from my
biases and from my temperaments but it's

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:28.390
biases and from my temperaments but it's
 

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.360

informed singular observer and what I'm
 

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.480

doing then is modeling how an informed

complex body of literature so it's

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839
complex body of literature so it's
 

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:52.110

I'm saying if you're a psychologist

00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.060
I'm saying if you're a psychologist

engage with the literature here's one

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920

way that you would do it and so then I'm

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.050
way that you would do it and so then I'm
 

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.890
way that you would do it and so then I'm
a model and I'm a model of a way to be

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:08.900
a model and I'm a model of a way to be
 

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.530
a model and I'm a model of a way to be
in a particular domain now that doesn't

mean that you have to emulate me you

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760
mean that you have to emulate me you
 

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.120

know from top to bottom but at least you

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.130
know from top to bottom but at least you
 

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.160
know from top to bottom but at least you
have a sense of what it's like to be a

have a sense of what it's like to be a
 

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.950
have a sense of what it's like to be a
person doing that and so that's and

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:20.960
person doing that and so that's and
 

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.400
person doing that and so that's and
that's a different form of pedagogy

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:24.410
that's a different form of pedagogy
 

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.660
that's a different form of pedagogy
