00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030
 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.190
so mark you have a great question about

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200
so mark you have a great question about
 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.350
so mark you have a great question about
black holes is there a minimum mass

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360
black holes is there a minimum mass
 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.510
black holes is there a minimum mass
needed for a black hole to form and as a

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520
needed for a black hole to form and as a
 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.190
needed for a black hole to form and as a
black hole form whenever a stellar

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200
black hole form whenever a stellar
 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.380
black hole form whenever a stellar
object gets that dense to begin with

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390
object gets that dense to begin with
 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.970
object gets that dense to begin with
let's talk about the definition of a

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980
let's talk about the definition of a
 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.550
let's talk about the definition of a
black hole now most commonly people talk

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560
black hole now most commonly people talk
 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.620
black hole now most commonly people talk
about black holes as being a consequence

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630
about black holes as being a consequence
 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.140
about black holes as being a consequence
of a giant star dying and the idea is

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150
of a giant star dying and the idea is
 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.660
of a giant star dying and the idea is
that a star has this huge mass and

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670
that a star has this huge mass and
 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.700
that a star has this huge mass and
that's a lot of gravity crushing the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710
that's a lot of gravity crushing the
 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.369
that's a lot of gravity crushing the
star together now when the star is alive

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379
star together now when the star is alive
 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.260
star together now when the star is alive
and there are fusion reactions going on

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270
and there are fusion reactions going on
 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.840
and there are fusion reactions going on
inside the core that crush of gravity is

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850
inside the core that crush of gravity is
 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.870
inside the core that crush of gravity is
actually held up but once the star dies

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880
actually held up but once the star dies
 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.510
actually held up but once the star dies
and the fusion reactions go away the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520
and the fusion reactions go away the
 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.130
and the fusion reactions go away the
gravity crushes inward and there's

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
gravity crushes inward and there's
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.780
gravity crushes inward and there's
nothing to support it anymore

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790
nothing to support it anymore
 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.940
nothing to support it anymore
so basically gravity becomes so strong

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950
so basically gravity becomes so strong
 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.160
so basically gravity becomes so strong
in that object that not even light can

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170
in that object that not even light can
 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.900
in that object that not even light can
escape and therefore we call it a black

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910
escape and therefore we call it a black
 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.510
escape and therefore we call it a black
hole that's probably the most classic

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520
hole that's probably the most classic
 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.790
hole that's probably the most classic
way to make a black hole is you actually

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800
way to make a black hole is you actually
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.590
way to make a black hole is you actually
make it from the core of a dead star

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600
make it from the core of a dead star
 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.420
make it from the core of a dead star
that's collapsing but you might be

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430
that's collapsing but you might be
 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.800
that's collapsing but you might be
surprised to learn that we actually

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810
surprised to learn that we actually
 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.180
surprised to learn that we actually
think there are other ways to make a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190
think there are other ways to make a
 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.249
think there are other ways to make a
black hole and the real answer to your

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259
black hole and the real answer to your
 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.290
black hole and the real answer to your
question is that there is no minimum

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300
question is that there is no minimum
 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300
question is that there is no minimum
mass needed for a black hole you just

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310
mass needed for a black hole you just
 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.790
mass needed for a black hole you just
need to have the right density for an

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800
need to have the right density for an
 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.980
need to have the right density for an
object's gravity to be so intense that

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990
object's gravity to be so intense that
 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.650
object's gravity to be so intense that
light can't escape the universe is very

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660
light can't escape the universe is very
 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.449
light can't escape the universe is very
good at making black holes that are

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459
good at making black holes that are
 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.760
good at making black holes that are
about the size of stars it's an easy way

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770
about the size of stars it's an easy way
 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.889
about the size of stars it's an easy way
to get them but the universe makes black

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899
to get them but the universe makes black
 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.350
to get them but the universe makes black
holes in other ways too we actually

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360
holes in other ways too we actually
 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.669
holes in other ways too we actually
think there are black holes being

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679
think there are black holes being
 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.859
think there are black holes being
generated all around us on very very

small scales there are things called

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360
small scales there are things called
 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.199
small scales there are things called
high-energy cosmic rays very very

and you'll get a black hole for example

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720
and you'll get a black hole for example
 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.850
and you'll get a black hole for example
if you could actually crush the entire

that would be a black hole but now let

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750
that would be a black hole but now let
 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.059
that would be a black hole but now let
me tell you that things go the other way

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069
me tell you that things go the other way
 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.759
me tell you that things go the other way
too we know a black holes that are much

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769
too we know a black holes that are much
 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.030
too we know a black holes that are much
much more massive than stars there are

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
much more massive than stars there are
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.710
much more massive than stars there are
things called supermassive black holes

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
things called supermassive black holes
 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.680
things called supermassive black holes
that are millions or billions of times

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690
that are millions or billions of times

that are millions or billions of times
the mass of the Sun we see these in the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180
the mass of the Sun we see these in the
 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.270
the mass of the Sun we see these in the
center of galaxies all around us and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
center of galaxies all around us and
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.979
center of galaxies all around us and
quite honestly one of the biggest

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989
quite honestly one of the biggest
 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.110
quite honestly one of the biggest
questions in astronomy right now is how

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120
questions in astronomy right now is how
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.020
questions in astronomy right now is how
do these giant black holes form because

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030
do these giant black holes form because
 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.390
do these giant black holes form because
we see them so far away in space we see

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400
we see them so far away in space we see
 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.490
we see them so far away in space we see
them in galaxies that are ten billion

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
them in galaxies that are ten billion
 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.920
them in galaxies that are ten billion
light-years away and that means that 10

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930
light-years away and that means that 10
 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.030
light-years away and that means that 10
billion years ago when the universe

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040
billion years ago when the universe
 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.970
billion years ago when the universe
wasn't very old you already had black

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980
wasn't very old you already had black
 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.099
wasn't very old you already had black
holes that were billions of times the

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109

black holes are really interesting

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
black holes are really interesting
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.699
black holes are really interesting
because remember I told you the whole

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709
because remember I told you the whole
 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.589
because remember I told you the whole
point is getting the right density for a

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599
point is getting the right density for a
 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.270
point is getting the right density for a
black hole doesn't really matter how

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
black hole doesn't really matter how
 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.809
black hole doesn't really matter how
much matter there is intriguingly these

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819
much matter there is intriguingly these
 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.509

giant black holes are actually not very

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519
giant black holes are actually not very
 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.869
giant black holes are actually not very
dense on average if you had a black hole

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879
dense on average if you had a black hole
 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.509
dense on average if you had a black hole
that was about four million times the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519
that was about four million times the
 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.909
that was about four million times the
mass of the Sun the diameter of that

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919
mass of the Sun the diameter of that
 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.740
mass of the Sun the diameter of that
black hole would be about the orbit of

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750
black hole would be about the orbit of
 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.689
black hole would be about the orbit of
where Jupiter is in our solar system and

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699
where Jupiter is in our solar system and
 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.150
where Jupiter is in our solar system and
the average density of it across that

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160
the average density of it across that
 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.339
the average density of it across that
whole volume would be about the same as

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349
whole volume would be about the same as
 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.349
whole volume would be about the same as
water so how is it you could have a

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359
water so how is it you could have a
 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.030
water so how is it you could have a
black hole that only has the average

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040
black hole that only has the average
 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.920

extremely dense things well this all

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599
extremely dense things well this all
 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.330
extremely dense things well this all
depends on the amount of mass that you

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340
depends on the amount of mass that you
 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.240
depends on the amount of mass that you
have so if the earth were a black hole

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250
have so if the earth were a black hole
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.800
have so if the earth were a black hole
you'd have to take all of the earth and

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810
you'd have to take all of the earth and
 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.479
you'd have to take all of the earth and
crush it to the size of a ping-pong ball

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489
crush it to the size of a ping-pong ball
 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.330
crush it to the size of a ping-pong ball
think about how dense that would be that

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340
think about how dense that would be that
 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.830
think about how dense that would be that
would actually be on the order of a

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840
would actually be on the order of a
 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.529
would actually be on the order of a
sextillion tons within a cubic

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539
sextillion tons within a cubic
 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.719
sextillion tons within a cubic
centimeter really really dense for these

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729
centimeter really really dense for these
 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.520
centimeter really really dense for these
really massive black holes you have a

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530
really massive black holes you have a
 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.159
really massive black holes you have a
lot more mass and that means you don't

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169
lot more mass and that means you don't
 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.220
lot more mass and that means you don't
actually need the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230
actually need the
 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.890
actually need the
density to bend space quite as much one

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900
density to bend space quite as much one
 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.390
density to bend space quite as much one
of the ways I can explain this is to use

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400
of the ways I can explain this is to use
 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.370
of the ways I can explain this is to use
an analogy saying that you have a rubber

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380
an analogy saying that you have a rubber
 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.680
an analogy saying that you have a rubber
sheet and in order to get a black hole

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690
sheet and in order to get a black hole
 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.180
sheet and in order to get a black hole
you have to make the bending of the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190
you have to make the bending of the
 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.980
you have to make the bending of the
rubber really really extreme you have to

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990
rubber really really extreme you have to
 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.330
rubber really really extreme you have to
drop something under the rubber sheet

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340
drop something under the rubber sheet
 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.030
drop something under the rubber sheet
that will bend it down so maybe you have

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040
that will bend it down so maybe you have
 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.350
that will bend it down so maybe you have
something that's just the size of a

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360
something that's just the size of a
 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.420
something that's just the size of a
marble and in order to get a really good

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
marble and in order to get a really good
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.370
marble and in order to get a really good
strong bend in that sheet it has to be

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380
strong bend in that sheet it has to be
 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.210
strong bend in that sheet it has to be
the density of lead really dense now say

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220
the density of lead really dense now say
 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.770

you have something big like an elephant

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780
you have something big like an elephant
 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.540
you have something big like an elephant
you put the elephant on the rubber sheet

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550
you put the elephant on the rubber sheet
 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.430
you put the elephant on the rubber sheet
you get a lot of bending even though the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440
you get a lot of bending even though the
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.170
you get a lot of bending even though the
elephant is on average a lot less dense

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180
elephant is on average a lot less dense
 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.530
elephant is on average a lot less dense
than lead so if you have more matter it

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540
than lead so if you have more matter it
 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.410
than lead so if you have more matter it
will create a bending of space even if

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420
will create a bending of space even if
 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.140
will create a bending of space even if
it's not very dense and amazingly that

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150
it's not very dense and amazingly that
 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.790
it's not very dense and amazingly that
does mean that the biggest black holes

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800
does mean that the biggest black holes
 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.620
does mean that the biggest black holes
in the universe have the average density

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630
in the universe have the average density
 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.410
