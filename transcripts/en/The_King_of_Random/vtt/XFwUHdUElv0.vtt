It's amazing what you can get off the free
section of your local classified adds.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.089
Now for some reason, people throw

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.820
expensive things away all the time, just because they won't turn

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.500
on. But with a little ambition, some peoples
junk can be a goldmine of opportunity.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.250
Let's open this thing up and see what we can
find inside. To get started let's push a putty

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.300
knife gently under the fasteners so we can
pry them up slowly and release the catches.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.940
When enough of them are removed, the pegboard
backing pulls away, to reveal a wondrous playground

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.090
of awesome electrical components. Not to mention
a butter knife and a whole lot of dusty cobwebs.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.520
These powerful 12" speakers should be awesome,
for experiments with non-newtonian fluids,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.850
and they're probably worth around $50 each.
The foot pedal at the bottom controls 2 potentiometers,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.860
that could be repurposed for loads of electrical
projects as well. Right here we've got a rocker

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.649
switch with insulated spade connectors, and
this just the beginning. Now I took a minute

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.960
to explore how these organ keys actually play
music, and it's mind blowing how simple the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.350
mechanics really are. Now if we remove the
top panel from the organ, we can access the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.090
power controller, and salvage some of the
protective fuses, but check this out. The

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.659
mains power fuse, isn't conducting any electricity.
That means its probably been fried. So what

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.009
would happen if we tried bypassing the fuse
with a jumper cable? You can see now, that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.169
when we flip the switch, the organ fires right
up, and is working just fine. It's just that easy.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.429
Now I have a similar fuse from a previous
project, that we can use to replace the broken

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.740
one, and now that the circuits are protected
again, let's replace all the paneling, and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.829
snap the pegboard back into place. What was
once a broken piece of junk, is now back to

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.679
proper working condition, and it's purpose
has instantly been restored. I tested out

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.119
the keys and the foot pedals, then decided
to go ahead and shine the whole thing up to

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.579
look a bit nicer. When my kids figured out
we had a new noisemaker in the house, they

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.959
went crazy for it, and spent a couple of weeks,
playing with the power at their fingertips.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.319
Now at first I thought we could sell this
and make a couple hundred dollars. But then

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.009
my wife and I had a different idea. We drove
down to a local charity, wrapped the organ

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.539
in ribbons, and gave it away with a big red
bow, hoping that some family out there, would

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.599
enjoy it a little more than we did. So you
see in the end, we didn't make any money on

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.959
this deal, and I didn't get any new parts
for future projects either. But I can say

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.150
this. That now I've donated one of my organs,
to charity. Well that's it for now. If you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.099
liked this project, perhaps you'll like some
of my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
