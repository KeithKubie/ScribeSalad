Langen: One of the things
I really like about developing

00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:03.734
on the Android platform
is the ListView.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.834
Um, I've developed applications
on a number of other platforms

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:10.601
where the ListView requires you
to stuff data into the control.

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.167
It's really nice
on Android

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.334
because I can keep my
data models however I like them,

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:17.501
and the view will just request
the data when it needs it.

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.501
One of the things that I would
like to see improved in Android

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:22.601
is a bit--have a bit
more robustness added

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:24.000
to the media player class.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.667
Currently, you can only play
from, um, a URI or a file name.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:29.367
It'd be nice
to be able to play media

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:30.968
from an arbitrary
input stream.
