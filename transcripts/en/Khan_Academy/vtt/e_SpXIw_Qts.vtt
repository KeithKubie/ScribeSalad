00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.660
What I want to do in this video
is one, just do a bunch of

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.010
addition examples so that we
really get some good practice

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.865
and we really get warmed
up with addition.

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:12.940
And what I even more want to
show you is that we now have

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.085
all the tools we need to really
tackle any addition problem.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.580
So let's just get warmed up
with some one-digit addition

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.780
problems, but these are the
ones that always give me a

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.850
little bit of a headache.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.525
Let's start with a really,
relatively straightforward.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.980
I want to say 2 plus 4.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.240
Well, we know what that is.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870
I don't think we need to draw
the number line at this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.340
point, but you can if you
need to remember this.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220
2 plus 4 is 6.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.430
Not too bad.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.020
What about 9 plus 3?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.000
We saw that in the last video.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.680
9 plus 1 is 10.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.260
Plus another 1 is 11.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.600
Plus 3 is 12.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.890
9 plus 3 is 12.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.610
And it's probably
not a bad idea.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.880
It's good to visualize what's
happening here, but it's also

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.380
not a bad idea to be able
to do these very fast.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.500
To be able to memorize, at
least what the one-digit

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.990
addition problems end up being.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.640
Let's do a couple
of harder ones.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.250
6 plus 7.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.180
This one I used to find
difficult to remember.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.920
But 6 plus 7 is 13.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.250
Draw out the number lines
and the lemons and limes

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.630
if you don't believe me.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.670
6 four 7 is 13.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.640
8 plus 6 or 6 plus 8
is going to be 14.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.650
And that's the same
thing as 7 plus 7-- is

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.470
also going to be 14.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.370
And if you think about
it, we got the same

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.380
number here as there.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.150
And it makes sense, right?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.270
Because we took one away from
8, but we had one more than 6.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.050
So it's like you just shifted
the 1 from the 8 to the 6.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.360
That's why we got
the same answer.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.500
If that confused
you, ignore it.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
Let's just do a couple
of more of these.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.870
So 8 plus 8 is 16.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.920
These are things that hopefully
you'll be able to do super fast

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710
in the not too far off future.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.690
5 plus 6.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.950
Well, that's 11.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.000
Let me just do a couple
of more really fast.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.200
So let's say 7 plus 9
is going to be 16.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.550
You might want to draw
the number line if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.180
you don't believe me.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.640
And that's going to be the same
thing as 8 plus 8, is also 16.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.590
And the 9 plus 9 is 18.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.450
And then 9 plus 8 is 17.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.800
And that's just a
little bit of warm up.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.090
We didn't do all of the
possible combinations of

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.410
one-digit numbers, but these
are some of the ones that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.500
give people a little
bit more headache.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.050
So now that we've done that
let's tackle some larger digit

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.640
numbers that we started
doing in the previous video.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.070
Maybe I'll leave
that there for now.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.100
So let's do a couple of them.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.500
Let's do 22 plus 3.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.760
So we go to the ones place.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.770
2 plus 3 is 5.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.400
We didn't have to
carry anything.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.390
And then in the tens place we
just have this 2 sitting here.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.390
So we just take that 2.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.240
2 plus nothing-- it's two 10's.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.660
It's two dimes.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.810
So then we put that down there.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.210
So we get 25.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.580
2 dimes and 5 pennies, or $0.25
depending-- a lot of people,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.330
money makes it easier to
understand things or maybe

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.930
to be motivated to
understand things.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.570
All right, let's
do another one.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:24.540
What is 38 plus 17?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.770
So we look at just
the ones place.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.460
What is 8 plus 7?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.670
We haven't done that one
yet; I'll do it up here.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.110
8 plus 7 is equal to--
it's going to be one

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.560
more than 8 plus 6.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.580
8 plus 6 is 14, than 8
plus 7 is going to be

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.330
one more than that.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.020
So it's going to
be equal to 15.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.090
So in this problem we
write the 5 here.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.810
Let me write this in
a different color.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.550
So the 5 in the 15 we'd
write right down there

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.650
in the ones place.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.430
And we would carry the 1
because that's one dime.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.560
That's one 10.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.840
You know, this 15,
this is 10 plus 5.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.960
So this 1 really means
one 10 or one dime.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.630
So we put that 1 up there
in the tens place.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.210
We have 1 plus 3 is 4.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.990
Plus 1 is 5.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.710
So you get 55.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.000
1 plus 3 plus 1 is this 5.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.070
38 plus 17 is 55.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.150
Or five 10's and five 1's.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.340
That's the same thing as 55.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.510
Let's do a couple
more problems.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.480
I think you'll see that we
have the tools to tackle

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.250
anything, any problem.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.680
Let's say we have 47.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.500
Let me switch colors just
so it stays interesting.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.065
47 plus 9.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.460
We just look at the ones place.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.120
7 plus 9.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.270
We know what that is already.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.750
We did that problem already.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.960
7 plus 9 is 16.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.090
So you write the 6 in the ones
place and carry the one.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.060
And now it's in the tens place.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.050
Because this is one
10 right there.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.350
So 1 dime plus 4
dimes is 5 dims.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.850
So it's 5 dimes and 6 pennies.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.240
It's 56.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.740
Let's do slightly
harder problems.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.750
Let me scroll down a little
bit so we have some

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.740
space to work with.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.010
We always need that.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.620
All right, let's do
something hard.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.540
99 plus 88.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.520
That's a hard one.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.855
And you just have to look at
the parts of the problem and

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:34.010
you'll see how it'll
all work out.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.060
You say, what's 9 plus 8?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.640
We did that up here.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.670
9 plus 8 we know already is 17.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.380
That's a good one to remember.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.760
9 plus 8 is 17, but it's
always good to be able

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.700
to visualize it as well.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.200
so 9 plus 8 is 17.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.020
Carry the 1.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.150
And then we have
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.870
10 plus 8 is 18.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.220
Now this is interesting.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.780
We want to write 18 down.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.630
So we write our 8 down there.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.520
We have 1 plus 9 plus 8.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.560
1 plus 9 plus 8 is equal to 18.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.960
We wrote the 8 down there and
we say, let's carry the 1.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.470
We carry the 1, but we carry
it into the hundreds place.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.340
This was the ones place,
the tens place, now we're

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.190
in the hundreds place.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.730
But there's nothing else
in the hundreds place.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.250
So it just drops straight down.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.190
So you could almost just
write the 18 just like that.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.240
So 99 plus 88 is 187.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.270
Let's keep doing some examples.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.750
You could see, it's
all the same pattern.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.290
We could add two ten-digit
numbers to each other as

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.270
long as we're just careful
about carrying our digits.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.340
So let's do 700-- let
me switch colors.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.570
Well do some
three-digit numbers.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.225
Let's do a four-digit number.

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:53.430
Let's not mess around.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.880
Let's do a four-digit number.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:07.910
So let's do 4,368 plus 572.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.120
Let's see what happens here.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.950
I'll write it down here.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.490
8 plus 2.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.970
We know that that
is equal to 10.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.960
You can do the number
line if you need to.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.780
8 plus 2 is equal to 10.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.860
Put the 0 on the ones
place, carry the 1.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.180
Now we're in the tens place.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.280
This is really one 10.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.630
This is six 10's.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.800
This is seven 10's.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.120
Or you could think of
them as dimes if we're

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.710
thinking about change.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.160
So 1 dime plus 6
dimes is 7 dimes.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.550
7 dimes plus 7 dimes is 14.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.590
Let me write if like this.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:45.160
We could write 1 plus 6 plus 7
is equal to-- 1 plus 6 is 7.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.850
7 plus 7 is 14.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.830
So this right here is
going to be equal to 14.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.870
Carry the 1.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.975
Now we have-- let me do
it in another color.

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.800
I'll do it in pink.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.150
We have 1 plus 3.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.020
We're in the
hundreds place now.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.130
Plus 5.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.145
1 plus 3 plus 5.

00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:10.020
Well, 1 plus 3 is 4.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.750
Plus 5 is 9.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.990
4 plus 5 is 9, so this is
going to be equal to 9.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.390
Nothing to carry.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.720
We only had something
in our ones place.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.670
9 is just 9 pennies.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.720
It's no dimes.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.380
It's just 9 pennies.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.350
And then we go to the
thousands place.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.750
Nothing to add to the
thousands place.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.040
So you just take this 4,000--
you see a 4 here, but since

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.040
it's in the fourth digit to
the left, this means 4,000.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.200
So this 4,000 right here, we
don't have any other thousands

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.940
to add it to, so we just
bring it straight down.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.570
So you bring the 4 down there.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:50.860
So 4,368 plus 572 is 4,000--
we'll put a comma there

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.140
to make it easy to read.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:52.540
4,940.
