00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.970
CARRIE ROWE: Yeah, but I
think they won't cut

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.640
to me until my app.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.630
ALI ASHFAR: So not even
when I introduce you?

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.770
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.460
We have the single of her right
now, so if you introduce

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.503
her we can cut to that.

00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:11.350
ALI ASHFAR: OK.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.350
MALE SPEAKER: So let's see.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.600
MALE SPEAKER: Cut this?

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.040
STEVE BAZYL: And feel free
if I'm going to add

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.850
color or ask questions.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.057
ALI ASHFAR: Stupidest goddamn
Hangout I've ever seen.

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:25.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.100
ALI ASHFAR: Are we ready
for some football?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.030
Goddamn, that's dumb.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.030
STEVE BAZYL: That'd be great.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.340
Just like, hey, we've got
a mouthful of chew.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.800
Wearing our white gaiters.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.460
CARRIE ROWE: How much free
storage do users get on Drive?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.796
ALI ASHFAR: Internet.

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:39.132
STEVE BAZYL: 15.

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:39.710
ALI ASHFAR: Yeah, 15.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.420
STEVE BAZYL: 15 now.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.400
CARRIE ROWE: 15 gigabytes?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.460
STEVE BAZYL: Well, it's 15
shared amongst Gmail and.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.030
ALI ASHFAR: Plus photos?

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.500
STEVE BAZYL: Yes.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.600
ALI ASHFAR: I always forget
the other one.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.400
CARRIE ROWE: That's
something that we

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.950
announced last week, right?

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.226
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:54.718
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:56.194
So this was the outro,
I believe.

00:00:56.194 --> 00:00:57.670
And when I hit it,
I got a shot of

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.654
Carrie for some reason.

00:00:58.654 --> 00:00:59.638
And then it went green.

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:00.888
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.002
STEVE BAZYL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.480
underneath.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.728
ALI ASHFAR: It's really useful
for like 95% of cases, and

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:15.352
then every now and then you need
to do something, and then

00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:16.602
it's like what.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.500
CARRIE ROWE: App of the week.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.220
You know what would make
the GDL more fun?

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.050
Having a dog.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.750
In the GDL.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.010
STEVE BAZYL: Go bring
him down.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.430
CARRIE ROWE: We could just like
put him on the table.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.271
Cooper, sit.

00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:33.730
STEVE BAZYL: I'll
bring my cat.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.455
ALI ASHFAR: You would have to
deal with me like sneezing

00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:36.750
constantly during the--

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.440
CARRIE ROWE: That's right.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.155
Because of your allergy.

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:40.405
ALI ASHFAR: Exactly.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.260
CARRIE ROWE: Sorry we
could [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.174
STEVE BAZYL: I'll start bringing
my cats to work.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.170
ALI ASHFAR: No.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.340
CARRIE ROWE: I would like
that, actually.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.510
I like cats.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.580
ALI ASHFAR: Don't do that.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.020
See, cats are the only thing
I like less than dogs.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.670
Goldfish, that's a pet.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.360
CARRIE ROWE: How do
you feel about

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.940
animals, pets in general?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.400
ALI ASHFAR: So my favorite pet,
the one I had the closest

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.530
relationship to, was
a guinea pig.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.150
CARRIE ROWE: Oh yeah.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.830
ALI ASHFAR: Have you ever
had guinea pigs?

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.140
I've had guinea pigs since--

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.610
CARRIE ROWE: My sisters
both had guinea pigs.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.340
ALI ASHFAR: I had like loads.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.770
And they were like really
intelligent animals.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.595
CARRIE ROWE: Yeah, they're
really smart.

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:17.325
ALI ASHFAR: Really smart.

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:18.500
Really sociable.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.810
Really cool.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.750
CARRIE ROWE: So your patronus
would be a guinea pig?

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.514
ALI ASHFAR: My patronus
would be--

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.860
STEVE BAZYL: At I/O, where we
talked about how to get your

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.090
app noticed in Drive.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.370
And during that talk, we
went over a few things.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.620
A lot of this talking about the
opportunity behind Drive.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.400
As well as a few tips for how
your app can stand out among

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.490
all the apps that
are integrated.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.170
I don't want to repeat
too much of that.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.760
I want to go into a few things
in a little bit more detail

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.240
that we didn't have time to
go to during that talk.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.730
But for those who haven't yet
seen it, I would suggest later

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.110
on go and try to watch
that session online.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.250
You can find it on YouTube
or linked to off

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.560
developers.google.com.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.570
So there are a few things that
I focused on during the talk

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.290
on how to get your app
noticed that I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.250
want to show in practice.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.080
How this actually affects how
an app appears to a user.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.019
And to do that, I'm going to
take a look at one of our

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.829
sample apps.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.670
This is the Realtime Cube.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.150
It's a demo app that we
used when we launched

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.070
the Realtime API.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.350
And it's a simple 3D cube puzzle
game that you can play

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.320
with your friends.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.070
So I want to show just a
screenshot here of what the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.420
application looks
like when it's

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.120
presented to users in Drive.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.290
And you can see here, it's
a little bit hard to see.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.320
And this really speaks to the
first problem that this app

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.610
has, which is, as a user, if I
see that I'm not really going

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.770
to be enticed by that.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.060
It's a screenshot of the
application, which, by itself,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.600
isn't very interesting.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.680
And it's really hard to make
out what the app is doing

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.330
other than the cube.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.270
It's the only thing
that's really

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.540
prominent in that image.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.490
But the text is far, far, far
too small to really read

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.550
anything about.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.040
And likewise, if we were to
actually take a look at this

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.630
for real, let's take a look
at the set of apps.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.800
And you can see here, all the
different apps here have

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.890
fairly bright, fairly
large fonts.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.530
Colorful, very enticing
images that really

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.160
capture people's attention.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.360
So actually, I want
to go back here.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.582
And here's the app.

00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:31.070
And actually, that's the only
thing that this app shows us

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.980
is just the screenshot.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.150
So not a great sales job at
really enticing us to use the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.800
application.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.120
And, of course, there's the text
of this and everything.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.980
Which, in this particular
case, isn't that bad.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.320
So I'm not going to spend a lot
of time looking at that.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.050
But do realize that this stuff
is very important.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.560
And as a user, there's really
no reason why I would ever

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.390
want to install this application
just based off

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.940
that screenshot.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.060
I really want something
more from that.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.420
Kind of even a little bit more
surprising, is that screenshot

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.470
probably shouldn't have
ever been approved

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.470
in the first place.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.650
This really violates just about
every guideline that we

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.630
have for what these tiles
are supposed to be.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.300
And you can see these in
the Chrome Web Store

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.690
Documentation.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.595
But the text is unreadable.

00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:17.090
There's far too much
white space.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.630
Just everything about it just
fails on the criteria.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.250
And this is--

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.260
not to fault the person
who did this.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It is just a demo app.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.280
But it's a good teaching
lesson as well.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.060
ALI ASHFAR: Was it you?

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.405
STEVE BAZYL: No,
it was not me.

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:31.500
I'm not going to name
names, but--

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.430
ALI ASHFAR: I think
it was you.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.870
STEVE BAZYL: No.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.630
[LAUGHS]

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.810
So I took a stab at kind
of redesigning this.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.680
Fair warning, I am not
a UI designer.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.110
But I do have reasonable
skill with Photoshop.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.875
Good enough to take a stock
photo or stock image and throw

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.120
on some text.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.120
And came up with something
like this.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.650
So we have something where the
text is much more prominent.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.670
There's not a lot of it.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.160
Just the app name.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.360
Very, very short description
of what this does.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.370
We're playing.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.370
We're playing with people.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.570
It's collaborative.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.750
And some bright, colorful cubes

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.700
that catch your attention.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.490
Of course, if this were a real
app, I would want to hire an

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.860
actual graphics designer to
do this and not just whip

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.400
together something in five
minutes with a Google search.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.760
But it's a step up.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.020
And it gives you kind of an
idea, not a huge time

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.220
investment can actually make
a big difference in

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.620
how that app appears.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.150
And now when I'm looking at
this, it's actually something

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.840
that stands out.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.470
It's bright.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.460
Catches my attention.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.990
And then I'm more inclined
to go in and check out

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.240
what that app does.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.040
So one of the other things that
we talked about at the

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:49.500
I/O talk was how the data that
the app creates in Drive

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.630
appears to users.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.470
And one of the things that,
for this application in

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.880
particular, because it's a
very visual application.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.170
Actually, let's just go
over and just show you

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.360
what the app does.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.780
For those who haven't played
with it, just we can go here

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.930
and rotate cubes around.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.850
And of course, if we had
multiple people in we'd see

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.460
our collaborators up
in the corner.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.160
We would see their moves
if they were

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.730
rotating the cube as well.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.060
It's pretty fun stuff if you
like solving puzzles.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.090
And you can sit there and
torture your friends or just

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.270
screw with each other by
undoing their moves.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.230
You can have a lot
of fun with it.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.160
But anyways, so that's it.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.770
So as you can see, there's
not a lot of text.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.630
There's really not much
I can search on.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.530
It's purely visual.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:35.950
And when we look at how this app
appears, ignoring this one

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.830
up in the top left, but all we
see when we're looking at the

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.799
grid view for our Drive is just
the icon for the app.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.500
And it doesn't really
tell me much about

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.540
that particular game.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.690
Even if I go and click in here
in the light box where I get

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.060
all these really nice
previews, here

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.840
I just get no preview.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.910
So not really useful.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.670
If I have five or six puzzles
that I happen to be working

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.520
on, and I want to go and find
that particular one that I

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.130
just, oh, you know what?

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.470
I think I figured out
what the moves are.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.050
I'm going have to go and click
through each one in

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.810
order to find it.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.390
So one of the things you can do
to make this a lot easier

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.350
for users is provide a rendering
of that content.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.920
So I actually kind of mocked
it up a little bit earlier.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.000
But in this case,
using the API.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.250
Just uploading a screenshot
of the API.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.900
Now we can actually see the
state of that cube where we

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.800
last left it off.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.710
And also in here you can see, in
our thumbnail view, we can

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.050
actually see that same
image here as well.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.280
So again, if we have five or
six games, I could actually

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.640
quickly recognize what that
particular game is just by

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.030
glancing at the screen here.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.320
To do that it's really easy.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.400
ALI ASHFAR: So we have
thumbnails there.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.360
But as you showed us, the
thumbnail also appears in the

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.845
preview for the--

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:50.680
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.120
In fact, I would actually
probably rename what that

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.750
thumbnail is.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.390
Because the rules for how you
can create thumbnails are

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.120
actually pretty generous
in terms of size.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.430
You can go up to 2 megabytes of
standard image formats, PNG

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.490
is preferred.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.350
And you can actually do a fairly
high resolution image

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.510
in just that 2 megabytes.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.600
It's pretty easy to do.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.350
The only thing you have to
do is just Base64 encode

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.240
it and update it.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.390
So I actually have here in the
API's console, this is how I

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.150
was able to do it for that
particular image or that

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.360
particular file.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.760
Just use the API's console
to inject it.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.485
Really all we had to do
was set thumbnail.

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:28.920
You can actually zoom in
a little bit here.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.370
Set the MIME type and
provide the image.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.600
You're only seeing this cut
off a little bit here.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.490
But you can see there
are requests.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.430
We have a really, really,
really long Base64.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.010
Hey, I just lost my
[INAUDIBLE] here.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.700
Let's go back.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.660
Oh well, I just lost it.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.590
But basically it's a
Base64-encoded image.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.780
It does need to be
web safe Base64,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.470
which is the only catch.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.400
So you do have a choice.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.170
The only difference is just how
some of the symbols are

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.240
encoded like pluses and slashes
and equal signs.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.750
But it's pretty easy to go.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.180
If you don't have a web safe
Base64 encoder, you can just

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.100
do a quick regex and fix that.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.500
But pretty easy to inject
that image.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.880
Once you do that, you get
all the cool stuff.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.280
You get the grid view.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.790
You get the preview
images as well.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.630
You can do the same thing
for indexable text too.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.110
If this app had text, maybe we
would even want to do some

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.460
synthetic text in terms of
maybe the game state.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.070
Is the puzzle solved
or is not solved?

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.580
We could even index the move
list, all the rotations.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.830
Something that would
be interesting.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.180
So pretty easy to do.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.090
And I want to take a little
side track because

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.890
I had to fake this.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.510
And I planned on actually having
this be a live demo.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.490
And it turns out there's some
interesting issues with

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.580
capturing images of CSS 3D
transforms that make it

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.110
impossible.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.930
So things like PhantomJS, which
a lot of people use for

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.540
screenshots, don't actually
support those transforms.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.820
So I had to fake it here.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.160
But there's a couple issues
with this that I think are

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.640
worth talking about with
relation to certain apps.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.890
So the Realtime API.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.540
When you have an app that uses
it, you don't have an explicit

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.470
save point.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.130
So it's not always clear what
you should actually be

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.070
snapshotting in terms
of the image.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.080
In this case, I did
this manually.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.690
I said, this is the point
that I want to save it.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.820
But if I have a user who's
making a serious move and

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.870
they're playing for 5 or 10
minutes, do you wait for them

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.960
to close their browser?

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.810
What happens if you have
multiple people in there if

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.540
one person closes and the
other person continues?

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.650
So the idea is you don't want
to necessarily update the

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.860
image too often.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.140
Basically you're just burning
through a quota.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.770
It's wasteful.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.410
And given that these are really
just snapshots at a

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.710
point in time to help users
recognize it, you don't

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.110
necessarily need to be super
accurate in terms of making

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:02.180
sure that that preview is a
perfect representation of what

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.100
the content of the file is
at any point in time.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.070
So you can do things a
little bit lazily.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.370
Defer things.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.930
And for something like the
Realtime API, a simple trick

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.550
you can do, assuming that we
had a way to render this on

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.970
the server, would be any time
that the file is changed,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.500
queue up some sort of event.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.640
Send this in the server,
send a time stamp.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.140
And then after some period of
time, 5, 10, 15 minutes later,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.030
then you can just snapshot
that file.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.770
And then if more collaborators
come along, you may want to

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.450
coalesce all those different
modifications into one event.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.620
That way you're not burning
through your quota too quickly

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.900
in order to keep this
stuff up to date.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.310
Really it's important, but you
don't want to necessarily kill

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.830
yourself or burn through quota
too quickly in order to keep

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.710
this information up to date.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.320
Same thing for indexable text.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.130
You can do the same thing
where you don't want to

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.620
reindex on every word that
somebody's typing.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.260
Just do it at some reasonable
interval after there's a

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.070
little bit of idleness.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.810
You know, because honestly,
people aren't going to go back

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.800
and look for that file
immediately as soon as they're

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.490
done editing.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.550
They're probably going to come
back the next day, the next

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.450
week, or so on.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.690
So just put in a little delay
and you really should be fine.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.490
But anyway, I had planned on
making this all really nice

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.960
and interactive until I ran into
issues with capturing the

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.940
actual image.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.960
But for most other applications,
if you're using

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.440
Canvas or something like that,
it's really not that

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.790
difficult to do.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.380
So those were just
the two tricks.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.360
There are some things this app
does right, that I want to

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.240
point out as well.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.300
One of the things I mentioned
in the I/O talk was the

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.510
importance of the
OAuth screen.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.700
The importance of choosing
the right scopes.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.370
This app is written to use the
fewest amount of permissions

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.410
that it needs in
order to work.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.820
One of that things that was a
follow-up question during that

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.550
talk was, if you had any stats
about what the impact of

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.910
choosing the right or
wrong scope is.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.130
And I actually did a little
bit of research into that.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.360
And it turns out that the
approval rates for apps that

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.450
use a very restrictive scope,
like drive.file, is about 10%

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.290
better, actually a little over
10% better than apps that

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.080
request access to the
user's entire drive.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.360
And so users actually do pay
attention to this stuff.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.230
And it's important that when
you're building your app that

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.370
you don't necessarily choose the
scope that's easiest, but

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.670
you choose the one that's right
and reflective of what

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.570
your app actually needs to do.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.010
So that's just some examples
of how those tips from the

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.140
talk come into practice
and how they affect

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.020
how your app appears.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.300
We weren't able to show a lot
of this in the talk, but

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.070
hopefully this gives you a
little bit more context for

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.920
how these changes can impact
how your app appears.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.780
And if you haven't seen the
talk, go ahead and watch it.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.880
And of course, check back on
the community and we'll

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.605
happily have discussions about
any other follow-up questions

00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:57.220
that you might have.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.780
So that's it.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.100
I'm going to turn
it back to Ali.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.370
ALI ASHFAR: OK, thanks, Steve.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.580
That's really interesting.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.820
So remember that and make your
apps appear useful and

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.880
welcoming to users.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.780
Give them the right images.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.940
Give them the right indexable
text, give them the right

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.550
thumbnails, and people will
use your application.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.250
That make sense, I think.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.470
And this is how to do it.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.980
So thanks very much, Steve.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.920
And now we'll be going to our
regular weekly installment of

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.435
Carrie's App of the Week.

00:16:21.435 --> 00:16:22.500
CARRIE ROWE: Thanks, Ali.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.850
So today I wanted to talk
about a photo app

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.830
called Loupe Collage.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.040
And photos are really prominent

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.120
in the Drive ecosystem.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.310
I think we announced last week
across Drive and some of our

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.700
other platforms users get 15
gigabytes of shared storage.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.210
So photos are a great way for
users to take advantage of all

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.060
this storage.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.900
So let's take a look
at Loupe Collage.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.340
So I've already installed
the app.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.430
And you can see right here in
the Create interface that

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.110
we've given a lot of good
real estate to apps.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.160
So right here let's select
Loupe Collage.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.470
And once this loads, you'll see
that in the next step I

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.220
can easily add photos.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.140
And Loupe has done a great job
of integrating with lots of

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.260
different photo platforms,
including Google Drive.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.750
So when I go to Google Drive,
all of my photos are ready for

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.680
me to select to add
to this collage.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.970
And let's select a few.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.839
I'm a huge fan of animals,
as you can tell.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.599
So we'll add the photos.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.310
And there's a lot of really
fun, creative art projects

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.040
that you can do with
these photos.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.640
So let's select a coffee mug.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:34.080
And I can, once it's created,
I can have fun watching all

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.900
the animation.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.830
So once it's created,
I can save this.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:43.350
Let's call it coffee mug.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.480
And then once it's saved, I can
really easily save it back

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.620
to my Drive folder.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.630
And then when I go to Drive, I
will be able to see this right

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.512
here in my Drive.

00:17:56.512 --> 00:17:58.980
And so I can open it
up and here it is.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.420
And so this is a really great
integration with Drive.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.970
Now, Steve just talked about
how important it is to get

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.300
your app noticed inside
of Drive.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.360
And I wanted to just mention
one other thing that Loupe

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.780
could have done to have
even more visibility.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.520
So a lot of users will view
their photos in this nice

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.530
shadow box right here.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.890
They can swipe through them.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.510
One other access point
is right here

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.650
in this Open button.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.840
So when I have my photo loaded,
I can choose to open

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.000
it with certain apps.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.840
And so right here if I click
Open, I can see all the

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.110
connected apps I have.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.370
So this is a really easy
integration for Loupe.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.250
They can add it right here.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.740
So any photos that I have when
I'm viewing them, I can access

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.560
them directly from the Loupe
application by clicking here.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.230
So this is a really great
integration of a photo app

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.130
with Google Drive.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.350
We love to see developers
creating apps for photos.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.560
And we look forward to seeing
what else you guys can create.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.600
Back to you guys.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.680
ALI ASHFAR: Thanks, Carrie.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.270
So yeah, I absolutely
love that app.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:52.960
Have you used that one?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.460
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, actually I
worked with them when they

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.490
were first doing it.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.380
It's a really fun app
to play with.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.060
I have created my fair share
of collages with it.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.070
ALI ASHFAR: And of course, once
your photos are in Drive

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.600
you can share them.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.810
You can comment on them.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.720
You can do all the cool things
that Drive offers.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.850
I keep beating the drum, but
this is the place where the

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:13.920
files should be.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.030
This is where you should
put them, in Drive.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.700
So thanks very much
for that, Carrie.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.730
And hopefully we can get
in touch with Loupe

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.520
and ask them to--

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.790
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.450
That's something that should
be a pretty easy

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.480
fix for them to do.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.170
And especially for things like
opening multiple files and

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.000
everything.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.670
That support is there
in the API.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.500
Which may not have been there
when they first did the

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.220
integration, but it's about time
to go back and revisit.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.280
ALI ASHFAR: OK.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.100
So thanks, everyone.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.590
Thanks for joining us.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.480
Join us again, and over
the next few weeks

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.430
we're pretty excited.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.970
We're launching some stuff
we've been working on for

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.820
quite a long time.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.760
So please stay tuned to find
out what that all is.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.170
And hopefully we'll
see you next time.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.610
From Steve and from Carrie
and myself, goodbye.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.900
CARRIE ROWE: Bye.
