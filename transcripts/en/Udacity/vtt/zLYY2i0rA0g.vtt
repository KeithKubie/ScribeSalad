00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.600
OK, I've been a bit tricky in the last

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.670
couple of exercises because when I organized all of

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.110
the chromosomes from biggest to smallest, I left out

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.330
a pair. I left out the very last pair, because

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.720
as you noticed there is something very unique about

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.500
them. They don't match in size in the pair

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.960
the way all the other chromosomes do. In fact,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.630
they're so different, and they're important for a very different

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.980
reason, that they're not numbered like the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.680
other chromosomes. It's the 23rd pair. But each

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.540
chromosome, because it's unique from the other,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.210
has its own name. We call the bigger

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.810
chromosome the x chromosome, and the smaller

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.340
chromosome the y chromosome. Together we call these

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.370
chromosomes the sex chromosomes. All of the

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.050
rest of the chromosomes are call autosomes and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.740
the reason we make a distinct is because

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.690
the sex chromosomes X and Y determine the sex

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.430
of an individual. What we mean by sex

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.290
is whether or not the individual has male reproductive

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.630
organs or female reproductive organs. And there's a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.840
very interesting story, as to why the Y chromosome

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.490
is so much smaller than the X chromosome

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.080
and they don't match. The story is awesomely amazing,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.580
but it's really outside the scope of our course,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.930
so if you're interested you should go search for more

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.750
about it on your own. The key point here

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.450
is that the y chromosome triggers male development. So if

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.950
you have a y chromosome, you're most likely going

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.320
to develop as a male. Without a y chromosome, ultimately,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.910
the individual will develop as a female. Now I

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.100
want you to tell me. Using this set of chromosomes

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.510
that you see right here. If this was

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.050
an individual's genome, what sex would most likely

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.050
develop from this set of chromosomes? Would you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.530
expect to get a male or a female?
