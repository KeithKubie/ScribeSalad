Explain it again.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.745 align:start position:0%
My friend was just
trying to get me a tampon.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.680 align:start size:50% position:50%
Your stories are
inconsistent.

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:18.051 align:start size:78% position:22%
So we wake up in Wantagh,
New Jersey.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.053 align:start size:66% position:34%
Abbi's puking on
the side of the road.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.454 align:start size:53% position:47%
No cabs anywhere.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.489 align:start size:75% position:25%
This is our second date,
mind you.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:26.225 align:start size:63% position:38%
She wouldn't call it
a date, but, uh...

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:27.660 align:start size:31% position:69%
(laughing)
We scheme.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.595 align:start size:41% position:59%
We do scheme.

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.898 align:start size:75% position:25%
Your partner hasn't
mentioned a tampon once.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
Sir, your guess
is as good as mine.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.700 align:start position:0%
(Israeli soldier)
You're on Birthmarc,

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:39.338 align:start position:0%
yet your friend sang a Christian
song to create a diversion.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:40.706 align:start position:0%
Is she even Jewish?

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.842 align:end position:100%
Honestly, your guess
is as good as mine.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.545 align:start size:81% position:19%
Why did you move seats
to sit next to a dead man?

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:46.579 align:start size:56% position:44%
That's suspicious.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:47.780 align:start position:0%
What?
No, no.

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:49.215 align:start position:0%
He-- He was sleeping.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.317 align:start position:0%
You--

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.385 align:start position:0%
Oh, my God.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.386 align:start size:41% position:59%
The dead guy?

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:54.420 align:start size:53% position:47%
Yeah, fully dead.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:55.822 align:start size:72% position:28%
Nobody wanted the seats

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.558 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we had to sit next to each
other, obviously, so...

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.193 align:start size:53% position:47%
Yeah, it didn't
bother me at all.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.028 align:start size:53% position:47%
You said your bag
was the bomb.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:05.531 align:start position:0%
It is,
my bag is the bom--

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.634 size:84% position:42%
Okay, Google "Refinery 29,"

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.003 align:start position:0%
in quotes, "Drew Barrymore,"
in quotes.

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.472 size:78% position:39%
It's a life-changing bag,

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.475
You were asking passengers
for very strange instruments.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.876 align:start position:0%
Twine,
someone's shoelaces,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.044 align:start position:0%
heavy duty scissors.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.712 align:start size:53% position:47%
To make a tampon.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.614 align:start size:75% position:25%
What, do you think I was
making a (bleep) bomb?

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:22.849 align:start position:0%
Yeah!

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.383 size:78% position:39%
You're here for suspicion
of terrorist activity.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.519
Terrorism? I thought this was
about the weed in my pussy.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:31.756 align:start size:16% position:84%
What?
