Speaker 1:          00:00          It's that moment of getting people to see everyone involved as human, right? We're not there yet. Still the ways people are talking about addiction are,

Speaker 2:          00:08          oh,

Speaker 3:          00:11          repellent, right? This is the thing of people as being weak. I think of people's, uh, having poor willpower, poor character, and that's why they're addicted. They're most people. I would, I would say it's safe to venture, aren't really fully aware of what the causes, what the underlying causes of people becoming addicted to drugs in the first place are. And what, what leads people this great sense of despair. I mean, it's really about reengineering our entire culture. I mean, re-engineering, not just the way we treat addiction, but the way we treat human beings where we treat poor neighborhoods. I mean there's, there's so much that needs to be done that's never dressed totally right. And

Speaker 1:          00:52          there's one part of this, this a funny really when they surprises me in this debate I have found is actually easier in the u s to make the case for compassion for people with addiction problems than to make the case for liberty for drug users who are not addicted. Right? So, like we were saying, even the main drug, your body in the world, the UN ODC, you're an office of drug control admits 90% of all currently banned drug uses. What's called non problematic, right? Our friend, Professor Carl Hart is the head of Psychology at Columbia University in an extraordinary human being has done really important work explaining this to people, even with what we think of as the devil drugs like heroin crack. The vast majority of people who use heroin and crack do not become addicted. Right. Which I found really chat when Carl first explained that to me. I was like, what's this guy talking about? And then they looked at the scientific evidence that there is very clear evidence. Right? Um, the, the actually, the ratio of people who use any drug who become addicted is pretty consistently 10 to 20%. Right? Slightly higher for things like heroin, but it's pretty consistently in that zone. Right? Which is not to say that there aren't other hoe. Heroin depresses your breathing. It can cause death that way. There other harms, but we're talking about addiction. Right? Um, so

Speaker 1:          02:06          it's interesting. There's so much. I think we need to explain to people. One person here in la who really helped me to understand this and the reset for the, because guy called Professor Ronald k Siegel, you should, you should totally have in your shows is a very interesting guy. So he was an advisor to four American presidents. He was, uh, wh advisor to World Health Organization. Really serious scientist, but he had a sideline for 30 years. We investigated animals using drugs, right? And he's basically shown loads of species love getting intoxicated for the pleasure of it, right? Sure. Elephants, elephants like this amazing example of I've in Golub elephants who broke into an alcohol store, got really drunk and just fucked up the whole village. Right? There's a bit of a great example. You gave what you give, if you give hashed to mice, what they do is they'll, they get really horny.

Speaker 1:          02:50          They try to male, nice. We'll try to mount women, but then they basically can't get it up. So they just spend hours looking their own balls and they're going to cock, uh, Saturday loads of examples. It's a pretty guy. Pressy. Got, I remember he told me at one point that he'd spent three years investigating, um, grasshoppers in cannabis fields who just naturally live in cannabis fields to figure out when they eat the cannabis, do they jump higher or lower? And I said, I write and at the end of your three years, what did you discover? And he said they'd turns out they just dumped the same height as everyone all the other girls offers. So it's not really, that wasn't a great use of your three years of life. But he also got the, had an interesting time when he was in Hawaii, he was investigating Mangu where the mongoose is like hallucinogen psychedelics and he, so he's like spying on these mongooses with, with we've been oculus and it gets caught and it gets caught by a loaded drug traffickers and they're like, who the fuck are you?

Speaker 1:          03:43          And he's like, don't worry, I'm just investigating whether Mongoose is like psychedelics. Like that is the worst fucking cupboard story we've ever had that held them hostage for like two days. But he showed us something I think is really important and there's loads of other evidence sport, which is, um, it is absolutely a Nate to other species, especially to humans. The desire to get intoxicated, right. There has never been a human society anywhere in the world where people didn't seek out and toxicants and enjoy using them. The only society where there are no naturally occurring in toxicants was the anyway, the what we used to be called the Eskimos and the architect and they used to just starve themselves to get a fucked up head state because that's how deep it is in human beings. If there is nothing in there. Yeah. If you starve yourself long enough, you get a kind of fucked up head state basically.

Speaker 1:          04:27          How far, how long are you going to go for? I don't know. I looked into the details of it, but he writes about that. Um, but, but so it's fasting. Yeah. Fast and courses and all to Ted State. But that, I've never done it, but that, this, this, this intoxication imposters is deepen human beings. As the sexual impasse, you even see it in small children. You know, when a little kid, everyone will remember this memory of when you're a little kid and you realize you can spin round and round and round even though you know it'll make you sick, you'd do it cause you get an altered headspace. That is one of the first expressions of the kind of intoxication impulse. Um, or a really nice example is for 2000 years, uh, 40 miles outside of Athens in ancient Greece, they used to be, um, once a year people would meet at something, a place called the temple of Hallucis and it was basically burning man.

Speaker 1:          05:14          They would all use a psychedelic together. We now know what that like Docker's yeah, it was a kind of, there's lots of different theories but they think it was a kind of fungus basically. Um, I remember the name of it, but there's been research, Liz and Simon or something. Is that, I don't know, I want to say it wrong. I, there was some kind of stuff I kind of psychedelic mushrooms and like people like Plato and Eris. Sometimes people say no drugs or William Bennett, the former drugs are saying drugs are an attack on the foundations of Western civilization. And you're like, no. At the actual foundations of Western civilization, the people your holding up as the icons, like Plato and Aristotle were literally getting fucked up in exactly the way you say is an attack on them. Right? It's this deep misunderstanding. So this is a natural human impulse. We are never going to get rid of it. We want to get rid of it. It gives people a lot of joy and pleasure. And yet the Oscar Wilde said once, I'm going to get the quote slightly wrong, you said it better than this, but you said, puritanism is the deepening fear that someone somewhere is enjoying themselves. And there's this puritanical hatred of, of drug use, right? Um, now some of that is understandable fears, Matt genuine harms. Uh, and that's a different thing. But a lot of it is just very deep. Puritanism and yeah.
