00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.560
Sure climate change is bad but at least it’s
not causing more cases of flesh eating bacteria

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.519
or something… no you’re kidding, seriously?

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.719
Hey global citizens, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.180
We talk about climate change a lot here, probably
because it’s a massive looming problem that

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.340
will affect the globe in profound ways.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.369
You already know most of them by heart I’m
sure: melting ice caps, rising sea levels,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.779
changing rainfall patterns that lead to droughts
and food shortages.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.140
All bad stuff that’s in the not too distant
future.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.430
But what if I told you that climate change
is causing problems already, and some of them

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.500
are truly unexpected?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.140
Take for example a recent anthrax outbreak
in Siberia.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.039
If you’re like me, you only know anthrax
as this white powder that gets mailed to someone

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.820
and then everyone freaks out because it could
kill you.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.500
So you may be wondering what madman is mailing
a bioweapon to people in one of the most remote

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.010
places in the world.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.920
But in reality, the bacterium that causes
anthrax infections, Bacillus anthracis, occurs

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.780
naturally and infects an estimated 2,000 people
each year.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.760
Back in the early 20th century, anthrax outbreaks
were common in Siberia.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.440
Anthrax infections killed over a million reindeer,
and they were buried in about 7000 burial

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.590
grounds by the indigenous Nenets.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.010
But since then it’s been quiet, with the
last outbreak in Siberia happening in 1941.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.360
Now the same bacteria that caused those outbreaks
could be responsible for the 20 Siberians

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.740
who contracted anthrax in August of 2016,
and I do mean the exact same bacteria.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.170
The current hypothesis is after the infected
reindeer were buried, the bacteria were essentially

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.090
refrigerated by the permafrost heaped on top
of them.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.230
Now that temperatures are climbing upward,
that frozen soil is starting to thaw, unleashing

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.070
spores across the tundra and infecting reindeer
and people anew.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.400
If rising temperatures are the culprit, then
the Nenets can expect anthrax outbreaks every

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
summer.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.540
There could be other dormant bacteria up there
waiting to be reawakened too, like bubonic

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.940
plague, or a disease that hasn’t occurred
naturally since 1977, smallpox.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.390
Climate change might be doing more than revive
frozen microbes north of the Arctic circle;

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.280
it could be helping microbes closer to the
equator too, like Vibrio vulnificus.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.870
That little guy is also known as a flesh-eating
bacteria, and it does well in warm and brackish

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.890
waters.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.320
Guess what climate change causes more of?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.900
Warm and brackish waters.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Global incidents of V. vulnificus have been
steadily rising for the last 4 decades.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.260
Now there are about 80,000 cases in the US
each year.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.550
Before you shout that correlation does not
necessarily equal causation and bring a tear

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.750
of joy to my eye like a proud parent, a study
in June published in the Proceedings of the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.390
National Academy of Sciences found that warmer
surface ocean temperatures are causing blooms

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.660
of the bacteria and are associated with the
increased incidence of infection in Northern

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.080
Europe and the US Atlantic coast.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.500
Most of the infections come from eating contaminated
seafood raw and in those cases the cholera-like

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.840
symptoms like diarrhea, cramping, and fever
usually pass after 3 days.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.590
But Vibrio can also find it’s way into open
cuts, causing lesions that grow rapidly.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.980
20% of the time these infections are fatal.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.240
Climate change isn’t some far-off problem
with hypothetical impacts that will be felt

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.380
50 years from now.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.130
It’s creating problems already, and some
of these problems come out of left field,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.510
like these revived and revitalized bacteria.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.690
Don’t worry though, because the hotter temperatures
can kill bacteria too!

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.510
Except that’s happening in deserts, where
the bacteria helps keep the soil from eroding.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.990
Seriously climate change, can you just chill
out?

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.160
Another unexpected side effect of climate
change?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.910
A refugee crisis.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.350
Seeker Stories has more info on that here.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.170
And climate change might be happening faster
than we expected.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.340
Trace has more info on that, here.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.170
Now have you noticed the changing temperatures
affecting your life in ways you didn't expect?

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.030
Like I for one basically can't play PC games
anymore without my room turning into a sauna.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.410
