00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:02.410
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
also to the organizers.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.490
This is a privilege to be
with such a great group,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.070
and I'd like to learn from
you as well as sharing

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.420
some of my own thoughts.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.470
I think this side of
the table represents

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.420
the cream of the crop.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.320
These people are the
best of the best.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.220
And so if you're able to
get a manuscript accepted

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.280
with either of these presses,
you are in terrific hands.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.610
They will tailor and craft it,
the length, the illustrations,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.110
all of that.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.520
Having an editor to try
to really tighten up

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.124
some of the prose is
just a fantastic thing.

00:00:29.124 --> 00:00:31.540
I'm going to maybe take the
opposite approach a little bit

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.200
and talk about life
for the rest of us

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.770
when we're not
quite so fortunate

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.880
or we're in a very narrow
field or we're aiming

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.790
at a very specific audience.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.890
And that's been my own
personal experience.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.570
I'm an Egyptologist, and
that's not for everybody.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.570
So that's pharaonic history
and hieroglyphs and pyramids

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.340
and mummies and
things like that.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490
In trade publications, of
course, you've seen them.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.130
There are plenty of
coffee table books

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.450
about everything you
can imagine-- Cleopatra

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.850
and how the pyramids
were built and all

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.060
of these sorts of things.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.890
But for scholars coming up,
there are much more narrow

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.940
and focused dissertations.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.370
And in my own
experience, I've become

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.142
a sort of a hybrid mutant
in the publishing world.

00:01:10.142 --> 00:01:11.850
And at the risk of
seeming like the enemy

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.280
to my esteemed
colleagues here, I'll

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.730
tell you a bit more
about my experience.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.230
One of the things
that fascinates me

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.930
about ancient Egypt
is its iconic nature,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.570
its graphical nature,
so the pictorial aspect

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.370
of the language and
things like that.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.840
So I've been involved from
the beginning with epigraphy

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.400
and drawings and reproductions.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.200
And pictures play almost as
large a part in my publications

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.860
as the words do.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.060
So I realized early on--
I think back in the '80s

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.490
when the first Macintoshes
were coming out-- I

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.840
instantly saw this
wonderful connection

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.100
between the ancient Egyptian way
of thinking and this now user

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.980
interface graphically-oriented
way of computing.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.940
And so I saw the Macintosh
as this way for someone

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.470
like me, a
non-programmer, to get

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.860
into the design and the
layout and the word processing

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.060
side of things.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.864
And so I spent a tremendous
amount of time realizing no one

00:02:00.864 --> 00:02:03.280
was going to pay for my books
and to have them beautifully

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.380
designed and edited
and all that,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.229
that I needed to take on
some of those roles myself.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.970
And I did.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.770
So my original thesis,
which was actually

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.710
an undergraduate
thesis here and which

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.690
was published several years
later in a monograph series

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.250
in Germany, I can safely
say I designed it myself.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.430
And it's probably the world's
ugliest academic publication

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.650
ever produced, with an
amazing array of fonts

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.150
and dot matrix hieroglyphs.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.030
And I'm too embarrassed
to bring it today.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.440
But it's a learning process.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.790
And by force, really, and the
fact that I'm a control freak,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.870
I try to pick up as many of
the pieces of this puzzle

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.500
as I could.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.630
So from altering traditional
Times Roman fonts

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.700
into transliteration
fonts, you know,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.190
H's with dots under them and T's
and D's with lines under them

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.680
so that you could transliterate
hieroglyphs and inscriptions

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.570
and things and then
working with computer

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.430
hieroglyphic fonts
and typefaces.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.430
And now, of course,
they're a dime a dozen,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.620
and it doesn't matter if
you're on a Mac or a PC,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.350
all of these tools are there.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.170
And from there, it's
learning what dots

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.510
per inch means and
Photoshop files

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.750
and what is publishable quality
and what is just for use

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.670
on the web or the screen.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.490
Same with line art
and drawings, there's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.680
a-- what was the word they used?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.670
Complications, I
think, illustrations.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.670
They certainly do
represent complications,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.590
but by dabbling into
each of these fields

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.120
and then moving from
Word to FrameMaker

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.160
to QuarkXPress, and
now to Adobe InDesign,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.740
I've been able to take on
enough of these skills, I think,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.950
where I can lay out the
books the way I see fit.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.820
And so that is for those cases
where you're not lucky enough

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.160
to have Harvard Press behind
you and wonderful professional

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.830
designers there, the more of
those pieces of the puzzle

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.330
you can control, even if
you're not doing it yourself,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.390
but at least understand
some of the jargon,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.360
I think that really
helps get a leg up

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.730
if you're talking about
a limited monograph

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.090
series in academic
press, places where

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.760
you're going to have to come
out with the publication subsidy

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.670
yourself.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.680
They will take
your book on if you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.322
can fork over the
$40,000 or the $70,000

00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:09.780
from somewhere to
get it published,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.040
that certainly helps.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.450
And that means you have to
know what you're dealing with.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.529
How can you figure out
what that Microsoft Word

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.279
document shrinks down to in
a typeset laid out document?

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.050
How many pages
would it really be?

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.362
How many illustrations do you
need, and are they full page?

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:26.820
Do they really need
to be that big?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.100
Or can they be half
page or quarter page?

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.445
Do you need color?

00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:32.820
And, if so, does it have to
be peppered through the text?

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.444
That's a lot more
expensive, because it

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.040
means all your
signatures have to go

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.170
on a four-color or
a six-color press.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.130
Or can they be bunched
at the end of the book?

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.610
So most of the book is
much cheaper to produce,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.730
because it's just
black ink and then just

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.410
a section of color
plates, for example.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.440
Does it need to be hardcover or
does it need to be paperback?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.310
Does it need a dust jacket?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.200
These are all the
types of formal specs

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.580
that any printer
is going to want

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.000
to know if they're going to
move ahead with your project.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.220
So estimating those
types of things

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.284
and having a handle
on that is good.

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:05.950
I brought a couple
of examples, and I'll

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.220
show you just one simple
benefit of this kind of control.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.188
I did a book on a bunch
of Egyptian tombstones

00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:17.990
which are rectangular, and
so because I was controlling

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.984
the process, I get
to make the book

00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:21.695
like this instead of vertical.

00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:23.890
And that's the
kind of thing that

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.014
maybe working with
an editor, you

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:27.430
may not have that
kind of freedom.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.230
They're used to doing vertical
books for all kinds of reasons.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.355
And there are good reasons.

00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:33.730
This one doesn't fit on
a bookshelf very well.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.330
It sticks out quite a bit.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.070
But that's one of the advantages
of controlling these aspects

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.544
of the design process.

00:05:41.544 --> 00:05:43.460
So over the years, I got
more involved in this

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.980
and produced my own
publications this way,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.440
working with
printers, of course,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.930
obviously, and going
on press myself.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.110
And then expanded a
little bit and started

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.210
producing Egyptological
publications

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.190
for the Metropolitan
Museum, for Penn,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.960
for Yale, Brown University,
for other places.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.760
And that actually brought in
a decent amount of income,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.330
even though these are not
trade publications they're not

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.550
bestsellers, but it
was an interesting sort

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.110
of side source of income for
me, which was not insubstantial.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.810
The books themselves
don't make money.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.620
These are probably
money losers, but I'd

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.470
suggest at this stage in
your career you're not really

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.460
out to make millions
with a trade publication.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.540
You're getting your
new scholarship,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.870
your new research out there.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.775
So in a case like this, there
are 500 copies of this book.

00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:31.100
It costs a lot to produce,
sells for about $150.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.190
That's probably beyond your
normal price point, right?

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.090
By contrast, when I needed a
break from my dissertation,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.340
I did a children's
book, which was just

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.750
the hieroglyphic alphabet book.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.660
And that was picked
up by Scholastic Press

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.530
and reprinted as a
paperback for $5.95,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.460
and that sold about 200,000
copies across the country.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.699
So it's quite a change between
these different areas of focus.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.240
And I think you hit
on the right term

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.000
with diversity, who
you're aiming at,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.290
what your audience is.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.480
Are you trying to show
your new research?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.530
Focus on the colleagues
in your maybe small field,

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.070
or are you trying to
do a trade publication

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.580
or go with one of
the big presses?

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.790
Those are all key.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.770
So the advantages
for me were feeling

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.190
in control of the process, being
able to produce the graphics I

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.022
needed, do the layouts I want,
choose the format of the book

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:19.230
and that sort of thing, work
with different printers.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.800
The disadvantage, I would
say, is that all of that

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.259
has come out of my
own research time.

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.800
So the number of books I have
written and produced personally

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.150
would, I feel, be much
larger if, of course,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.400
I hadn't been spending a
lot of that time producing

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.880
books for colleagues.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.100
So in a sense, it was
enriching because I

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.049
got to know my colleagues, I
got to read their works, which

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:40.590
are in my field and, of course,
I was very interested in them

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.300
as well.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.420
But, again, all of
that technology time

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.280
comes out of my academic
time and my research time.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.360
So I'd say be aware
of those issues.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.470
What are you writing?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.120
What formats does it have?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.780
What kinds of additional
challenges are you facing?

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.540
And then you'll
be better equipped

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.700
to choose the publishers
that are interested,

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.230
see what kind of subsidies
may or may not be necessary,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.310
and to try to take
the process from there

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.170
and then be more in control
of what's happening.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.420
That's not for everyone.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.720
And, as I said, this is a
very strange and quirky sort

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.240
of career path that I've
taken, where the design

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.114
aspect is so much of it.

00:08:16.114 --> 00:08:18.280
But even if you're going
to hand that manuscript off

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.100
to someone else, it's good to
know what a designer is then

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.300
going to be doing.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.210
And as a final
caution, I'd say keep

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.380
track of the entire process.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.350
And going forward, there is the
challenge that books like this

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.410
could be a bit of a dinosaur.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.679
And I don't know how much
longer museums and universities

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.700
will be wanting to see these
small print run publications

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.230
going.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.240
And so think about the
conversion of your book

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.450
to other types of reading.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.390
Would you rather
lug this around?

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:46.890
Here.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.530
Here's the thickness comparison.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.770
Would you rather lug this
around or that around?

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.360
And so often I see colleagues
work so hard on a book,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360
send it off, it goes
perhaps to a designer

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.550
and then to the press.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.330
And then they
totally lose interest

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.290
in the final digital files.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.737
And they're on some designer's
computer in another state,

00:09:05.737 --> 00:09:07.070
and no one knows where they are.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.611
And was that really
the final version

00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.980
when we corrected that
plate or that drawing?

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.850
And I think that's
just shameful.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.800
If you can hang onto
the final book files,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.630
if you designed them, or know
where the designer is and try

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.610
to get hold of those, there
will be an electronic version

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.820
down the road or a
web version or ways

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.160
to reach a larger audience that
your perhaps small print run

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.540
book couldn't do.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.467
So do try to keep track of that.

00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:32.050
I think you'll find
more and more that

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.620
will be the way to go as these
kinds of portable devices

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.990
pick up steam and get
ever more popular.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.610
That is my contribution.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.130
I'm hoping that's
not too at odds

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.650
at what the professional
presses have to contribute.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.800
But I'd welcome your
feedback and questions

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.080
for any of the panel.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.280
Thanks.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.330
