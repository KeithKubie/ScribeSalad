ANJALI WHEELER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.100
My name is Anjali Wheeler and
I'm the tech leader of 360

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.070
and 3D videos at YouTube.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.077
So I'm going to talk
about three things today.

00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:17.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.400
Thank you.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.830
So I'm going to talk
about three things today.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.200
I'm going to talk
about to 360 video.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.530
I'm going to talk
about 3D video.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.330
And then we mix
the two together,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.650
and we talk about
360 and 3D together.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.830
So by a show of hands, how many
of you have seen a 360 video?

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.518
How many of you have
seen a spherical video?

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:43.910
AUDIENCE: What's the difference?

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.535
ANJALI WHEELER:
They're the same thing.

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:46.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.790
Thanks for asking.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.350
OK, so they're called
spherical videos,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.419
because you can imagine
a viewer sitting inside

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:56.460
in the middle of the sphere
and looking outwards,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.126
and that worldview.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.174
I would have liked to create
one, but it's too much work.

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:03.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.930
So what do spherical
videos looks like?

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.960
So they're essentially
a sphere which

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.210
is projected onto
a flat surface,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.610
and we call this
method projection.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.100
And this method has been used
for a long time by map makers,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.500
because the Earth
is a sphere, and we

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.880
like maps on a flat surface.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.220
So this is a projection which
we call equirectangular,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520
and as you can see,
it's essentially

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.970
like a sphere, just
unwrapped and flattened out.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.850
There are several
other projections

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.790
that have been used,
like the world map.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.030
That's another example of
equirectangular projection.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.130
And let's see these.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.870
There's the quincencial on the
left, and there's the Goode.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.620
And just as an
example, we want to use

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.280
things which are rectangular.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.445
And the one on the right
that is not rectangular,

00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:01.010
it's not useful for us, because
there are lots of wasted pixels

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.650
there.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.140
So we don't use those
kinds of projections.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.300
So let's talk about
how we shoot 360 video.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.580
Today, there are lots of
cameras in the market which

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.560
can shoot 360 videos.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.510
I have one here to show.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.660
That's a Ricoh Theta.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.700
It has two lenses on both sides.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.850
They both take a 180
degree view of the world.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.960
And once it shoots, they are
like all of these cameras,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.450
have multiple lenses.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.750
And the video
streams are several,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.320
depending on the
number of lenses.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.440
And after that, you use
a stitching software

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.670
to stitch them all together
into a single video frame.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.710
So that's about capture.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.430
Now once this video is ready,
you can upload it to YouTube.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.510
So how does YouTube
know whether it's a 360

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.010
video or a standard video?

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.630
We tried several things there.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.980
We tried auto-detection
to see-- we

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.500
had a filter that
will automatically

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.720
find out if a video is 360.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.620
And the problem was, the
auto-detector was very good,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.280
but it was not perfect.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.550
And when you go
to YouTube scale,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.320
even a 0.1% error is very big.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.077
Imagine you uploading a 360,
and it's appearing weird,

00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:17.910
and people who are
uploading standard video,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.970
and that doesn't show up right.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.440
So that wasn't enough for us.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.662
Than we thought, OK,
let's do a check box.

00:03:25.662 --> 00:03:27.120
When people upload
a video, they'll

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.960
tick a check box-- my
video is spherical.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.440
It shows up very well.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.190
It doesn't work.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.100
And we tried it before
with the 3D videos.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.820
So people uploaded 3D videos,
and there was a check box,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.060
and the problem
was, a lot of people

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.280
didn't know how to
use it correctly

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.140
There were people whose videos
were not 3D that checked it,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.970
and people with videos who
want 3D and it didn't check it.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.180
And everyone was
frustrated, including us.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.600
And so that didn't work well.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.610
So we thought, OK,
the best way is

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.790
to have the 360 cameras include
some metadata in the video

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.370
to tell YouTube that
this video is 360.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.990
And we approached the 360
camera makers with this idea.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.750
We created a spec
for the metadata that

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.900
can be introduced into the
file, and the camera makers

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.899
like this idea.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.880
They agreed to put
it in the file.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.149
So this works.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.730
And for a few cameras which
don't have the metadata,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.100
we have a Python script that
you can run on your video.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.250
It's not great.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.960
I'm sorry.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.460
But I hope that in future,
with time, all cameras

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.980
are going to put the
metadata in the file.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.650
So with that, let's
talk about render.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.020
So how do we render 360 videos?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.110
We need some sort of a 3D
API, OpenGL, or DirectX

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.620
and we map the
decture of the video

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.190
onto these sphere mesh, just
the way it's supposed to be,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.360
as per the projection.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.900
And it works.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.480
We have gravity
and gyro sensors,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.810
so when you move your
device, the view pans.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.700
Has everyone used it
on a mobile device?

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.930
How many of you have used
it on a mobile device?

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.910
OK, cool.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.240
And so we call this mode
the magic window mode.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.660
And that's because this device
is like a magical window

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.680
into another world, and you
can move this window around,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.720
and it moves you
into the other world.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.240
And the other is, of
course, the VR mode.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.680
So that's cool.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.930
I sort of have some sort of
a personal affinity to VR.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.745
In the '80s, they were the
first set of VR headsets

00:05:41.745 --> 00:05:42.530
that showed up.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.990
And they weren't really great.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.080
They were three 20
by 200 resolution.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.560
They had five frames per
second, and they were heavy.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.460
And nobody liked it,
and so I was bummed out.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.850
Then in 1999, "The
Matrix" showed up,

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.360
and I was again revved up.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.580
Yay, VR!

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.770
But, again, the world
was not ready for VR.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.330
So I did the neatest
thing I could do.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.830
I joined 3D FPS gaming job.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.580
Anyways, so I'm happy that, now,
we are in a much better place

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.480
far VR, and the chances of
this succeeding this time

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.190
around a pretty high.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.075
So with that, let's
talk about the quality

00:06:25.075 --> 00:06:28.090
of spherical videos.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.490
So in this projection that
we've been talking about,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.850
there's a horizontal
field of view of 360,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.150
and a vertical of 180.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.780
This gives us six
pixels per degree.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.310
So who knows what is the
I-resolution in terms

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.390
of pixels per degree?

00:06:48.198 --> 00:06:49.134
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:50.217
ANJALI WHEELER: Pardon me?

00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:51.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:52.349
ANJALI WHEELER: Yeah.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.390
So it's a 60 pixels per
degree, of [INAUDIBLE] minute.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.000
So we are at 6, we
want to go to 60.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.200
How do we go from 6 to 60?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.490
And we are researching several
things to go from 6 to 60.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.760
So it's the eye's
retina resolution.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.930
And one of the
ideas is cropping.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.440
Let's crop the top
and the bottom,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.123
because people
don't look up when

00:07:15.123 --> 00:07:16.864
they are watching
the 360 videos,

00:07:16.864 --> 00:07:18.780
or they don't spend time
looking at the floor.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.650
They look forward.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.280
So how about we crop
them out, and then we

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.430
get close to ten
pixels per degree.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.410
The other ideas are tiling.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.850
Let's have several streams, and
when people turn their heads,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.570
you switch to a new stream.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.580
And dialing gives us another
advantage in horizontal.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.280
We get almost 10.6.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.690
We you combine them together.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.410
We get 10 on both
sides, approximately.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.720
And 4K [INAUDIBLE] are
just around the corner.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.170
They're right there.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.500
And so that takes us to 20.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.600
So that's good.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.320
We are close.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.070
So that's one of the
things we're trying

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.090
to do-- improve the quality.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.070
And another thing that is
tough with the spherical videos

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.260
is just the sheer
amount of data.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.940
So if you look at this
image, the area under the red

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.740
is the area captured
by a standard video.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.100
And we have like four
times more things there.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.810
And add depth and 3D to
it, it gets even worse.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.420
So that's another area
we'd like to improve upon.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.310
So that's about 360, and
I'm going to talk about 3D

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.010
after this.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.720
So are there any
questions so far?

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.090
Yes, please.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.495
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:41.370
ANJALI WHEELER: Yeah.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.720
But those features, we are
doing on a, you could say,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.190
platform-by-platform basis.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.800
So on the web, we support
zooming in and out.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.970
And on other clients,
we do wish to.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.970
And I cannot say
when we'd do it.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.750
So let's talk about 3D.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.560
It's sort of an old
story, but I feel

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.940
like I should talk about
it before we talk about 3D

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.910
and spherical together.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.840
And so how do
humans perceive 3D?

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.220
This is a perfectly 2D image.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.790
And I'm pretty sure
everyone of you

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.330
here can figure out what's
far away and what's close by.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.242
So human can completely make
sense out of a completely 2D.

00:09:25.242 --> 00:09:29.150
You could see a picture and
know what's far, what's near,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.320
but we know that this is fake.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.960
This is not real depth.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.500
And so we perceive 3D by
something by disparity.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.300
We have two eyes at two
different locations that see

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.320
two different use the world.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.295
And we compute the difference,
and we figure out what's far

00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:46.540
and what's near.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.350
So that's what we
try to replicate

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.800
when we do 3D in computing.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.490
And

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.730
one example is, there
are 3D cameras, which

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.290
just have two lenses set exactly
the same distance as human eye.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.750
And they capture two
views, and we can just

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.770
put them side by side.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.410
We can put them top and bottom.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.650
And people have tried
every possible way

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.660
to do it-- interlaced and
temporal alternate frames-- one

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.860
for the left eye, one
for the right eye.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.410
And all of them
produce, more or less,

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.170
similar results where there's a
viewing instrument that people

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:27.050
wear to filter the left and
the right eye correctly.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.010
So we can always
watch a 2D view of 3D

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.166
through one of the eyes'
view and just watch it in 2D.

00:10:35.166 --> 00:10:42.080
This is the anaglyph, or
these red and blue filters.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.200
And we could polarized, which
most movie theaters do that,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.550
and a lot of TVs have
organized glasses support too.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.320
One downside with
polarization is

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.910
that it cuts the
brightness in half,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.670
so the TV or the movie theater
has to be twice as bright.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.462
Then we have VR.

00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:05.430
Cool.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.320
So that's about 3D.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.345
So before I talk about
spherical, any questions on 3D?

00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:15.845
No.

00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:17.120
Cool.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.100
So now we're going to
mix the two together.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.110
We talked about top-bottom.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.320
We talked about equirectangular.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.020
And we mix the two
together, and we

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.460
get equirectangular top-bottom.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.520
And that's the most
popular way today

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.800
to represent spherical videos.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.460
How do we capture them?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.130
JUMP.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.610
There's a talk right after me.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.500
You'll learn about JUMP there.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.380
So let's talk about playback.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.920
Playback is, again,
two of the same idea.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.260
There's a magic window mode,
and there's a cardboard view.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.960
And that's how people will be
able to enjoy spherical 3D.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.920
We don't support it yet,
but we do plan to soon.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.130
And so that's rendering part.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.540
But when we introduce
3D, there are

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.260
a lot of things that
are needed to make

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.740
the users comfortable--
like, some people

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.830
get motion sick
when they watch VR,

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.580
and some people get headaches.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.450
And so there are
some things to keep

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:29.130
in mind, for example, the IPD,
or the interpupillary distance.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:36.310
So humans come in all shapes and
sizes, and so people whose eyes

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.050
are closer together, they
are not very comfortable

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.270
when they see VR, which is
made from the point of view

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.700
of somebody whose eyes
are farther apart.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.120
So it's, essentially,
the head size.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.450
And so we need to make
sure that the IPD is

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.675
right for the person,
and maybe provide a way

00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:56.070
to calibrate and adjust for it.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.190
They are field of view issues.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.930
So there's been
research done on it,

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.600
and it was found that people
are more comfortable when

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.620
the field of view is hire.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.245
People also get motion sick
more when the field of view

00:13:09.245 --> 00:13:10.436
is higher.

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:13.890
So there's no good,
great path there.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.660
It's a balance act.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.800
And the third thing
is latency-- like when

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.870
people move their
head, how long does it

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.690
take for the image to move?

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.470
And that's, again,
something that

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.840
needs to be as low as possible.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:37.071
So there's the tech aspects of
360, 3D, and the YouTube part.

00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:38.057
Thank you.

00:13:38.057 --> 00:13:41.508
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:41.508 --> 00:13:47.688
