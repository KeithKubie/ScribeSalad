the last half I say I'd say almost the

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.110
the last half I say I'd say almost the
 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.070
the last half I say I'd say almost the
last two-thirds of this movie and just

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080
last two-thirds of this movie and just
 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.260
last two-thirds of this movie and just
just how phenomenally bored I was I

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270
just how phenomenally bored I was I
 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.999
just how phenomenally bored I was I
really think the problems I have with

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:52.009
really think the problems I have with
 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:53.890
really think the problems I have with
this film like the criticisms I'm making

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:53.900
this film like the criticisms I'm making
 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.810
this film like the criticisms I'm making
are ones that everyone else made of the

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820
are ones that everyone else made of the
 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.990
are ones that everyone else made of the
first film but my big the big difference

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000
first film but my big the big difference
 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.879
first film but my big the big difference
I have is that I really think by

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:00.889
I have is that I really think by
 

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:03.129
I have is that I really think by
splitting it up it made the story move

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:03.139
splitting it up it made the story move
 

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:06.010
splitting it up it made the story move
so much slower and you couldn't get the

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:06.020
so much slower and you couldn't get the
 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.080
so much slower and you couldn't get the
investment in there as much alright at

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.090
investment in there as much alright at
 

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.209
investment in there as much alright at
