PAVNI DIWANJI: Ah, so we have
a bunch of makers and hackers

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.540
in the audience.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.770
That's always good.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.340
Right?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.140
So we are really, really
enthused to have you

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.350
all again here at Google.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.010
We are committed,
as you all know,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.420
to the cause of encouraging
every woman to be a techmaker.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.160
And I'm very committed
to encouraging

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.590
every woman I meet to be
a software engineer, not

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.390
because I think it
benefits Google,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.540
but I think it
benefits the world.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.910
Because I believe
that is what is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.380
going to be the engine
of life for the future.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.680
And we want to equip our side
of the house, our population,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.850
to be tooled, no matter what
discipline they go after.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.490
So I was here last year.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.670
And I was really
pleasantly surprised

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.420
that it is growing and growing.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.590
And I talked last year about
my journey and my learnings.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.110
And it is really amazing to see
how many common elements there

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.290
are in all our stories--
my story, the stories

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.020
of the speakers today, and
also, of course, your stories.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.360
I could tell from the questions.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.360
I almost wanted to
answer all of them,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.020
because having taken
off time for kids?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.550
Yup.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.790
Done it.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.415
Have had a difficult on-ramp?

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:31.970
Yup.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.810
Done it.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.780
All the problems you run into.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.400
So I'll be around if you want
to talk about that afterwards.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.590
But today I think I was
given the responsibility

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.960
to conclude the day.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.730
And I was thinking,
what would be

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.070
the three big things that
you can take away from today?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.830
And I will tell
you my nominations,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.380
and then we can of course talk
after about what you took away.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.270
And that's always good.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.760
So the first thing I want
to talk about is stretch.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.410
And I think making
uncomfortable your norm.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.880
So Avni, our keynote
speaker today,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.240
talked a little bit about it.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.610
She's an amazing woman.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.137
She said, stretch
your imagination.

00:02:22.137 --> 00:02:23.970
But I think it applies
to everything you do.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.370
So I would say
stretch your skills.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.060
Put yourself in new situations.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.730
And I would say not
only in your career,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.780
but even in your personal life.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.120
Forcing change, I have found,
is a fabulous way to grow.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.300
And what I always tell myself is
that awful feeling you get when

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.360
you're trying to
do something new,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.740
I think that's a good
thing, not a bad thing.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.030
And I've always applied
that throughout my career.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.700
I remember when I was
with Sun Microsystems,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.880
and we'd just
published Java, and I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.470
was at the height of my
software engineering career.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.870
And then I decided to
jump to do a startup.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.340
And that same feeling
was there in my gut.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.190
I'm like, oh, I'm not sure
I should do this or not.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.640
I'm a bit scared what
it's going to bring.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.980
And honestly it was the
best ride of my career,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.660
because I grew
like I never knew.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.030
I found talents I
never possessed.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.990
So it's a great thing.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.650
That uncomfortable
feeling, embrace it.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.580
So the second thing is-- I think
Telle Whitney came and talked

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.150
to you about lifting as we go.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.150
So I think that we focus a
lot on our diversity numbers

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.500
and how bleak the situation is.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.670
And I mean, I look
at it, and I say,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.690
we have to get
started somewhere.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.670
So if you look at the
start of any revolution,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.740
it always starts small,
and then it lights up.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.710
And I think we are in
the light up phase.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.670
I'm an optimist.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.800
I like to think that way.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.330
So Telle talked a little
bit about lifting,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.140
and Cheryl did too in her book.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.530
So lift as you go.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.100
So I think I want to talk
a little bit about that.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.300
So lend a hand, a helping hand.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.440
Look around you.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.990
I said make community
around you who

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.250
kind of resonate your passions.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.940
Be part of the community,
and give back when you get.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.910
So I think when I say
this, a lot of people say,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.610
I don't have time.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.280
I am pretty maxed out
between family and kids

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.390
and just keeping up with
my career and my job.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.550
And what I say to
them is it doesn't

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.800
take-- in my experience-- it
really doesn't take very long.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.470
Because all you have to
do is look around you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.770
and find someone who needs a
little nudge, a little helping

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.780
hand, a little support.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.270
In the right moment,
that's what we need.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.670
So I will give you one example.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.850
We just actually last month had
our global women's conference

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.940
at Google.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.650
And there were some
amazing speakers lined up.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.010
And about a week
before the conference,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.540
I was thinking, well, all
this experience on the stage

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.980
is great, but what if we
use this forum to give women

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.840
Googlers who are technologists,
who are software engineers,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.110
a voice to voice their ideas.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.800
It was really quickly-- we
did a call for submissions

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.770
to all the women tech
at Google and said,

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.970
do you want to come and
talk about your idea?

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.860
We called it Red Talk,
because it was like TED,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.600
but I really didn't
want to call it TED.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.840
We wanted it to be en empowering
and inspiring experience.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.360
So we called it Red.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.620
And we were quite amazed.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.840
Within a day, we got
more than 50 submissions.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.980
And we said we want to
welcome any 10x ideas.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.200
And we got over 50 submissions.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.640
We had a hard time picking
the five people we wanted

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.830
to spotlight on the stage.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.380
And every single idea that was
on the stage, that was amazing.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.810
It was like big.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.410
It was like game
changing, even for Google.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.910
So what does this say?

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.510
It didn't take very much
effort to shine spotlights

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.340
on people's ideas.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.830
It doesn't take very much effort
to help another woman in need.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.330
It doesn't take much to help
someone who might be doing

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.830
an off-ramp because of kids.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.440
It doesn't take very
much to help someone

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.010
with their coding problem.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.360
I don't think it takes a lot.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.970
It just takes a mental shift
to make it part of your day.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.190
So lift as you go.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.140
Remember that.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.840
I think we need all
of you to do that.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.810
And the third and the last one
I want to talk about is making.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.370
Now I was backstage
here and I saw

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.570
some of the things
you guys have made.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.140
So I think we have a lot
of makers in the audience.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.740
I was a bit surprised that the
organizers putting all of you

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.640
to task to design and
wear watches for Google.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.630
But it was quite inspiring
what has come out of that.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.470
I think hikers are going to
have a wonderful experience

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.560
with this design.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.160
So be your our own maker.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.770
I think make your future.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.010
Make your brand.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.390
Make what you're about.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.400
And make your community.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.940
So I will tell you one-- I
have a lot of stories to tell,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.910
but I'll tell you one
of my recent stories

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.300
that is about a year and
a half, two years ago.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.880
I'd been working at Google
for-- this is my tenth year,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.070
believe it or not.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.550
So I was working
away, and I realized--

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.540
I have two daughters--
my younger daughter was

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.380
looking for trains on Google.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.320
And instead of serving her
Thomas the Tank or something

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.340
similar, we were actually
serving her the train schedule

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.760
for Caltrain train station.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.280
And I thought, OK,
this cannot be right.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.040
And that is what led
the simple idea of how

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.880
wanting to help kids led
to the start of what is now

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.700
a pretty big project at Google.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.040
It's never easy, but you
have to start somewhere.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.850
And I think if you just
say we're going to do it,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:28.190
and we can do it, then the rest
will just take care of itself.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:34.309
So with that, I think I have
one nice slide to end the day.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.870
So all the power to you.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.429
I think you can do it.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.570
And thank you.
