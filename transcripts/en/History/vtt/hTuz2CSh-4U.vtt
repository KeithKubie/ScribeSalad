00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.870
NARRATOR: In the
Montana backwoods--

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.630
Oh!

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.900
NARRATOR: --veteran
trapper Tom Moore

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.130
is battling the brush to
claim every last dollar

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.600
before the season closes.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.630
My boots are slick.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.070
NARRATOR: But the payday
doesn't come easy.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.330
[music playing]

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.330
And finally, after a
two-mile fight to cross

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.000
nature's wild gauntlet--

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.200
We made it to the water.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.630
NARRATOR: --he's reached
the promised land.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.930
That looks beavery, too.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.800
[music playing]

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.000
All right, we've got
a good set in here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.870
Let's go put some more traps in.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.730
The slough is so big, it's
big enough to have two

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.100
or three beaver families in it.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.530
NARRATOR: A single beaver family
can have as many as 12 members.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.270
At $200 a pelt, Tom's
hard-fought gamble

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.070
could be a last-minute jackpot.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.270
TOM: Then there's a tunnel
that goes underneath here,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.830
and goes into that water
over on the other side.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.700
Be an ideal place
for a trap there.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.230
NARRATOR: Tom's an expert in
locating the high-traffic lanes

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.470
in this maze of interconnected
waterways, a skill he'll

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.930
need to maximize his catch.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.630
[music playing]

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.100
TOM: And now it's up
in that tree there.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.400
NARRATOR: A hard day's work
yields a surprising reward.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.670
Well, that might be
an extra [inaudible]

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.670
NARRATOR: A rare 10-pound
porcupine with a valuable hide

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.870
and quills.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.270
Think I'm gonna go
harvest the porcupine.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.670
[music playing]

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.230
[bird squawking]

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.130
All right.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.830
He's got good hair on him.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.170
I can actually make
money from a porcupine.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.070
I'll be able to
sell all the quills

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.100
I can harvest,
along with the hair,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.200
and even the front toenails.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.870
[music playing]

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.370
Now, this is a little added
bonus to the old trap line.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.300
[music playing]

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.370
All right.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.130
Years and years ago, before
the white man brought beads

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.900
to this country to
trade to the Indians

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.500
for decorative
stylings, the Indians

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.870
used dyed porcupine quills.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.200
These are little
round rawhide rings,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.370
and the quills are all
wrapped around them,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.170
and the ends are all
glued on the back.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.130
Lots of the war shirts
that the Indians wore,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.200
like on the Plains,
would have one of these

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.870
mounted on the front of it.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.170
NARRATOR: On average,
a single porcupine

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.330
has a staggering 30,000 quills.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.600
Also, the hair
has a value to it.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.170
The Native Americans used
this hair for what they

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.030
call roaches, dancing roaches.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.670
It was a headdress
that they'd wear.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.730
There's hours of plucking
on that porcupine

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.170
I've got to look forward to.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.130
But we're not finished yet.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.870
We've still got traps to check.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.770
The season's gonna close in
a few more days, so that's

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.870
all we can do, is just try to
wrap up what we've got going

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.370
and bring in as
much fur as we can.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.530
And it looks like another
successful season.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.100
