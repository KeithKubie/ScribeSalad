Okay, so the next thing to do here is to play this movie quote, but

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.290
really slowly.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.665
So here what I want you to do is to read the documentation of

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:11.800
AVAudioPlayer one more time.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.790
By the way, a link to it is in the instructor notes.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.470
See if you can find a function to change the speed of audio playback.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.380
Enter the name of that function here.
