with Forbes media and the most
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.680
with Forbes media and the most
interesting idea that I've heard today

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690
interesting idea that I've heard today
 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.410
interesting idea that I've heard today
not really an idea but I just came from

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420
not really an idea but I just came from
 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.140
not really an idea but I just came from
an exercise called the refugee run and

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
an exercise called the refugee run and
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.760
an exercise called the refugee run and
it's run by an organization called

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
it's run by an organization called
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.510
it's run by an organization called
global hand crossroads and it's an

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
global hand crossroads and it's an
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.580
global hand crossroads and it's an
extraordinary simulation of what life is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
extraordinary simulation of what life is
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.429
extraordinary simulation of what life is
like in a refugee camp and I'm actually

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
like in a refugee camp and I'm actually
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.779
like in a refugee camp and I'm actually
you know businessman and I'm here

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789
you know businessman and I'm here
 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.310
you know businessman and I'm here
attending the world economic forum but

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
attending the world economic forum but
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.530
attending the world economic forum but
after that experience in few minutes ago

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
after that experience in few minutes ago
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.750
after that experience in few minutes ago
it's really all I can talk about for the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
it's really all I can talk about for the
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.680
it's really all I can talk about for the
next couple of minutes you are put into

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
next couple of minutes you are put into
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.590
next couple of minutes you are put into
the situation of being a homeless

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
the situation of being a homeless
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.799
the situation of being a homeless
refugee pushed around and shuttled in

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
refugee pushed around and shuttled in
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.520
refugee pushed around and shuttled in
the dark and with with no no resources

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530
the dark and with with no no resources
 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.580
the dark and with with no no resources
into a refugee camp and you stay there

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
into a refugee camp and you stay there
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.670
into a refugee camp and you stay there
and experience in a very very real

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
and experience in a very very real
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.450
and experience in a very very real
simulation what that's like so the I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
simulation what that's like so the I
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490
simulation what that's like so the I
guess it's not the most interesting idea

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
guess it's not the most interesting idea
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.120
guess it's not the most interesting idea
but the realization that there are 43

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
but the realization that there are 43
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.190
but the realization that there are 43
million people at least refugees in the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
million people at least refugees in the
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.230
million people at least refugees in the
world who are experiencing what I just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
world who are experiencing what I just
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.230
world who are experiencing what I just
went through a simulation of at any

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
went through a simulation of at any
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810
went through a simulation of at any
given point in time is is remarkable to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
given point in time is is remarkable to
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.920
given point in time is is remarkable to
me so that's the idea I'm trying to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
me so that's the idea I'm trying to
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.469
me so that's the idea I'm trying to
grapple with and I'm not sure if that's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
grapple with and I'm not sure if that's
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.510
grapple with and I'm not sure if that's
what you were looking for but that's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
what you were looking for but that's
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.750
what you were looking for but that's
what's on my mind thanks
