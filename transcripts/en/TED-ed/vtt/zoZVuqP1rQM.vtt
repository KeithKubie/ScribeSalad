00:00:06.993 --> 00:00:09.708
The good news is that your experimental robo-ants

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.178
are a success!

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.298
The bad news is that you accidentally

00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:16.318
just gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:17.808
…and you can’t turn it off.

00:00:17.808 --> 00:00:19.848
You have five minutes to stop them

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:22.138
before the lasers go online.

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:22.968
Until then,

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.798
all of your robo-ants will walk

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.998
inside their habitat at a speed of

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:29.218
exactly 1 meter per minute.

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:31.808
If they bump into each other or hit a dead end,

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:33.418
they’ll instantly turn around

00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:35.398
and walk back the way they came.

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:36.293
When five minutes are up,

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:37.778
they’ll turn on their lasers,

00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:38.828
break free,

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:40.468
and stream out into the world,

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:42.978
carving a path of destruction as they go.

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:45.278
Your one chance to stop them is to insert

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.888
the two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitat

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:52.588
and suck the ants up before they break free.

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.148
The nozzles can press into any one location

00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:57.488
in the habitat through a membrane covering

00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.458
its front side, and any ants that walk past

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.148
will be sucked up and deactivated.

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.398
You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placed

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.938
without leaving a hole that the robo-ants

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:09.768
would pour out of, so choosing the

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.988
right spots will be key.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.788
The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes.

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:17.018
When the robots reach an intersection,

00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:18.978
they will pick randomly whether to go

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.568
left, right, or forward.

00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:23.148
They only go backward if they hit

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:25.528
hit another robo-ant or a dead end.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:28.198
Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them

00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.898
inside the habitat, and if even one escapes,

00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:33.088
it’ll do a lot of damage.

00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:35.228
With just less than five minutes remaining,

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:38.138
where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles

00:01:38.138 --> 00:01:40.306
to suck up all the robo-ants?

00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:43.840
Pause the video now if
you want to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.410
Answer in: 3

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.701
Answer in: 2

00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.275
Answer in: 1

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.365
With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat,

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.145
it might seem impossible to stop them

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.645
before they break free.

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:57.505
But this situation is simpler than it seems.

00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:58.695
Here's why.

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:00.915
Imagine just two robo-ants crawling

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:02.275
toward each other.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:04.265
When they collide, they immediately

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:05.465
reverse directions.

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:07.335
And what would that sequence of events look

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.345
like if they crawled past each other instead?

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:13.445
It would look exactly the same before

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.435
and after their collision, but with

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.705
their positions swapped.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.715
This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet.

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:23.285
Because the identities of individual ants

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.305
don’t matter, you just need to figure out where

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:27.445
you should put the nozzles to capture

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.085
any single ant walking without interruption

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.465
for less than 5 minutes, starting from

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:34.155
any point in the habitat.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:37.655
That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.285
Placing the nozzles at intersections where

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:43.345
three or four tubes meet seems like your best bet

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.845
since that’s where the robo-ants might otherwise

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.555
change directions and miss your nozzles.

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:50.955
There are only four intersections…

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:52.795
which two should you pick?

00:02:52.795 --> 00:02:55.475
The top right intersection has to be one of them.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.845
If it isn’t, an ant crawling down from

00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.565
this intersection toward the dead end would

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:02.755
crawl for four minutes to get back to the

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:05.275
intersection, and then go in any of three

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:08.345
directions, walking for at least another minute.

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:10.465
Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right,

00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:12.615
the only other choice that has a chance

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:14.545
to work is the bottom left.

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:17.245
To see that this works, imagine an ant

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:19.155
anywhere else in the habitat.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:22.015
Worst case scenario, the ant would start

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:25.225
right next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it.

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.385
But in all those worst cases, the ant would march

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:31.305
for at most 4 meters before being sucked

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:32.855
up into the vacuum.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:35.915
No other choice of two intersection points

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.385
is guaranteed to get all the robo-ants

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.955
within five minutes.

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.565
Having vacuumed them all up, you’ve

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.275
averted a major crisis.

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:47.095
Before you mess with robo-ants again,

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:49.455
you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready.

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:50.825
And wouldn’t it be cool if it could

00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.745
fly and breathe fire?

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:55.065
There’s no way that could go wrong!
