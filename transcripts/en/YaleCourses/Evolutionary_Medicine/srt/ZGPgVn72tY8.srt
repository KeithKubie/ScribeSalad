1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,080
Another factor that determines the way
a disease is expressed has to do with

2
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:13,401
whether the functions that says that it
is affecting our fixed or adjustable.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,270
Okay.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,400
And whether a function
is fixed or adjustable,

5
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:20,040
depends on its sensitivity
to the environment.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,510
Some developmental and physiological
processes are very sensitive to

7
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,990
environmental change. That would include
glucose metabolism and blood pressure.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,380
Others are rather insensitive.
For example,

9
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:35,790
DNA replication and Purin metabolism are
not very sensitive to the environment.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Sensitive reactions evolve
to be adjustable and
insensitive reactions evolve to

11
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,914
be fixed,

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,730
so adjustable reactions are
buying flexibility at the
cost of vulnerability to

13
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:54,630
dysregulation, insulin resistance
and type two diabetes. For example,

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,970
insensitive reactions are
robust to dysregulation,

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,420
but they remain vulnerable to genetic
defects so they are more likely to undergo

16
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:07,470
catastrophic failure.

17
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:11,760
Where is adjustable reactions are
likely to undergo a sort of progressive

18
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:15,250
failure?
Let's unpack them.

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,790
Fixed functions are
insensitive to the environment,

20
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,820
highly conserved control core biological
processes and are disrupted by single

21
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,640
catastrophic mutations.
They are responsible for rare men.

22
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:34,150
Delian diseases such as
cystic fibrosis or progeria.

23
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,870
Adjustable functions are
sensitive to the environment.

24
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,830
They vary within and between species
that are constantly shaped by natural

25
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:45,070
selection. They're directly
involved in local adaptation.

26
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,410
They control physiological adaptation and
do civil responses and reaction norms.

27
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,840
They are affected by many genes,

28
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:56,140
often polymorphic who's
frequencies change under selection.

29
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,940
They caused predisposition to
diseases of mismatch such as obesity,

30
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:04,960
type two diabetes, asthma,
hypertension and so forth.

31
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,210
Yeah,

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,370
so a few comments on fixed processes.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,890
These are some of the examples of
catastrophic failure due to mutations.

34
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,170
Core biological processes are fixed.
They include DNA replication,

35
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,230
transcription of actin,
Cytoskeleton and so forth.

36
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,880
Major features of the body plan
are fixed by developmental control.

37
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,630
That's the number of heads,
legs, arms, digits in the eyes.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,860
These are all mutations affecting heads,

39
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,270
digits and I's mutations.

40
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:44,470
Disrupting such traits can have
catastrophic effects which you see here.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,780
They are often caught by quality control
of Gametes of Zygotes and concept I

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,450
when they're not caught,
they result in major birth defects.

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,010
Yeah,

44
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,460
adjustable features vary on the different
time scales that we have already

45
00:02:58,461 --> 00:02:58,960
visited,

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,490
so physiological adaptation is
occurring in fractions of a lifespan.

47
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,270
Acclamation up to about a
lifespan and development.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,870
Developmental plasticity
at about a lifespan.

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,280
Developmental plasticity
is often irreversible.

50
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,840
Acclimation is often
achieved through Rio Stacy's.

51
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,850
That is changes in the set point of the
homeostatic feedbacks and physiological

52
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,510
adaptation is usually regulated
through a homeostatic feedback loop.

53
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,770
Okay.

54
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,550
An example of an adjustable processes,
glucose distribution in the body.

55
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,550
It is controlled by insulin.

56
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,830
It's set points change during pregnancy
to privilege the fetus so that more the

57
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,060
fat and the skeletal muscle of the
mother becomes more insulin resistant to

58
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:55,490
maintain a higher glucose
level in the blood.

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,380
That can then be taken up by the
developing fetus and during infection.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,290
The same kind of switch will occur to
privilege the immune system. So the uh,

61
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,710
skeletal muscle and the fat cells become
insulin resistant to keep the glucose

62
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:16,400
level elevated in the blood so it
can be used by the immune system.

63
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,840
This kind of adjustability
comes with a price,

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,240
the diseases of homeostasis,

65
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:26,090
which include insulin resistance
and type two diabetes.

66
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:27,990
Yeah,

67
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,740
the symptoms of type two diabetes or
excess thirst, frequent urination,

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,300
constant hunger, and the longterm
complications of heart disease,

69
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,910
strokes, kidney failure, and amputations.

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,080
So it was very adaptive for evolution
to design and adjustable process to

71
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,620
regulate glucose distribution in the body,

72
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,760
both to aid and pregnancy and
to aid in disease defense.

73
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:58,761
But it created a vulnerability
that allowed a type of
disease to arise that can

74
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,970
be very debilitating,
particularly in older people.

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,580
To summarize, fixed traits are
insensitive to the environment.

76
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,760
They're deeply conserved.
They're often developmentally canalized

77
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,010
nutations that disrupt such
traits act early in development,

78
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:19,560
and they can often have
catastrophic consequences.

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,260
Adjustable traits react sensitively
to changes in the environment.

80
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,190
They are often controlled by many
genes that have allelic variation.

81
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,600
The disruption of an adjustable trade,

82
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,910
whether it's by genetic mutations
or by environmental insults,

83
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:40,800
produces diseases of homeostasis
such as diabetes, type two diabetes.
