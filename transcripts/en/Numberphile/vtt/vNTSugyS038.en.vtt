00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.640
BRADY HARAN: 43 is a
very special number

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640
with chicken nuggets.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.220
It's the highest number that
you can't make by using the

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.340
standard packs that you
get from McDonald's.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.640
The packs are 9, 6 and 20.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.860
There's fewer of those numbers
that you can't make.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.640
You can't make one, because they
don't sell them in ones.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.640
You can't have 2 or 3.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:59.116
But 43 is the biggest.

00:00:59.116 --> 00:00:59.560
Yeah.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.540
So 43 isn't the only number
that you can't make using

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.790
these Chicken McNugget
numbers.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.930
There's actually 22 different
numbers you can't make.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.340
So the first one is 1.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.120
You can't make 1.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.920
They don't sell them
in packs of 1.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.840
2, we can't make.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.370
We can't make 3 or 4 or 5.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.900
But we can make 6.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.280
They do sell packs of 6.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.920
So we can make 6.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.115
But then we can't
make 7 and 8.

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:27.500
But we can make 9.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.080
So here's the pack of 9.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:43.724
And the others are 10, 11, 13,
14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25,

00:01:43.724 --> 00:01:48.060
28, 31, 34, 37.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.650
And the biggest number that
you can't make is 43.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.990
And all other numbers,
you can make.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.090
So if you wanted to make
the next number, 44,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.070
we would have 20--

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.889
a box of 20, two boxes
of 9, and a box of 6.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:10.519
There we go.

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:31.960
That makes 44.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.610
So obviously, McDonald's
were very

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.670
concerned about this problem.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.320
This happens a lot,
people wandering

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.240
about, ordering 43 nuggets.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.660
So, they've changed the rules.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.600
And this is a new development.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.470
They now sell the Happy Meal
nugget box, which has 4

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.155
nuggets in it.

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:51.120
They now sell that separately.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.860
So you can now buy boxes of 4,
6, 9 and 20, which changes

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.580
everything.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.120
So this was our list of things
we couldn't buy.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.620
But now that we can buy 4, we
can do that no problem.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.340
And we can get 8, as well.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.470
No problem.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.060
Or could have 4 and a
6, so 10 disappears.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.842
In fact, most of these
disappear now.

00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:20.370
And we can now order all
these McNugget numbers.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.580
So the highest number now that
you can't order is 11.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.550
Maybe that's something other
people can try as well, OK.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.760
So if you don't want to eat 43,
like we're going to have

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.530
to do now, try it out with 11.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.780
See what we do.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.040
So the girls at McDonald's
were quite

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.890
concerned about this.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.110
We asked for 43, and they said,
well, we can't sell

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.740
packs of 3.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.190
We can't do 20's and 3's.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.660
And they said, well, we
can give you 44, maybe

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.580
two 20's and a 4.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.940
And I was very tempted to lean
over and help them out.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.575
Because there is a way now
that we can do 43.

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:08.466
Three packs of 9.

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:13.710
There's 9, 9, and we
need another 9.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.240
Three packs of 9.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.474
Two packs of 6.

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:20.414
5, 6.

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:28.320
And another 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.810
And oh, a pack of 4, there.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.680
And that's 43.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.790
We've got one extra.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.185
Can I have this now?

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.530
It's good.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.630
I haven't eaten yet.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.670
These McNugget numbers
are great fun.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.450
But in the world of
math, they're

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.920
called Frobenius numbers.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.960
And this is the largest number
that you can't make using--

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.780
well, whatever numbers
that you decide.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.670
So for the McDonald's,
it was 6, 9, and 20.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.715
Another name for the same
problem is the coin problem.

00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:06.460
So if you have coins of
different values,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.410
what can you make?

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.210
What can you buy?

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.260
What can't you buy?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.720
So we've ended up with
44 of these nuggets.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.940
But I want to know how many
sachets of barbecue sauce they

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.010
think someone with
44 nuggets needs.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.810
No.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:34.080
1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.470
it's not enough.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.010
It's not enough.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.320
Come on.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.783
Disappointing.

00:05:39.783 --> 00:05:41.550
MALE SPEAKER: 8 seems like
excessive to me.
