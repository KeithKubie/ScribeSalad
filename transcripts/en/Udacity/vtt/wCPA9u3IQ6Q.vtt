00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As stated before, the priority defines how soon a bug will be fixed.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Of course, it may be desirable if severe bugs were fixed first,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but a severe bug may affect only a single user.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hundreds of other users may suffer for minor issues,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which therefore may have to be addressed first.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The same goes for bugs which have been around for the longest.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Again, these may not be important for many users.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Those which are the easiest to fix.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, if a problem is easy to fix

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that certainly increases the chance to get fixed soon.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then again, these problems may not be important.
