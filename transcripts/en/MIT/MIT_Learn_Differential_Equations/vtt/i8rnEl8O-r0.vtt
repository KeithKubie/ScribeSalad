GILBERT STRANG: This
is heat equation video.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.410
So this is the second
of the three basic

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.640
partial differential equations.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.750
We had Laplace's equation,
that was-- time was not there.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.620
Now time comes into
the heat equation.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.910
We have a time derivative,
and two-- matching

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.540
with two space derivatives.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.030
So I have my function.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.900
My solution depends
on t and on x,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.290
and I hope I can
separate those two parts.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.870
This is exactly like the way
we solved the ordinary systems

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.460
of differential equations.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.900
We pulled out an
e to the lambda t,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.930
where lambda was the
eigenvalue, and then we

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.680
had the eigenvector.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.930
Here, it's an eigenfunction
because it depends on x.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.540
We didn't have x before, but
now we have partial differential

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.300
equations.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.700
X is also a coordinate here.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.670
So I look for
solutions like that.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.650
And just as always, I substitute
that into the differential

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.930
equation to discover what--
what determines S, S of x.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.870
The time derivative
brings down a lambda.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.780
The space derivative
brings down--

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.280
has two space derivatives.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.820
So that's what I get when I
substitute e to the lambda t S

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.450
eigenvalue, times eigenfunction,
into the equation.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.940
And always, I cancel e
to the lambda t, that's

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.490
the beauty of it, and I
have an eigenvalue equation,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.820
or I'm looking again
for a function.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.850
So the second derivative
of my function

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.940
is lambda, some number,
times my function.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.380
OK.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.350
What I'm looking
for for functions S,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.330
they'll be sine functions.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:21.272
S will be, S of x, will
be the sine of K pi

00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:26.044
x, the sine of x, the
sign of something times x.

00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:26.960
What's the eigenvalue?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.980
Take two derivatives
of this, I get back

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.050
sine k pi x, which is, that's
great, it's an eigenfunction.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.220
And out comes the
eigenvalue, lambda

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.170
is, well when I take
two derivatives,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.010
k pi comes out twice
with a minus sign.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.220
So it's minus k
squared, pi squared.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.250
So I have found a bunch of
eigenvectors, eigenfunctions,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.560
and the eigenvalues.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.140
So this was a simple pair,
but now the general solution,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.890
the general solution,
u of t x, will be?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.240
If I know several solutions,
and I have a linear equation,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.910
I just take combinations.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.740
That's always our way.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.980
Take combinations of
those basic solutions,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.920
so I'll have a sum, k
going from 1 to infinity.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.680
In differential equation,
partial differential equations,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.150
I need a big sum here,
of some coefficients,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.190
let me call them B k,
times this solution,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.360
e to the lambda-- what was
lambda-- minus k squared, pi

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.050
squared t, times S, S number k.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.650
I should have given this
eigenfunction it's number, k.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.290
So there is the, this is
my family of eigenfunctions

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.170
and eigenvalues.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.180
And then, this is the
combination of these solutions.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.110
There is the general solution.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.870
And for S k, I should have
written in sine k pi x.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.750
So that's the dependence on t.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.480
Let's have a look at this.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.360
So the dependence
on t is fast decay.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.750
And if K, as K gets larger,
later terms in this sum,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.040
the decay is really fast.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.020
So the term that decays
most slowly, k equal 1,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.070
there'll be a B1, an e to
the minus, pi squared t.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.970
That's decaying
already pretty fast.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.330
When I'm talking about
decay, what's happening here?

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.970
I have a bar, a material bar.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.260
The ends of the bar are
kept at temperature zero,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.370
they're frozen, and
heat is in the bar.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.520
Heat is flowing
around in the bar.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.810
And where is it going?

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.880
It's flowing out the ends.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.420
The bar is approaching freezing.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.950
The ends are kept at freezing,
and the inside of the bar,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.390
whatever heat is there
at the beginning,

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.350
is going to flow out the ends.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.020
So, you see, that I have
these sine functions.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.610
When x is 0 the sine is 0
so that's frozen at one end.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.140
When x is 1, I have the sine
of k pi, which is, again, 0,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.310
so it's frozen at the other end.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.510
So I'm freezing it at both ends.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:01.800
The temperature is
escaping out of the center,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.120
so let me graph the solution.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.720
So maybe I start with--
here is my bar from 0 to 1,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.640
and I'm keeping it frozen.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.780
F for frozen, f for
frozen at that end.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.400
Maybe I, maybe I start
off with a warm bar.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.990
So u at 0 and x,
I'll say it'd be 1.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.960
This way is x.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.790
So I have an
ordinary heated bar,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.090
and I put it in the freezer.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.070
So I insulate the sides so
the heat is escaping out

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.990
the two ends, out the end
x equals 0 and out the end

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.550
x equal 1.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:56.040
And the solution will
be, let me remember

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.740
what the general
solution looked like,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.450
and I have to find
these numbers.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.530
OK.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.850
And those numbers, of
course, the numbers

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.260
are always found by matching
the initial conditions.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.010
This is the initial, this
is an initial picture.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.670
OK.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.340
So I have to match that
by-- so this is t equals 0,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.200
I have to match the sum of B k.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.400
This is k going
from 1 to infinity.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:35.800
When t is, when t is zero, this
is 1, and I just have the Sk.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:44.350
The sine of k pi x,
that has to match the 1.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:57.640
And from that, I find the Bk's,
and then the final solution.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:04.010
T greater than 0 uses those Bks.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.970
And we're again faced with
a Fourier series problem.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.540
Anytime I have to find
these coefficients,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.930
this is a Fourier sine
series, I have only sines,

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.270
not cosines here.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.560
And I'm finding
the coefficients,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.070
so that this will match
1, the initial condition.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:35.120
And then, for t greater than 0,
solution u will be, as we said,

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.770
the sum of these
Bk's, which come

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.710
from the initial conditions,
come from this-- Fourier

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.510
coefficients, we still have to
do that video on Fourier series

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.680
to know what these numbers will
come out to be-- times the e,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.120
to the minus k
squared, pi squared

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.020
t times the sine of k pi x.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.410
You may think, well it's
a pretty messy solution,

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.720
because it's an infinite sum.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.680
But it's not bad for a
partial differential equation.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.910
We have numbers, we have
something depending on time

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.720
and decaying rapidly, and
something depending on x.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.500
So at time 1, if
I drew a picture,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:29.140
suppose the heat is, the
temperature starts out

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.560
through the whole bar at 1.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.540
But with this kind of time
decay, a little later in time,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.390
the temperature's going
to be something like that.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.780
It'll be way down at the ends,
pretty low in the middle.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.850
And so at some time
t, the temperature

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.810
will look like that, and
then soon after that,

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.820
the temperature
will go down here,

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.570
and the steady state, of
course, is the whole thing

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.300
is at temperature 0.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:05.020
So that's what solutions to
the heat equation look like.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.820
And this is the step of finding
the-- which I didn't take,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.750
it's the Fourier series
step-- of finding

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.760
the coefficients in our
infinite series of solutions.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.670
Once again, we have
infinitely many solutions.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.270
We're talking about a partial
differential equation.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.330
We have a whole function to
match, so we need all of those.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:34.220
And Fourier series tells
us how to do that matching,

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.630
how to find these Bk's.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.790
So that's a separate
and important question,

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.250
Fourier series.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.910
Thank you.
