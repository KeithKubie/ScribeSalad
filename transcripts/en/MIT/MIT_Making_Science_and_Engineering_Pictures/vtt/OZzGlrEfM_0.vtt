00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.690
PROFESSOR: So as I
mentioned before,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.870
we're going to see
two devices threaded

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.170
throughout all of
these tutorials.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.430
Take a look at this music
box for our first case study.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.590
So I place it on the
glass of the scanner,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.350
and it looks pretty good.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.970
But as I look carefully.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.470
Which I hope you will do when
you try this sort of stuff

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.510
with your work, a
couple of things

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.430
that I'm not thrilled with.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.490
First of all, we're seeing
some writing on the barrel.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.000
Looking closer, it appears
to be numbers and letters.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.290
That's not great.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.680
Our eyes go straight
to letters and numbers,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.550
and they basically
attract our eye

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.950
and actually become a
distraction from the image,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.440
as far as I'm concerned.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.750
So I'm not happy with that.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.790
I'm also not thrilled with
the positioning of the turning

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.730
mechanism.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.100
Let's call it a stem.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.330
Somehow it doesn't
feel composed properly.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
So what I simply did, was I
played it a bit so the barrel

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.230
no longer shows the writing,
and I turned the stem

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.330
so that it landed in a
better composed image.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.990
I've been thinking
about composition

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.450
all my professional
life, so see if you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.040
can agree with me
on this decision.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.420
So I started thinking
about what difference

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.070
it would make if we changed
the orientation of the device

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.520
on the scanner.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.430
Now remember the light
and sensors travel

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.280
only in one direction we
have no control over that.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.170
So in this first image,
the barrel of the music box

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.930
is parallel to the light source.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.580
In the next image I decided
to rotate the music box

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.280
90 degrees, that
is, perpendicular

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.800
to the light source.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.710
Here's that image.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.070
Take a look at the
two side by side

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.870
and observe the difference.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.640
I'll let you think
about that for a bit.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.840
So you see the first image,
made with the barrel oriented

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.920
parallel to the light source,
has a significant highlight.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.000
Whereas the one
captured perpendicular

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.930
to the light source
has no highlight.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.980
If I sat down for
a bit and tried

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.790
to anticipate all these
results by drawing arrows

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.550
from light sources and
reflections and all that,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.730
I might have been
able to anticipate

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.930
what the differences
would be in advance.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.950
But I would prefer to just
discover it, experiment

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.960
with it, just as I hope you
will do with your own material.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.990
And what it would look like if
I oriented the device about 45

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.847
degrees to the light source?

00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:49.430
What do you think
will be the results?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.380
Take a moment.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.360
You can even stop the
video if you'd like to.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360
OK ready?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.790
Here we go.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.290
Nothing very important
here, I'm afraid.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.130
But the point is to
experiment with your material.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.260
Remember you don't have
control of your light source

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.690
with a scanner as you
will with your camera.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.660
So at the very
least, take advantage

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.720
of what you do
have control over.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.620
And in this case, it's the
placement of your device.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.180
Here you're seeing
this incredible animal

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.660
which is called a Euplectella,
which lives in the sea.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.150
This is his skeleton,
made out of silica.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.690
Now when you take
a careful look,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.680
you can see that two shrimp are
living within this guy in what

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.130
can be called a
symbiotic relationship.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.400
Which is very
interesting, tangential,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.430
but quite interesting.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.750
So I put this
three-dimensional skeleton

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.630
on the flatbed scanner,
covered it with black velvet,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.180
and took a very high res scan.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.950
I think it was
something like one Gig

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.490
file, which is pretty high.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.160
The black velvet becomes the
background of the image, right?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.280
Now watch as we zoom
in to the image.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.420
We start seeing this
magnificent structure

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.830
that nature is somehow
able to produce.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.480
Those fibers measure
about 50 microns.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.880
So I'm quite
serious about seeing

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.850
things of very fine
structure, if in fact,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.095
once again, you capture at
a high enough resolution.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.820
Here's our final case study
for this particular tutorial.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.430
It's about a 2 1/2
centimeter device,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.030
which once again I
place on the scanner.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.220
For this, I thought it
would be fun to show you

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.530
how I get some of these
things in the mail.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.780
I made a quick image
with my phone camera

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.070
to show you what I start with,
and eventually wind up with.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.280
I thought it would be
interesting for you.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.540
You can do this.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.300
You can see things that don't
look so great the beginning,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.550
and imagine ways of creating
an image that is publishable.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.550
Take a hard look at your
device as I'm doing here.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.670
Try to look at it as if
you were looking at it

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.760
for the first time,
which I know is not easy,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.290
but that's the trick.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.290
You might even
think about focusing

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.160
on getting a cover image
for your submission.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.220
That's where my thinking was on
this device, since the article

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.890
was already accepted
for publication.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.870
So here, the image I
made was about 374 megs.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.420
And you can see as we
zoom in to the image

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.060
the nice detail in the device.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.990
Again, when you capture at
a high enough resolution

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.950
on your scanner, you
can see these details.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.950
So when you think
about cover designs,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.780
for example, think about
cropping and formatting

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.420
for the cover.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.290
In the end, it turned out
that for a cover submission

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.600
I did wind up using a camera
on the stereo microscope.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.150
This is what I made with
that equipment I thought

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.720
I was getting more clarity
with the microscope.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.660
But frankly when I compared
the two a few months later

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.540
as I record this tutorial, the
scan image looks pretty good.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.880
And maybe I was in a
bit of overkill mode.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.570
These are the kinds
of decisions you'll

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.550
have to make for your own work.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.740
Maybe you have an opinion
about which is better.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.220
Take a look.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.820
By the way, in the end, in this
case, it didn't matter much.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.380
We didn't get the cover.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.840
But at least I was able to
show you another example.
