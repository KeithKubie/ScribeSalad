[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.900
DAVID KEEGAN: So if I could
start by taking you back

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.630
to 2009, Ireland
was experiencing

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.662
what the media called
a suicide epidemic,

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:17.120
and it didn't really
feature highly

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.860
on anyone's list of priorities.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.800
And I could never
quite understand

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.490
why you couldn't change the
TV channel for seeing a road

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.850
safety ad, but at
the time there were

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.670
more people dying by suicide
than there were on the roads.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.680
But you never saw an
ad for mental health.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.060
It didn't really feature in
civil discourse at the time,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.097
and it wasn't a conversation
that was being had.

00:00:42.097 --> 00:00:43.680
And there's a lot
of reasons for that.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.700
One, it's not an easy
conversation to have.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.390
So I shared a house with a
pal of mine, JP, who we've

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.815
known since our late teens.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.380
And he came to me
one day and said,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.496
would you like to help me
run a mental health event?

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.370
And my reaction was, a what?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.250
And, you see, he didn't--

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.040
I knew his older brother
David had died by suicide when

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.860
he was 16, but we'd never
really spoken about it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.620
because it's not an easy
conversation to have.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.250
So what he didn't
know at the time

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.610
was that I'd been
self-harming from the same age

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.980
and did enough to scratch
too far under the surface

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.500
to discover depression,
schizophrenia,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.354
and suicide leafed
throughout my family tree.

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:37.770
One in four of us will suffer
with a mental health problem

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.060
at some point in our life.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.084
We carry out annual
research around attitudes

00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:46.500
to mental health in the country,
and our research actually

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
indicates that it's
actually far worse.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.105
47% of the people we
interviewed had openly admitted

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.480
to having a mental
health problem

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.930
at some point in their
life, with 4 in 10 people

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.810
also admitting to
delaying seeking help

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.150
for fear of stigmatization.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.135
So back to, I suppose,
my own story again.

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:11.760
He didn't know that
I was kind of going

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.407
through this at the time.

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:15.615
And, again, it was nothing--
we didn't talk about any

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:17.400
of this stuff with my family.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.380
Again, it's not an
easy conversation

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.730
to have at a kitchen table.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.770
So when we sat
down, the intention

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.250
was to design a
model or a catalyst

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.850
to start a national mental
health conversation,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.200
and we'd shared interest
in arts and culture.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.260
It's my background.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.740
JP worked in mental health
services at the time.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.670
He's a psychotherapist
and a social worker.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.390
And our perspective was
that culture reflects

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.530
who we are societally, and
artists have always championed

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.150
issues of great
social importance,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.440
whether it be hunger,
AIDS, or equality,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.460
and great art can
effect great change.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.610
So my name is,
again, David Keegan.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.010
I'm CEO of First Fortnight.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.930
First Fortnight,
Ireland's National Mental

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.320
Health Arts Festival.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.360
And every year, we start
kitchen table conversations.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.530
We challenge stigma, race,
awareness, true cultural action

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.340
in the form of mental
health arts festival.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.030
The challenging time of year
for a lot of people in January.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.580
And in 2013, we became a
mental health service provider,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.370
delivering free mental health
care to vulnerable communities

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.870
across Dublin.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.680
Predominantly people in
homeless communities or people

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.320
at risk of experiencing
homelessness.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.600
And, I suppose, it's with
great pride that this year,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.620
particularly, this
January, we will

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.080
host Europe's mental
health festival

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.930
in communities across Ireland.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.420
And I'd invite you all to
join us and end mental health

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.010
stigma together.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.980
That's me in a
nutshell right now.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.570
Thanks.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.440
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Thanks, David.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.232
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah.

00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:11.606
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
So I'm going

00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:13.740
to kick off a few
questions, and then we'll

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.279
go to audience Q&amp;A. Marina
has a microphone ready

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.790
to hand around to you guys.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.920
So thank you for being
here, and thank you for--

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.350
DAVID KEEGAN: Just turn
around and look at you.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.100
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: And thank
you for this amazing festival.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.625
DAVID KEEGAN: Thanks.

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:30.416
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
It's really important,

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:33.810
and I think it's an amazing
thing for a group of people

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.690
to come together and build
up over the past 10 years.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.410
So when you and JP discussed
this idea maybe 11 years ago,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.640
or would it be 12 years ago--

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.070
DAVID KEEGAN: It started-- he
had his bright idea in 2009.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.657
Yeah.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.240
That's where the
conversation started.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.660
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
And in 2009,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.230
did either of you, even
in your wildest dreams,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.070
imagine that it would develop
into something so important

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.930
and so successful, so loved?

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.690
DAVID KEEGAN: No, we didn't
have any idea whatsoever.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.100
We just knew that we had
a degree of influence

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.170
amongst our peers, and we
had an amount of experience

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.510
in the relevant
areas, and we cared.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.020
And we were directly seeing
the effects of stigma

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.740
all around us.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.420
I mean, it's probably not--

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.870
I would imagine there's
probably not many people--

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.546
all of us would probably
know or be one person removed

00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:38.670
from someone who has had
a mental health difficulty

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.410
or died by suicide within
our kind of peer group.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.360
So we were seeing
this all around us

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.110
and had direct
personal experience.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.790
Change doesn't come from
above, it comes from people.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.640
And so that was literally it.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.550
We just kind of
combined our powers.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.610
And we approached our
friends who were in bands

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.130
or worked in kind of
the cultural sector,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.160
and we approached other friends
who worked in the media.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.044
And they played
at this one event

00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:09.960
in a place called Andrew's
Lane Theatre, which

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.930
no longer exists.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.380
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.963
Unfortunately.

00:06:11.963 --> 00:06:15.020
DAVID KEEGAN: And we partnered
with Mental Health Ireland.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.235
Our friends played as part
of the event and the media

00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:19.860
wrote about it.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.860
And we filled our venue.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.530
We sold it out.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.950
And it exceeded all
of our expectations.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.390
We were completely humbled
by the outpouring of support

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.900
we got.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.275
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
When did you

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:35.470
know so that it wasn't
going to be a once off?

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.585
That you guys had
to keep doing this?

00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:41.460
DAVID KEEGAN: We were approached
very soon after the first one

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.040
to see if we were
interested to do it again.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.870
Yeah.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.706
It was directly afterwards.

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.080
After the first
one, we kind of--

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.280
we felt we'd hit a--

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.040
it was the zeitgeist moment.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.006
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:06:57.006 --> 00:06:58.380
DAVID KEEGAN: We
just felt people

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.530
wanted it, were ready
for that conversation,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.280
and it was needed.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.180
It needed that this public
discourse needed to happen,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.870
and it was a thing that we
just weren't talking about.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.010
And so that was it.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.300
Mental Health Ireland
came back to us and said,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.260
will you do it again?

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.120
And that's where
it started, really.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.620
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's amazing.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.411
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah.

00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:22.710
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: And
in 10 years from now,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.690
where do you think this
conversation will be?

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.690
The conversation either
on mental health,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.180
or on First Fortnight,
or similar festivals.

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:38.200
DAVID KEEGAN: The conversation
is different year to year.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.340
So we try to explore--

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.840
I mean, we started
off at one event,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.881
and it was a music event.

00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:44.980
So, I suppose, our
programming policy

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.720
is to program high quality art.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.220
It's high quality art that has
the potential to effect change.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.380
And, again, it's people
will relate to it.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.890
With that one event,
we're constantly

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.900
looking for how we
could have more impact.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:08.080
That was one genre of what
could potentially be a festival,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.960
an arts festival,
and each genre of art

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.910
has its own unique
medium for communication.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.270
So in a lot of
ways, the festival

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.200
itself is just a
medium to communicate

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.090
a positive mental health
message or explore mental health

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.580
themes, and then
contextualize everything

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.570
with conversation and debate.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.480
So that was kind of--

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.950
I suppose you tested the
model in Andrew's Lane.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.704
It's where social
enterprise-- it's very--

00:08:36.704 --> 00:08:38.620
that's kind of how we've
always approached it.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.375
The festival itself
generates an income,

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:42.909
and the income is
reinvested into the service

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.950
to manage and
maintain its growth,

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.920
and then also invest it
into the free services

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.110
that we provide to
homeless communities.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:56.080
So we tested that model in
2010 with our very first event,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.740
and then 2011 we
needed a bigger venue.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.980
We had a new partner in
Amnesty International

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.850
because they had a
campaign around--

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.570
their focus was mental
health as a human right.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.690
And so we kind of developed
the program a bit more.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.010
We decided to do a mental
health talk at 2 o'clock

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.691
in the afternoon in
the Button Factory.

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:21.565
It was a bigger venue
with a bigger capacity.

00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:25.100
It was 750 was the capacity.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.880
And, again, we had a mental
health talk at half two,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.280
and then a gig
later on that day.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.950
So we put out about 150
seats in the Button Factory

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.710
to have this mental health talk.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:36.850
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Was
this the middle of the day?

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.240
DAVID KEEGAN: This is it.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.530
And you're kind of,
like, in the situation

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.370
where it's like you're throwing
a party and you're like,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.005
who's going to come?

00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:41.290
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Who's going to come?

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.081
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.600
It's totally that situation.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.450
And we only put out
150 seats, and then

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.760
people started to come
in, and they kept coming,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.620
and they kept coming,
and we ended up

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.100
having to put out
another 100 seats.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.600
And the venue is packed.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.221
And we're like, this
is something here.

00:09:58.221 --> 00:09:58.720
Like--

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.053
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:00.053 --> 00:10:01.679
DAVID KEEGAN: Like, yeah.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:02.470
So we were floored.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.345
And then we had an event
on later that night.

00:10:04.345 --> 00:10:05.997
And, again, we
sold it out again.

00:10:05.997 --> 00:10:07.830
And then that was in
partnership, as I said,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.530
with Amnesty.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.910
And then year three--

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.530
so we've basically done this--

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.240
just to say, this
is purely voluntary.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.330
So both myself and JP
had full-time jobs.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.070
He worked in HSC at
the time, I worked

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.660
at Pavilion Theatre
in Dun Laoghaire

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.200
as a kind of Marketing
Communications Manager.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.180
So it was completely
in our spare time,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.820
and asking our friends to do
bits and pieces to help us out.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:31.630
So we did it.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.640
And then into year three, we
kind of felt confident enough

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.140
then.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.730
We tested the model
two years in a row.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:37.646
There was an appetite.

00:10:37.646 --> 00:10:38.710
There was an audience.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.760
People were buying
tickets, and we

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.570
were raising a significant
amount of money,

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.130
and we were basically
donating this

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.380
to our mental health partners.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.480
In year one, it was
Mental Health Ireland.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.320
We donated to them.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.760
And then Amnesty afterwards.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.860
But year three when
we decided, all right,

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.390
we can do a full
blown festival now,

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:58.230
and try to program a
broad amount of kind of--

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.486
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Spectrum of theater styles.

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:01.360
DAVID KEEGAN: Genres.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.460
We included theater, film,
spoken word poetry, music.

00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:13.480
But we just made kind
of a mature decision

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.360
that we needed to kind
of register as a company,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.270
subsequently register
as a charity to reinvest

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.590
in ourselves.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.540
Because we were
giving the money away,

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.160
we had no money
the following year

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.780
to reinvest in the
festival program.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.307
We couldn't book venues,
we couldn't necessarily

00:11:30.307 --> 00:11:32.140
program because we
didn't know what money we

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.280
were going to have.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.130
But we were very good
at finding the money.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.160
We were better at, like,
deciding whether or not

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.560
what we were going to do
was going to have an impact.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.870
If we agreed it was
going to have an impact,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.444
then we found the money
to do it after the fact.

00:11:47.444 --> 00:11:49.360
Because we weren't paying
anybody at the time.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.350
It was voluntary.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.870
And that's kind of how
it started to develop

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:53.870
from the first festival.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.953
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:11:54.953 --> 00:11:55.812
That's amazing.

00:11:55.812 --> 00:11:59.290
So I missed the first few years
of the festival, unfortunately.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.190
I was living abroad.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.040
When I came back, one of
the first pieces I saw

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.542
was "HALF LIGHT."

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:05.500
DAVID KEEGAN: Oh, yeah.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.208
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Which was beautiful.

00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:08.760
It's a beautiful show.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.660
From what I remember, it's
a little boy's exploration

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.990
into where his father
is, and his father

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.280
is suffering from depression.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.460
So he's trying to find his dad
again and reconnect with them.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.030
And it's beautiful, but it's
so wise and intelligent.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.830
I love that piece.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.490
It really stuck with me.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.890
What have been
some of the ones--

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.659
some of your highlights
over the years?

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:31.200
Is that an awful
question to ask you?

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.725
Sorry.

00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:32.095
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:32.095 --> 00:12:32.960
DAVID KEEGAN: What are
your favorite children?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.432
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Who
are your favorite children?

00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:36.890
DAVID KEEGAN: I
loved "HALF LIGHT."

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.430
I just loved the message in it.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.700
It was appropriate for kids,
and families, and adults.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.217
And it's like, is this kid's
kind of little fantasy--

00:12:43.217 --> 00:12:45.800
he builds his own little fantasy
land of exactly that-- trying

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:52.160
to find the dad he's more
familiar than the dad who's

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.680
suffering with depression, but
he doesn't know what it is.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.880
It's not named.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.670
It's just a thing.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.490
It's just not the dad he knows.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.625
And so he's on this
little journey and--

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.440
yeah.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.030
I loved it.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.710
But, like, what I heard
anecdotally after the fact,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.470
I'd been told about a person who
was involved with the festival,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.580
and they had come
along with their kids

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.040
to one of the performances.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.890
And he had confided in me
that they'd brought along--

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.770
and he'd actually suffered at
that one stage with depression,

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.830
but they'd never really
talked about it as a family.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.390
And so essentially--

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:29.650
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
It's lovely.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.260
Is there a way--

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.635
DAVID KEEGAN:
Well, this is the--

00:13:31.635 --> 00:13:33.224
well, not actually,
because he was

00:13:33.224 --> 00:13:34.640
in a better place
at the time when

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.181
he brought-- when
the kids came along

00:13:36.181 --> 00:13:37.790
and they went as a family.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.890
And after the fact, he
got in touch to say,

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.849
actually, we came out of
the show and one of the kids

00:13:42.849 --> 00:13:44.390
actually turned
around and said, dad,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.560
is that what you were going
through, or kind of a thing?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.820
And then that opened up
the opportunity for him

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.980
to have that conversation
with his kid.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.100
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's amazing.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.040
DAVID KEEGAN: And then kind of
gain a level of understanding

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.372
about what had happened.

00:13:56.372 --> 00:13:58.580
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: What
an insightful little child.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.340
DAVID KEEGAN: Absolutely.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.840
Yeah.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.574
And so we're very
familiar that what we do

00:14:04.574 --> 00:14:06.740
does have an impact because
there's lots of research

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.450
around creativity
and mental health,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.290
and it having a good,
positive social impact.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.540
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: I'm
hearing no favorites, David.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.498
DAVID KEEGAN: So, yeah.

00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:16.280
I loved that.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.560
What else?

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.564
Like, there's been so many
pieces that have come through.

00:14:21.564 --> 00:14:22.730
What have been my favorites?

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.750
I should have really
thought about this

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.232
before I kind of
sat down with you.

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:26.690
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Oh, that's OK.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.290
We can come back
to that later on.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.540
We've probably had a few
people in the audience who've

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.290
been to a few and might be
able to share some of theirs.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.940
DAVID KEEGAN: Like some of our--

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.570
one of the things that we do
is we partner with the Fringe

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.070
Festival--

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.064
Dublin Fringe Festival.

00:14:40.064 --> 00:14:42.230
And every year, they have
the Fringe Festival awards

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.710
like the Spirit of the
Fringe, or Best Production.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.020
We partnered with them
because we wanted to award

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.414
a piece of theater that
speaks to the mission of First

00:14:50.414 --> 00:14:52.330
Fortnight's challenge
in mental health stigmas

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.430
or experimental health themes.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.460
And the very first year
we offered that award,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.150
there were, I think, four pieces
shortlisted for consideration

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.850
for our award, and a piece won.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.150
It was called "Dolls."

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.460
And the point of "Dolls"
was it was like a--

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.210
it bombarded all of your senses.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.610
It was kind of like
movement in a dance piece,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.400
but essentially was kind
of mixed multimedia.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:25.050
It was, like, really bright
light and really loud

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.300
piece with movement,
and it was repetitive.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.520
And then it showed very
kind of graphic images,

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.125
but they were graphic images
that we see on a daily basis.

00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:33.750
But, ultimately, the
point of the piece

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.630
was to present what
women have to go through

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.870
and what they have to kind
of experience in the media.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.620
What they're told.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.980
The messaging that's
consistently--

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.260
is on rotation,
basically, and the impact

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.957
that it has to women
and their mental health.

00:15:48.957 --> 00:15:51.040
And then we kind of
contextualized the whole thing

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:58.730
with post-show debate
about new ways of--

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.660
or challenging media,
and stuff like that.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.030
So the ones that have
kind of come through--

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.912
so that was-- when we offered
that award, as I said,

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:08.370
there were four
pieces shortlisted.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.970
So we did that award this year.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.600
And I think there's 24 pieces
shortlisted by the Fringe

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.340
Festival, with another 6.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.440
So our intention by
offering that award

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.146
was that we only have so much
time to see art to program.

00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:23.520
And so to the
Fringe Festival, we

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.160
get to see now
all of their work,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.290
but not only just see the
work and then award it.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.760
It's actually encourage--

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.810
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
It's another platform.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.476
DAVID KEEGAN: --and
encourage more work.

00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:35.280
Inspire more work to
be made in this vein

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.144
and challenge societal
norms that really should

00:16:40.144 --> 00:16:41.310
be challenged at this stage.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.143
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
And can you tell us yet

00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:44.894
who you've chosen for
next year from the--

00:16:44.894 --> 00:16:46.143
DAVID KEEGAN: Fringe Festival?

00:16:46.143 --> 00:16:46.770
Yeah.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.299
It's called "Infinity."

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:51.090
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Who's presenting that?

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.631
Do you know off the
top of your head?

00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:54.170
Sorry to put you on the spot.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.725
DAVID KEEGAN: God, someone
look-- open the program there,

00:16:55.725 --> 00:16:57.016
and they'll be able to tell me.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:01.950
But it's a beautiful piece
of theater around, I suppose,

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.780
again, the bombardment on
our senses and, you know,

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.829
the digital kind of impact
of communication nowadays.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.790
And, I suppose, the
anxiety around just how

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.801
bombarded we are by--

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.550
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
The constant flashing

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.750
or the light on your phone?

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.410
DAVID KEEGAN: Exactly.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:19.910
Yeah.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.220
And it's kind of--

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.777
the message is that it's
kind of OK to not be OK.

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:25.860
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.943
DAVID KEEGAN: But, yeah,
it was a fantastic piece,

00:17:27.943 --> 00:17:29.960
and an easy one for us
to judge on this year.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.860
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Brilliant.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.490
Over the years, have you noticed
in what way, or if at all,

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.480
the conversations during
the festival have changed?

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.685
Like maybe the Q&amp;A afterwards.

00:17:44.685 --> 00:17:46.140
Have they changed at all?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.970
How is the conversation
developing?

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.970
DAVID KEEGAN: I think--

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:57.344
best example I can give you
is we worked with a band

00:17:57.344 --> 00:17:58.760
when we were kind
of starting off.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.880
I think it was into
our first four years.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.520
And we worked with a band, and
they were quite a high profile

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.160
band at the time.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.970
So we had kind of extended
an invitation to participate.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.650
We always provide
the opportunity

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.015
for artists who want to
speak on the subject of--

00:18:16.015 --> 00:18:18.470
or the themes raised in the
festival program, the themes

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.280
that we want to
discuss by programming

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.790
the festival the way we do.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.400
You don't have to have had
a mental health problem.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.810
This festival is for everybody.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.570
It's actually just exploring
mental health themes.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.550
There's a lot in
there for everyone

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.410
to kind of get
their head around.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:39.002
But, essentially, after the
festival had happened and--

00:18:39.002 --> 00:18:41.210
so I asked it at this
particular event that happened.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.387
It was a music event.

00:18:43.387 --> 00:18:45.470
One of the members of that
band kind of approached

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:51.180
myself and my co-founder and
was really apologetic and very,

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.110
very emotional because
they didn't necessarily

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.210
know what they were
participating in.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.850
It was more an opportunity
to play this big gig that

00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:59.630
was happening.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.840
But, actually, it
was over the course

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.630
of their involvement in the
festival that they'd come to--

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.850
they'd apparently gone
to their record company,

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.080
because they'd recently had a
diagnosis of manic depression,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.930
and they approached their
publisher to find out whether

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.480
or not they could share
that story through the media

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.900
because they were doing
an article for a national

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.010
broadsheet, and the advice
was given that they shouldn't.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.880
So then they performed
the event and realized

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.255
retrospectively, you know,
the impact that we were trying

00:19:37.255 --> 00:19:39.254
to have and the reasons
that we were programming

00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:41.250
these types of events
and the festival itself,

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.491
and he was hugely emotional,
massively apologetic--

00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:45.990
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Of course,
there are emotional moments.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.850
DAVID KEEGAN: --for not having
shared his story because that

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.840
was kind of the point.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.370
But, look, the
other side of it is

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:56.510
that he may not have been
ready to share that story.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.640
Because we bring
a lot of attention

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.057
to the program itself, and it's
a very personal kind of journey

00:20:02.057 --> 00:20:03.890
someone has to take to
be comfortable enough

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.310
to share that story
and shine a light on it

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.700
because the stigma is still so
prevalent in today's society,

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.202
which is--

00:20:11.202 --> 00:20:13.370
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
And how is the Q&amp;A,

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.500
the after show conversations?

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.490
Have they changed?

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.600
Are people asking new
questions, or are more people

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.570
asking questions?

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:21.820
DAVID KEEGAN: Sorry.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.611
I kind of ducked that
question a little bit

00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:24.650
by giving an anecdote.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:25.100
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Sorry.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.914
DAVID KEEGAN: So has
the conversation--

00:20:26.914 --> 00:20:28.830
I'll tell you, the
conversations have changed.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.440
I think people are
a lot more open

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.890
to talking about mental health.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.130
In my experience, it tends
to be one person removed

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.650
from the person
you're talking about.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.540
Now, I've been in a
very privileged position

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.420
in that I've been doing this
a long time and my friends

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.640
feel very comfortable
to talk to me about what

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.430
they might be going through,
or a family situation,

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.627
or whatever.

00:20:50.627 --> 00:20:52.460
But if it's someone
that I tend not to know,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.130
it tends to be one person
removed from the person--

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.150
someone else's problem.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.400
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
[INAUDIBLE] distance.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.733
DAVID KEEGAN: And there's also--

00:21:00.733 --> 00:21:02.270
there still seems
to be a distance.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.110
And there's, like--

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.110
I mean, now you can go on
any social media channel

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.420
and you'll generally
see something every day

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.610
about mental health in the feed.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.220
But, again, social media
now has just become,

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.630
you know-- you're numb to it.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.190
You see it in a feed, but how
much do you-- see the headline,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.648
but do you actually
read the story?

00:21:18.648 --> 00:21:20.800
How much of an impact
does it actually have?

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.770
So yeah, it's a
lot more prevalent,

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.350
but stigma and culture
takes a long time to change.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.780
And it presents another
problem, not really a problem,

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.170
but I think the
conversation's so prevalent,

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.770
and it's, again, I'd
like to think we're

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.430
part of that cultural shift.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.170
But now people are happy to
talk about mental health more

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.350
openly or even address
issues before they

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.660
become serious problems.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.200
But if you rely on
public services,

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.460
the help really isn't there.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.020
You're going on a waiting
list for six to nine months.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.647
And if you're in a
state of emergency,

00:22:00.647 --> 00:22:01.730
that's where you're going.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.230
You're going to
the emergency room,

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.260
and you'll be given a priority.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.180
And that's something that
really needs to change.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.790
So in terms of the
dialogue as well, I mean,

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.445
two years ago we started a
campaign in collaboration

00:22:14.445 --> 00:22:17.120
with one of our mental health
partners, Mental Health Reform.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.580
And it was around 24 hours, 7
day a week emergency service

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.760
provision.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.360
The following year,
Minister Jim Daly

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.250
announced that it
would be happening,

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.620
but it would be set up 24-hour
care, five days a week.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.650
So you can see it shifting.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.730
Now, it's slow to shift, but
they're all positive changes,

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.460
certainly going the
right direction.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.418
But like instead of
answering questions around,

00:22:41.418 --> 00:22:42.310
I did a talk for--

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.890
I'm not sure if you're familiar
with the Federation of Music

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.781
Collectives, or Hard
Working Class Heroes.

00:22:47.781 --> 00:22:49.280
It's a festival,
like music festival

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.850
that goes on in the city.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:56.190
So I was asked to
participate in a talk

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.720
about music and mental health.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.100
And one of the questions
I was asked about

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.280
was about the
pressures on musicians

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.060
to merely create a
mental illness in order

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.700
to bring focus onto your
music or the pressures

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.832
they feel to open
up about things

00:23:13.832 --> 00:23:16.290
that they wouldn't necessarily
be comfortable with to bring

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.786
attention or promote the
music that they're trying to--

00:23:18.786 --> 00:23:21.160
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: As it's
their social responsibility?

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.951
Was that what the--

00:23:21.951 --> 00:23:23.190
DAVID KEEGAN: No, not even.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:27.282
Almost like saying
like it's disingenuous.

00:23:27.282 --> 00:23:28.740
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
If they don't?

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.390
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah, that it's
not necessarily a problem.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.130
That it wasn't
necessarily depression,

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.088
but that they're calling
it depression in order

00:23:34.088 --> 00:23:35.730
to bring attention
to their music.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.960
And I don't know whether
or not I buy into that.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.710
But it seemed to--

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.293
I saw a lot of nods
when the questions

00:23:42.293 --> 00:23:45.340
were asked in the room, so it
seemed to be a shared opinion.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.257
So that's quite toxic.

00:23:46.257 --> 00:23:47.881
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's very toxic.

00:23:47.881 --> 00:23:50.430
DAVID KEEGAN: And I don't know
really where that comes from.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.000
And I wonder, is it part
of like that we're just

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.960
like numb to how prevalent we
see it in social media field

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.620
feeds?

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.080
But how many meaningful
conversations

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.370
do you realistically
have about mental health?

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.828
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Do you think--

00:24:04.828 --> 00:24:07.620
is it another way of
promoting the stigma,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.400
or protecting yourself from
being involved in the stigma,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.990
having that attitude,
do you think?

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.920
DAVID KEEGAN: Having
the attitude as to be--

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.910
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That those artists are--

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.035
she is really depressed,
he's not really depressed.

00:24:20.035 --> 00:24:21.960
They're doing it
because it helps--

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.210
they're saying this because
it helps sell their album.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.780
Is it another way of just
ignoring the problem,

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.902
or is it fear?

00:24:28.902 --> 00:24:30.360
DAVID KEEGAN: I
think it comes back

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.850
to this idea of presenting your
best self on social media, that

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.950
people then [INAUDIBLE]
Irish speak,

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.710
like even though it's
like we're on Google

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.920
and it's multicultural.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.266
But I don't know if you've
ever heard of Irish begrudgery?

00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:47.640
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: You should
explain Irish begrudgery.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.410
We might be the only
two Irish people.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.970
Well, there's maybe four of us.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.760
DAVID KEEGAN: OK,
Irish begrudgery

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.040
is, we're happy
for you to do OK,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.360
but if you do better than OK--

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.172
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Get back down.

00:24:58.172 --> 00:25:00.580
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah, you
need to find your place

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.663
and you need to be on a
level with everybody else.

00:25:02.663 --> 00:25:06.350
No one wants to see
someone else be successful.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.267
That tends to be the--

00:25:07.267 --> 00:25:09.641
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: But we're
very nice other than that.

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:10.590
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.650
So I don't know if it's around--
and I have had conversations

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.320
with friends who are
artists, and they

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.480
would be on social
media and they'd

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.910
be looking at other
artists on social media

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.894
and seeing that they've had this
success, and blah blah blah,

00:25:23.894 --> 00:25:25.810
and then they'd go, well,
I'm better than him.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.820
I don't understand why
he's getting that gig.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.150
And they've taken themselves
off social media because--

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.358
and not to say that social
media is a terrible thing,

00:25:32.358 --> 00:25:35.130
but just to say that
there are impacts with all

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.120
of this sharing.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.170
And I suppose what
it comes down to is

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.480
like a meaningful
conversation, like you're

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.630
having a meaningful
sharing with somebody.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.970
And that's, again, the
purpose of the festival.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.360
It's actually bringing
people out to be at an event

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.950
and actually experience it.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.394
Because me talking about a
mental health arts and culture

00:25:55.394 --> 00:25:56.810
festival, I'm sure
some of you who

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.726
are sitting in the room
who haven't been to it

00:25:58.726 --> 00:26:00.260
or been to anything
similar to it

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.030
would be like, how
does that even work?

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.230
And we were like
that for a few years,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.420
and we were doing
it for a few years

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.630
and coming to terms
of what the model is

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.780
and what our approach
is and how we affect

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.632
change, meaningful change.

00:26:14.632 --> 00:26:15.840
And it's all of those things.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.900
And I mean, the
festival is like--

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.920
it's a selection box for
mental health discussions.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.530
So a lot of people
don't know the ways

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.470
that you can manage
your mental health,

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.370
like to balance lifestyle.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.170
And like, obviously,
medication is one approach.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.730
But then your diet has a big
impact on your mental health.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:40.260
You know, your stress
levels, how social

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.190
you are, whether you're getting
enough exercise, those bits

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.690
and pieces.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:44.430
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Time and nature.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.770
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.430
Absolutely.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.240
Like, we have a
massive disconnect now

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.620
in society from nature, and
when you think about it,

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.810
everything's man made around us.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.810
We weren't born-- we're mammals.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.580
We've just lost our
connection to nature.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.660
And just a walk, or
like a bit of exercise,

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.040
or addressing some dietary.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.680
Your diet can have a
massive impact on your mood.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.190
And people don't know it.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.170
I know it's anecdotal
to say, well,

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.420
of course that's common sense.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.362
Well, it's one thing
saying common sense.

00:27:19.362 --> 00:27:20.820
It's another thing--
so well, these

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.310
are the things you should
look at to address your diet.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.180
Because, well, what
are you eating?

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.710
And again, some of the things
that would happen, say,

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.040
in a play, where we would
advertise the general public,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.830
it's not direct or
target marketed to people

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.600
who are interested in theater.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.420
It's actually just there
could be like a big name who's

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.360
in a theater production and
you might just pop along to it

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.710
because a friend brought you.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.830
It's important for us to
contextualize it for someone

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.760
where the message isn't
necessarily clear,

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.300
or just to provide an
opportunity for questions,

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.050
which you're more than
welcome to ask over

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.130
the course of this conversation.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:02.060
But I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:07.370
What's interesting, actually,
is how the priorities

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.990
change for us year to year.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.290
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: OK.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.240
DAVID KEEGAN: Like, well,
just to give another example,

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.950
one of our French
Festival award winners

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.469
was an amazing company
called Sunday's Child,

00:28:15.469 --> 00:28:17.510
and they did a piece called
"My Name is Saoirse."

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.360
And it was around the time
of the abortion referendum.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.470
And her whole piece was
just about the impact on--

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.590
so she wrote a piece about
a young girl whose mother

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.100
passed away when she was
young, and she had two brothers

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.770
and she was being raised
by her father and stuff.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.650
And she had gotten
pregnant unexpectedly

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:41.390
when she was a teenager, but
then lived in a rural town

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.690
and then couldn't tell anybody
and couldn't tell her father,

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.250
and had to deal
with it on her own,

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.458
and not only did she have
to deal with it on her own,

00:28:48.458 --> 00:28:52.490
she wasn't ready to have a
child, so wanted to travel away

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.760
to have a termination.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.910
So it was about this
experience and the trauma

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.670
that she had to go through,
kind of just accepting

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.920
that she was in the situation,
having no one to talk

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.190
to for fear of it going
to this rural community,

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.939
and having to deal with not
only the stigma of getting

00:29:09.939 --> 00:29:11.480
pregnant in the
first place, but then

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.320
the stigma of having
a termination.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.820
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
All on her own.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.920
DAVID KEEGAN: And all on her
own with no access to support.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.560
And just sort of things
like having to get

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.490
say a boat as opposed to a
plane for fear of being seen

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.140
at an airport by somebody else.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.640
So it made more sense.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.280
So again, that
became like a theme.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.410
And we aren't so arrogant
to just program a festival

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.710
without actually
asking our audience

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.980
what it is they want to see
in the next festival program.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.400
So we had never programmed
child and family events.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.840
We were kind of broad program
for like a broad demographic,

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.710
but never specifically to
other family friendly events.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:03.980
And then we started to get this
feedback to start doing them.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.364
And that program's
just blown up.

00:30:07.364 --> 00:30:09.530
So just to say as well,
we're called First Fortnight

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.620
because we start at the
beginning of the new year.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.630
So there's a green
ribbon campaign

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.570
run by one of our mental
health partners, See Change,

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.670
That happens in May.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.050
And then there's mental health
week which is in October,

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.133
World Mental Health Day
is on the 10th of October.

00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:29.750
But I suppose our model is
based on my co-founder, JP,

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.940
as a psychotherapist
and a social worker.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.190
He would just know from the
beginning of the new year,

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:38.100
or that first quarter, his
caseload would shoot up.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.810
And Christmas is challenging
for a lot of people.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.524
I'm not massively
into Christmas,

00:30:44.524 --> 00:30:45.440
and I never have been.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.629
I've never been one
for New Year's either.

00:30:47.629 --> 00:30:49.670
But if you've had a
particularly challenging year

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.589
and you're facing
into a brand new one,

00:30:51.589 --> 00:30:53.630
and you haven't had a
particularly good Christmas

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.590
or New Year's, or you've
found it quite stressful,

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.190
that first quarter,
that first month,

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.260
can be quite challenging.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.160
So that's why we kind
of do it when we do it.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.940
It's to start people off on a
positive mental health note,

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.820
explore some of these
teams in the hope

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.250
that someone will
come along or someone

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.720
will read about us in
an associated article,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.609
and address an issue before
it becomes a serious problem.

00:31:19.609 --> 00:31:20.900
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Thank you.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.510
Have we got any questions
from the audience?

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.780
I have lots more to
go, but if someone--

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.420
great.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.310
You can fire away.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.120
I'm just curious, how do
you pick the pieces that

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.067
go into the festival?

00:31:33.067 --> 00:31:35.150
Are people coming to you
or are you going to them,

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.580
and how has that
changed over the years?

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.240
DAVID KEEGAN: Good question.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.330
Yeah, in the beginning we--

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.210
so I should also
say that what we do

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.870
is only possible because of
the voluntary support we get.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.600
When we started off, again,
we had full time jobs that

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.010
paid our rent or our mortgages.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.250
So we did this in
our spare time.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:59.530
And we've kind of
maintained that model.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.600
We're very grassroots.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.310
And we've kind of grown
to an organization

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.650
that-- well, at this stage
we're five employees,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:10.720
and then we contract employees
or contract staff who

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.530
come in and deliver the festival
program in tech and, say,

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.420
communications, or
volunteer coordinator.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.590
Well, we'd have 150 people
who will voluntarily

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.990
sign up to deliver
the festival program.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.450
Our board is voluntary
and they're 12 people.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.940
And we have an auto
resource team, about seven,

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.070
who fundraise on
our behalf, again,

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.310
voluntary, and a communications
team of about five,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.340
again, voluntary.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.298
That's the only thing
that makes this possible.

00:32:35.298 --> 00:32:37.030
But ultimately, all
of those people,

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.320
they are the change makers.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.252
And the sales guys will
help us to program.

00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:44.210
In the background, as I
said, we're five staff.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.380
But I mentioned, we run a
center for creative therapy.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.670
So we employ two art therapists
to work with our clients,

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.980
and then we've got two
full time staff and then

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.530
two other kind of
part time staff.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:01.720
So some years we do call out
for work, and we'll just,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.180
through our partners,
we'll just look for people

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.460
to make submissions
to us, and then

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.540
we'd have a panel of
experts who will basically

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.930
judge the work based
on our priorities,

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.724
and then we'll decide
on the program.

00:33:16.724 --> 00:33:19.390
And it comes down to funding, as
well, what funding is available

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.790
for the festival program.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.770
And year on year,
the festival just

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.680
keeps getting bigger,
and around 20%

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.990
between what it cost
in terms of resources,

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.400
but in terms of the
actual program itself.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.980
So the ambition
was always that we

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.550
would produce a national
mental health festival,

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.235
but it's just been very
organic in its development.

00:33:39.235 --> 00:33:41.050
It started in Dublin,
and then we kind of

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.730
went to the satellite
counties, and then

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:47.260
we kind of identified
Cork as a new hub,

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.170
and that festival program
has expanded from one event

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.160
into eight.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.080
We're in 24 counties this
year with about 184 events.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.650
With this addition
of the festival

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.510
is actually Europe's
Mental Health Festival

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.300
that we're presenting,
with participation

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.450
from 12 countries, with
two European networks.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.630
So it's kind of a combination.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.360
It's work that we may have
started to develop over

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.060
a period of time.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.530
And it's the staple
things that we do,

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.340
like the staples being like
we have a flagship music event

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.699
at the end of the program.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.449
We do, obviously, our French
Festival award winner.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:26.590
That goes to whatever
production wins.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.750
And we've got therapy
sessions that happen

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.949
in the workmen's every year.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:36.087
But then the selection
process through the call out--

00:34:36.087 --> 00:34:37.670
so it's kind of a
combination of that.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.836
And then we'll have board
members who are interested

00:34:39.836 --> 00:34:43.179
or experts in particular
areas, like film or theater,

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.730
who will kind of make
recommendations to the board.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.520
So it's kind of a combination
of all those things.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.589
But we're constantly
looking for new work.

00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:52.380
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
It's a great question.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.920
Do you something
you want to submit?

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.320
Maybe.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.020
Excellent.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.635
Any other questions
from the audience?

00:34:58.635 --> 00:35:01.382
Yes, at the back of the room.

00:35:01.382 --> 00:35:03.090
AUDIENCE: So you
started the conversation

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.430
off talking about
stigma of mental health.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:09.450
And as someone who
has had mental health

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.590
issues and problems
the last few years,

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.190
I've got a lot of
support from the company

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.110
that I've worked
for prior to Google.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.610
And since starting
Google, I've seen

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.740
all of the AP, all of
the mental health stuff.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.430
But from a corporate
level, what do you

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.760
think a company can do to help
the stigma, particularly around

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.002
mental health?

00:35:28.002 --> 00:35:30.319
DAVID KEEGAN: Things like this.

00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:31.360
I think things like this.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.320
It's a very mature approach
to address and actually kind

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:41.200
of recognizing the impact of
the positive mental health

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.744
and well being of staff
on an organization.

00:35:44.744 --> 00:35:46.660
And I think the tech
companies, in particular,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:52.702
have been the leaders in this
approach in my experience.

00:35:52.702 --> 00:35:54.160
Because I've done
a couple of these

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.370
with a couple of tech
companies, and I've

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:05.140
been really impressed with
the investment in the staff,

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.655
and the recognition of the
importance of mental health

00:36:08.655 --> 00:36:10.750
and well-being.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.480
I think a lot of
other organizations

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:19.180
could take note and apply some
of the same-- like actually,

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.150
mental health week is a good
idea in kind of any company,

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.730
or just check-ins with staff.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.210
I don't know if it's-- with some
tech companies provide access

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.300
to free mental health care,
or access to therapists,

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.970
or like even massages
and stuff like that.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.090
I mean, I never got
that in my profession,

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.812
and I don't know that you, when
you were a practicing artist.

00:36:42.812 --> 00:36:44.020
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Exactly.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.145
When I was a practicing
artist, there was certainly

00:36:46.145 --> 00:36:47.570
none of that kind of support.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.360
But I had a lot of
free time, you know,

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.640
for walks on the beach
or things like that.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.810
So I guess I should look
after my own mental health

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.210
from my own point of view.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.120
But we are, yeah, we are lucky.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.860
We do have quite a
significant amount of support.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.770
And it is lovely
to have this talk.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:08.500
And originally, when I was
saying at the beginning,

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.530
I wanted David to come in,
I think, back in February,

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.010
but I was conscious that he
had just finished the festival,

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.230
and then between a
few different things,

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.610
I changed the date a few times.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.940
But I think it turned out to be
a lovely timing for the talk,

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.240
really, not only for--

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.490
well, for the festival,
that's great to support that--

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.070
but also because of
everything you've

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.210
been saying about the time
of year, the limited sunlight

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.360
that we have this time of
year, and just all the effects

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.490
that that can have.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.450
So it is great to
continue the conversation.

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:38.512
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah.

00:37:38.512 --> 00:37:40.220
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Any other questions?

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.280
Another one at the
front of the room.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.517
Thanks, Marina.

00:37:43.517 --> 00:37:45.850
AUDIENCE: So I really liked
what you were talking about,

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.610
the events that involve family,
so parents and children.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.220
So you think there's any
gap in terms of teenagers?

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.460
I know that my
sister is 16, and I

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.200
try and be as open
as possible with her

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.449
so that she talks about
it with her friends.

00:37:58.449 --> 00:37:59.865
And she said that
they had someone

00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:02.830
in talking to them about mental
health, which is something

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.390
that I never got in school.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.790
But do you see teenagers
coming to your events,

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.039
that kind of age group?

00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:10.330
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:14.290
And we started to
program specifically

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:17.330
for that demographic, who
are massively at risk.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.410
And we're seeing unbelievable
record numbers of anxiety,

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.980
particularly amongst
teenagers and younger.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.060
We've partnered, actually,
with SpunOut out this year

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:34.960
to engage with their audiences
on what our messaging is,

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.430
but also involving
their audience in work

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.811
that we're kind of doing.

00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:45.810
There's a massive duty
of care, though, as well,

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:46.518
at the same time.

00:38:46.518 --> 00:38:50.790
Because the its
every kind of winter,

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:54.390
we've tried to launch project
where we would work directly

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.910
in schools to bring these
conversations to schools,

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:00.690
and actually provide an
opportunity for the youth

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:05.040
to engage with mental
health service providers.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:10.320
And for kids in schools, it
can be a very toxic place.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.940
So it's work that we
would like to do more of,

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.550
but also, we're very conscious
in terms of our duty of care,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.040
that we don't want to just
parachute into a school

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.210
and then disappear.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:22.710
I know you got a
lot of at risk kids

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.260
who've been encouraged
to speak openly,

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.940
and then there would
be no support for them.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.600
In a lot of cases,
you've got teachers

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.030
who are inundated,
under-resourced,

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:40.010
having to be that
front-line, essentially,

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.434
therapist, or person
for that kid to talk to.

00:39:43.434 --> 00:39:44.850
And they're not
equipped, and they

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.535
shouldn't be in that position.

00:39:46.535 --> 00:39:47.910
And then you've
got other schools

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.993
that would have guidance
counselors who are there,

00:39:49.993 --> 00:39:54.090
really, to provide professional
guidance counseling,

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.870
and not there from a mental
health and well-being

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.110
perspective.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.980
But Jigsaw are doing a
lot of work with schools

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.970
and stuff like
that, and SpunOut.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.110
So we're kind of partnering with
them on individual projects.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:12.660
And as I said, we built our
organization up voluntarily.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.290
We invest heavily in
kind of marketing and PR

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:18.490
communications,
because as I said,

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:22.690
the festival is a medium to
have these conversations.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:25.032
So it's important
for us to communicate

00:40:25.032 --> 00:40:26.490
what's happening
with the festival,

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.960
because we're
limited by capacity.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.260
I said we have 184 events
in this festival program.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.980
We're generally able
to 80% occupancy

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.845
because we invest so heavily
in the market, communications

00:40:37.845 --> 00:40:38.470
in the message.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.610
But our reach is far
greater than the festival

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:42.450
program itself.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.779
So I suppose our
approach is that people

00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:47.070
can have the opportunity to
read about what we're doing

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.320
and start those kitchen
table conversations.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.150
So it's far more prevalent
to provide the opportunity.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.840
And the festival,
again, it provides

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.907
a kind of a safe space where
that conversation's possible.

00:40:57.907 --> 00:41:00.240
Because someone's talking
about on stage, and it's like,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.310
Jesus, you know, actually--

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.893
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Maybe it's
OK to start the conversation--

00:41:03.893 --> 00:41:06.300
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah, and
another example of that is--

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.110
so we carry out attitudinal
research every year.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.690
And our audience is 70% women.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:15.300
And we knew that just from,
again, are you male or female?

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.990
It's completely anonymous.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.860
But that would hold true with
cultural festivals or the arts,

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.390
generally.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:29.710
There's generally 70%
women, 30% male audiences.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.620
But again, we're about impact.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.490
So we needed to
diversify and engage

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.460
with a male kind
of demographic--

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.340
I know yours is specific
to kind of younger adults,

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.960
but just to give
you an example, I

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.150
suppose, we
diversified in sport,

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:50.580
I suppose, to engage
with younger men as well.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.720
We designed an event
called Corinthian,

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.270
and have had people, like
for instance, [? Brezzie, ?]

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.569
or like--

00:41:59.569 --> 00:42:01.860
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: There's
a GAA player, isn't there?

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.600
There's a GAA--

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.480
DAVID KEEGAN: Don
[? Loke, ?] is it?

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.563
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:07.410
DAVID KEEGAN:
Yeah, and so, yeah,

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.740
we kind of tried to
like-- and again, we're

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.800
just responding to what
people want to see, and then

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.460
try to match the
ambitions of the festival

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.210
with resources in
order to do what we do.

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.917
Also, I should say
about our model, what

00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:27.125
we do is only possible
through creative collaboration

00:42:27.125 --> 00:42:29.310
of partnerships.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:33.030
It does a lot of logos on the
inside sleeve of that program

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:36.090
from a funding perspective, but
also from a reach perspective.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.800
We have four mental
health partners there.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.850
And without their support and
their help and their advice

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.340
year on year, what we
do wouldn't be possible.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.180
We wouldn't be able to
get into 24 counties

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.360
and have the impact
that we have.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.267
So Jigsaw for instance,
and SpunOut, do great work.

00:42:51.267 --> 00:42:53.850
And we want to do more work with
them in the future to program

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:55.860
and cater for those audiences.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.750
Because again,
there's record numbers

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.830
in depression and anxiety
in younger people, and--

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.785
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
So Jigsaw and SpunOut.

00:43:03.785 --> 00:43:05.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I just think it's

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.785
such an amazing medium to get
the conversation going on it--

00:43:08.785 --> 00:43:09.660
DAVID KEEGAN: Thanks.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.280
AUDIENCE: --and
everything you do.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.756
Thank you so much.

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.589
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Another quick question.

00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:15.690
We might get a time check.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:18.221
Can somebody--
are we OK on time?

00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:19.970
Before we go to another
audience question,

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.990
kind of a bit of a segue
then into the service

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.510
provision that you're
moving into and advocacy,

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.590
and what does that
change mean for festival?

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.350
What does it mean for
you and your workload?

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:37.890
And what should we expect
from you guys next?

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:42.120
DAVID KEEGAN: OK, well,
that's a big question.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.479
So yeah, our advocacy work
has been through the festival

00:43:46.479 --> 00:43:47.520
and growing the festival.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.660
So I mean, the presentation
of this European edition

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.540
of our festival, that started
in 2015, believe it or not,

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.300
when Dublin were in
part of the Dublin 2020

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.960
bid, when we were invited to
be part of the Dublin 2020 bid.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:08.580
And we were listening to all of
the great benefits, city gains,

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.420
from winning the award of
capital city of culture.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.287
European city of culture?

00:44:14.287 --> 00:44:15.370
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:17.703
DAVID KEEGAN: And we kind of
had this collective thought

00:44:17.703 --> 00:44:19.440
where like, well,
why couldn't there

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.140
be a European mental
health festival?

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.260
That would bring not only the
benefits that we were hearing,

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.540
but also the social
benefits that I suppose

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.760
our festival bring
to mental health

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.990
and well-being of the respective
city that it would visit.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:35.170
And that's how that started.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:39.120
And then 2016, we were
part of a partnership that

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.690
produced Europe's first mental
health festival in Athens

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.880
in October 2016.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.650
An outcome of that
was the establishment

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.980
of a network for mental health
festivals, a European network

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.660
for mental health festivals.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.610
We made a bid to
that network to host

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.745
Europe's second mental
health festival in Ireland.

00:44:56.745 --> 00:44:59.655
And it was successful, and
that's where we are today.

00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:01.155
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's January?

00:45:01.155 --> 00:45:02.250
DAVID KEEGAN:
That's this January.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:03.625
That's what you'll
see this year.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.670
So we're switching
international little island now

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.840
at this stage.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.560
And now, more than ever, with
kind of alt-right movements

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.670
gathering momentum
across countries like--

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.580
well, a lot of Europe, but
of particular, now probably

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.930
Italy and Hungary, and with--

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.647
can I use the word
Brexit in this--

00:45:26.647 --> 00:45:28.730
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: We
talked about not using it.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:32.020
DAVID KEEGAN: I know, like, I
didn't know a way around saying

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.230
it without saying it--

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.600
happening in March,
this is an opportunity

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.910
in January with that looming
in March to celebrate

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.670
two things that connect us
despite everything else,

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.240
and that's our culture and our
mental health and well-being.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.890
So yeah, so just to come
back down, our our intention

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.710
is to actually roll out free
mental health care for artists

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:56.145
and artistic communities across
the country by Q3 of next year.

00:45:56.145 --> 00:45:57.645
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's amazing.

00:45:57.645 --> 00:45:59.186
DAVID KEEGAN: That's
been a massive--

00:45:59.186 --> 00:46:00.524
so we would identify them as--

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.440
I mean, they're core to
everything that we do,

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.030
and I, personally,
am in awe of artists.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.730
Because you know, they
have a lot of strength

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.440
and the courage to get up
on stage in the first place,

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.640
but also to open their
heart to subject matter that

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.874
is really challenging.

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:18.540
And share it with us
in the hope that it

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.150
has impact with audiences.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.750
In collaboration with
several partners,

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.820
we kind of talked about this
idea of free mental health

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.560
care for that
particular community,

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.530
and that's something
that will roll out

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:32.630
by September next year.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:33.450
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Well, that'll

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.350
be an amazing achievement.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:34.735
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah.

00:46:34.735 --> 00:46:37.151
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Can you
tell us how can our audience,

00:46:37.151 --> 00:46:39.090
or any of their friends
and their family,

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.570
get involved either next
year or the following year

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.404
at this stage maybe?

00:46:43.404 --> 00:46:44.903
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah,
you can find out

00:46:44.903 --> 00:46:47.075
everything else about the
festival on our website.

00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:48.516
It's just firstfortnight.ie.

00:46:48.516 --> 00:46:49.890
So I mean, you
all have-- there's

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.589
a festival program there.

00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:53.130
All the details are
on our festivals.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.588
As I said, it's
across the country.

00:46:54.588 --> 00:46:59.265
So and hopefully there's
something there for everyone.

00:46:59.265 --> 00:47:01.515
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: What
day does the festival start?

00:47:01.515 --> 00:47:02.385
DAVID KEEGAN: January 1.

00:47:02.385 --> 00:47:03.676
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: January 1?

00:47:03.676 --> 00:47:06.280
DAVID KEEGAN: Yeah, and
it's a whole month now.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.412
So it's actually, the
first events on the first

00:47:08.412 --> 00:47:09.745
and the last events on the 30th.

00:47:09.745 --> 00:47:11.630
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Going to change your name?

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.838
DAVID KEEGAN: Well, it always
starts in the first two

00:47:13.838 --> 00:47:14.726
weeks of the year.

00:47:14.726 --> 00:47:17.350
But we've actually, even though
[INAUDIBLE] never actually been

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:17.970
a [INAUDIBLE]--

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:18.014
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
It'll eventually

00:47:18.014 --> 00:47:18.840
be the first quarter.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.890
DAVID KEEGAN: First quarter.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.431
I don't know.

00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:22.270
For my own sanity
and mental health,

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.644
I think one month
is probably enough.

00:47:24.644 --> 00:47:26.310
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Any final questions

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.160
from the audience [INAUDIBLE]
conscious of time?

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:28.450
We're all good?

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:28.949
Oh.

00:47:28.949 --> 00:47:31.290
There's just one at
the front of the room.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:32.509
This one more.

00:47:32.509 --> 00:47:35.050
AUDIENCE: You kind of hit the
nail on the head when you said,

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.897
like, you know, Christmas can
be pretty shit for people.

00:47:37.897 --> 00:47:39.480
Do you have any kind
of tips or advice

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.580
on like, how we can kind of
look for friends and family

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.060
over Christmas who
might be going through--

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.030
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Great closing question.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.300
Thank you.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.341
AUDIENCE: --a tough time?

00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:47.460
DAVID KEEGAN: It's check-ins.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:48.780
It's making the time, you know?

00:47:52.215 --> 00:47:54.574
A lot of people know when
your friends aren't right

00:47:54.574 --> 00:47:55.740
or your family aren't right.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:56.810
And it is just--

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:58.920
it's having a cup of tea
to making the time to--

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.360
and it can be quite challenging.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.010
Because we're running around
buying Christmas presents

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.080
like lunatics, and
closing off, trying

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.180
to finish off your
loose ends, so you

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.240
can walk away without
worrying about that email

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.860
that I didn't send.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:14.260
And it's again, stress
upon stress upon stress,

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.600
but it's difficult to
try and make that time,

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.032
but it is really important.

00:48:19.032 --> 00:48:20.740
And again, I'll give
you another example.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.900
We diversified in sport.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.234
We applied for an award that
we subsequently didn't get.

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.275
We got shortlisted for
it, but we didn't actually

00:48:26.275 --> 00:48:27.100
get the award.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.460
But a person was involved
with that award scheme was

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.320
part of the big multinational.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.840
And he told me about a story
that he'd brought friends

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.400
to come to our festival.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.610
The reason he brought
his friend was his friend

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.076
was going through a tough time.

00:48:39.076 --> 00:48:40.700
And he knew something
was wrong, but he

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.380
didn't know how to bring it up.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.050
So he thought, I'll bring
him along to Corinthian

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:48.500
and see if it jars
something with him.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.112
Brought him along to
Corinthian, and on the way home,

00:48:51.112 --> 00:48:52.070
they were walking home.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.360
His friend actually
said, you know what?

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.580
I'm actually not in a
good place at the moment.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.209
They went for something
to eat and had a coffee

00:48:58.209 --> 00:48:59.750
and talked it through,
and he decided

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:04.890
he's actually going to book put
himself in for some therapy.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.440
So that's one way.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.720
But it's kind of checking
in with people, really.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.995
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: So
be brave and check in.

00:49:10.995 --> 00:49:12.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's tough.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:13.650
Thank you, David.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.233
It's been a pleasure
having you today,

00:49:15.233 --> 00:49:17.230
and I'm sorry it took me
so long to get you in.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.240
And best of luck in January.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.250
DAVID KEEGAN: Thank you.

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:24.700
