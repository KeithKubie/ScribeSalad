history there's not to say that there
 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.529
history there's not to say that there
wasn't resistance and there wasn't

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539
wasn't resistance and there wasn't
 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.689
wasn't resistance and there wasn't
conflict and that there is not a strong

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699
conflict and that there is not a strong
 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.080

sense of national unity and nationalism

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090
sense of national unity and nationalism
 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.939

is but simply that we are now at a point
 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.129
is but simply that we are now at a point
where we are some removed from the war

where we are some removed from the war
 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.570
where we are some removed from the war
and the kinds of issues that the war

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580
and the kinds of issues that the war
 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.219

and the United States and we are able to
 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.119
and the United States and we are able to
look at some of the more complicated
