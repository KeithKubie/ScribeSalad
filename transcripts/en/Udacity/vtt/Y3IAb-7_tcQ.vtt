00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We know when we are quantifying difficulty, it must somehow incorporate these two concepts

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of total amount or weight of water and the distance we have to lift it and so why don't we start

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
by thinking about the last unit.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, in the last unit, we learned about force and namely force is the cause of acceleration

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and we use this equation to describe acceleration.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, let's try to analyze this situation using forces.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, I have all this water here that I need to give rid of it that I need to pump up.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This water have some mass, which means that I can draw it as a force diagram

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and to make things simple, I've represented the waters as a simple block of mass m.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The block has a weight and the ground is supplying some normal force to keep the water up.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're using forces to analyze this situation and well it seems like total weight of water is taken care of.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We've addressed that concept but we haven't talked about the distance we have to lift this water

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which also seems very important in analyzing or quantifying this difficulty of this task.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
How much work we're going to have to do.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I've been using this word work kind of colloquially but it has a very precise meaning in physics

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and that's one we're going to learn today.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We're also going to learn about energy and what is called the conservation of energy

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so even though these terms work and energy are relatively new once.

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We can go all the way back to the time of Archimedes to study their origins.
