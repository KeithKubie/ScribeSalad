00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Here it is.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.460
The moment you’ve all been waiting for.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.940
“We’re delighted to be able to report
to you today that we have seen what we thought

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.070
was unseeable.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.620
We have seen and taken a picture of a black
hole.”

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.150
The first ever photo of a black hole, more
specifically the supermassive black hole 55

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.550
million light-years away and almost the size
of our entire solar system.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.290
It took only two years.12,000 simulations,
200 researchers, 60 institutes and an international

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.989
partnership of radio telescope sites spread
across the world, to get it.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.990
And it will finally tell us if Einstein’s
theory of general relativity’s prediction

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.860
of black holes was right or...wrong.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.440
I know that’s a hefty claim which is why
this is big deal.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.390
But don’t fret, he was right, and it’s
been confirmed that his theory holds up.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.940
As we may all know, a black hole is one of
the most extreme environments in the universe,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.059
and nothing, not even light can escape its
event horizon...

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.280
So these images are not even the real thing.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.440
But we can look at the materials going into
a black hole, like gas, stars, and other astrophysical

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440
bodies.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.831
The atoms of these materials are pulled into
the intense gravity of the black hole, which

00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:16.970
then tosses them around at extreme speeds.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.190
All that commotion causes the atoms to heat
up into white-hot emissions of X-ray and other

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.870
high-energy radiation.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.700
This is what the teams at the EHT detected
with M87.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.440
The researchers call this bright orbiting
disk of hot material, the black hole’s shadow.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.420
And the shadow is what we’re all worked
up about.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.420
Because just to remind you every other photo
you’ve seen up to this point, has been an

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.730
artist illustration.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.730
Every.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.730
Single.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.730
One.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.030
When these images were made black holes had
never been seen and still a theory.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.040
A well-known and highly accepted theory, but
a theory nonetheless.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.330
So this photo not only proves the existence
of black holes, but the shape of its shadow,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.250
verifies what we currently understand about
theoretical physics.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.670
In 1915, Einstein proposed his theory of general
relativity that explains pretty much how gravity

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.160
interacts with space and time to shape the
universe.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.870
He also predicted that the light would bend
by a certain amount when coming near immense

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.450
gravity, like our sun.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.450
Except his theory of gravity is independent
of the modern theories of quantum mechanics.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.860
These two pillars that uphold physics just
don’t work together, so one of these theories

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.220
has to budge.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.420
Black holes are one of the places to look
for answers and it looks like general relativity

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.300
may have the edge, as it’s just been proven
to hold up near one of the most extreme environments

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.750
known to man.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.950
Next steps will be understanding quantum gravity.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.770
“It is great that we can see it verified,
but we use this everyday for satellite communication,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.920
it is very integral part of our understanding
the universe.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.700
There are many people thinking about this
also, but I'm fascinated about black holes

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.569
and quantum gravity, and how does gravity
actually work?”

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.970
Researchers had only an idea on what they
should expect from the photo based on their

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.569
calculations of the black hole; an asymmetrical
lopsided ring of sorts with the disk’s light

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.569
warped around the event horizon.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.569
Which is what we got.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.620
“I have to admit, I was a little stunned
that it matched so closely be predictions

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.720
that we have made.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.340
It is gratifying, sometimes frustrating.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.069
But, this is the beginning.”

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.290
After 12,000 simulations, they produced this
photo, that matches what Einstein predicted,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.780
and it’s an amazing feat because even the
slightest deviation from general relativity

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.510
could have created different shadows entirely.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.819
Plus this is just another win for Einstein
since the discovery of the gravitational waves

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.580
in 2016 and the observations of “gravitational
redshift” at Sagittarius A-star.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.319
But just because the EHT project made event
history, they aren’t just gonna pack up

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.349
their gear and head home.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.400
Nu-uh, that’s not how this works...ever.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.270
In fact, now that they’ve proven the existence
of one of the most tremendous events to happen

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.550
in the universe, they’re going to dig deeper.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.410
“There are some very interesting things
that we want to follow up with, there are

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.830
asymmetries around the ring, the brightness
in the southern part, so there will be a lot

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.250
of future work on this to sharpen our focus
on gravity.”

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.810
