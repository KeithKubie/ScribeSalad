00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome back.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.560
I think I was rushing
that problem.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.160
So let me just make it clear
again, just so you don't get

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.270
confused, because I was
trying to get under

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.930
that 10-minute limit.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.800
But they want to know what
the perimeter of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.860
this red is, right?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.980
That's kind of the outside of
this thing that looks like a

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.570
flower or something.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.370
And what I'm saying is that the
perimeter of the red part

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.000
is equivalent to the sum of
the perimeters of the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.490
rectangle-- of the triangle,
sorry-- the sum of the

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.620
perimeters of the triangles.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.550
But if I were just to take the
sum of the perimeters of the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.230
triangle, I wouldn't just
be getting the red part.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.780
I'd also be getting in
these parts, right?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.630
Because those are parts of the
perimeters of the triangles.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.020
So if I want just the red part,
I subtract out this,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.170
what I just drew in blue, and
the blue is the perimeter of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.450
that inside square.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.350
And the perimeter of that inside
square is 9 plus 9 plus

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.340
9 plus 9, or 36.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.490
So I just take the perimeter
of all four triangles.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.110
Each of them has a perimeter of
30, so together they have a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.660
perimeter of 120, and then
subtract out the perimeter of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.630
the square inside, which
has a perimeter of 36.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.450
So 120 minus 36 is what?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.690
84.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.900
Right, 84.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.740
That's choice D.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.385
Next problem.

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:13.910
Let me remember that this is
where I ended the last one.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.830
OK, next problem.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.210
Problem number 13.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.340
The graph of g of x
is shown above.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.600
OK, I'd better draw it because
they want us to essentially

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.305
look at the graph and
figure out a value.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.810
Well, let's see, it starts at
roughly-- so if I were to--

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.405
let's see, 2, 4, 6, 8.

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:54.770
And we have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.010
I'll try my best to draw it like
they have. So the line

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.750
starts roughly a little bit
above 6, not even up to 7.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.970
And then, where does it go?

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.150
It goes to like 4.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.940
Oh my God, I thought I was
using the line tool.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.360
It starts a little bit above
6, not even up to 7.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.640
It looks like about at 1.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.140
It starts here, then it goes
to the point 4 comma 2, it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.390
looks like.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.124
And then it goes from 4 comma
2 to 6 comma 3, roughly.

00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:28.060
Or maybe even exactly.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.390
6 comma 3.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.570
And then it looks like
it goes to 8 comma 8.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.646
8 comma 8 is like
there, roughly.

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:37.390
That's about right.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.280
And then it goes down to like--
I don't know-- almost

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.020
11 comma 2.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.565
It goes to someplace like that,
and they're saying this

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:53.040
is the graph of g of x.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.540
And they're saying, if g of 2
is equal to k, which of the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.790
following could be the
value of g of k?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.110
g of k is what?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.290
So what could k equal?

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.880
Let's figure out g of 2.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.100
So when x is 2, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.780
what is y equal to?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.290
Well, it looks pretty darn close
to 5, if not exactly 5.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.010
So k is equal to 5, right?

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.060
g of 2 is equal to 5, right?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.880
And they want to know
what g of k is.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.310
Well, we figured out that k is
equal 5, so now we want to

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.870
know what g of 5 is.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.370
So we go to 5.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.940
We go, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.860
This is 5.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.310
And then we go bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.200
Looks pretty close to 3.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.340
g of 5-- and actually the way
they drew it, it doesn't look

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.370
close to 3.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.310
The way they drew it, if you
look at where 5 is, it looks

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.270
actually less than 3.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.010
It looks like 2 and
1/2, actually, the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.150
way they drew it.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.000
My drawing is a little off.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.280
So if you look down, look
at the x value.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.770
When x is equal to 5, you go up
to the graph, it looks like

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.630
the graph value there is
right around 2 and 1/2.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.790
So I should say this
is 2 and 1/2.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.880
And that is one of
the choices, B.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.130
Next problem.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.690
Problem 14.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.290
If 0 is less than or equal to x,
which is less than or equal

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.920
to 8, and negative 1 is less
than equal to y, which is less

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.460
than or equal to 3, which of the
following gives the set of

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.830
all possible values
of x times y?

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.240
OK, so we really just want to
figure out how low can x times

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.590
y be and how high can
x times y be?

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.743
Well, what's the lowest possible
value for x times y?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.560
Well, if we make y negative, and
we make x really big, or

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.420
as big as it can be, if x is 8
and y is negative 1, then that

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.140
is the lowest value for x
times y I can think of.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.410
So xy is going to be greater
than or equal to negative 8

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.850
because when you take a negative
number, you want the

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.100
other number to be as big as
possible so you get a large

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.260
negative number.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.170
And it's going to be less than
or equal to-- well, what's the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.970
largest number that
I can think of?

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.670
Well, if I take 8 and I multiply
it times the large

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.175
value of y and this is a
positive value, then I get 24.

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:46.890
So xy is going to be greater
than or equal to negative 8

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.200
and less than or equal to 24.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.640
And that is choice E.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.270
And once again, how did
I get negative 8?

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.160
This is probably the part that's
not intuitive for you.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.570
It's because-- I mean, your
instinct might have said the

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.260
minimum x is 0, right?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.500
So I'll take 0 times any
of these, so this

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.930
is going to be 0.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.740
But, you can actually get a
smaller value for xy by using

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.180
negative 1 and 8, so
that's where we got

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.760
the negative 8 from.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.920
Next question.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.590
15.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.640
Switch colors.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.352
15.

00:06:22.352 --> 00:06:23.340
Let me draw that.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.100
It looks like a line there, line
there, line there, then

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.310
there's another line that
goes like that.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.330
And they write that this is
n degrees right there.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.350
In the figure above, what is
this sum in terms of n of the

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.660
degree measures of the four
angles marked with arrows?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.940
Fascinating.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.600
So they want to know that plus
that plus that plus that.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.450
Well, let's just do
the angle game.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.520
If this angle as n, well, then
this angle is n, right?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.630
Let me switch colors.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.470
What is this angle here?

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:10.770
Well, it's supplementary to
n, so this is 180 minus n.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.490
And so is this.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.360
This is also 180 minus n.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.620
And so what are these?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.316
What's the sum of these
two angles?

00:07:20.316 --> 00:07:24.380
Let me call this a, b.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.140
What's the sum of a plus b?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.590
Well, we know that a plus b
plus this angle, plus 180

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.110
minus n is equal
to 180, right?

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.810
Because they're all in
the same triangle.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:47.860
So a plus b is equal to
180 minus 180 plus n.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.150
I just took this and subtracted
180 and added n to

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.685
both sides.

00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:56.300
This cancels out so you get
a plus b is equal to n.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.340
And similarly, if you had c,
if this were c and d, you

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.460
could do the same thing.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:07.090
c plus d plus this angle, 180
minus n is equal to 180

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.830
because they're all in
the same triangle.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.120
Subtract 180 from both sides and
then add n to both sides.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.070
You get c plus d
is equal to n.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:23.740
So if you want to know what a
plus b plus c plus d is, a

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.130
plus b is n, c plus d is n, so
the whole thing is going to be

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.760
n plus n or 2n.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.404
And that is choice B.

00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:38.110
Let's see if I have time to do
problem 16, considering I have

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.400
a little under a minute left.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.580
Problem 16.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.650
After the first term, each term
in a sequence-- actually,

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.480
this is going to be-- I think
this will take some

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.080
explanation, so I'll do 16
in a video by itself.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.990
I'll see you in the
next video.
