00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.950
Welcome to top five
of the DevBytes

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.750
series Making Apps Beautiful.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.220
Thus far, we've built
an app that didn't

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.340
have a lot of love.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.620
We modernized.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.450
We performance tuned it.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.590
But what we didn't do is make
it look exactly the same on

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.960
older versions of Android as
compared to newer versions.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.930
So just to see exactly where
we were up to there, let's

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.820
look at our app on a Nexus
S running Android 2.3

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.070
Gingerbread.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.880
So we're just starting it up.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.640
And here it is, nice
and smooth.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.040
But if we look at the title
bar, it's the old style.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.062
There is no action bar here.

00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:51.510
You wouldn't call this a very
modern-looking app, even

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.520
though it's running on an older
version of the platform.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.730
And we can do better.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.070
So let's switch back
to the slides.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.500
And let's talk about backward
compatible action bars.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.710
So there are a number of options
that you have when it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.980
comes to backward compatible
action bars.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.250
Two of the these are the
ActionBarCompat, which is part

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.590
of the Android SDK in the
Support Library, as well as

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.580
the ActionBarSherlock library,
which is a community effort

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.580
and much loved.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.040
So after having integrated these
into our apps, let's see

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.280
what it'll look like on a Nexus
S. We're just going to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.010
launch that version
of the app.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.220
And there you have it.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.610
You have a beautiful action bar
that is also themed along

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.080
with our brand.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.770
So let's just now bring it side
by side with what we have

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.770
on a modern device.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.980
And here we have the apps
running side by side on a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.930
Nexus S, as well as the current
versions of Android.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.980
Identical, which is fantastic.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.380
So switching back
to the slides.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.030
The action bar can be used
on newer versions of the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.250
platform, as well as the older
versions of the platform with

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.090
these backward compatible
components.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.639
And the nice thing about both
ActionBarCompat and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.440
ActionBarSherlock is that
on newer versions of the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770
platform, they're basically thin
wrappers for the native

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.530
action bar.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.470
It's not implementing everything
from scratch.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.220
The other thing we should talk
about is the View Pager.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.360
The View Pager allows us to
horizontally swipe across

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.470
pages to bring the previous or
the next page of content.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.030
Let's see a demo of
that on our phone.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.970
So we loaded the details
page here.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.310
And you can see I can
swipe left or right.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.810
And you'll notice here with
gestures, I don't need to

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.010
complete the gesture in
order for the next

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.890
content to come through.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.120
While my finger is still on
the screen, I can see it.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.770
So the View Pager is a great
way to page your content.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.630
And it's also backward
compatible.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.140
So switching back to the slide,
the View Pager is also

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.480
another really nice utility
class that you can include in

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.660
your apps through the Support
Library, and is backward

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.830
compatible to older versions
of Android.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.300
Finally, I want to talk about
the Navigation Drawer.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.360
The Navigation Drawer is a
patent that you've probably

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.020
seen in many apps.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.510
But we have Android design
guidelines that describe

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.230
exactly how that Navigation
Drawer should

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.740
look like on Android.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.280
Now you'll notice these screen
shots aren't from our

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.400
BaconReader app.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.110
And the reason is is that we
don't believe in shoe horning

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.660
these UI patents into apps
where they may not fit.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.870
So what we're going to look at
here is another sample app.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.090
It's not the BaconReader app.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.910
It's the sample demos that come
with the sample code for

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.020
the Navigation Drawer.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.790
So let's look at that.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.150
Let's switch to our phone.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.220
We're going to load it up.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.380
There's just a list
of planets.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.520
But you'll see here on the top
left in the action bar, it's

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.100
not the traditional app icon.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.150
It's not the angle bracket
pointing left.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.940
It's these three horizontal
bars.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.810
And when I tap it, these three
horizontal bars will actually

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.180
animate in and out to show you
whether the Navigation Drawer

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.180
has been expanded
or collapsed.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.100
The other nice thing is, we
cannot only press the app

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.829
icon, we can actually swipe,
bezel swipe, from

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.529
the left edge in.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.589
And also swipe that Navigation
Drawer out.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.670
We can also dismiss it just
by tapping outside

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.760
the Navigation Drawer.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.620
The other thing I want to
point out is some other

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.260
subtleties of the Navigation
Drawer.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.390
And that is that when I slide
it in, you'll see that the

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.300
content kind of fades.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.780
So we're making a concerted
effort to show that the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.750
Navigation Drawer isn't
shifting the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.560
content to the side.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.520
It's overlaying on top.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.400
And more importantly,
the action bar is

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.980
staying in its place.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.330
The action bar itself does not
move as a Navigation Drawer

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.130
slides in and out.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.060
So let's switch back
to the slides.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.160
And the good news about all
these subtleties that we're

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160
talking about for the Navigation
Drawer is that,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.320
one, we've documented them on
the Android Design Guidelines

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.620
page for the Navigation
Drawer.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.730
You'll see that on the bottom
right hand corner there.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.960
But also, we've made this
Navigation Drawer available

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.070
for developers through
the Support Library.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.180
Now if you want to learn a
little bit more about some of

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.580
the insights into why the
Navigation Drawer overlays on

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.680
top, and what the idea behind
the fading effect, or the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.230
handover icon is, tune
into this Android

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.660
Design in Action video.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.520
You can find it on the Android
Developers' YouTube page. .

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.620
The episode is called
Navigation Drawers.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.890
And they actually interview
the engineers that built--

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.580
the engineers and designers--
that built

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.540
this Navigation Drawer.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.340
So so far, we talked
a little bit about

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.050
this Support Library.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.160
The great thing about the
Support Library is it's just

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.600
available as part of the
Android SDK Manager.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.740
So you can just go ahead and
select it and add it.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.820
Once you add that Support
Library to your app, you get

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.750
access to a whole range of
components that are backward

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.500
compatible.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.230
So things like fragments.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.990
And we have used fragments
in this app.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.990
We saw our tablet layouts
and our phones layouts.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.370
So in order to make this fully
backward compatible, we

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.020
actually used the support
fragments

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.510
from the Support Library.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.870
Then there's new patents like
the View Pager and the

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.700
Navigation Drawer, which aren't
actually in the Android

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.840
framework yet but are available

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.320
in the Support Library.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.555
And of course we've our
ActionBarCompat,

00:06:32.555 --> 00:06:35.550
NotificationCombat, and others,
like Loaders as well.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.020
So the Support Library is full
of useful utility classes for

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.300
developers.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.140
And pretty much, there's no
reason why you shouldn't be

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.490
using it already.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.520
So with that said, we've come to
the end of the Making Apps

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.040
Beautiful series.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.030
On the left is where we started
on tablets and phones.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.860
Not a very modern looking app.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.360
Didn't look like the app
had had much love.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.660
But through changes in layouts
by including backward

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.310
compatible components, as well
as through optimization

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.350
techniques, we've been able
to make it look beautiful,

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.420
perform great, and be fully
backwards compatible.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.670
Thank you for joining us.
