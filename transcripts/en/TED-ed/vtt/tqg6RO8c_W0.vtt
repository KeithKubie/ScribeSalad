00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:18.066
Picture this:

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.391
your friend and you are watching a sitcom

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:22.765
and a sassy sidekick walks into a room,

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:25.011
carrying a four-tiered wedding cake.

00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:25.949
He trips,

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.540
falls,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.672
and face-plants into the cake.

00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.176
Your friend doubles over with laughter and says,

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:34.527
"It's so ridiculous! So ironic!"

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:36.457
Well, quick, what do you do?

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:38.329
Do you laugh along with the laugh track

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.569
and let this grievous misinterpretation of irony go?

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:43.098
Or, do you throw caution to the wind

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:45.487
and explain the true meaning of irony?

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:48.658
If you're me, you choose the latter.

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:52.591
Unfortunately, irony has been completely misunderstood.

00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.377
We tend to throw out that term

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:57.765
whenever we see something funny or coincidental.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:00.854
And while many examples of true irony can be funny,

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:04.082
that is not the driving factor of being ironic.

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:07.303
A situation is only ironic if what happens

00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:10.662
is the exact opposite of what was expected.

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:13.247
If you expect A, but get B,

00:01:13.247 --> 00:01:15.015
then you have irony.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:17.862
Let's take the slap-stick cake situation as an example.

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.941
When someone walks in precariously balancing something

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.584
that shouldn't be carried alone,

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:25.100
trips, falls, and makes a mess,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.637
it is funny, but it's not ironic.

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:29.513
In fact, you probably expect someone

00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:32.743
who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip.

00:01:32.743 --> 00:01:35.855
When he does, reality aligns with expectations,

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:38.633
and so that is not irony.

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:41.790
But what if the sassy sidekick walked in wearing a gold medal

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.959
that he'd won at the cake walking event

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.576
at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996?

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:49.921
What if that sidekick was a professional cake carrier?

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.926
Then, maybe there would have been a reasonable expectation

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:54.862
that he would have been more skilled

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:57.954
when carrying a ridiculously large cake.

00:01:57.954 --> 00:02:02.683
Then, when that reasonable expectation was not met by the tripping sidekick,

00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:05.039
irony would have been exemplified.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.286
Another example.

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:09.089
A senior citizen texting and blogging.

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.590
The common and reasonable expectation

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.253
of more mature men and women

00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:16.826
is that they don't like or know technology,

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:19.105
that they have a hard time turning on a computer,

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.879
or that they have the old brick cell phones from the 1980s.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.031
One should not expect them to be connected,

00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:26.160
high-tech,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.895
or savvy enough to text

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:29.231
or to be blogging,

00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:31.832
which must seem like some sort of newfangled thing

00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:35.360
that "back in my day," they never had.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.210
So when Granny pulls out her smart phone

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.148
to post pictures of her dentures

00:02:39.148 --> 00:02:40.530
or her grandkids,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.759
irony ensues.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.473
Reasonable expectations of the situation are not met.

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:48.354
That is irony.

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:51.316
So while the cake dropper might not be ironic,

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:55.297
there are all kinds of situations in life that are.

00:02:55.297 --> 00:02:59.126
Go out, and find those true examples of irony.
