watching the first Apollo moon landing
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.810
watching the first Apollo moon landing
way back in nineteen sixty-nine and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
way back in nineteen sixty-nine and
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.129

been interested in space and flying and
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.980
been interested in space and flying and
I was building model rockets and model

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
I was building model rockets and model
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.480
I was building model rockets and model
airplanes but something about that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
airplanes but something about that
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.769
airplanes but something about that
moment I can remember like it was

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779
moment I can remember like it was
 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.440

I was going to school but it was until I
was a university studying engineering

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400
was a university studying engineering
 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.550
was a university studying engineering
that I thought what do I really want to

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560
that I thought what do I really want to
 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.770

finished my or after i was getting my
doctorates that's when I first applied

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650
doctorates that's when I first applied
 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.880
doctorates that's when I first applied
to NASA

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
 
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440
 
well the minimum requirements to apply

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
well the minimum requirements to apply
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.140
well the minimum requirements to apply
to be a NASA astronaut are is a least a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
to be a NASA astronaut are is a least a
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.460
to be a NASA astronaut are is a least a
bachelor's degree in science or

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
bachelor's degree in science or
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.899
bachelor's degree in science or
engineering so I was getting that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
engineering so I was getting that
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969
engineering so I was getting that
covered and also you have to be in good

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
covered and also you have to be in good
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649

health which you know I was in great
health so i didn't have trouble passing

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
health so i didn't have trouble passing
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.910
health so i didn't have trouble passing
the medical but that's the basic

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
the medical but that's the basic
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.770
the medical but that's the basic
requirements you know so it's pretty

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
requirements you know so it's pretty
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.410
requirements you know so it's pretty
broad I mean NASA selects from a broad

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
broad I mean NASA selects from a broad
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480
broad I mean NASA selects from a broad
range of people in my class alone there

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
range of people in my class alone there
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.790
range of people in my class alone there
were 23 of us and there were several

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800
were 23 of us and there were several
 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.170
were 23 of us and there were several
folks from the military you know the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
folks from the military you know the
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.330
folks from the military you know the
test pilots flight test engineers but

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
test pilots flight test engineers but
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.040
test pilots flight test engineers but
there are also medical doctors research

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050
there are also medical doctors research
 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.840
there are also medical doctors research
engineers like myself we even had a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
engineers like myself we even had a
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120
engineers like myself we even had a
physicist and you know people like that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
physicist and you know people like that
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.080
physicist and you know people like that
so really it's just you know the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090
so really it's just you know the
 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.800
so really it's just you know the
recommendation that I give people who

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
recommendation that I give people who
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.630
recommendation that I give people who
are interested is study something that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
are interested is study something that
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.859
are interested is study something that
you're interested in that you have a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
you're interested in that you have a
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.200
you're interested in that you have a
passion for because that then you're

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
passion for because that then you're
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940
passion for because that then you're
going to do your best and that also

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
going to do your best and that also
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.560
going to do your best and that also
qualifies you to apply to be an

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
qualifies you to apply to be an
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990
qualifies you to apply to be an
astronaut
