the letters of the human genome which

the letters of the human genome which
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.280
the letters of the human genome which
basically meant decoding our blueprint

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290
basically meant decoding our blueprint

came to sort of crystallization in the
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.609
came to sort of crystallization in the
late 1980s and the reason for that was

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
late 1980s and the reason for that was
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680
late 1980s and the reason for that was
the recognition that if we could get

the recognition that if we could get
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.630
the recognition that if we could get
foundational information about our

foundational information about our
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.300
foundational information about our
blueprint it would set up a series of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
blueprint it would set up a series of
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.620
blueprint it would set up a series of
studies that would help us better

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
studies that would help us better
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.560
studies that would help us better
understand human biology and eventually

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
understand human biology and eventually
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.300

require an industrialization if you will

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
require an industrialization if you will
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.520

a scale-up of a scientific effort that

a scale-up of a scientific effort that
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260
a scale-up of a scientific effort that
was really unusual for biomedical

you know six or ten people they work on
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.619
you know six or ten people they work on
profoundly difficult problems and they

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
profoundly difficult problems and they
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020
profoundly difficult problems and they
like to explore they like to sort of ask

big questions it's very different this

was a very focused effort very defined a

to do that was going to require multiple

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
to do that was going to require multiple
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.369
to do that was going to require multiple
countries it was going to require

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
countries it was going to require
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.620
countries it was going to require
thousands of scientists and was going to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
thousands of scientists and was going to
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.420
thousands of scientists and was going to
require a number of years originally

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
require a number of years originally
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.340

slated for 15 years and ended up taking

slated for 15 years and ended up taking
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.850
slated for 15 years and ended up taking
13 years that is why the analogy to to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
13 years that is why the analogy to to
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370
13 years that is why the analogy to to
the putting a man on the moon has often

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
the putting a man on the moon has often
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.929
the putting a man on the moon has often
come in because the idea that was a very

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
come in because the idea that was a very
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580
come in because the idea that was a very
focused goal we are going to do

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
focused goal we are going to do
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230
focused goal we are going to do
somethings going to be a grandly large

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
somethings going to be a grandly large
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840
somethings going to be a grandly large
project requiring many people with a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
project requiring many people with a
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.190
project requiring many people with a
very defined goal we're going to put a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
very defined goal we're going to put a
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.890
very defined goal we're going to put a
person on the moon and so that was

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
person on the moon and so that was
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450
person on the moon and so that was
something that biomedical researchers

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
something that biomedical researchers
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.710
something that biomedical researchers
looked at and said while we never do

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
looked at and said while we never do
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.899
looked at and said while we never do
anything like that until the Human

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
anything like that until the Human
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.249
anything like that until the Human
Genome Project and I think that's really

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
Genome Project and I think that's really
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.370
Genome Project and I think that's really
the first example in biomedicine of a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
the first example in biomedicine of a
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.130
the first example in biomedicine of a
defined large-scale project i would say

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
defined large-scale project i would say
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.440
defined large-scale project i would say
in hindsight now looking back on it 10

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
in hindsight now looking back on it 10
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.300
in hindsight now looking back on it 10
years ago when we finished the project I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
years ago when we finished the project I
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.580
years ago when we finished the project I
think biomedical research have gotten

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
think biomedical research have gotten
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.230
think biomedical research have gotten
much more comfortable with doing these

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
much more comfortable with doing these
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.960
much more comfortable with doing these
large science endeavors recognizing that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
large science endeavors recognizing that
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.490
large science endeavors recognizing that
we still need lots and lots of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
we still need lots and lots of
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.160
we still need lots and lots of
individual scientists working around the

important biomedical research problems

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
important biomedical research problems
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.100
important biomedical research problems
