00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.580
Some more heavy lifting. Let's talk about the

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.440
distributed data structures that GMS has in order

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.600
to do this virtual memory management across the

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.510
entire cluster. First thing that GMS has to

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.290
do, is to convert a virtual address, which is a local thing so far as a

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.570
single processor's concerned. And convert that virtual address

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.360
into a global identifier, or what we'll call

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.470
as a universal ID. And the way we derive the universal ID from the virtual

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.230
address is fairly straightforward, if you think

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.720
about it. We know which node this virtual

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.170
address emanated from, IP address. We know

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.730
which disk partition contains a copy of the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.750
page that corresponds to the virtual address. That

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.490
we know. What are the i-node data structure

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.540
that corresponds to this page? And what is the offset? So if you put all of

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.470
these entities together, you get a universal ID

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.010
that uniquely identifies. A virtual address. This is

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.170
the offset within a page. So given a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.500
virtual address, the first three parts uniquely identify

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.360
the page, and the fourth part identifies the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
offset within that page for that virtual address.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.050
And this we can derive it from the virtual memory system as well as the UBC.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.950
There are three key data structures: PFD, GCD

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.870
and POD. These three data structures are the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.440
workhorses that make this cluster wide memory management

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.270
possible. Let's talk about each one of these

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.010
things. PFD is like a PH table. Normally in a PH table what you do is

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.120
you give it a virtual address and the PH table says oh, I know what is the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.140
physical frame that backs this particular virtual address.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.830
That is the translation between a virtual page number

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.230
and a physical page frame that hosts that

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.170
virtual page is contained in a page table. Similar

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.930
to that is PFD, it's called the page

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.850
frame directory. It has a mapping between a UID,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.500
because your virtual address has been converted to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.260
a UID. Given a UID, it says, what

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.490
is a page frame that backs that particular

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.555
UID? That's this data structure. Because we're doing cluster-wide

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:24.390
memory management, the page itself can be in one of four different states. It

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.270
could be in the local part of that node. And if it is in a local part of a node.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.370
Then, that page could be a private page or it could be a shared page. These are

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.560
two possibilities, there is living in the local

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.930
part of the physical memory of a node. If

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.630
it is in the global part, we know

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.330
by definition, global part is only hosting clean pages,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.120
so the content of global cache is always.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.660
Going to be private pages and so the state

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.090
of the page that happens to be the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.920
global cache of a particular node is guaranteed

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.730
to be a private state. And the last

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.910
possibility is that it's not in the physical memory

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.760
of a node, but it is on the disk. So the page frame directory. Just like a page

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.140
table, says that either this page that you are looking for go from VA to UID,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.480
that page is in physical memory and it is one of these

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.320
three states or its not in the physical memory, it's on the disk.
