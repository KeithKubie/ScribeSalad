I'm often asked about the future and
it's a little bit difficult for me to

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.030
talk about because as a historian I'm
always focused on the past. When I think

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.500
about the 50th anniversary of the you
know martyrdom of Martin Luther King it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
reminds me actually of all he was able
to accomplish but those persons who came

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.830
before him who also accomplished so much.
You know 100 years before Martin Luther King

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.160
the king there were people like
Frederick Douglas for example Mariah

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.160
Stewart and others who worked so hard to
get the 13th the 14th and the 15th

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.890
amendment passed and then 100 years
later there is Martin Luther King who

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.600
through his activism the activism all
those people those very very brave and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.969
courageous people around him
who helped to make the 13th the 14th and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.250
the 15th amendment actually come alive
for the entire nation so that everyone

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.239
could benefit from it. So I like looking
forward but it always reminds me of the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.920
past of what we've gone through and of
what we have to do. We have such a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
wonderful diversity here on this campus
and in the nation but that diversity

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.090
that wonderful community of diverse
voices and experiences and peoples will

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.420
melt into a chaos if indeed we cannot
continue to provide a pathway forward a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.909
path where everyone can enjoy you know
the justice of our society. The

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.280
egalitarian society and a
voice in what this nation should be and is.
