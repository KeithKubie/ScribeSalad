(electronic tones)

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.410
- Dr. Mendoza is going to speak more,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.170
as Dr. Weiss commented, on
the impact of Immigration,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250
Trauma and Children and
Youth with Disabilities,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.646
Fernando, welcome.

00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:24.479
- Thank you.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.479
(audience applauds)

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.963
Lucy, thank you very much.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.113
So I'm talking about immigration.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.943
I have no disclosures except one.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.130
I'm a child of an immigrant.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.997
How many of you have parents

00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:47.053
that were not born in this country?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.800
So as Paul talked about violence,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.280
violence has been around a long time.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.530
My grandfather fought in
the Mexican Revolution

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.460
with Poncho Villa, got shot four times,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.890
by our family history.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.490
He decided that was not
a safe place to live,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.180
so he came with his family,
worked on the railroads

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.413
and then in the, as a farm worker

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:14.660
and brought his family to California.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.803
That's my dad.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.870
My parents raised me.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.270
You know that's me, child
has a very big head.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.880
(audience laughs)

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.273
But I think that's the
history that we have.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.520
But the history that I grew up with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.950
was immigrants are
welcome, there's hope here.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.290
But as one gets older and
looks at the real history,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.040
you see things like the reality

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.450
that they're not always welcome.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.300
And indeed if we look at our history,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.820
and this is something that
actually I didn't know much about

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.340
until recently, but in the 1930s,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.363
U.S. citizens who were Mexican,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.930
by the government were
deported back to Mexico.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.763
Among that group was my mother.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.630
And at 91, she felt that that was the most

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.163
traumatic experience in her whole life.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.420
So I think that immigration
and the kinds of things

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.663
that happen are really powerful.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.240
So what I'd like to do is
sort of cover these areas.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.520
It's gonna be sort of a fast oversight,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.600
demographic, social
determinants, health status,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.140
utilization, policies, and then
what I think we need to do.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.341
And these are the learning goals.

00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:31.750
I think that, at the end of the day,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.430
those of us in health professions

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.170
need to understand something
about immigrant kids,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.290
the social determinants,
their health status,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.090
how they differ, list some of the factors

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.990
of what are the problems in utilization,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.300
understand some of the
policies that we're looking at

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.310
in terms of how they apply to this group,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.490
and lastly, and lastly is to talk about

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.913
is our system ready to see these kids?

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.910
Demographics, I use that picture

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.513
'cause that's what we look like.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840
Last year, 2018, we went through this.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.460
This is the demographics
of the United States.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.460
This is where half, that
50%, half of the population,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.563
the red line is kids.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.540
That line last year crossed at 50%.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.000
That says that half of all the kids

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.700
in the United States are minority.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.530
That line here, adults will
cross in the next 20 years,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.950
where half of the population

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.220
in the United States will be minority.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.820
This is what the population
of kids looks like,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.063
primarily minority, with
the largest group Latino.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.723
Now how did we get there?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.680
Well actually, if you look at,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.340
and I would encourage you to look

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.653
at the history of
immigration, the policies.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.710
Prior to 1965, our country used quotas

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.190
to let people immigrate.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.400
And those quotas were basically

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.010
from Northern European countries.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.360
In 1965 with Civil Rights,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.960
there was a new immigration law passed,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.550
and that law said we really wanna look

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.020
at how to bring families together.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.933
And if you look in 1974,

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.930
the immigration to this
country dramatically changed,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.840
as you can see here, much more

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.080
for Latin America, Mexico and Asia.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.730
So what that's led to is a dynamic

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.370
of change of the demographics.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.370
And this is a map of the
primary groups of immigrants.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.810
So although there are
many different immigrants,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.750
you see that the major
group here is from Mexico.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.860
But then you see other
countries as noted here,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.373
from Africa, from other
parts of the world.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.380
I think that's important to understand,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.920
but the other part of
this, the other reason

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.380
the wall will not work to
stop the demographic shift,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.100
is the birth rates of these groups, right?

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.700
So 40% of the immigrant
population from Mexico,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.110
they have 32% of the
growth of immigrant kids,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.120
Central America 11%, 17% of the growth.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.120
But look at Asia, 9%
but 23% of the growth.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.710
In the last several decades,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.150
75% of the increased growth in children

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.000
has been from Latinos and Asian Americans.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.020
Without that, we would
have a negative population

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.840
among kids, which would not be
good for those of us over 65.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.660
(audience laughs)

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.440
That has brought, that
diversity has brought languages.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.580
There are 350 languages
spoken in the United States.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.270
If you look at this, this is
the number of languages here.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.570
This is the number of people.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.610
But I want you to look at this,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.840
if you can't see it,
major metropolitan areas.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.500
This is San Francisco area.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.500
There's more than 150 languages
spoken, 150 languages.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.560
Each of those languages,
different culture,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.000
different way of thinking, right?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.700
If we look over here, we see
that the totality of those

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.790
that do not speak English
at home in the United States

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.790
is like 21%, 8% more or less
that are not fluent in English.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.650
But look at California.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.650
We're looking at 44% that do
not speak English at home, 44%,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.250
and almost 20% that are
limited English-proficient.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.510
Silicon Valley, 66% of the households

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.730
do not speak English in the house, right?

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.583
That's America, that's new America.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.680
So when we look at the United States

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.640
and I show you that demographic,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.010
California is 20 years ahead
of the rest of the nation.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.770
So we are living in the future

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.520
for the rest of the
nation demographically.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.080
Silicon Valley is even in front of that.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.590
And to understand that as
health professions is key

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.070
because this is not gonna go back.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.480
We have to anticipate what that means

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.173
and how we practice and
what, how we see kids.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.120
So what is the social determinants?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.260
What are these groups like, right,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.400
because indeed we need to
think, not only about diversity,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.543
but something about what
exactly is going on with them.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.560
This is the sort of model
that the World Health

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.430
and CDC use to think
about population health.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.330
Now I want you to use this

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.890
to think about immigrant populations.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.140
And we see that the totality of the circle

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.940
is the population health.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.963
This little part up here is genetics.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.980
Our institution spent a
lot of time on genetics,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.530
but it's only that little part.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.350
And yet when we look at the other parts

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.350
of health care access, health
behaviors, as important,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.530
but we think about what
are health behaviors?

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.960
Health behaviors comes out
of how people are raised,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.573
how people live, right?

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.660
And that plays into the
rest of the ecology.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.000
How, what's the environment they lived in?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.570
Paul just talked about environments

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.090
that are really traumatic.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.210
Well, you know, we have to
think about what trauma is

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.310
and relative to how people live.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.840
These are the things that we
usually think about, right,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.080
poverty, low education, racism,

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.870
cultural differences, languages, isms.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.180
I think we also should think

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.180
about how disenfranchised
people are from institutions.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.750
But now we're thinking about
the issue of immigration

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.243
because among those social determinants,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.170
somebody signing a bill
can change them, right?

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.450
We can't change poverty
really by just signing a bill,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.680
but we can change immigration
by somebody signing a bill.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.080
And that's really important.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.670
Let me just start off
with what's the difference

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.863
between a refugee and an immigrant?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.403
So UN High Commission,
these are the definitions.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.110
People that migrate and
immigrate for economic reasons

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.340
is different than a refugee.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.780
A refugee has to leave the country

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.823
because they're in danger in
their life or in their freedom.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.040
And we have honored that for generations.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.003
We have been that place that
allows refugees to come in.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.250
We've been that place

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.250
that have allowed immigrants to come in.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.393
The question is are we still that place?

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.050
For immigrant kids, or
children in immigrant families,

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.063
which we define as one
parent not born in the U.S.,

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.130
this is what they looked at.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.740
And this is in 2009,
but basically the same.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.290
So this group is U.S. kids,
that is a U.S. citizen kid

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.110
with parents that are documented.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.370
This is U.S. citizen kids.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.640
This is kids with documentation.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.490
And only this little sliver
here, which about 6% in 2009,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.970
it's down to about 4% now,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.340
are children that are undocumented.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.757
So in essence when we talk about children

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:27.430
in immigrant families, we're talking

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.640
about either U.S. citizens,
which now is about 90%,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.823
or kids that have been documented.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.770
Here is the problem.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.780
This section here are kids
that are U.S. citizens

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.063
or documented but have
undocumented parents.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.223
What that means to us is the following.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.373
This is the U.S.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.970
We see that among the
immigrants in the U.S.,

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.853
about 30% or so have
an undocumented parent.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.850
But look at California.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.710
One third of all the kids in California

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.560
that are living in immigrant families

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.530
of an undocumented parent, 17%.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.250
What is 17%?

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.850
One out of every six kid

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.253
that you see has an undocumented parent.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.513
What does that mean?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.450
If we look at television,
we know what it means.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.160
It means that kids go to school worried

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.330
about when they come home,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.080
whether their parent will be there.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.530
Dad goes to work, they're worried

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.730
about am I gonna see
my father this evening?

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.090
Now think about the
times in your own lives

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.220
when you've had, even when you were small,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.930
the possibility that you
weren't gonna see your parent?

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.360
What trauma, even for
the instant, that caused.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.360
Think about it, living
that type of environment

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.373
for a long period of
time, what does that mean?

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.443
So I think that one of the things

00:12:00.443 --> 00:12:04.550
that we're concerned about
here is that demographic,

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.150
the way we look at social determinants

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.840
and whether you're legal
as a child is one thing,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.500
but more importantly whether
your parent is legal or not,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.220
and what is their status?

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.270
And even if they're legal,
even if they have papers,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.203
is that gonna change by
somebody signing a bill,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.880
by having somebody say well,

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.213
you no longer have
permission to stay here.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.910
What are the other things
that we need to understand

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.760
about children in immigrant families?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.380
This is something I want
you to kinda think about

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.690
because these are not homogeneous groups.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.000
These are very heterogeneous.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.580
And they're heterogeneous
because they're coming

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.720
from different countries
with different experiences

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.330
and different social classes.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.630
This is one thing that we all look at,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.600
the social structure of the family.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.710
And what we see here is children
with two-parent families,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.830
here are native, here's
the immigrant population,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.100
and you see these are different groups

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.730
across the spectrum here
from Mexico, Central America,

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.730
Southeast Asia, Asia, European, Africa.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.770
So even by that, you can see well,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.790
most children in immigrant families

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.943
on the average live in
two-parent families.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.830
But they also have
differences in education.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.650
This is less than than a
high school, dark purple,

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.150
gray high school, college.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.140
And you see that for Mexico,
very few have college.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.140
Most, a number have less
than a high school education,

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.680
primarily primary school.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.850
But then we see the spectrum here,

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.450
and some of these groups have
70% that are college educated.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.730
Could look at Silicon
Valley, the engineers

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.170
that come from all over the world,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.070
that's part of the
immigrant population, right?

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.620
So that sets up a different dynamic

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.360
when we think about this,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.970
and yet they still have
that cultural issue,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.250
which is language at home.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.360
You see, almost all of
them have a predominance

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.853
of speaking other than English at home.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.810
What education does,
and is really set you up

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.790
for whether you're gonna
live in poverty or not.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.960
And as we see in educational framework,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.600
the Mexican-American population here,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.080
which is the largest immigrant population,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.520
has the highest level of
both below poverty line

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.520
and 100%, or up to 200% poverty
line, almost two thirds.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.770
So for some groups, this
is really significant,

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.660
that they live in poverty.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.760
Here's the average for natives.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.250
And in other groups they're lower.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.380
So as we think about children
in immigrant population,

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.880
particularly you in San Francisco,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.600
you're gonna see lots of different groups.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.140
And yet we shouldn't just
look at the social class,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.470
we shouldn't just look
at the immigrant status.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.510
We need to look at the totality

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.693
of what the characteristics
of those families are.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.680
What about their health status?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.230
This is a painting from
Carmen Lomas Garza,

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.910
who does a lot of things about the culture

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.320
of different groups.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.950
I love this because you can see

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.660
it's sort of the folk medicine.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.320
And yet it brings up the
issue that a lot of times,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.520
even if you're educated, you
still have a lot of beliefs

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.040
that are fundamentally cultural, right?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.873
We all do.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.870
When we look at immigrants and refugees,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.610
we need to distinguish what
exactly has happened to them.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.360
And I see kids in clinic,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.173
and we see them from
all over Latin America.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.650
And one of the things we try to do

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.390
is assess what has
happened to them, right?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.900
So although a majority of
the kids that I showed you

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.170
from that round circle are U.S. born,

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.360
there's a large section that are refugees

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.570
or kids that are first-generation,

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.510
that is born outside
the U.S. that come here.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.150
These are the things
that we need to decide.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.070
Are they refugees, and I'll show you

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.410
why that's so important, but
basically they get services,

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.973
or are they immigrants
who may not get services?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.510
What was their social class?

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.500
Even from Mexico, I can see families

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.180
that were living in Mexico City,

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.140
parents are well-to-do, and I see them.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.450
They're different than somebody

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.180
that comes from the
(speaks foreign language)

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.520
and, you know, a sixth grade education.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.830
So that's the dynamic of
education and social class

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.700
that they may have in their country.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.513
Trauma coming to this country,

00:16:57.027 --> 00:16:58.320
the trauma, as Paul points out,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.163
is both in the home and at coming here.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.550
I had one father that came
in with two daughters,

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.050
fairly well-dressed
and lived in Guatemala,

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.987
and I asked him well
what are you doing here?

00:17:13.987 --> 00:17:17.440
And I mean they had funds and everything.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.190
He said the gangs told me
unless I gave them my business

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.463
they would kill my kids.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.823
So you know Paul points out why
does somebody take the risk?

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.770
Well what risk is there if
your kids are gonna get killed

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:37.280
versus coming here and trying
to get through the system?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.740
That's not a hard risk to take, right?

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.140
So we do have lots of
families that have a trauma,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.460
not just coming across,

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.403
but from their prior
history in their country.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.850
Trauma, clearly you've heard stories,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.240
and those stories are very much true,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.310
that coming across the
border is dangerous.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.870
It physically can be, has
physical abuse, sexual abuse,

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.320
and just the psychological trauma

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.100
of coming through the process

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.860
of getting to the United States

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.480
and getting through the
border patrol and all that,

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.290
that is traumatic, and Paul
showed some of the things

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.280
that are going on.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.070
I'll talk a little bit more about that.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.570
But that's another assessment.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.540
Moreover, what has happened

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.140
to the current immigration status?

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.080
And lastly, do they have any support here?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.070
Are they here with other family members?

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.983
Do they have other things
that will help them support?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.590
When we look at other
factors in terms of health,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.230
we have to think, as Paul points out,

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.420
you know, are these kids coming healthy,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.140
or are they have
problems, chronic disease,

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.120
malnutrition, infectious disease?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.810
On the average, they tend not

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.810
to be physically too unhealthy,

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.343
but I think the psychological
stress is really quite high.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.260
And lastly when we think about health,

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.350
the two things that I think
have been quite remarkable,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.910
one is that the expectation,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.103
particularly those first-generation kids

00:19:11.103 --> 00:19:16.103
that are coming seem to
be over several decades

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.570
not as bad as we thought
they would once they're here,

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.800
that is even though parents have poverty,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.160
they don't have very high education,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.570
their kids' health status
seems to be relatively okay.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.140
And that turns out to be

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.770
what people have called
the immigrant paradox,

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.630
the paradox that in this country

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.410
usually if you have
poverty, low education,

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.513
low social class, your health is poor.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.380
This group tends to at least seemed,

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.370
at least in surveys, seems to indicate

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.260
that they're not as
poor as we would expect.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.800
That's the paradox.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.090
Here's the problem, though.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.590
The longer they stay in this country,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.990
the worse their health gets.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.510
I was on the Institute
of Medicine's committee

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.800
for immigrant kids in the late 1990s.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.170
That was astonishing, 'cause
everything we looked at,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.663
health, mental health,
education got worse.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.903
So we ended up by saying
America may be toxic.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.313
And yet that's important
to understand why.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.913
Why do people change?

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.810
What things should we not
change and keep them healthy?

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.360
That's something we don't know.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.840
Let me show you a little
bit of those things.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.433
Here's birth weight, right,
birth weight's really important.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.520
This is something from the 1990s.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.050
We did a study in the '80s,
the studies that are done now,

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.993
those red bars are all
women that are immigrants.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.890
And their proportion of low birth weight

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.893
is always lower than native-born.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.630
I want to point out one
particular one from Africa.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.960
Look at the difference
between African-Americans

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.400
born in this country
and African-Americans,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.200
or Africans born in other countries.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.480
There's no program

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.323
that decreases low birth weight that much.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.210
That is true for all across.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.023
We look at infant
mortality, all those things,

00:21:17.023 --> 00:21:18.493
it's the same picture.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.370
Using the National Survey
of Children's Health,

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:29.370
these are the odds ratios
of comparing immigrants here

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.340
to third generations.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.440
And what we see here,
the reds are significant

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.630
that many of these things
that we think about

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.260
as developmental issues
are, for the most part,

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.980
lower in children in immigrant families.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.700
Now remember, these are a small proportion

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.420
of first-generation,

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.940
the majority is second-generation, okay?

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.950
Now the question will be

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.670
is that because they just don't know?

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.900
Hard to say, 'cause
first-generation would get access

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.480
to health care, right,
or second-generation.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.450
So what we see here is, for example

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.680
behavioral problems less, depression less,

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.210
a little bit hard for me to see there,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.210
depression, autistic
disorders same, interesting,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.820
and all the rest are lower.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.760
But even with just
looking at insured kids,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.010
so everybody has access,
they're still lower.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.053
So the question to us as
investigators in pediatrics,

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:35.920
what is that?

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.260
What factor can we find that
could be very useful to us

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.883
to understand that this helps families?

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.010
Is it the culture?

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.940
Is it social connectedness?

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.720
Is it how people rear their kids?

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.773
We don't know, but it is
important to investigate.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:54.820
But here's the other problem.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.830
The longer they stay in this
country, the worse it gets.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.580
This is U.S. born, and these
are then by the time state,

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.170
or living in the United
States things get worse.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.530
And whether that's asthma
or chronic disease,

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.523
they all get worse.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.773
Now some of that is behaviors.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.500
While new immigrants don't smoke as much,

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.860
as they stay here they smoke more,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.270
they drink more, et cetera, right?

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.290
So this is something that
as we look at prevention,

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.270
we need to think about
what are those things

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.730
that immigrant families
do that we wanna support

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.080
and not change?

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.500
Allow them not to be Americanized,

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.350
but allow them to keep their culture.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.663
What about health care utilization?

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.910
Well, I use these two,
again photo from a painting

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.343
from Carmen Lomas Garza.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.063
Families may be using both.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.240
They may use folk medicine
at home, don't tell you,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.800
and then they may come to you
to get health care, right?

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.600
So that's something that I think we

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.600
as health practitioners need
to think about and work with.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.030
The issue of looking at this

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.430
as you know primarily health
insurance is important,

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.163
because indeed one of
the things that we have

00:24:18.163 --> 00:24:21.130
in this country is if you
don't get health insurance,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.850
then you're probably not gonna
get access to care, right?

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.340
Now what's interesting about immigrants

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.460
and different groups of immigrants

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.510
is almost all immigrants work.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.690
And you see that sort of black green bar

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.343
is the proportion that work.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.570
But the immigrants that work with jobs

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.380
that get health insurance,
like this group here

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.670
which are non, basically immigrants

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.770
from non-Latin American countries,

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.740
it's much larger than
immigrants from Mexico that work

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.240
but rarely get health insurance.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.710
And that is because at the end of the day,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.800
they're working in jobs that
don't provide health insurance

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.250
or work part-time jobs, right?

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.840
And therefore they tend to have
the largest uninsured group.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.760
And among Latinos in general,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.730
those that are first-generation,

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.230
clearly undocumented are ones

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.540
that are gonna have less health insurance.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.610
So you know, as we look forward,

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.230
this is the group that's most at-risk,

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.630
the group that's
first-generation, undocumented,

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.230
and even though they're working
sometimes two or three jobs,

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.880
they still don't get health care.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.970
And this demonstrates that issue more so

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.193
in the sense that when we
look at no health insurance,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.250
Hispanic children in immigrant families,

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.473
one in four does not
have health insurance,

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.100
no preventative care, 16%,

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.280
and did not receive mental health.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.040
While that's common among all these

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.420
among the largest immigrant group,

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.093
they rarely get mental health.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.070
And yet if you think about
who needs it the most,

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.800
it's those groups that have
tried to come across the border

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.010
that have had trauma and are dealing

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.583
with post traumatic stress,

00:26:20.583 --> 00:26:23.860
dealing with depression, anxiety.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.210
And where they show up
sometimes in our clinic,

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.360
but you know one of the problems

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.530
that we all have, as you know,

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.730
is where do we get those
kinds of services long-term?

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:35.913
Do we go to schools?

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.533
And, you know, do you send
them to psychiatrists?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.830
How many psychiatrists
are there for children?

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.730
Do you send them for
mental health therapists?

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.220
How many mental health
therapists speak Spanish

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.040
or other languages?

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.220
Hard to do mental health
if you can't speak to them.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.630
So that is a real challenge for us,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.010
and I think in utilization
although we can get them

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.670
through the part of insurance,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.520
access to care is gonna be important.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:10.730
Now what I said previously is
that we have here a situation

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.690
where if you're a refugee
or you're U.S. born,

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.730
then you get health care.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.820
And this table here shows that,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.670
that if you're a U.S. citizen child

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.380
with undocumented parents, this one here,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.030
you see that you're eligible

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.093
because you're a U.S. citizen, right?

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.590
But if you're pregnant and
if you're not undocumented,

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.260
it's unclear whether you get,

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.970
if you are undocumented, rather,

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.343
it's unclear whether
you get access to care.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:47.983
Even if you have lawful
documentation to be in this country,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.910
in some states they will
not give you any services

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.973
for five years.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.720
They want you to be a
good person for five years

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.220
before they give you anything.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.513
Luckily in our state that's
not happened and others.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.717
Whether, also whether
you're under 18, over 18,

00:28:09.717 --> 00:28:12.000
that's a situation.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.070
But if you're a refugee, again
this is why it's so important

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.640
to determine whether you're a refugee,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.373
you get services across the board.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.633
So the people that are
coming up to the border,

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.700
they wanna be let in because of the trauma

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.490
and the things that Paul talked about,

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.000
but you know, we all see
in the news everyday.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.880
And the way that they
can get in is being asked

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.530
that they're in threat for
their life, which they are.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.230
And if they become refugees,
have refugee status,

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.900
then they end up getting all the services

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.500
that we would want to give them.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.270
This last group, though, is a group

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.560
that we're particularly interested in,

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.560
is undocumented parents,
women that deliver.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.410
And I'll show you in a minute a study

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.430
that we've done with this group,

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.133
but this is a group that's having babies,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.433
and yet they don't have
access to services.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.810
Now think about that
prior infant mortality

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.650
and low birth weigh I showed you.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.020
Even without services,
they still do pretty well.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.020
But that doesn't mean

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.200
that they don't have health care issues.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.600
And it clearly, that just
puts them more at risk.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.610
So one of the things that needs to be done

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.130
is thinking about how we change this

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.050
to make sure that everybody gets care.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.000
Unfortunately the dynamics
of our government right now

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.683
is in a bit of a turmoil,
and I think one of the things

00:29:43.683 --> 00:29:46.870
that we need to think
about is how can we impress

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.550
upon our policy leaders about
what this actually means.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.110
What does this mean on the ground level?

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.323
What does it mean day to day
for our kids and families?

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.150
Now as I said, you know,
this has been something

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.640
that sort of disrupted the
politics of this country,

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.640
and this picture here, this
figure here shows that.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.080
So undocumented children are not eligible

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.250
for any health, federal
health care services,

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.100
and even those that are, as I just said,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.660
sometimes it takes five years
for them to get anything.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.240
The green states, California
being one of the early ones,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.160
Santa Clara County being
one of the early ones,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.603
said kids are important,
they oughta get health care.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.890
And they gave health care to all kids

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.630
independent of whether
they were documented

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.893
or not documented U.S. citizens or not.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.540
That was the right thing to do.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.540
That was the humane thing to do.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.160
And if you see here, that that has spread

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.100
throughout California and
through the green states.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.090
The blue states give access
to use Medicaid dollars

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.593
to help those documented
immigrants to get care.

00:31:12.828 --> 00:31:16.640
And the gray states just
think those kids don't exist.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.460
So that's the status of
our country right now.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.900
It's fractured.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.020
It's different people
valuing different things.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.400
Now I'd like to think

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.190
that it's really not
valuing different things,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.380
but not having the
knowledge or perspective

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.500
of what it means, right?

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.850
And I think giving the
knowledge and perspective

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.540
of what this means is really important

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.710
because the folks that we're
talking about can't speak up.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.290
They don't have a voice.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.830
We're the ones that have a voice,

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.610
and we're the ones that
kind of need to do this

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.453
and bring this to the forefront.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.623
So let's talk about barriers in,

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.670
having to do with disabilities.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.123
What are those, well, I
think you can think about it

00:32:04.123 --> 00:32:05.973
just from what I've discussed, right?

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.500
Health insurance, if you
don't have health insurance

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.660
it's hard to get to
someplace and get care.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.253
The immigration issues, the fear of that,

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.010
and yet you know, we're here to serve.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.313
We're here to provide those services.

00:32:25.651 --> 00:32:28.680
There was a study by Lin in pediatrics

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.640
that looked at autistic
spectrum disorders,

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.130
developmental delay, looking at immigrant,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.910
children in immigrant families,

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.090
and they were twice as likely
to lack a usual source of care

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.490
and have poor communication.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.600
So this is across the country,

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.630
that even though they have
access, for U.S. kids,

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.220
remember most of these kids are U.S. born.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.170
They still have that problem
of getting through the system.

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.300
As I looked at this, it would
remind me of the IOM studies

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.370
that have been out in terms
of what are the problems

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.260
of getting care to kids,

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.280
and it talks about access,

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.520
it talks about bias of physicians,
problems in our system.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.110
There's a study in Canada
that you're seeing here

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.730
that comes up with the same things,

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.150
basically identifying challenges

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.743
where the lack of cultural
competency among the providers,

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.700
communication issues,
can't talk to the family

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.310
'cause we don't speak the same language,

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.550
health beliefs, they
believe something different

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:39.370
than what we do, lack of rapport,

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.270
it's hard to relate to somebody
if you can't talk to them,

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.820
and developing patient-centered
and self-advocacy.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.190
So as you know, it's really important

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.080
for kids or any family
that has a chronic disease

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.970
to be able to advocate for themselves.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.983
How do we end up doing that with families

00:33:56.983 --> 00:33:59.960
that have different
culture, different language,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.670
different kinds of backgrounds, right?

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:02.953
That is a challenge.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.090
We have, we're in the
process of just completing

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.420
and submitting a paper where we looked

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.870
at the California Health Interview Survey

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.610
of all of California, and
looked at the families

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.200
that were limited English
proficient, which is a pretty,

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.283
it's about a third of all
the kids in California.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.850
Those families reported a lower rate

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.683
of communication with their physicians.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.460
And the calculation here showed

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.350
that they had a 60% less likelihood

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.433
of having effective communications.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.180
So think about all those
things I've talked about

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.800
in the risk factors,
particularly the environment

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.850
and the prevention and
the social determinants.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.620
How do we get to that if
we can't talk to them,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.990
if we can't communicate with them, right?

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.963
That's a challenge.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.180
And we have to really
be very introspective

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.083
to ask that question of ourselves.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.890
How effective are we as
communicators with these families

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.960
because we know if we're not effective,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.053
our treatments are gonna not
be very effective, either.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.270
This was an interesting study
because it brought to light

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:23.100
that this issue is not just an
issue for us in this country.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.437
It's an issue for around the world,

00:35:24.437 --> 00:35:27.436
and Paul spoke about this.

00:35:27.436 --> 00:35:29.320
This is a paper out of Chile

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.320
where they did a literature
review for the last decade,

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.320
2006 to 16, 107 articles,
about half from Europe,

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.223
a third from this country.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.340
What they found was something
that you look at these things,

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.973
you say yeah, of course, it happens here,

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.640
higher use of hospitals and ERs

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.203
by this population, all right.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.600
Seeking care was affected
by the cultural norms,

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.390
models of disease, lack
of safety networks,

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.900
language barriers, economic
and social adversity.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.530
So these were things that
we look around the world,

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:09.513
they're consistent.

00:36:10.857 --> 00:36:11.690
And you would say of
course they're consistent

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.820
'cause they're all going
through the basic same thing.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.310
They're coming to a country
that is not like them,

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.563
may not welcome them, and
is not set up to treat them.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.787
So why would we be expecting
anything different?

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.480
They also access factors,
family related difficulties,

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.590
navigating systems, underline that one,

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.050
and the lack of basic rights,

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.863
that not understanding
what rights do they have.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.370
But this last one I
think is also important.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.060
It's something that the
Institute of Medicine

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.620
has brought up a lot of times,

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.540
which is the health professions barriers,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.910
our biases, our
stereotypes, our prejudices,

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.803
language and communication barriers.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.440
At Stanford we've been
looking at unconscious bias,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.650
and I reviewed the literature
for the last 10 years.

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.320
And what's kinda sad is
that the IOM came out

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.170
in 2002 or so, said we need to think

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.370
about how we deal with
our unconscious bias.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:15.730
And if you look at the
literature for the last 10 years,

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.190
that continues to report the idea

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.040
that physicians in health professions

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.050
have unconscious bias
that impacts health care

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.153
in a negative way.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.700
So even though we get a national report,

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.830
none of that has changed.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.550
So that's something particularly
for kids most at risk,

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.520
the kids that you all see,

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.870
that we need to think
about how we change that.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.893
Immigration and social policies,

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.550
the wall, Paul's been at Brownsville.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.490
I went there, too.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:50.510
What's interesting is to see these kids

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.703
and to see that they
almost feel safer here.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.810
And in fact they probably are

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.080
'cause in their country,
they're getting shot at.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.733
They're getting physically
abused, sexually abused.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:09.240
The problem is that our refugee policy

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.300
tends to change sometimes with a memo

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.870
or with somebody signing
something as it has, right?

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.710
So we as a country need to think about

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:20.570
what do we want our country to stand for

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.020
when we think about refugees?

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.360
And that is important.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.890
And that, hopefully our people in Congress

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:31.943
will start kind of being
more adult about this issue.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.073
Parents and children, the fear,

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.700
yeah clearly you don't have
to imagine this too much,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.320
but what does it do to somebody
to go through this process?

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.340
You're not only living in
terror in your country,

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.970
you're coming to this country

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.920
and then having to go through all this.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.350
More importantly, even if you get through,

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.120
that's not the end.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.230
Even if you get refugee status,

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.520
you have to live with all that drama.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.780
And in this country you also
have to live with the fact

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.550
that you're an immigrant,
and what that means

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.130
and how people, as our president does,

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.270
talks about that, right?

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.250
I don't know what the long-term effects

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.500
of that's gonna be for our kids,

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.640
but I'm concerned that that
has significant impact.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.503
It can have significant impact.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:27.090
Finally, if we think
about immigration policy,

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.600
again, encourage you
to look at the history

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.150
of immigration in this country.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:35.350
It has been to really
control what we look like,

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.183
how we think.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:42.310
And I think it's been
mostly looking at adults.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:46.440
We have never thought about
how those policies affect kids.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.790
And yet we need to think about that

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.890
'cause at the end of the
day, what I hope I showed you

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.890
is not about the small
percentage, though significant,

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.230
of kids that are first-generation.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.280
It's about the larger percentage
that are U.S. citizens

00:40:07.263 --> 00:40:09.070
that are gonna be American adults

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.350
trying to advance this country forward,

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:12.830
that to live in a situation

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.190
where you don't know what's
gonna happen to your parents.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.170
We think about ACEs, one of those things

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.023
is really, you know, what
happens to you as a child.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.950
That to me is something
that our legislation

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.600
needs to think about, is that families

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.680
with undocumented parents
can cause a real stress

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.913
in the lives of kids.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.600
Documentation and getting to that process

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.460
can be quite traumatic, and particularly

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.390
when the lines for that change.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:50.870
Public charge, recently
the Trump administration

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.080
wanted to change public
charge and what it meant.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.160
And it meant that if your
kid got food in school,

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.453
that was a public charge.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.180
And I think that those
people that stood up

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.413
and said that's not the thing we wanna do

00:41:07.413 --> 00:41:09.170
are people that are looking at this

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.253
as what we wanna do with
our immigrant population.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.483
DACA, you know these are
kids that were brought here.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:23.630
They had no say in that process.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.230
And yet we're still battling with DACA.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.580
And we see from reports of that group

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.660
that they're successful,
they do all kinds of things.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.450
Several of my students at
Stanford are DACA students.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:37.740
I'm sure there are DACA students

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.240
in all of our medical schools.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.120
Paul brought up, you know, what's happened

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.850
for the future of this.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.260
And I think one of the issues
is at the end of the day,

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.590
we don't know what happens
to kids that go through war.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.920
We don't know what happens long-term

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.880
for kids that come as refugees.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.010
I would say to you I don't
know what's gonna happen

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:05.940
when you have a child
who comes home every day

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.360
because the mother's undocumented,

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.530
doesn't know whether the
mother's gonna be there.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.173
What is the long-term effects
of that for development,

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.913
for depression, for anxiety,

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:22.570
for even just belief what
this country's about, right,

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.840
I think those are things that
we need to be concerned about,

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.563
and certainly something
that worries me a lot.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:31.670
Yeah, we can do something.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.290
We did a study, my colleagues
at the Immigration Policy Lab

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.650
and I and General Peds.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:42.130
We looked at DACA from Oregon,

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:44.930
and we were able to identify women

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.973
that were eligible for
DACA and had babies.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.913
And those babies could be followed.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.240
And what we found was that
the children of parents

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.603
that had DACA eligibility had kids

00:43:02.603 --> 00:43:06.280
that had half as much
mental health disorders

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.380
as those that did not.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.730
One policy impacting those
kids by decreasing half

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.883
of the mental health issues.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.920
So that to me says that one policy

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:26.300
set together by the
President's executive order

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.953
rather than Congress, has
major impact on child health.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.420
So I think it just says, you know,

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.790
how government can actually be positive.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.690
It doesn't always have to be negative.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.033
So here's what I think has to change.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:48.400
Immigration policies, I
know we have to have laws,

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.940
but we have to have laws that
are supportive of families,

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.490
that if we're gonna do whatever processing

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:55.700
we have to with the law,

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.450
it has to be sensitive to the family,

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:00.980
and this, I think, particularly

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.163
with ICE and refugee processing.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.150
DACA needs to be supported

00:44:07.032 --> 00:44:10.330
and finalize the path to citizenship.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.740
I really believe that our
parents who are undocumented,

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.050
have U.S. citizens, need
to have that path as well.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:21.480
We can't have U.S. citizens
lose their parents,

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.260
particularly when they're,
you know, six months old,

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.963
a year old, five years old.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.480
We have to make sure that public charge

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.540
does not take away that threat

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.550
of understanding what public charge is

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.390
to not take away services to kids,

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:42.933
to not inhibit families from
using services for their kids.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.083
I think that the state
and local governments here

00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:49.663
have done a great job.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.610
I've talked about health
insurance for all those kids

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.390
that were undocumented.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:56.470
We led the way.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.880
That spread throughout the nation,

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.763
as we can see here with these things.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.780
But lastly I think we need
to have insightful thoughts

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.343
about how we practice.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:13.210
Clearly my deanship has been
in diversifying our workforce.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.973
It needs to continue.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.860
50% of all the kids in
California are Latino,

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.713
5% of the pediatricians.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.640
And not that they have to be matched up,

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.680
but there's a concern there.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.810
Cultural competency training,

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.950
our schools don't do that all that well.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.050
Unconscious bias training, likewise.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.810
These are important things
if we're gonna have a society

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:39.880
that's diverse because there's no way

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.030
even for me being Latino to
understand every Latino patient.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.770
And certainly I don't
speak all these languages.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.980
How do you provide a person

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.910
like a physician or a health
profession the ability

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.420
to function in a very dynamic society

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.083
that has all kinds of diversity?

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.243
I think interpreters need
to be instituted more,

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:08.250
which has been problematic
a bit because of resources.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.460
But lastly I think in the
realm of health care providers,

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.730
we need to partner with communities,

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.902
with community workers,
(speaks foreign language)

00:46:16.902 --> 00:46:18.350
'cause at the end of the
day what we're looking at

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.820
is how not just to treat
people in the office,

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.660
but that ecology that I talked about.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.900
We need to think about how we affect that.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.200
Lastly our health care
system needs to change,

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.610
and that clearly improving
literacy for our families,

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.990
how they access the care, make it easier,

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.120
truly make it patient-centered,

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.993
and last but not least
make them empowered.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.600
When I was growing up in the '50s,

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.610
Norman Rockwell was a person to me

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.230
that sort of exemplified

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.620
what America was about, right,

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.890
he had these classic pictures.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:01.040
This is one I like because
at the end of the day,

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.610
it just said this is a country
that we respect everybody.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:08.493
We want everybody to be involved
through the Golden Rule.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:12.480
And I think that sometimes
we need to stand up

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.300
for what we believe in,
this country stands for.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.470
And I think this is probably the time,

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:19.910
particularly for our kids

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.170
because if we can do that,
we're not just standing up

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:24.903
for the kids and their families.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.960
As I pointed out, we're
standing up for the future.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.557
And that future is gonna
be from these kids, right?

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.270
So I wanna thank you for listening,

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:39.941
and we can answer some
questions, thank you.

00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:42.941
(audience applauds)
