[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In this video we're going to show you

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.280
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
a quick and easy way

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.800
to make a mold and cast
of your own hand.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.000
It's fairly versatile
and the position of your hand

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.320
and what you do with the
casting are entirely up to you.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.380
[Music]

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.740
Molding and casting is actually
something I've done quite a bit of,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.040
and I wanted to show you one of
the very easiest ways to do it yourself.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.880
There are two main ingredients.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.199
A mold compound and a casting compound.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.840
I got both of these at a
local craft and fabric store,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.820
but there are many options
using the same basic idea.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.360
Our mold material is
something called alginate,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.200
and our casting material is plaster
with some other added elements to it.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.660
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.540
We'll quickly make a box using
foam core and a glue gun.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.000
We'll mix up some alginate molding
material and mold our hand inside.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.620
Once the mold is cured,
we'll whip up a batch of our plaster,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.960
and pour it into the mold,
making a perfect cast of our hand.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.760
This box will have a
bottom and four sides to it,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.620
and of course, no lid because my hand
needs to be able to fit down inside.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.020
So I'm going to start making some
marks on this piece of foam core

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.920
that are just big enough for my hand
in the thumbs up position to fit inside.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.319
This piece right here will be the base,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.140
so now we need to measure out
the four pieces that will act as the walls.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.180
I want to leave a little bit
of a gap at the bottom

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.299
so my hand isn't pressed down onto it.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.420
So, let's lift that up.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.800
I probably want to get molded up to
right about here on my wrist.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.820
Not far beyond the edge
of my hand but a little bit.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.240
Overall, it looks like we want to
pour the alginate about six inches up,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.960
and let's give ourselves an extra inch of
wall just so we're not overflowing it.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.140
[Music]

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380
We've got all five pieces
of our board measured out,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.580
now let's cut them down.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.860
We'll probably also need to trim
the two narrower sides as well.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.420
Just so everything fits together nicely.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:50.340
[Music]

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.940
All right we now have this
beautiful little white paper box,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.780
and this should do a perfect job
of holding our alginate.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.560
This alginate mold material has
a couple of advantages and disadvantages

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.740
over mold materials we've used in the past.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.400
You've probably seen some of
our videos where we used silicone

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.320
to make molds of things,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.100
and silicon is great for a lot of uses.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.540
It's very durable.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.590
It lasts a long time.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.020
You can get several casts out of one mold,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.560
but it does have some drawbacks.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.980
Silicone is fairly expensive
and even the quickest stuff

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160
can take up to 45 minutes to cure.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.120
Alginate cures in about
two to five minutes at most,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.040
and while that seems really good,
it does have its own drawbacks.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.080
Alginate isn't very durable.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.620
You're likely to get one or maybe
two castings out of a single mold.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.560
It's also a very wet material
while you're using it as a mold,

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.400
so there are some things
you can't cast in it.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.660
A lot of types of resin won't work well
if they're surrounded by moisture.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.600
However, it is perfect if you're trying
to cast something made of plaster

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.520
and because it cures so much faster.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.900
It's a lot more comfortable to
try and cast say a hand in this

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.209
than it would be in silicone.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.120
Because otherwise,
I'd have to put my hand in the box,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.020
and just hold it perfectly still for
like 45 minutes before I pulled it out.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.120
And then, I would have a really hard
time getting my hand out of there.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.680
Silicone grips quite a bit,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.280
whereas the alginate
is a lot more slippery,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.340
so I should be able to just slide my
hand right out of the mold once it's done.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.329
To get a good sense of how much
alginate mixture we're going to need,

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.920
Let's first fill up our box with sand,
and then pour that into our bowl.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.600
That'll show us about the
level we're expecting to get to.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.160
I am also adding my hand into the box to
get an accurate measure of the volume.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.600
[Music]

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.700
All right, I think that is just about exactly
where we want our alginate to go to

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.780
that's covering up the end of my wrist.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.480
Let's see if I can pull my hand out.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.920
[Music]

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.140
With the particular
alginate that I'm using,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.880
it has a ratio of 0.83 cups
of alginate to 1 cup of water,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.760
which is 1/2 a cup plus 1/3
of a cup to 1 cup of water.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.700
If you're using a different brand of alginate,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.100
it may have a different ratio.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.440
Make sure you follow the instructions
that come with your packaging.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.620
All right.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.140
Going for a thumbs up.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.520
Pushing my hand down into the alginate.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.580
[Music]

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.460
All the way the bottom
and then back it off just a little bit.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.180
Cause I don't want it touching
the bottom, just close.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.060
Make sure if you're molding your hand,

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:16.260
you're in a position that
you can stay in for a few minutes

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.880
because although it
does cure faster than silicone,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.360
it's not instantaneous.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.380
I can feel it curing around my hand,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.180
and for the most part,
it doesn't feel wildly different,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.280
except that just as my
hand moves the tiny tiny bit,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.440
I now feel resistance.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.900
where it used to just move
right through the liquid.

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.860
I think I'm about ready
to take my hand out,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.380
and the alginate does really
get into all the very tiny details

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.060
so it feels like it's stuck
to the sides of our hand.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.229
It's not really chemically bonded on there,

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.180
it's just gotten into every tiny little groove,
and nook, and cranny in your hand

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.180
that its gripping on pretty well.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.960
So in my experience,
the easiest way to get it off

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.120
is to really just start wiggling your hand
around inside the mold just a little bit,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.420
and you'll feel it start to detach
from your skin everywhere.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.600
Once it feels like it's loosened up,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.680
You should be able to just slide
your hand right out.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.600
[Music]

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600
Here we go.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.620
Hand slid out pretty nicely.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.620
You can see down in there the cavity,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.080
that hand-shaped cavity somewhat.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.500
Our alginate mold seems
like it's working great,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.610
My hand came out of there
without destroying too much.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.520
I can see the mold on the inside.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.880
So I think this is gonna work really well.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.060
So what we need to do now is
mix up a batch of our casting material.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.380
We want to be ready to do this
immediately after finishing the mold

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.080
because an alginate mold
does not keep very long.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.430
If you want to expand
its lifetime by a little bit,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.680
you can keep it in a sealed container
with a lot of wet paper towels

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.600
that can help it stay viable
for even a couple days

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.620
but it is something that's
going to degrade quickly.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.900
So this is really something
you want to make the mold,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.700
and then cast into it right away.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.820
Our casting material says that it is
a 3 to 1 ratio of the material to water.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.960
So let's mix them up about enough
to fill up a hand giving a thumbs up,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.640
and then pour that into our mold.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.800
[Music]

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.300
The plaster is now nice
and evenly mixed together.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.000
It's definitely a thicker
substance than water,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.060
but it's thinner than say honey.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.820
Like watered-down Elmer's Glue maybe?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.100
Now, I'm just going to tap and shake
this bowl for a couple minutes

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.780
trying to get some of the extra
air bubbles out of the plaster.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.960
[Music]

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.900
I think we're now ready to pour
our plaster down into the alginate.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.780
Let's hope I mixed up enough.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.580
If I didn't however,
while the plaster is still liquid,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.660
I'll be able to mix up another
smaller batch and add that to it.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.160
[Music]

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.980
Before I fill that all the way,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.020
I'm going to take the mold
just shake that a little bit.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.280
Again, I'm just trying to
get any air bubbles out,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.940
gonna tip it to make sure that the thumb

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.000
full all the way,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.600
and all of the air bubbles are out of that.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.880
[Music]

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.380
Look at that.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.420
I have maybe a couple of
tablespoons leftover plaster.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.332
So if your hands happen to be
the exact right size of mine,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.560
then three cups of this casting material
and 1 cup of water is the perfect amount.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.200
My hand is molded and the cast that
has now been poured into the mold,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.220
and that needs to cure.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.430
With this stuff, it takes about 45 minutes
before it's ready to take out of the mold.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.660
So let's set this aside for 45 minutes,
and while it's going,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.160
I think I'm actually just going
to whip up a whole second box,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.770
second batch of alginate
and make a second mold

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.680
so I can make sure I can get
two of these thumbs-up castings.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.039
[Music]

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.940
I've got a second mold made and we're
about ready to start making the plaster.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.740
But before we do,
there's some other things I want to try.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.980
This version of the hand,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.620
I'm hoping we can turn
into a wall decoration,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.640
something that actually just attaches
to the wall with some threads.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.240
So, here I have a threaded hook,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.560
and we're going to try embedding
this in the plaster as it cures,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.820
and I also have this
spare piece of steel rod and

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.160
we're going to try and bend that to
a shape so it fits nicely into the thumb.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.700
[Music]

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.240
I'm going to fit this wire
down inside the mold,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.220
right down into the end of the thumb.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.760
So that this angled portion should be in the
body of the hand so it's nice and stable,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.460
and then after I pour the plaster in,
I'll take this hook and lower that in as well.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.560
So hopefully, we'll have
the hook embedded in it

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.140
that lets us have threads so we can
screw this into a wall after its cured,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.200
and a piece of metal inside the thumb 
really giving that some good reinforcement.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.500
[Music]

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.300
The plaster does take a
little while to start setting up ,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.740
so I think to get the hook
to be in the right spot,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.080
I'll try attaching a little
bridge of tape going across,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.860
and just lower that down into the plaster.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.259
our first mold with the casting in it has
now been sitting for 45 minutes curing,

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:29.980
and I think it's time we
try and take it out of box.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.850
Now, I don't have a
good way to grab onto this.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.140
So I think what I'm going to try and do to
get it out is cut the sides of the box off,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.240
and then destroying as little as possible

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.900
but I'm just going to pull apart the
alginate to get to the casting inside.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.860
Yep. This is just getting destroyed.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.780
That's okay.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.580
That's what we use an alginate mold for.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:09:02.400
[Music]

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.820
Our first casting is now out of the mold,

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.280
and I gotta say I am pretty happy
with how this thing turned out.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.060
Pretty similar?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.460
[Music]

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.340
So this turned out really well.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.280
As you can see, the mold did not survive.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280
Not even a little bit.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.960
I had to just tear it into several large
pieces to be able to get the casting out.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.680
But that is what we are expecting.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.960
That's what happened with alginate.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.200
The point of alginate
is you get one good casting,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.290
and then if you need several,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.700
you can actually make a stronger
silicone mold off of this hand.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.700
There were a couple of spots
where it came out with some errors.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.460
You can see here.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.720
This right here was an air bubble.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.580
When the plaster flowed down in,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.840
it couldn't quite get rid of that right there,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.020
and even though I tipped it,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.130
mostly I tipped in this direction,
and that air bubble stayed stuck in there.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.740
So if I need too I could fix that up
with a little bit of spackle

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.200
before I do any decorations,
or just put this hand on display.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.420
Once you're done with your mold,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.600
and you've already take the
casting out of it and it gets destroyed,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.860
you can just throw it away.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.040
If you need a second casting,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.360
you can either make a different
mold off of the casting you made,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.620
or you can make a
second mold the way we did.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.620
I think it's time to
demold the second hand,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.620
and since the first one
was in there so tight,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.880
I'm just going to go straight to destroying
the box and the mold to get it out.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.320
[Music]

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.360
Now there were two pieces of metal
that we embedded into this hand.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.340
One of course is the hook at the back,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.897
which is going to give us a threads

00:10:22.897 --> 00:10:25.000
to hopefully let us
mount this onto a wall.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.940
The second is a bent piece of metal
that I ran through the thumb,

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.060
and you can actually see it sticking out
a little bit from the tip of the thumb.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.720
That most likely means that
the way the metal was resting,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.040
it pressed just slightly
into the alginate mold.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.940
We're going to try and clean that up
just by going over it with a file.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.020
[Music]

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.886
Look at that.

00:10:45.886 --> 00:10:48.500
Two separate castings of
my hand giving a thumbs up.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.080
[Music]

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.220
Let's see if we can't hang
this one on the wall,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.620
and make a wall-mounted thumbs up.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:14.800
[Music]

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.920
For the hand that isn't
getting mounted on the wall,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.000
this is just going to be
a desktop accessory.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.380
I want this to be a little more decorative,

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.660
so I'm going to paint it
a hammered metallic paint,

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.660
and see how that looks.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.980
But first, I do want to try and fill in these
little gaps that formed with the bubbles.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.700
There are several ways
I can try and do that.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.380
I'm going to see how well it works
to use super glue and baking soda.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.260
[Music]

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.300
Now that we've done a little bit
of cleanup and patchwork,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.120
let's add some paint.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:58.840
[Music]

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.020
I've got one hand as a desk decoration,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.380
and one that can be mounted onto a wall
as a hook or as just a wall decoration.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.740
Either way there's lots of options
of what you can do with this,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.180
and of course, you don't have
to use these same techniques

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.220
just to mold and cast your hand.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.880
The alginate is fairly versatile,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.340
and anything that you think
you can slip out of the mold,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.280
you should be able to cast pretty well.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.700
Of course, you don't have to make
a thumbs up if you're trying this.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.100
You can do any position you want.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.120
Jjust be aware that some hand positions

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.700
will have a tendency to get
air bubbles trapped inside them

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.620
so you'll really need to make sure
that you rotate things around

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.440
to get all of those air bubbles out.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.060
It's a fun project that doesn't take
too long and doesn't cost too much.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.640
I'd give it four thumbs up.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.600
Guys, that's not all,
there's still more for you to see.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.730
That box up at the top will
take you to our last video,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.760
you should go check that out.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.520
The box at the bottom will show you what
YouTube thinks you need to be watching next.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.480
This bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.920
and that way you never miss a video.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.120
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.140
Talk to you then.
