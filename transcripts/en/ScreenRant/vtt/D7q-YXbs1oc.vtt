00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.410
When George Lucas dreamed up the tale of Luke
Skywalker, Darth Vader, and the incredible

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.870
Star Wars of his now decade-spanning film
series, he proved anything was possible to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.090
a new generation of filmmakers.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.050
Although those directors may not have reached
the same heights, that didn’t stop them

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.390
from tipping their hat to Lucas and his galactic
heroes in their own films.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.810
Here are Screen Rant’s Awesome Star Wars
Easter Eggs in Other Movies.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.090
Close Encounters of the Third Kind

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.300
The friendship shared between George Lucas
and Steven Spielberg has led to more than

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.760
a few collaborations over the years, most
notably in shaping the Indiana Jones series.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.609
But that didn't stop Spielberg from paying
homage to his friend's hit franchise in his

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.120
extraterrestrial mystery, Close Encounters
of the Third Kind.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.070
The alien ships that arrive to make contact
with humans aren't explicitly taken from the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.899
Star Wars universe, but a closer look at the
Mother ship shows a familiar shape on its

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:54.899
underside.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.499
Yes, that's an unmistakable R2 unit pinned
upside down, modelled after the beloved droid

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.190
mascot of the galaxy far, far away.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.190
Apocalypse Now

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.960
Apocalypse Now is remembered as Francis Ford
Coppola's monumental tale of darkness and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.701
descent in the Vietnam War, but it didn't
begin that way, It was originally George Lucas

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:17.280
who planned on directing the film, with his
close friend Coppola executive producing.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.040
By the time the pair had become big enough
names to make the movie happen, Lucas was

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.360
filming Star Wars, and making Harrison Ford
a household name after giving him his big

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.729
screen break in American Graffiti years earlier.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.000
Coppola took over Apocalypse, but found a
small role for Ford to play, fittingly, named

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.439
after their mutual friend.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.720
To make the reference clear, Ford's 'Colonel
Lucas’ is referred to as simply "Luke" in

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.170
the actual scene.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.170
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.369
The Star Wars easter eggs found in the Indiana
Jones trilogy are well-documented, ranging

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.909
from the obvious to nearly impossible to catch.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.039
The most often cited references are the airplane
tail numbers in Raiders of the Lost Ark hinting

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.229
at both Obi-Wan Kenobi and C-3PO, and the
Shanghai night club named for Luke Skywalker's

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.929
Jedi Master seen in Temple of Doom.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.439
The hieroglyphics containing R2 and 3PO are
harder to spot, and the chemicals in The Last

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.750
Crusade hinting at Han Solo's carbonite cocoon.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.319
But not every nod is so clear: for instance,
the sacrificial lava pit in Temple of Doom

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:23.670
making the exact same sound as Darth Vader's
lightsaber igniting.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.530
Independence Day

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.030
Fans may not see too many parallels between
Roland Emmerich's Independence Day and the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.470
Star Wars saga, but that doesn't mean the
director and crew weren't massive fans of

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.430
George Lucas's series.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.959
When the alien invaders are first detected
by Earth's scientists, it's easy to miss the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.751
computer monitor showing a model of the "Deep
Space Satellite Satellite Devlin," named for

00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:44.430
the movie's co-writer and producer, Dean Devlin.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.340
What's impossible to miss is that the satellite
is clearly a scaled down version of the Death

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.460
Star super weapon - but it's not the only
easter egg in the movie.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.959
A tiny model may be hard to spot, but when
the movie shifts to the underground labs of

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.370
Area 51, the hangar storing the captured alien
spaceship is marked so clearly, fans may wonder

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.349
how they missed the massive "R2" on the facility’s
walls.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.349
Star Trek

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.760
The battle between Star Wars and Star Trek
has waged since the 1970s, with fans hotly

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.989
debating which franchise reigns supreme.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.579
But when director J.J. Abrams took over the
Trek series for his 2009 reboot, he injected

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.879
the franchise with some big screen spectacle
typically associated with George Lucas's space

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:22.879
opera.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.629
To make his love of Star Wars clear years
before he took the helm of Episode 7, Abrams

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.970
included R2-D2 in his own universe, visible
among the wreckage of a massive fleet of ships.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.730
Only visible for a second, r2 is clearly the
go-to easter egg for every director.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.439
Star Trek into Darkness

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.360
Just to make sure that fans made the connections
between Trek and Wars clear, Abrams followed

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.560
up his reboot with yet another R2 unit.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.890
This time, the droid calls the Enterprise
home, and can be glimpsed for even less time,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.069
flying out of the ship during an explosive
decompression.

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.519
Given the drama seen in both franchises, this
seems like just another day on the job for

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.329
your average R2.

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.640
Marvel’s Phase 2

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.370
While it's technically the middle chapter
of a planned trilogy, the Empire Strikes Back

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.489
is still recognized as one of the greatest
movie sequels in history, considered to be

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.099
an even better film than the original by many
fans.

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.209
So when Marvel Studios decided to pursue that
same level of success with "Phase 2" of their

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.530
shared cinematic universe, they decided a
studio-wide homage was in order.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.800
Empire's climactic battle saw Luke Skywalker
lose his hand to Darth Vader, meaning every

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.570
Phase 2 Marvel movie had to follow suit.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.350
First came Iron Man 3, in which the film's
villain loses his limb courtesy of a Stark

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.810
blade.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.910
It was followed by Loki slicing off Thor's
hand in the Dark World, although it's revealed

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.600
to be an illusion.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.710
Captain America's Winter Soldier sports an
artificial arm, and both Groot and Nebula

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.340
get the same treatment in Guardians of the
Galaxy.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.060
Add in a pair of lost limbs in The Avengers:
Age of Ultron, and it's hard to know if Luke

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.000
Skywalker would be proud, flattered... or
disgusted.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.450
So what do you think of our list?

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.850

galaxy far, far away?
