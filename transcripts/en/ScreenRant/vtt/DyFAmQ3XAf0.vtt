00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.849
Nothing can bring a movie audience to tears
like the death of a beloved character.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:19.060
But when an actor or actress's on screen death
is well-deserved, insanely over the top, or

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.970
delivered at the hands of a horror icon, viewers
may be too busy laughing or cheering instead.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.590
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Funniest Movie Deaths.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.130
A Nightmare on Elm Street

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.570
Since Freddy Krueger uses dreams to take out
teenagers, every kill in the series is ridiculous

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
in some way.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.940
But when Nancy's mother is surprised by the
slasher, he smashes an arm through a glass

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.730
window - and the viewer's suspension of disbelief.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.280
It's obviously impossible to actually pull
the actress through the window, but the awkward

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.350
dummy taking her place turns the genuine jump
scare into a bad joke.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.350
Live and Let Die

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.140
As crazy or hard to believe as some of James
Bond's kills have been, there's no debating

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140
the weirdest.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.250
When 007 has his showdown with the villain
of Live and Let Die, a short, awkward grapple

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.320
sends both men into a shark tank, where James
leaves his opponent to die.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.350
Not by shark, but one of the villain's own
Inflating bullets.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.929
When the man floated to the ceiling and exploded,
the audience wasn't laughing at the twist

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:26.800
- they were laughing at how ridiculous Roger
Moore's super spy had really become.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.800
Deep Blue Sea

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.520
When a movie is absolutely filled with ridiculous
deaths, it takes something special for one

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.049
kill to rise above the rest.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.110
Or in this case, just a passionate speech
from Samuel L. Jackson.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.119
When his character has shown why he's just
the man to help the movies cast survive an

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.689
assault from super-smart sharks, the fish
get the last laugh, cutting his plan short

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.040
with a single bite.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.750
The surprise and absurdity of the kill made
it one of Hollywood's cult favourites, eventually

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.460
becoming well known even if movie fans never
sat through the entire shark drama.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.460
Zombieland

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850
Audiences were shocked enough when comedy
icon Bill Murray made a surprise appearance

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.190
as himself in this post-apocalyptic tale.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.649
Ever the kidder, Murray's decision to scare
another survivor winds up costing him, but

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.380
his sudden and unceremonious death is the
perfect exit.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.540
Letting him dish out some deadpan humor, and
even a playful shot at his worst-reviewed

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.070
role to date, the actor made sure his cameo
would be remembered as one of the movie's

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.100
best moments.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.230
And with his dying breath, showed there's
always time for another joke.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.380
Big Trouble in Little China

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.390
No list of insane movie deaths is complete
without this entry from the classic Kurt Russel

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.570
martial arts fantasy.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.190
When his trucker hero has managed to take
out the supernatural villain of Big Trouble,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.230
the warlord's lieutenant is more than a little
angry.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.100
Instead of looking for revenge, he lets his
anger build, eventually inflating him to a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.310
level of ridiculousness that the movie had
yet to reach, before exploding in a burst

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.330
of lettuce.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.200
The death alone is worth the movies entire
runtime.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200
Zoolander

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.510
Ben Stiller made an entire movie out of the
idea that fashion supermodels aren't exactly

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.310
gifted thinkers, but the true stupidity of
Derek Zoolander's best friends only became

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.620
clear moments before their death.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.320
Food fights, pillow fights, and snowball fights
are all in good fun, but a gasoline fight

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.500
is asking for trouble.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.890
The gag might have been one of biggest reaches
in the entire movie, but there's no denying

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.890
its staying power.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.729
There are lots of laughs to be had throughout
the movie, but the scene - and it's fiery

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.260
end - are impossible to forget.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.260
Total Recall

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.630
It's hard to tell what's true and what isn't
in this sci-fi classic, but when Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.540
finally gets to Mars, he sends the movie's
villain out onto the planet's surface.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.380
Without any air to breathe, he's dead in under
a minute.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.690
Well, the oozing, swelling plastic version
if him is, anyway.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.280
If the movie really is all in Quaid's head,
then he never learned what a lack of oxygen

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.510
would do to a human being.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.340
But he's clearly a fan of schlocky horror.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.340
MacGruber

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.910
It's hard to pick just one memorable death
in this SNL feature film, since the final

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.380
act sends the hero into a throat-ripping frenzy.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.660
But MacGruber finally gets the payback he's
been waiting for when his nemesis shows up

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.660
to ruin his wedding.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.100
It wasn't enough to beat Dieter Von Kunth
and throw him to his death.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.680
The handy hero needed to riddle him with bullets
on the way down, and even run salt in the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.910
wound by desecrating his corpse.....

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.910
Twice.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.570
The guy can really hold a grudge.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.570
True Lies

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.130
Director James Cameron set a record with the
budget of his action-comedy True Lies, but

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.630
audiences got to enjoy every dollar of it
on the big screen.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.380
As star Arnold Schwarzenegger battles a group
of terrorists out of a skyscraper and onto

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.690
the wings of a fighter jet, audiences probably
thought things had gotten as insane as possible.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.750
But with the villain hanging from one of the
fighter's missiles, and his partners escaping

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.410
in a nearby helicopter, Arnold decides to
solve two problems at once.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.260
Delivering one of the most laughable kills
in his entire career.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.260
Team America: World Police

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.290
The actors may not be humans, but that only
guaranteed that each and every single kill

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.190
and stunt in Team America would be a surefire
gag.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.660
The squad's celebration is cut short when
one surviving terrorist suddenly cuts down

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.660
one of their own.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.980
Even though the twist has been seen in dozens
of action flicks, the tragedy of a puppet

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.570
being cut down in his prime, and the insane
death dance of his killer is impossible not

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.620
to laugh at.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.090
Those are just a few of our favorite funny
movie deaths, but did we miss any of your

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.390
favorite outrageous kills?
