SANDEEP RAVICHANDRAN:
Cognitive Clouds

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.060
is a software development agency
where we build scalable, web,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.160
and mobile products.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.618
RAVINDRA KANCHIKARE: We are
six to eight people strong team

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:14.000
and serve more
than 40 customers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.970
PRASANNA GOPINATH: We specialize
in transforming simple customer

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.190
sketches into complex
software products.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.780
Our mission is to
help our clients

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.570
to build fantastic
products keeping the design

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.000
at the heart of the system.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.420
That's what we do best.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.050
SANDEEP RAVICHANDRAN:
There are three things

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.400
that sets us apart.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.370
We use rapid prototyping to make
sure the product gets launched

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.650
to market as soon as
possible by building

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.561
a proper MVP for the customers.

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.310
We have regular meetings
with the clients.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.680
We also prefer to
overcommunicate rather than

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.170
undercommunicate, and make sure
things go according to plan.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.140
And last and not
the least, employees

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.610
are the backbone of our company.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.140
We make sure the
basics are strong.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.580
They have good communication.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.130
And everyone can serve
as a manager for them.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.650
RAVINDRA KANCHIKARE: It's
quite exciting working here.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.310
Every day is a great morning.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.811
And then you feel like want to
come to office and then work.

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:01.143
PRASANNA GOPINATH: I've read
about the Google Developers

00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:02.810
Agency program on the blog.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.430
Google being Google, we love it.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.580
We were looking for alternatives
for building servers.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.760
So Firebase and Google
Cloud were two technologies

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.160
we really wanted to try
out and basically scale

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.284
our applications.

00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:16.700
The second motivation was the
design sprints that came out

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.086
of Google got so
popular that we wanted

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:20.210
to actually tinker with it.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.680
And Google Agency
program actually

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.681
helped us getting there.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.721
RAVINDRA KANCHIKARE: We
have seen Google building

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.020
great applications, and
then, if we can, actually,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.260
use those tricks and
experience and help

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.780
our customers get the
same kind of products.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.920
When we started working
with the agency,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.090
we discovered a lot of
things which we didn't know.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.930
And that was really helpful
for us to build better quality

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.900
applications.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.460
SANDEEP RAVICHANDRAN: I believe
that any good development

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.100
agency needs to be capable of
solving problems on their own.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.080
How to make [INAUDIBLE]
your company.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.600
But its very reassuring to know
that Google was just a phone

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.200
call or email away when
we had any problem and we

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.682
needed any suggestion to
use any of the products.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.670
The Google Design Sprint
helped to streamline our design

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.690
process.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.790
Our [INAUDIBLE] designs
faster, and also,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.690
which in turn cuts down
costs for the client.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.050
So it made them happy
at the end of the day.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.430
RAVINDRA KANCHIKARE: We'd
start working [INAUDIBLE],

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.930
and then all the
four or five people

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.989
who was working
on the project has

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.050
to sit down and work,
and then immediately get

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.270
the feedback like that.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.620
That cut down a lot
of time, and also made

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.730
the design quality much better.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.630
We have support e-mail,
and also Hangouts in Google

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.130
where we have a
question and answer.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.090
That's a great way to us
ask the right question

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.945
and find the solutions for it.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.070
SANDEEP RAVICHANDRAN: As
an app development agency,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.510
trust is an important thing.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.000
Being a part of Google
Developers Agency program

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.572
really helped us in building
that trust with our customers.

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:36.530
PRASANNA GOPINATH: I
think having Google Agency

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.960
certification and
Google's credibility

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.730
adding to what we've
been doing already,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.610
we've been able to gain more
customers around the world

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.620
to build next generation
Android applications.
