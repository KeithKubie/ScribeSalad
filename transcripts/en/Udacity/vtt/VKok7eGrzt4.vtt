00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.350
The third issue has to do with Extensions.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.415
Components are often extended by adding new features.

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:08.880
Recall that we met features and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.290
features diagrams when we looked at architectural views.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.338
When the vendors add new features complicating situations may arise.

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:21.340
For example, the particular situation might require that there

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.650
be exactly one instance of that particular component.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.410
This is sometimes called a singleton extension.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.870
If there are multiple components involved, we might want to ensure that at

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.580
most one of the, one has this new feature added to it.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.460
Related to that is what happens if there are parallel extensions of,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.370
of multiple components in the same dimension.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.810
If we do allow the same feature,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.050
feature to be configured into multiple components, we may need to be aware of

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.430
the possibility of resource contention, if each version,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.760
version of that component is trying to get access to the same resource.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.880
Sometimes there are non-orthogonal extensions, and

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.780
we have to be careful of possible feature interactions,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.569
if a customer configures in more than one new feature at the same time.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.050
And then there are recursive extensions.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.490
Some component models support adding components that can themselves be extended.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.630
This may mean that the component vendor loses control of what

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.220
components are actually deployed.
