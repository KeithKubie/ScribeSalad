1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.780
Hey Joe,
welcome.
Thank you.
It's great to be here.
Thanks for having me.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.370
My pleasure.
I'm Sam Harris.
Sends his regards.
Yeah.
Sam's a beautiful man.
He is.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.910
I love that guy.
And he's one of the reasons why you're here.
Um,

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.550
so universal basic income,
this is what this is all about.
Yes.
Yeah.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.160
That's what my campaign for president is all about.
That's uh,

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.690
an interesting,

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.230
like a focus of a campaign and very unusual and I mean four years ago you'd

8
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.060
never even thought that that would have a chance at all.

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.510
But this is a subject that has been gained momentum and it made a,

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340
I made a big shift because a,

11
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:41.190
I had my friend Eddie Wong on once and he was the first person to bring it up

12
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:44.370
and my initial knee jerk reaction was get the fuck out of here.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.290
Like universal basic income.

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.150
Just going to give people money that just going to be lazy.

15
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.070
Nothing's ever going to get done.
That's a terrible idea.

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.440
And then I started paying attention to the rise of AI and automation and how

17
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.820
many jobs are going to get taken away from.

18
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.280
And then once you see the actual numbers,
it's pretty staggering.
Yeah,

19
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.660
and that's how I got there,
Joe.

20
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.840
Like I spent the last seven years running an organization that I had started

21
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.730
called venture for America and we helped create about 3000 jobs in Detroit,

22
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990
Cleveland,
Saint Louis,
Birmingham,
New Orleans,
other cities around the country,

23
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.070
and I saw that were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in

24
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.440
the bottom,
and that for every five,

25
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:25.710
10 50 jobs that my entrepreneurs are going to create,

26
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.260
we're going to lose five 10 50,000 jobs.

27
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.360
It's not something that people intuitively suspect could be a real issue either.

28
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.900
It's,
it's one of the ones where you kind of have to let go shake people like,

29
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.840
hey,
look at this.
This is coming.
There's a cliff.

30
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.290
We're going towards this cliff it,
it's darker still.
And that,

31
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.480
so when I was digging into the numbers,

32
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.200
I found that it's not this cliff that we're heading towards.

33
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.210
It's actually a more of a curve that we're on.

34
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.530
What I've been telling people is that wearing in the third inning now where one

35
00:01:55.531 --> 00:02:00.531
of the main reasons why Donald Trump won in 2016 is that we automated away 4

36
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.610
million manufacturing jobs that were based in Michigan,
Pennsylvania,
Ohio,

37
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.500
Wisconsin,
Missouri,
Iowa,

38
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.840
all the swing states he needed to win in the center of the country.

39
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.170
And a lot of that was just manufacturing work.
And if you go to a factory,

40
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.630
you'll see it's a giant robot arms as far as the eye can see.

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.810
So it's not just that you have artificial intelligence on the horizon,

42
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.610
it's that we've been eating away at the most common jobs in the u s economy,
uh,

43
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.920
for almost 20 years now.

44
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.150
And it's just now hitting a point where it's pushing more and more unskilled men

45
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.760
in particular out of the workforce now.

46
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.930
Are there other alternatives that you've considered other than just universal

47
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:37.770
basic income,

48
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:42.771
like educating people about this being a real issue and perhaps pushing them or

49
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:49.530
directing them towards other occupations?
Yeah,
so that,
that's the,
uh,

50
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.110
recipe that most people are attracted to.

51
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.710
So I just want to unpack the number is a little bit more so people have a sense

52
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:56.400
of it.

53
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.840
I was just with a bunch of truck drivers in Iowa last week and there's a guy at

54
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.210
dentist but gasky that gave me a ride from Altoona at Grinnell in Iowa where

55
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.790
I've been campaigning and the truth of it,
Joe,

56
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.570
is that there are three and a half million truck drivers in this country right

57
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.990
now is the most common job in 29 states and the average truckers,

58
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.460
a 49 year old guy with a high school education,
maybe ex military,

59
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:23.200
like Dennis was a,
they're making like $50,000 a year.
So then if you say,
Hey,

60
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:28.201
I'm going to retrain half a million truck drivers for what exactly is like issue

61
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:33.490
number one,
right.
And that these guys didn't love school 30 years ago.

62
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.720
It's not like driving a truck has made them really excited about the idea and

63
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.050
then the new job you're training them.

64
00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:43.180
Before I looked into the data as to how good we were at retraining,

65
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.110
let's say displaced manufacturing workers in the Midwest when we started

66
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.550
decimating their jobs.

67
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.880
And we're terrible at like according to independent studies,

68
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
government funded retraining programs had a success rate of between zero and 15%

69
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.240
in real life.

70
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.050
Like this is what actually happened to the workers of Michigan and Indiana and

71
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.140
Ohio.
And so if you say we're going to retrain these people,

72
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:09.610
then you also have to come up with a way for us to become amazing at something

73
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:13.030
that right now we're really,
really bad at.
And if you are an employer,

74
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.893
which you are,

75
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.490
would you rather employ a 50 year old former truck driver with health problems

76
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.080
who got some certificate program?

77
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.950
What would you rather higher a 25 year old kid who went to community college is

78
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.090
probably cheaper,
has lower expectations,
uh,

79
00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:30.790
and his skills are natively going to be a little fresher.
I mean,

80
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:35.500
if you were an employer,
you'd probably choose number two.
I agree.
Um,

81
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.220
but I,
I'm,
I mean I'm trying to look at this through rose colored glasses,

82
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:44.140
I guess.
Well,
thank you.
If there's a way that these people can adapt,
you know,

83
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:48.130
I mean some will for sure,
you can retrain and rescale some people,

84
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:48.880
but if you look at,

85
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.420
even the conversations we're having around this where people legitimately talk

86
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.820
about retraining coal miners to be software engineers,

87
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.260
stuff that on the face of it makes no sense.
But the,

88
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:02.020
the reason why we're stretching for that is because we're looking for some kind

89
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.800
of retraining oriented solution when the numbers show that that's just not going

90
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:09.420
to be the recipe for actual success.
And this is where,

91
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.840
where this whole learn to code controversies coming out online where people are

92
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.330
actually getting banned for writing,
learn to code.

93
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.690
It's a really a hot subject on Twitter and it's very confusing too.

94
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:25.240
And I haven't really gotten an explanation for why that's such an offensive

95
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.140
thing to say,
but people are getting banned for even analysts.

96
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.150
I know a show's coming around saying learn to code and it's very weird.

97
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.290
But the idea behind it is that it's kind of preposterous to ask someone who

98
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.700
doesn't have an education to do something that's as difficult as code computer

99
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:43.840
language.
Yeah.

100
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:47.320
And unfortunately we're going to get to a point where AI can do some basic

101
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:51.820
coding at a certain level.
So if you think about the impulse to say,

102
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.654
learn to code,

103
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.920
what it's really saying is you need to do something that the market values,

104
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.220
it's like,
Hey,
being a truck driver,
the market's not going to value that much.

105
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.610
And when the truck started driving themselves in the next five to 10 years,

106
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.730
so what does the market value?
And then people are like,
well,

107
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.180
coding and stem and uh,
engineering skills.

108
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.790
And so there's a drive to try and push people in those directions.

109
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.310
But if you look at the numbers,
uh,

110
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.230
about 8% of American jobs right now are in stem fields,

111
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:22.880
like in technology,
engineering,
math,

112
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.840
etc. So you're talking about 92% of the population that is not in those fields.

113
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.880
And it's unrealistic to expect that 92% to somehow shift into the 8%.

114
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.560
Right.
And they're even be places for them.
Yeah.
That that's true too.

115
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.980
Even if they perfectly seamlessly transitioned,

116
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.720
there's too many people for those jobs.
Yeah.
So I,

117
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:44.930
I've been driven to universal basic income in part because I had been looking at

118
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:45.764
the numbers.

119
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.150
The five most common jobs in the United States right now are administrative and

120
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:54.230
clerical work,
retail and sales,
food service and food prep,

121
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.600
truck driving and transportation and manufacturing.

122
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.080
Those five jobs comprise about half of all American jobs.

123
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.260
Only 32% of Americans graduate from college.

124
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.590
So the average Americans have high school Grad during one of these five jobs.

125
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.730
And if you look at it,

126
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:10.820
technology is already doing a number on each of these jobs.

127
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.210
Like the first administrative and clerical includes call center workers.

128
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:18.530
And Ai is in the process of taking over that job.
Retail and sales,

129
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:21.710
30% of malls are closing in the next four years.
So the,

130
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.540
the danger here is to think of it as artificial intelligence is coming.

131
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.280
It's actually already eating up the most common jobs in our economy and it's

132
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.690
driving Americans,
uh,
into distress in various ways.
In the numbers.

133
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.530
Now when you talking about universal basic income too,

134
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.070
there's two questions that come up.
How much money and where's it coming from?

135
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.390
Yeah,
so first I want to say that if you look at the heritage of universal basic

136
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:47.930
income,

137
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.440
it's a deeply American idea where Thomas Paine was forward at the founding of

138
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:54.860
the country and then Martin Luther King was for it.
Milton Friedman,

139
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.800
the godfather of conservative economists was for it.

140
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.480
And one state has had it in effect for 37 years where everyone in that state

141
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:06.870
gets between one and $2,000 a year.
No questions asked.
And this is Alaska.
Yeah,

142
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.660
it's Alaska.
And they funded with oil money.

143
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.050
And what I'm going around and telling people is that technology is the oil of

144
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:16.670
the 21st century.
So I know you spoke to another guest about,
hey,

145
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.533
how do you get,

146
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.980
let's say approximately $3 trillion a year to fund universal basic income?

147
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.440
And a great thing is that it's,
well,

148
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.540
the first thing is it's not actually 3 trillion.

149
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.300
And the reason why it's not 3 trillion is that if you look at what we're

150
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:32.270
currently doing,
we have a,

151
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:36.650
we're spending about one point 5 trillion right now on 126 welfare programs and

152
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:40.550
social security.
And so if you show up to someone's door and say,
hey,

153
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.730
here's a dividend of $1,000 a month,

154
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.720
but if you're already getting more than a thousand dollars and stuff,

155
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:50.450
we're not just going to stack it on top.
Uh,
you know,

156
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:52.370
we're gonna just gonna say you're guaranteed a thousand.

157
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.950
And if you're already getting more than this doesn't touch you,

158
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:59.340
you keep your current stuff.
If you're getting 700 and food stamps and whatnot,

159
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.960
then you can just get 300 on top.

160
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.730
So the 3 trillion actually shrinks a lot very fast because of the fact that

161
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:09.110
about half of Americans are already getting various,
uh,

162
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.920
income support from the government.

163
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.220
So the real price tag is closer to about one point 8 trillion.

164
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.330
If you say everyone who's 18 and up now for context,

165
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:21.120
the entire US economy is now 20 trillion,

166
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.170
5 trillion in the last 12 years.
And the federal budgets,
4 trillion.

167
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.300
So you're looking at one point 8 trillion.
It's a lot of money.
Uh,

168
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.980
but it's actually manageable.

169
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.960
And one of the things that I haven't heard discussed here with you is that when

170
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:39.750
you put money into people's hands,
the money doesn't disappear.

171
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.300
Like if I gave you 1000 bucks a month,

172
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.880
it probably would not make a big difference in the economy because they're just

173
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.790
go into your account somewhere and you know,
nothing would happen.

174
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.200
But we all know that right now,
most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

175
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.760
57% of Americans can't afford an unexpected $500 bill.

176
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.460
So you put $1,000 a month,
and then their hands,

177
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.120
it's gonna go right back into the economy.
They're going to spend it on food,

178
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.590
childcare,
car repairs had been putting off the occasional night out.

179
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.860
And then all of those businesses end up hiring more people.

180
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:14.190
And then we end up getting some of the money back as tax revenues.

181
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.540
So of the one point 8 trillion,
we're going to get back,

182
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.430
let's call it 400 billion in new tax receipts because everyone's going to be

183
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:24.330
spending more money.

184
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.110
We're going to save one to 200 billion on things like incarceration and

185
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:34.860
homelessness services and emergency room healthcare.
I was in New Hampshire,

186
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.840
uh,
last month and a prison guard said to me,
there's a prison guard.
He said,

187
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:43.410
we should pay people to stay out of jail because we waste so much money when

188
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:46.950
they're in jail.
Like he sees all the waste in the system.

189
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.640
So if you imagine a society where everyone's getting 1000 bucks a month,

190
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.050
that's like a,

191
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.750
it's a great incentive to try and stay out of jail because you know,

192
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:57.750
you stopped getting it if you wind up in jail,
uh,

193
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.080
and it reduces recidivism because when you come out of jail,
at least you have,

194
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.990
you know,
1000 bucks a month waiting for you and then you're less inclined to,

195
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.730
to commit a crime and head back in.

196
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.680
How much crime do you think you would actually prevent though,

197
00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:09.480
by giving people $1,000 a month?
I mean,

198
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:12.330
think most of the people that are doing crime,

199
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.440
whether it's thieve thievery or assault,

200
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.290
they're not thinking this out.
You know,
this is,

201
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:22.980
this is just either a way of life for them either,
you know,
they're,

202
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.620
they've got real mental issues or a pattern of behavior that they can't break.

203
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.040
I really don't think that $1,000 a month it's going to fix any of that.

204
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.100
I was not going to fix all of it for sure.
I mean we'll still have jails.

205
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.230
It's not like,
you know,
silver bullet,

206
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.980
but at the margins would it keep like that person who's falling through the

207
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:47.220
cracks and feels like they have no place in society and maybe they,
you know,

208
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:49.500
it's like the people around them are also like,
hey,
you know,

209
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:52.140
you don't have any value until you get 1000 bucks a month.
Maybe.

210
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.440
Like it keeps off at the margins and everything we're talking about is at the

211
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:56.951
margins.

212
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:00.760
I mean everything is like this statistical curve and you're taking the people

213
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:01.091
who are,

214
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:06.091
let's call it like the last 10 to 20% but if you reduce our incarcerated

215
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:10.180
population by 10 to 20%,
I mean that's billions and billions of dollars.

216
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.500
So you,
you're saving money on a bunch of things.

217
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.500
We spend like a about a trillion dollars on right now,
like healthcare,

218
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.570
incarceration,
homelessness services and then the,

219
00:12:20.571 --> 00:12:25.420
the magic is that if you have 1000 bucks a month and you're a parent,

220
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:29.950
so you feel this,
that studies have shown that your kids are healthier,

221
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.390
better nourished,

222
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.170
more likely to graduate from high school and get further education.

223
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.220
Mental health improves,
relationships improve,

224
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.990
domestic violence goes down,

225
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.920
hospital visits go down and your worker productivity goes up mean uh,

226
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.710
you're an entrepreneur and CEO.
So you know,
when you run a company you say,

227
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.210
I'm going to invest in my people.

228
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.110
I'm going to like treat them well and try and train them and give them resources

229
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.501
cause you know,

230
00:12:56.501 --> 00:13:00.760
that'll increase your productivity as an organization and the public sector.

231
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:04.960
We have the opposite approach where like if I can just avoid spending money on

232
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:07.630
you that you know,

233
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:11.290
I'm going to somehow save money when we end up spending that money and very,

234
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.580
very dark,
costly counter productive ways in the backend because they wind up,

235
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.860
you know,
uh,
uh,
in our institutions and our institutions just spend a,

236
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:20.830
a truckload of money.

237
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
So if you look at the cost savings and the value gains and the economic growth

238
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.040
that actually gets you back about a trillion dollars or the 1.8,

239
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.370
this is like the trickle up economy cause none of the money disappears.

240
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.200
It goes right back into the economy.

241
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.240
And the way you get the last 800 billion or so is related to what we think is

242
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:42.520
happening with AI and all these advanced technologies.

243
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:47.890
Because if you look at who's going to win with AI and a self driving cars and

244
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:48.724
trucks,

245
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.930
the savings from robot trucks are estimated to be $168 billion a year just from

246
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:55.084
that one thing.

247
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.380
So the problem is that the American public is going to see very little of that

248
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.220
money,
uh,

249
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.790
because the winners are going to be the trillion dollar tech companies that are

250
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:07.330
great at does not paying a lot of taxes.
They'll move it through Ireland.

251
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.560
Amazon will say it didn't make any money this quarter.
No reason to pay taxes.

252
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.220
And so what we need to do is we need to put in a new tax that actually gets the

253
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.360
American public a slice of every robot,
truck mile,

254
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:21.700
Amazon transaction,
Facebook ad,

255
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.420
and every other industrialized country already has this tax.

256
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:28.990
It's called a value added tax.
And because our economy is so vast,

257
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:30.850
at 20 trillion of value added tax,

258
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:34.810
that even half the European level generates about 800 billion in new revenue.

259
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.460
And that gets you all the way there.

260
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.720
So this is much more achievable and affordable than most people think when they

261
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.450
start unpacking how the numbers work out.

262
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.750
So essentially it would be the biggest corporations,

263
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:51.320
the companies that gain or that have the largest revenue,

264
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.540
they're going to be paying most of this.
Yeah.

265
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:55.970
But they're going to get some of that money back obviously because one of the

266
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:57.470
things I say to the CEOs,

267
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.010
it's like if everyone in Missouri is getting 1000 bucks,
you know,

268
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:04.070
Amazon's going to see some of that because they're just going to buy more stuff.

269
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.790
Right.
That's true for all of the big companies.
What I say to CEOs,

270
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:10.040
and I've spoken to groups of dozens of CEOs,

271
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.610
what's really bad for your businesses when people don't have money to spend?
Why?

272
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.350
What's good for your businesses when they do?

273
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.560
So they're going to give up some money at the top end,

274
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:20.530
but they're just going to end up getting it back.
Uh,

275
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.780
when they're consumers end up spending a bit more and it's just been actually

276
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:24.441
fleshed out.

277
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:27.830
Like the real numbers are the projections of how much they're going to get back.

278
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.710
Yeah.
That like the,
so the Roosevelt Institute study,

279
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:34.520
this plan of everyone getting 1000 bucks a month and projected it would create 2

280
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.900
million new jobs,
uh,
and grow the economy by eight to 10%.

281
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.430
And then you can model out what that means to each business because in that

282
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:46.130
climate they're going to see a similar uptake and revenues.

283
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.710
Did they factor in all the jobs that are going to be lost?

284
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.690
So one of the things that's a misconception about universal basic income is that

285
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.880
a,
it's somehow we'll like facilitate job loss.
Job losses though,

286
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.910
was the reason for universal basic income in the first place,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

287
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:03.680
Which way in the midst of right now,
like right now,

288
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:04.760
as we're sitting here together,

289
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.440
the labor force participation rate in the United States is 63%,

290
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.380
which is the same levels as El Salvador in the Dominican Republic.

291
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.300
That's right now,
like,
uh,

292
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.310
94 million or so Americans have left the workforce over the last number of
years.

293
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.810
Now,
a lot of that's natural demographics,
a lot of that people in school,

294
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.230
but about 5 million of it is unskilled men who've gotten pushed out of the

295
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:31.070
workforce.
So,
uh,
so again,
this is not like a,
you know,

296
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:33.050
we're going to solve a problem that's coming down the pike.

297
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.750
Like we're actually in the middle of this problem.

298
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.900
So if you put 1000 bucks a month into people's hands,

299
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:41.420
that actually grows the economy and creates jobs,
uh,

300
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.840
because of more economic activity.
Now,

301
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:47.540
when you say a problem that's coming down the pike,
what,

302
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.820
what are the projections in terms of life?
The timeline?
Yes.
So,

303
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.720
uh,
there are a lot of the projections are actually pretty consistent with each

304
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:00.740
other,
which means they're probably right.
So,
so the,
uh,

305
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.800
so Bain says you're looking at between 20 and 30% of jobs subject to automation

306
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:09.950
by 2030,
which is pretty soon,
it's like 11 years from now.

307
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.060
Mckinsey says that 25%,
uh,

308
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.030
the Obama White House literally have like their last day in office,

309
00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:20.570
they issued a report saying,
hey guys,
we're gonna automate away all the jobs.

310
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:22.670
And then like,
you know,
turn the lights off.

311
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.380
They said 83% of jobs that make less than $20 an hour will be subject to

312
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:31.820
automation by 2030.
Mit is saying the same thing.

313
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:32.570
Uh,

314
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.570
and so we have 11 years to try and accelerate meaningful solutions.

315
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.300
And this 11 years,
it's not like it all happens on 2030.

316
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.390
It's going to happen between now and then.
Progressively,

317
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.150
according to all of the major institutions that have looked at this.
