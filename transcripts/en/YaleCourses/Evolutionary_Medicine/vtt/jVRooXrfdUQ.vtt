1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.890
So why is it that we are susceptible to cancer?

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.480
<v 0>The evolution of maintenance mechanisms,</v>

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.740
which is associated with the evolution of aging has been such that maintenances

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.490
neglected for good reasons.
Let me,

6
00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:21.050
collective maintenance allows better reproduction.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.630
We have stem cells and we need them for repair,

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.060
but they are pre adapted for metro stations.

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.140
There really aren't genes for cancer.

10
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:37.070
Most of the genes that are involved in cancer actually are doing something else

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.090
early in development.

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.820
The possibility for somatic mutation is simply enormous.

13
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:46.320
The numbers are overwhelming.

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.010
So what are the causes of aging?

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.710
We have covered some of these in previous lectures,

16
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:57.711
but it's a good idea here to have a recap because this is the context in which

17
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.050
our vulnerability for cancer arises.

18
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.090
Aging is a byproduct of selection for reproductive performance.

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
That's the essential idea
in this process.

20
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:13.980
Maintenance is neglected in order to improve reproduction.

21
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.130
Aging arises through the evolutionary accumulation of many genes that have

22
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.660
positive effects on fitness early in life and negative effects on fitness late

23
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:27.690
in life.
So there are benefits outweigh their costs.

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.550
From the point of view of evolution,

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.160
which is not the point of view of a patient with cancer.

26
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.980
First we reduced mortality that is caused by infectious disease.

27
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.510
We did it with hygiene,
vaccines and antibiotics,
mostly in the 20th century.

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.560
Then cardiovascular disease emerged as a major killer.

29
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.050
Then we improve the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease,

30
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.950
but we started dying more frequently of cancer and Alzheimer's.

31
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.900
There isn't really any end of that insight.

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.140
Now the second,
uh,

33
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.950
idea in why we are vulnerable to cancer is the multicellular covenant.

34
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.600
So this picture is designed to elicit the notion of multicellularity.

35
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:20.601
This is a multicellular Alga and the bright green dots are the reproductive

36
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:25.020
cells.
The smaller,

37
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:29.730
darker green dots are the somatic cells that are engaged in photosynthesis,

38
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.540
and they gather the energy and give it to the reproductive cells,

39
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.670
which get the genes into the next generation.

40
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.390
So somatic cells stop reproducing.

41
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.450
Germ cells propagate the genes,

42
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.290
stem cells repair tissue cancer breaks this covenant.

43
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.730
Most of the cancers originate in stem cells.

44
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.030
So stem cells arose with multicellularity or great innovation.

45
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.530
There are about a billion years old.

46
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.480
They appear to divide slowly and they retain the potential to differentiate.

47
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.270
Slow Division would reduce cancer frequency potential to differentiate and to

48
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.000
move pre adapts them to a cancerous lifestyle.

49
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.740
<v 0>They are positioned all over the body to replace cells that we're out in our</v>

51
00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:28.790
discarded,
particularly in bone marrow,
in lungs,

52
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.960
intestine,
in skin,
and the epithelium there.

53
00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:37.961
Capacity for self renewal and their potential to differentiate pre adapt them to

54
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:39.740
a cancerous lifestyle.

55
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.040
<v 1>No.
How</v>

56
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.970
<v 0>are somatic cells normally kept under control?
Well,</v>

57
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.800
early in development,
the germ cell germline is physically isolated,

58
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.310
at least in organisms like us,

59
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.310
that prevents invasion from the Soma.

60
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:03.510
So that keeps somatic cells from defecting from the Covenant and going back and

61
00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:05.490
getting their genes into the next generation.

62
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.370
Tumor suppressor genes control differentiation and deal with them.

63
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.430
So if a sales starts to proliferate when it should not,

64
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.580
it receives a signal to commit suicide.
A pop ptosis.

65
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.780
If DNA is damaged and attempt is made to repair it,

66
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.910
but if the damage cannot be repaired,

67
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.580
then the cell receives a signal to kill itself.

68
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.150
Both of these responses are controlled by the tumor suppressor gene p 53 in

69
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:33.750
cancer biology,

70
00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:38.751
you hear a lot about p 53 one Crucell mutation on the weed of cancer is the one

71
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:43.590
that disables the response to a signal to commit suicide.

72
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.880
So here is a figure of a t cell in orange volunteer in a pop toci cells.

73
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.630
So that t-cell has received a signal that the DNA in this,

74
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.970
a pop toasting cell is defective and cannot be repaired and it's giving it a

75
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:05.350
signal to commit suicide.
Cancer ignores that signal.

76
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.220
So where do the somatic mutations come from?
Well,

77
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:15.130
some of it's bad luck for mistakes.

78
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:17.620
During the duplication of the genome and cell division.

79
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.520
Every time a cell divides about 3 billion nucleotides have to be copied and no

80
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:24.780
copying processes.

81
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.790
Perfect evolution has also adjusted the mutation rate longterm to be low but non

82
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.171
zero.

83
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:37.171
It's about 10 to the minus ninth per nucleotide per cell division about one in a

84
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:42.421
billion probability that a single nucleotide at a specific site will mutate in a

85
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.014
soul division.

86
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.860
Somatic mutations can be increased by exposure to environmental mutagens like

87
00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:54.200
ultraviolet light or tobacco smoke.

88
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.190
There were free that are

89
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.890
<v 1>released during inflammation,
protons,</v>

90
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.780
so inflammation can actually cause somatic mutation.

91
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.330
In most cases.
Chronic exposure is much worse than acute exposure.

92
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.660
So something like a longterm helicobacter pylori infection in the gut in the

93
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.160
stomach,
which is making stomach ulcers is going to provide,

94
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.990
provide chronic exposure,
a lot of inflammation,

95
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.120
and that can then lead to somatic mutation causing gastric cancer.

96
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.580
<v 0>Inactivation of a DNA repair gene like p 53 greatly increases the mutation rate.</v>

97
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.480
Now are there really genes that are for cancer?
Well,

98
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:46.510
there aren't really any genes that are designed to produce cancer.

99
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.070
There are genes mutations in which can lead to cancer.

100
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.010
Most genes for cancer actually functioned in early embryogenesis.

101
00:06:57.011 --> 00:07:00.370
They mediate cell migration,
cell adhesion,
induction,

102
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.550
clonal proliferation,
other normal functions.

103
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.890
They are healthy genes that are turned off during terminal differentiation of

104
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:09.724
tissue.

105
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.220
It is carcinogenic mutations that disturb the epigenetic controls on these jeans

106
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.840
that release normal cell functions at developmentally inappropriate points.

107
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.460
So these genes are examples of antagonistic fly tropey if natural selection

108
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.850
where to protect us from cancer by eliminating these genes,

109
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:38.380
which all have useful functions in early embryogenesis than early development

110
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:39.214
would fail.

111
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.760
Instead selection has reinforced controls and provided mechanisms to detect and

112
00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:49.450
correct or eliminate cells that have precancerous mutation.

113
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.403
<v 1>Yes,</v>

114
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.640
<v 0>so heritable dis a predisposition to cancer often involves a heritable</v>

115
00:07:56.741 --> 00:08:00.250
deficiency in these control and surveillance mechanisms.

116
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.400
We should also recognize that not all somatic mutations are equally dangerous.

117
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.670
About 1% of the genes in the genome.

118
00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:17.671
That's about 350 are involved in producing cancer in oncogenesis.

119
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.420
It is usually mutations in stem cells,

120
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:25.480
not in differentiated tissue that produce cancer

121
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.730
mutations that occur early in development or the most important because they

122
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:35.731
present have the chance to produce a lineage of many cells within which other

123
00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:38.140
mutations can then accumulate

124
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.090
each cell lineage in the body then develops a unique history with more than 10

125
00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:49.750
to the 16th cells per individual per lifetime.

126
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.380
The cell lineage history within each of us is larger than the history of all of

127
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:57.540
the individual humans who have ever lived.

128
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.120
So we have to recognize that the number of cell division events going on and

129
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:08.121
producing an individual human is enormous and carries with it enormous

130
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.560
opportunity for somatic mutation.

131
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.050
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

132
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.330
<v 0>that's important because cancer is a numbers game.</v>

133
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.580
Cancer's result when a series of somatic mutations accumulate and there are a

134
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:27.630
lot of somatic mutations during development.

135
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:32.340
The single celled Zygote expands to about 10 to the 13th the 10 to the 14th

136
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:33.174
cells.

137
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.470
That requires about the same total number of cell divisions.

138
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.380
The somatic mutation rate per gene per cell division is about 10 to the minus

139
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:47.940
seventh or 10 to the minus sixth and if we put those numbers together,

140
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.750
the number of total somatic mutation events per gene per gene per individual is

141
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:57.450
about 10 to the six to 10 to the eighth

142
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.130
every gene in the genome you Tate's many times in the Soma of every individual.

143
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.250
That's a rather frightening conclusion,

144
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:13.251
but it comes inevitably from some pretty simple arithmetic.

145
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.450
So why are some tissues more susceptible to cancer than to others?

146
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.400
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

147
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.450
<v 0>the epithelium and lungs and skin is more exposed to carcinogens in the</v>

148
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:28.230
environment than our other tissues in general.

149
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.580
Cancer is lot more likely in mitotically active tissues for each round of

150
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.220
mytosis is an opportunity for mutation.

151
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:40.221
So we see more cancers in the hematopoietic cells,

152
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.990
the Leukemias and Lymphomas,

153
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:47.991
which are coming from lineages of immune cells than we do in red blood cell

154
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:49.824
cancers.

155
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.200
We see endometrial cancer but not Fallopian tube cancer because the endometrium

156
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.780
is dividing with each menstrual cycle.

157
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.810
We see cancer's a secretory tissues in gut,
breast,
cervix,
prostate and so forth,

158
00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:08.340
but not in the smooth muscle of the gut or in the smooth muscle of the

159
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:09.270
reproductive system.

160
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.020
Children are much more susceptible to brain and bone cancers than adults because

161
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:19.350
those tissues are growing rapidly in shoulder with many cell divisions.

162
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.040
But they are not divided.
They are not growing actively in adults,

163
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.720
which do not have very many cells that are dividing in their brain and in their

164
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:28.554
bone.

165
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:30.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.520
<v 0>Oh.
When cancers do appear in non mitotically active tissues,</v>

167
00:11:34.521 --> 00:11:39.350
they are likely to be secondary sites resulting from metastasis from primary

168
00:11:39.351 --> 00:11:43.240
tumor.
So to summarize,

169
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.380
we age is a byproduct of selection for reproduction and that means that

170
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:54.190
maintenance has been neglected in order organisms for good reasons to support

171
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.220
earlier in life,
better reproductive performance.

172
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:58.720
<v 1>Okay,</v>

173
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.940
<v 0>we need stem cells to maintain our tissues,</v>

174
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:05.610
but mutations in stem cells can add two characteristics that predisposed stem

175
00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:07.600
cells to become cancerous.

176
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.560
So if a stem cell turns on some of its capacities at inappropriate times and

177
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:17.980
places,
it can easily become cancerous.

178
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.200
<v 1>Okay?</v>

179
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.200
<v 0>We do need a modest mutation rate to maintain evolution.</v>

180
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.680
And the opportunities then for somatic mutation are immense.

181
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.010
So even though the mutation rate has been adjusted down to 10 to the minus ninth

182
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:36.760
per nucleotide per cell division,
which is the low rate needed by evolution,

183
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.120
the number of cell divisions in somatic development is so great that there are

184
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.500
millions of somatic mutations.

185
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.660
<v 1>Okay?</v>

186
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.230
<v 0>We need cell functions early in development that would be cancerous later in</v>

187
00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:52.270
development if not properly controlled.

188
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:56.500
And so if there are mutations to the control systems,
cancer can develop,

189
00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.180
<v 1>okay?</v>

190
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.860
<v 0>Humans are especially vulnerable because we have a long post reproductive
period.</v>

191
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.240
And because we are exposed to novel risk factors and we have an unusual

192
00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:08.074
sexuality.

193
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:09.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.540
<v 0>The bottom line is that we trade vulnerability to cancer for valuable benefits,</v>

195
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.210
reproduction,
tissue maintenance,

196
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.330
evolve ability development and sexuality.
