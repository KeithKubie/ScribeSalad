00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.170
My name is Ginny Foos. I am honored to be

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.120
here and it actually brings back, some really great memories. When

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.820
I was ten hmm, I was on a television show

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.750
outside of WGBH in Boston which is were I grew up.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.890
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.850
&gt;&gt; And I was one of five finalists, that had disabilities and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.010
we filmed for two years and it was a real coming of age experience

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.436
for me because we were asked to sit on very hot sets. talking about, how do you

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.980
feel about being different? How do you feel

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.800
about being teased? And not only was I saving

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.310
in psychological costs, I didn't have to see

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.360
a shrink, I was actually being paid for talking

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.950
about my feelings. And I really bonded with

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.330
the other four individuals, and it was really neat.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.970
&gt;&gt; How old were you when you,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.790
sort of, noticed, yourself, that you were different from

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.700
other people, and maybe when your parents also noticed this?

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.060
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question. my parents were given the diagnosis

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.850
when I was 18 months old and they wonder to this day

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.350
whether or not it was a delayed diagnosis that no one had

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.496
the heart to break it to them. now this was pre-DNA testing.

00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:14.080
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.260
&gt;&gt; This was all based on x-rays and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.550
femur length. Femur is really what they go for in

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.920
measuring the femur length. and there we were sitting at

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.030
Boston, one of the top medical communities in the country

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.765
and the gentleman that gave my parents the diagnosis was

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:32.870
[UNKNOWN],

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.800
who was sort the Dr. Spock, not the Sci-Fi Dr. Spock but sort of the,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.100
the paediatric voice of America in the 70s. And so I love to tell people that I

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.700
was diagnosed by that man myself, so they knew when I was 18 months old. I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.640
think many little people like myself do not

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.450
come to their own realization until they're in school.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.543
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:58.020
&gt;&gt; Because that's when the teasing really starts.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.190
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.370
&gt;&gt; And the accessibility if you will, especially back then.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.810
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.700
&gt;&gt; You know we're talking about the 70s there wasn't any Americans with

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.770
Disability Act. So that's when I was having to struggle to, to access

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.110
what my fellow students were accessing. So, I think the word has finally

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.250
gotten out what the correct terminology is, but just in case let me educate

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.250
you on that. The, when, when Little People of America was first formed in 1957,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.490
the name was actually Midgets of America it was primarily a, a venue for enter,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.830
entertainers. and they kind of made light of their union, for lack of a better

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.380
word, well then slowly, educated, serious people started

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.510
joining the group and one of the first

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.160
tasks I had was to get rid of the word midget. Now, what's wrong with the word

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.570
midget? for me, and many others, it conjures up the image of, Vaudeville

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.810
when they were called midget performers and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.860
they would go around, much like a travelling

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.560
circus. And they would get on stage, and

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.540
you would see a...a little person like myself,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.330
with a cigar hanging out of their mouth, and a diaper on.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.811
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:21.190
&gt;&gt; And making total fools of themselves. So when

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.400
I hear the word midget, that's what I conjure

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.790
up in my mind, as, as do many in

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.190
our organization so I think the word is finally dying.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.950
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.520
&gt;&gt; occasionally it will be used in

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.190
hockey leagues it's still used up in Canada,

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.900
signifying the younger kids, I think. And, and I,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.870
I think the little people group up there has been

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.970
really working on that. so, the terminology that I'm

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.240
comfortable with long winded answer is I'm comfortable with little

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.780
person and I'm comfortable with dwarf because that's what

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.810
I was raised with. Now that's not to say that

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.850
my children, and they're okay with that, too but maybe

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.290
my grandchildren will have come up with a new term.
