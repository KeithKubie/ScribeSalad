00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,280
Hi Jocko and echo. I recently
read the book marine,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,630
the life of chesty puller and in the book
chesty references and the unnecessary

3
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:11,800
loads of administrative paperwork that
was required to be prepared for the

4
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:15,580
military. I also recently member
on it on a recent podcast,

5
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:20,581
you recalling a situation in Ramadi where
your platoon leaders were not thrilled

6
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,840
to fill out required paperwork.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,270
I'm a squad sergeant in a prominent
American police department and I'm

8
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,160
experiencing the same dilemma.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,610
The micromanaging and
oversight is extreme and I'm,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,540
and it's taken a toll on the
morale of the officer's citywide.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,810
The tedious paperwork and
constant micro-managing is
preventing good cups from

12
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:46,690
being proactive. I feel
like the job, quote unquote,

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,450
has changed beyond recognition.

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,830
I'd appreciate your advice on how
to approach the bullshit paperwork

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,530
and increase the morale of my
cops. Thank you for your time.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,070
Okay, so what would I do
in this situation? Um,

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,690
first of all, I am going to
be awesome at the paperwork.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to do it so well that,
because if you blow off the paperwork,

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,270
then you go to your boss and say the
paperwork sucks. And it's not any good.

20
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,190
The guy looks at you and
says, Oh, you know what?

21
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,890
You don't even know how to do the
paperwork. How do you know if,

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,170
how do you know if it's hard or not?
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do,

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,930
I'm gonna Start building a case.
That's what I'm going to do.

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,520
So I'm going to do the paperwork.

25
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,910
I'm actually going to log down how
many hours I put into the paperwork.

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm going to follow that paperwork and
see where it goes and see if anyone

27
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,780
actually reads it, right? Cause if
I can go to my boss and say, Hey,

28
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:44,781
I spent 28 hours a week filing this
paperwork and know not one single person

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:46,860
read it.

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,980
And then you take the manpower of everyone
in the department and then what you

31
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:52,920
do is you actually build a case.
When you go in to talk to the boss,

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,950
you should have a full magazine of
ammunition to combat this paperwork that

33
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,590
you're being forced to do.

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,070
You have to be able to explain it to
them in a rational, logical manner.

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,570
And you can't.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,680
You can't make any headway against your
boss if you are trying to fight from the

37
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,334
low ground.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,810
The low ground is why don't really turn
in the paperwork and I don't really do

39
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,060
the paperwork and I think
the paperwork is crap.

40
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,580
Then they're looking down on
you. What are you talking about?

41
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,070
How are you dare you say
that you don't even do it.

42
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,430
You don't even know what you're doing.
You got to get on the high ground.

43
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,200
How do you get on the high ground?

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,410
You get all that stuff done
to the best of your ability.

45
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,450
You logged down the hours it takes.

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,210
You get your whole little team doing it
and you tell your whole team, hey look,

47
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,660
I know this is painful right
now. Everyone in this squad,

48
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,210
everyone in this platoon
is gonna do all this.

49
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:49,080
We're going to log down what it takes
because I am going to bring a solid case

50
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,520
up the chain of command of where
we need to limit this paperwork.

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,100
This is a long war situation.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,470
You know how long it took to build
up all that paperwork? It took years.

53
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,710
It took 20 years, 30
years for that to happen.

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,390
I used to joke about the marines,
the navy seal teams, the range,

55
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,550
our range procedures are super loose.

56
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:13,660
We go out there and we shoot like crazy
and do all kinds of really dynamic

57
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,930
things and we'd sometimes
go to a Marine Corps range.

58
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,860
It was like everything was super tight
and I would tell my guys, I'd say,

59
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,120
look, that's because that happened
over years. One mistake happens.

60
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,890
How do you stop that mistake
from happening again?

61
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,680
Put a rule in place that stops
it. Another mistakes happen,

62
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,100
another mistake happens. Put another
rule in place. Another mistake happens.

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,500
Put a p a piece of paper to
stop it from happening again.

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,740
And eventually you end up with a
range that's barely even usable.

65
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,050
So that's what happened
in this department.

66
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,220
There was little things that happened
over time and they built and they build

67
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,810
upon themselves and the
next thing you know,

68
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:51,220
you can't even recognize what your
actual job was. So we have to,

69
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,380
it's so that took 20 years to happen.

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
You're not going to undo it overnight
and you're definitely not gonna undo it

71
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,630
from the low ground. You
have to get the high ground.

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,490
You have to be a performer.
If you're not a performer,

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,470
you have no say, do your job, do it well,

74
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,430
fight the long war.
