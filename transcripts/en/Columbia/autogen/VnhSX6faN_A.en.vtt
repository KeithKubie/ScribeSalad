puzzles I'm going to talk about three in
particular the first puzzle actually

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469
particular the first puzzle actually
 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.270
particular the first puzzle actually
speaks to this this is this issue of

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280
speaks to this this is this issue of
 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.520
speaks to this this is this issue of
whether or not energy wealth per se

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
whether or not energy wealth per se
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.360
whether or not energy wealth per se
would allow us to predict right what the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370
would allow us to predict right what the
 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.710
would allow us to predict right what the
what the economic performance was going

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720

you know energy development strategies
at the domestic level because we thought

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
at the domestic level because we thought
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.800
at the domestic level because we thought
we knew the answer but the reason we

rather from economic crises they just

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910
rather from economic crises they just
 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.909
rather from economic crises they just
can't recover from economic crises right

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919
can't recover from economic crises right
 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.920
can't recover from economic crises right
because they're so vested in spending

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930
because they're so vested in spending
 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.870
because they're so vested in spending
they can't stop spending there so

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880
they can't stop spending there so
 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.460
they can't stop spending there so
heavily indebted that they just get more

out of crisis they also have

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220
out of crisis they also have
 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.950
out of crisis they also have
institutional weakness right so that's

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960
institutional weakness right so that's
 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.879
institutional weakness right so that's
another problem that can address

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889
another problem that can address
 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.030
another problem that can address
economic crises but you see after the

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040
economic crises but you see after the
 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.470
economic crises but you see after the
two thousand most the most recent

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480
two thousand most the most recent
 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.090
two thousand most the most recent
financial crisis of 2008 global

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100
financial crisis of 2008 global
 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.740
financial crisis of 2008 global
financial crisis actually had fairly

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750
financial crisis actually had fairly
 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.170
financial crisis actually had fairly
quick recovery rates particularly in

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180
quick recovery rates particularly in
 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.210
quick recovery rates particularly in
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan I would

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan I would
 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.409
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan I would
contrast this for example with

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419
contrast this for example with
 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:19.940
contrast this for example with
Azerbaijan which we can talk about later

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950
Azerbaijan which we can talk about later
 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.700
Azerbaijan which we can talk about later
but you have these um rather quick

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710
but you have these um rather quick
 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.500
but you have these um rather quick
recovery rates in Kazakhstan which has

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510
recovery rates in Kazakhstan which has
 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.810
recovery rates in Kazakhstan which has
avoided recession is actually bounced

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820
avoided recession is actually bounced
 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.780
avoided recession is actually bounced
back in 2009 and continues to grow in

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:29.790
back in 2009 and continues to grow in
 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.610
back in 2009 and continues to grow in
2010 and you have this becca stano's

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620
2010 and you have this becca stano's
 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.409
2010 and you have this becca stano's
virtually avoided a crisis and of course

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419
virtually avoided a crisis and of course
 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.520
virtually avoided a crisis and of course
most of you are thinking yeah that's

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.530
most of you are thinking yeah that's
 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.719
most of you are thinking yeah that's
because it never liberalised that was

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:35.729
because it never liberalised that was
 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:36.860
because it never liberalised that was
all it really wasn't connected to the

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870
all it really wasn't connected to the
 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.010
all it really wasn't connected to the
global economy sure okay fine but it's

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020
global economy sure okay fine but it's
 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.630
global economy sure okay fine but it's
also managed to continue to to grow

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:43.640
also managed to continue to to grow
 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.680
also managed to continue to to grow
quite a quite a large pace and to

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.690
quite a quite a large pace and to
 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.740
quite a quite a large pace and to
actually use the increase in its oil

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750
actually use the increase in its oil
 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.540
actually use the increase in its oil
exports and its oil production to offset

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:53.550
exports and its oil production to offset
 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.580

some of the non the decline in the non
 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.890
some of the non the decline in the non
energy side of things okay so I think

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900
energy side of things okay so I think
 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.090
energy side of things okay so I think
this is the sort of a third puzzle

00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.100
this is the sort of a third puzzle
 

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.550
this is the sort of a third puzzle
that's been overlooked by not taking

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560
that's been overlooked by not taking
 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.190
that's been overlooked by not taking
seriously the differences across the

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:04.200
seriously the differences across the
 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.420
seriously the differences across the
former Soviet the country is a

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:05.430
former Soviet the country is a
 

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.830
former Soviet the country is a

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840
particularly Central Asia and the
 

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.659
particularly Central Asia and the
energy-rich Central Asia and how

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:08.669
energy-rich Central Asia and how
 

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:11.330
energy-rich Central Asia and how
differently they've actually gone about

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340
differently they've actually gone about
 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.580
differently they've actually gone about
developing their energy sectors and the

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:13.590
developing their energy sectors and the
 

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.050
developing their energy sectors and the
different implications if that's had for

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060
different implications if that's had for
 

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.330
different implications if that's had for
their fiscal policies and hence their

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340
their fiscal policies and hence their
 

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.810
their fiscal policies and hence their
abilities to I think recover from

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:19.820
abilities to I think recover from
 

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.490
abilities to I think recover from
financial crisis right um why is this

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500
financial crisis right um why is this
 

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.379
financial crisis right um why is this
right and here's where my notes would be

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:27.389
right and here's where my notes would be
 

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:29.960
right and here's where my notes would be
really nice I'm going to try to sort of

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:29.970
really nice I'm going to try to sort of
 

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.060
really nice I'm going to try to sort of

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.070
distill a very complicated causal story
 

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.709
distill a very complicated causal story
into two basic points first the reason

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719
into two basic points first the reason
 

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.159
into two basic points first the reason
that Kazakhstan has been able to at some

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:40.169
that Kazakhstan has been able to at some
 

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.670
that Kazakhstan has been able to at some

with its current ownership structure
there's actually been a convergence

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:46.530
there's actually been a convergence
 

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.800
there's actually been a convergence
toward ownership structure ship

these these are differences as of 2005
 

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.420
these these are differences as of 2005
right after 2005 Kazakhstan actually

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:02.430
right after 2005 Kazakhstan actually
 

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.090
right after 2005 Kazakhstan actually
adopts s2 and so does Uzbekistan so

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100
adopts s2 and so does Uzbekistan so
 

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.350
adopts s2 and so does Uzbekistan so
they're both sort of converging to the

getting this distributive imperative
right that you get supposedly from the

the distribution of oil rents and so
 

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.890
the distribution of oil rents and so
it's done this very ostentatious way and

it's done this very ostentatious way and
 

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.870
it's done this very ostentatious way and

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.350
growth that's done a couple of things
one is that it's reduced societal

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360

and and so as I said I have mixed

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:46.310
and and so as I said I have mixed
 

00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:51.220

if it is a nonzero-sum if its value

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040
if it is a nonzero-sum if its value
 

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.210
if it is a nonzero-sum if its value
added might be a good thing but there's

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:58.220
added might be a good thing but there's
 

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.300
added might be a good thing but there's
also a possibility a great game is

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:01.310
also a possibility a great game is
 

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:05.440
also a possibility a great game is

otherwise would be a healthy situation
so there is a negative aspect to the

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:10.790
so there is a negative aspect to the
 

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.880
so there is a negative aspect to the
great game that he seems to me that we

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:12.890
great game that he seems to me that we
 

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:17.350

sort of there's these different outcomes
 

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.870
sort of there's these different outcomes
and effects that as I said Kazakhstan

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:55.880
and effects that as I said Kazakhstan
 

00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.280

their huge upfront payoffs in the form
 

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.020
their huge upfront payoffs in the form
of big royalties right so you can get a

but you get a huge upfront royalty in
the payoff of the licenses and so that's
