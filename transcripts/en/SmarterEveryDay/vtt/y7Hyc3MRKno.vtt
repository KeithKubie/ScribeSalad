00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:02.818
Hey, it's me Destin, welcome
back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:04.300
I love,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.133
laminar flow.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.977
And people send me tweets
about laminar flow,

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:08.498
all over the internet, its time to do,

00:00:08.498 --> 00:00:09.635
the laminar flow video.

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.310
Check this out, big pool.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.103
We're going to see if we can
make, laminar flow happen.

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:16.542
I should be able to poke
a hole, in this pool,

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:18.191
and get a glassy looking jet,

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:20.303
that comes out this pool.
That's what laminar flow is.

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:22.028
It's very orderly, looks like glass.

00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:24.079
Okay, so here we go, ready,

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.497
three, two, this feels so wrong.

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:29.377
Let's see if we get laminar flow,

00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:30.460
no, we don't.

00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:36.228
(laughs)

00:00:36.228 --> 00:00:37.697
Now I've got a hole in a pool.

00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:39.098
Okay, laminar flow is
a function of geometry,

00:00:39.098 --> 00:00:40.665
obviously I had the wrong geometry.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.794
We're going to try a
big spike, here we go.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.247
Oh golly.

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:46.638
Okay.
(Laughs)

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:47.471
Alright.

00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:50.280
No, it doesn't work.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:56.177
So my shape's not right.

00:00:56.177 --> 00:00:57.407
My shape's not right, what do I do.

00:00:57.407 --> 00:00:59.946
Work, work, work, work with me.

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:02.113
Ah, there we go, okay, so.

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:05.406
I got laminar flow right here,

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:09.074
and its going turbulent, right here.

00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:10.141
Why?

00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.515
Laminar flow is a function of
the geometry, the velocity,

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:13.544
and the kinematic viscosity,

00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:14.480
of the fluid that you're working with.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.795
Right now, my velocity,
is not fast enough,

00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:18.687
to have laminar flow, because
there's not enough pressure,

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:20.134
so if I move it down, I
should have more pressure.

00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:22.511
So, let's plug this back up,

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:25.231
well now I have a problem.

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.897
That's out.

00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:29.483
I'm doing a bad job of
explaining laminar flow,

00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:32.595
what we need to do, we need
to go, around the world,

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.632
to different places I've
observed laminar flow

00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:36.104
in the past several years.

00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:38.887
And we need to let me
show you, various things

00:01:38.887 --> 00:01:40.350
that I've seen along the way.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.256
Laminar flow is orderly, all
streamlines are parallel,

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:44.888
and there's no mixing of the flow.

00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:46.525
It's all like how you would imagine,

00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:47.759
water flowing through pipe,

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.590
everything is straight and parallel.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.137
Turbulent flow however, is chaotic,

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:53.679
there's pressure fluctuations throughout,

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.585
you get the idea.

00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:56.088
Engineers have this special term,

00:01:56.088 --> 00:01:57.252
called the Reynolds Number.

00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:59.232
To try and help predict,
what type of flow,

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:00.498
they might be dealing with.

00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:01.721
The top of the equation are the things

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.392
that describe the flow itself,

00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:06.534
like the velocity, the
density, the geometry, etc.

00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:09.343
But the bottom of the equation
is viscosity of the fluid.

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:12.135
Like how thick the fluid
is, like water vs honey.

00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:13.494
A lower Reynolds Number,

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:15.169
means that the flow is more laminar,

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.807
and in my opinion, more awesome.

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:19.711
But a high Reynolds Number
means that it's more turbulent.

00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:20.942
So if you look at the equation,

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:22.705
you can kinda see what's going on here.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.128
If you have more viscosity,

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:26.380
that means Reynolds Number gets smaller,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.807
therefore the flow is more laminar.

00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:30.535
But if you increase the
velocity of the flow,

00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:31.901
or the size of the flow,

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.184
Reynolds Number gets bigger,

00:02:33.184 --> 00:02:35.408
therefore you have more turbulent flow.

00:02:35.408 --> 00:02:38.281
If you keep Reynolds Number
and the mock number the same,

00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.072
you can make a model of
whatever you're trying to fly,

00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:44.259
and you can get a good idea
if turbulence or laminar flow

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:45.092
is going to happen over the model.

00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:47.362
That's exactly what they
did with the Saturn V,

00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:49.427
this is the big Saturn V right here.

00:02:49.427 --> 00:02:51.495
But in order to approximate
what was going to happen,

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:53.144
they made a wind tunnel model.

00:02:53.144 --> 00:02:54.594
You can use wind tunnel models,

00:02:54.594 --> 00:02:55.986
like this little four inch model.

00:02:55.986 --> 00:03:00.081
To approximate the flow, over
the entire, Saturn V rocket.

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:02.211
As flow comes through here,

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:04.025
and goes across this Apollo capsule,

00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:06.018
if the string flickers as turbulent flow,

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.295
if it's steady, it's laminar flow.

00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:09.665
Check this out.
(whirring)

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:11.969
So as we change the angle of attack,

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.096
you can see the different
types of flow, take place.

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:16.957
It's a little hard to see
it, with just the strings,

00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:18.992
but Sarah-Kate, who goes
to school with my daughter,

00:03:18.992 --> 00:03:21.232
made an awesome science fair project.

00:03:21.232 --> 00:03:22.298
You've got to see this.

00:03:22.298 --> 00:03:24.889
Okay, to demonstrate laminar
flow and turbulent flow,

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.202
this is Sarah-Kate, science
fair winner, extraordinaire.

00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:29.150
Right,
- yes sir.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.087
- [Destin] You going to
show us how it works?

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:32.012
So NASA Glenn Research Center,

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.815
and you just built it from the plans?

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:34.785
- Yes sir,

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:35.618
- [Destin] That's awesome.

00:03:35.618 --> 00:03:37.444
- [Sarah-Kate] I had parental
supervision and guidance.

00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:38.801
So you have to pick your scent.

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.676
- [Destin] Frankincense, dragons
blood, that's pretty legit.

00:03:41.676 --> 00:03:43.265
Orange, that's got to be good.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.793
That's a weird smell.

00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:48.460
- [Sarah-Kate] Okay,
now I'll blow them out.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.673
- [Destin] Okay, and so,

00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:52.421
that's going to make
the smoke come through,

00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.811
this pipe right here right?

00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:54.644
- [Sarah-Kate] Yep.

00:03:54.644 --> 00:03:56.139
Now I'll turn on the fan.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.221
(fan whirs)

00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.721
- [Destin] So got to get
the light correct, right?

00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:00.830
- [Sarah-Kate] Yep.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.910
- [Destin] Okay, so
that's pulling it through,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.206
should we be able to see it, yet?

00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:05.775
- [Sarah-Kate] Yeah,
you can already see it.

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:07.559
- [Destin] You can already
see, oh what the heck.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:08.642
You sure can,

00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:10.904
look at that.

00:04:12.032 --> 00:04:14.790
Oh that's cool, look at that.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.871
Okay, cool, so, laminar flow,

00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:20.165
are the straight lines
that go across, correct?

00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.181
- [Sarah-Kate] Yep.

00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:22.973
- [Destin] So that's a
zero angle of attack?

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:24.077
- [Sarah-Kate] Yes.

00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:27.130
- [Destin] So give me a
real high angle of attack.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.845
There you go, look at that.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:31.117
So we're getting flow separation,

00:04:31.117 --> 00:04:32.335
along the backside here,

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:34.598
and we're getting turbulence
back in here right?

00:04:34.598 --> 00:04:36.431
- [Sarah-Kate] Mm hmm.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.836
Let's see.

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:39.669
- [Destin] This is like

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.335
the coolest science fair
project you've ever done?

00:04:41.335 --> 00:04:42.399
- [Sarah-Kate] It's the
only science fair project

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.349
I've ever done.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.011
(laughs)

00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:46.994
- [Destin] Look at that
turbulence back there.

00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:49.617
So ultimately, what were
you trying to learn here?

00:04:49.617 --> 00:04:51.788
- [Sarah-Kate] Basically,
I was just trying to learn

00:04:51.788 --> 00:04:55.602
more about, airflow shapes,
and flow separation, and stall.

00:04:55.602 --> 00:04:58.979
And make a good visual
representation of all those things.

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.786
- [Destin] Well I think
you accomplished that.

00:05:00.786 --> 00:05:02.515
Look, man, look a it from
this angle right here.

00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:06.579
You can see, you can see
the separation back there.

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:08.119
Look at that.

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:10.380
That's a really good angle.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.748
This is an awesome experiment.

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:13.534
Are you going, you're going
to regionals now right?

00:05:13.534 --> 00:05:14.436
- [Sarah-Kate] Yes sir.

00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:15.487
- [Destin] You're going to win.

00:05:15.487 --> 00:05:16.320
Do it.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.884
If you've ever been to
the Detroit airport,

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.660
there's an awesome fountain,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.738
like right in the middle of
the whole concourse area.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.764
And you can see laminar flow in action,

00:05:23.764 --> 00:05:25.554
programmed with computers.

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:26.829
- [Destin] It's the awseomest fountain,

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:28.496
let's go look at it.

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:33.665
What do you call this flow?

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.144
That flow right there.

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:36.376
- Laminar flow.

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:38.269
- [Destin] What's it called?
- Laminar flow.

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:39.204
- [Destin] Laminar flow,

00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:41.755
some daddies don't teach their
kids cool words like this.

00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:44.005
- Oh, I already know alias.

00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:45.896
- [Destin] Yeah?

00:05:45.896 --> 00:05:46.899
- And all that other stuff.

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.330
- [Destin] You don't appreciate this.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.163
- I do.

00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:53.723
- [Destin] You just don't, you
just don't appreciate, what.

00:05:53.723 --> 00:05:56.973
You just don't appreciate laminar flow.

00:05:58.675 --> 00:05:59.617
Let's go.

00:05:59.617 --> 00:06:01.773
(phone buzzes)

00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:03.027
Dude.

00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:04.109
Did you get the funnel?

00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:06.903
Yep, alright, so here we go.

00:06:06.903 --> 00:06:07.787
Thank you.

00:06:07.787 --> 00:06:09.669
Ow my finger.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.355
Okay there we go.

00:06:11.355 --> 00:06:13.078
This is a Go-Pro right?

00:06:13.078 --> 00:06:14.669
So what's happening is,

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.773
the flow is going into the funnel,

00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:19.445
and as the flow goes in there.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:22.727
All of the streamlines of
the water, are lining up.

00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:24.381
And so its flowing parallel right,

00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.869
once you get all the flow
going in one direction.

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:30.227
You can divert the laminar
flow, and the streamlines,

00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:32.055
stay in the same orientation.

00:06:32.055 --> 00:06:34.099
So look, you can start
to make things like,

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:36.144
sheets you see that?

00:06:36.144 --> 00:06:37.227
Look at that.

00:06:39.652 --> 00:06:40.735
It's working.

00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:46.076
That's got ridges on it.

00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:48.076
(gasps)

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.845
Okay, look at this, so if you get

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:53.154
all the laminar flow
going in one direction.

00:06:53.154 --> 00:06:53.987
You can put things that,

00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.487
look at that it made a bubble.

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:03.083
Okay, you can make a sheet,
like a sphere, of laminar flow.

00:07:03.993 --> 00:07:06.257
Okay, so there's a really
cool children museum,

00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:08.666
in Chattanooga, that I found this,

00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:10.883
and I put my phone up under it.

00:07:10.883 --> 00:07:14.383
Look at that, I could put my head in that.

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:18.093
That is beautiful.

00:07:18.093 --> 00:07:21.926
This is probably my
favorite kind of fountain.

00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:24.625
And the cool thing about it,

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.620
is the flow rate at the
center has to be high enough,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.685
so that, it's glassy,

00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:32.150
like you have enough flow
to make a complete covering.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.429
But it's not too high,

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:37.086
where you go turbulent at
this location right here.

00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:38.010
Right there.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.920
See it's wanting to go
turbulent, but it's not.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.619
And as, the water, drops off.

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:47.015
There's enough volumetric flow,
to cover and make it glassy,

00:07:47.015 --> 00:07:48.432
360 degrees here.

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:51.619
Which is awesome.

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:54.198
So what I'm going to do,
is put my phone in there,

00:07:54.198 --> 00:07:56.822
and see if we can see
through the laminar flow.

00:07:56.822 --> 00:07:58.080
Let's see if it's smooth enough.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.913
Okay, you ready?

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:00.236
Another thing I like to think about,

00:08:00.236 --> 00:08:01.900
is the inverse square law,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.141
and the flow rate as it comes out.

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:04.641
Anyway here we go.

00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:17.154
(muffled water flowing)

00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:26.697
That works doesn't it?

00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:30.491
So the next question is, can you hear me?

00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:32.729
So it's totally engulfed with water,

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:33.917
I don't know if you can here me or not,

00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:36.861
but the microphone is probably
full of water at this point,

00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:38.444
but let's try this.

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:41.749
Can you hear me better now?

00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:45.001
I like this a lot.

00:08:47.063 --> 00:08:49.730
(water flowing)

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:00.747
I like that a lot, okay.

00:09:00.747 --> 00:09:03.889
It's really fun, when you're
30 something years old,

00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:05.352
and you have to wait
for the two year olds.

00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:07.465
So you can do you're
little fluid experiment.

00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:10.350
I love laminar flow, and
I want you to love it too.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.434
Prince Rupert, you're in my light, move.

00:09:12.434 --> 00:09:13.490
Thank you.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.722
Okay, so, the thing that
I think is so neat here,

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.778
is if you think about
the volumetric flow rate,

00:09:18.778 --> 00:09:20.311
if it's not enough,

00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:22.178
you don't have water go
all the way to the bottom.

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:23.736
You see how it's breaking up here.

00:09:23.736 --> 00:09:28.736
But, if you control all of
these variables, perfectly,

00:09:28.897 --> 00:09:32.481
you can make a fountain
do exactly what you want.

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:33.526
This is beautiful.

00:09:33.526 --> 00:09:36.501
I really respect people that
design fountains like this,

00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:38.477
because it has to do with flow rate,

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:41.166
has to do with, pressure,

00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:42.563
the nozzle geometry.

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.256
Anything, can disturb, the flow.

00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:47.922
- [Destin] It's amazing
watch, touch it, come here.

00:09:47.922 --> 00:09:49.112
- [Woman] Oh, it's shot, it's up,

00:09:49.112 --> 00:09:50.507
are we going to go up, and then down?

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:51.996
- [Destin] Yeah, touch it, touch it.

00:09:51.996 --> 00:09:52.977
- Are we allowed to touch this?

00:09:52.977 --> 00:09:55.560
- [Destin] Well we're doing it.

00:09:58.206 --> 00:10:00.456
Ah that's so stinking cool,

00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:02.421
I love it.

00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:03.857
You know why I love it?

00:10:03.857 --> 00:10:04.795
Laminar flow.

00:10:04.795 --> 00:10:06.361
Can you imagine they had
to perfectly level this,

00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:08.611
because that's gravity fed.

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:11.631
And then you have to make sure the flow,

00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:14.631
into the orifice there, is perfectly

00:10:15.619 --> 00:10:16.616
perfectly level.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.199
All the way across, oh my gosh.

00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:24.316
This mall in Chicago wins,
for the coolest fountain.

00:10:24.316 --> 00:10:25.851
And probably the number one reason,

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:27.871
why I want you to love laminar flow,

00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:29.586
and this is not an exaggeration.

00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:33.151
We literally use laminar
flow to protect the integrity

00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:34.370
of the moon rocks.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.154
And that is not an exaggeration.

00:10:36.154 --> 00:10:39.201
So, I'm about to show you
a clip of how that works,

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.544
and if you would like to consider

00:10:40.544 --> 00:10:42.718
subscribing to Smarter Every
Day, while we watch this,

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:44.405
this from a future episode.

00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:46.399
- Now that we're dressed
in our bunny suits,

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.829
we're going to go into our air shower,

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:49.609
and we stay in there for one minute.

00:10:49.609 --> 00:10:52.227
And it's a laminar flow,

00:10:52.227 --> 00:10:53.536
- [Destin] You have no idea how much,

00:10:53.536 --> 00:10:54.629
- it separates between a less
clean area, and a clean area.

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:56.459
- [Destin] You have no idea
how much I like laminar flow.

00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:57.292
(laughs)

00:10:57.292 --> 00:10:58.125
- [Destin] You don't even know,

00:10:58.125 --> 00:10:58.958
I can't even explain it to you.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.391
- You really love it don't you.

00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.641
(laughs)
- [Destin] I do.

00:11:01.641 --> 00:11:02.733
So here we go.

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:03.981
Laminar flow.

00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:06.605
Is this going to make our hair fly around?

00:11:06.605 --> 00:11:07.941
- No, it's not that kind.

00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.852
- It's just really slow laminar flow.

00:11:09.852 --> 00:11:11.893
- In the meteorite lab, they
have the little tunnels,

00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:13.892
that actually would make your hair flow,

00:11:13.892 --> 00:11:16.133
they found that stirred up more particles.

00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.181
So this was designed,

00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:18.501
- Turbulence was bad.
- Exactly, yes.

00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:19.457
- That's why this is laminar.

00:11:19.457 --> 00:11:21.096
- Laminar good, turbulence, bad.

00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:24.275
- Got it, I dig it, I like laminar flow.

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:25.400
- That's our minute up.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.233
- Is our minute up?
- Yes.

00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:27.066
- [Destin] Our microwave is done.

00:11:27.066 --> 00:11:28.357
- [Andrea] So watch your step down.

00:11:28.357 --> 00:11:30.357
- I'm watching it, boom.

00:11:31.613 --> 00:11:32.696
Wow, alright.

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:35.638
Okay, I hope you enjoyed this video,

00:11:35.638 --> 00:11:37.710
I'm going to do what's
called, the soft sell.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.950
I'm just going to give an option to you.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.135
You can either take it or leave it.

00:11:40.135 --> 00:11:41.696
I like exploring the world,

00:11:41.696 --> 00:11:43.089
using goofy stuff like this.

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:44.359
And I film stuff all over the world,

00:11:44.359 --> 00:11:46.721
and I throw it together
in videos like this.

00:11:46.721 --> 00:11:48.366

Thank you to everyone,

00:12:09.573 --> 00:12:12.762
who sends me laminar
flow pictures on twitter.

00:12:12.762 --> 00:12:14.353
I really enjoy them.

00:12:14.353 --> 00:12:17.607
I am Destin, this week, this
video is sponsored by tacos.

00:12:17.607 --> 00:12:20.193
I hope you enjoy that
too, have a good one, bye.

00:12:20.193 --> 00:12:21.633
- [Destin] What are you doing?

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:22.636
- Making tacos.

00:12:22.636 --> 00:12:24.274
- Making tacos.

00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:25.878
This episode of Smarter Every Day,

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:26.859
is sponsored by Hello Fresh.

00:12:26.859 --> 00:12:28.344
Which is a meal kit delivery service,

00:12:28.344 --> 00:12:29.605
which we use at the Sandlin house,

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:32.858
to cook meals and eat around
the table as a family.

00:12:32.858 --> 00:12:34.443
They send food to your house,

00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:37.932
and you can just cook per the
recipe, which is enclosed.

00:12:37.932 --> 00:12:40.277
They have premeasured
ingredients, it's a great thing.

00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:41.273
The reason we like it,

00:12:41.273 --> 00:12:42.721
is because it makes everything simple,

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:44.869
and how we do life, in the evenings.

00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:46.997
And it let's us eat yummy food.

00:12:46.997 --> 00:12:48.299
- [Destin] How do you
know when they're done?

00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:49.756
- Timer.

00:12:49.756 --> 00:12:52.492
(laughs)

00:12:52.492 --> 00:12:54.993
- So if you want to try
this, I highly recommend it.

00:12:54.993 --> 00:12:56.048
We love it.

00:12:56.048 --> 00:12:58.456

00:13:14.077 --> 00:13:15.718
Come look at these tacos.

00:13:15.718 --> 00:13:16.711
- [Destin] So am I at a taco truck?

00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:17.544
- [Boy] Yep.

00:13:17.544 --> 00:13:18.377
- [Destin] Nice.

00:13:18.377 --> 00:13:19.481
Thanks for making me tacos.

00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:20.376
- You're welcome.

00:13:20.376 --> 00:13:22.345
- [Destin] Would you rather
have tacos or a haircut?

00:13:22.345 --> 00:13:23.257
- Tacos.

00:13:23.257 --> 00:13:24.790
(laughs)

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.859
- [Destin] Will you get a haircut anyway?

00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:26.692
- Yeah.

00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:27.525
- [Destin] Okay.

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:28.963
So it works out to about 6.99 a serving,

00:13:28.963 --> 00:13:29.914
which is a really good deal.

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:32.381

00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:39.531
Bye.

00:13:39.531 --> 00:13:40.702
If you're mom doesn't love laminar flow,

00:13:40.702 --> 00:13:41.748
your mom is wrong.

00:13:41.748 --> 00:13:43.339
(laughs)

00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:46.735
There's only one thing
left to do, the taste test.

00:13:46.735 --> 00:13:49.088
(laughs)

00:13:49.088 --> 00:13:51.569
That was laminar flow.

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:54.152
Let's taste turbulent flow now.

00:13:56.595 --> 00:13:57.618
Yeah laminar flow is better.

00:13:57.618 --> 00:13:59.701
(laughs)
