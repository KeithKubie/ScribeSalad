00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome to the
African and Middle East Division.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.680
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.950
I'm Chief of the division and I'm
really happy to see you all here

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.030
and I'm happy that we're
having this presentation

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.230
with the genealogist
Daniel Horowitz.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.450
This big section is cosponsored
with the Jewish Genealogy Society

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.680
of Greater Washington and we thank
the society and its President,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.420
Dr. Alpert and its members
for their cosponsorship

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.790
and their continuous
interest in our division.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.520
In fact, last year the Genealogy
Society was also here in May 2016.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.980
It was also there for the program
on The Blumenthal's of the Upper

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.030
and Lower Peninsula of Michigan,
so we had a program that sort

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.400
of preceded you in doing this.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.590
As most of you already
know, our division is made

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.690
up of three sections, the
African, the Middle Eastern,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.540 position:56%
and the Hebraic section and we cover
responsibilities for the collections

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.770
from 78 different countries
in Africa, the Middle East,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.570
Central Asia, the [inaudible]
we go off almost to China

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.650
and sometimes depending on
the collections we represent.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.600
We also invite scholars and
experts who have researched

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.570 position:56%
and done work here at the library or
elsewhere and who are knowledgeable

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.390
about areas that we know more
generally about and they know more

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.770
about as experts themselves.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.690
Genealogy of course, is of great
importance here at the library.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.590
We actually have a whole
division that deals

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.670
with local history and genealogy.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.650
The library's genealogy
collection began as early as 1815,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.850
with the purchase of
Thomas Jefferson's library.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.640
Our digitized materials
on US history for example,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.980
include first person accounts
of 19th century California,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.770 position:56%
the upper Midwest from 1820 to 1910,
the Chesapeake Bay area from 1600

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.540
to 1925, and other resources
for genealogy research.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.020
We also have bibliographies,
and guides, and local history

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.330
in genealogy and we have programs

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.690
such as this one that
focus on genealogy.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.220
And so now, our very
own Sharon Horowitz,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.740
no relation I've been told,
the Senior Reference Librarian

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.000
in the Hebraic Section,
will introduce Mr. Horowitz

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.050
and the program, after which
you will be enlightened on how

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.590
to research here at the library

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.320
and Dr. Alpert will
also say a few words,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.460
but first let me call
on Sharon Horowitz.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.760
Thank you.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mary-Jane.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.270
Welcome to the African and
Middle Eastern Reading Room.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.020
On behalf of the Jewish Genealogy
Society of Greater Washington

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.250
and the Hebraic Section, let
me thank you all for coming

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.200
to today's program in celebration
of Jewish American Heritage Month.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.170
As you heard, I'm Sharon Horowitz

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.270
and I'm Reference Librarian
in the Hebraic Section.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.170
The Hebraic Section marks it's
beginning in 1912, with the receipt

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.620 position:56%
of 10,000 Hebrew books and pamphlets
whose purchase was made possible

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.100
by a gift from New York
philanthropist Jacob Schiff.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.730
From those humble beginnings,
our collections have grown

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.880
to around 250,000 items in Hebrew,
Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Persian

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.200
and other Hebraic script languages.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.890 position:56%
The Hebraic Section also includes an
important collection of books in Gz,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.750
Amharic and Tigrinya, the languages
of Ethiopia past and present.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.420
Our section's holdings
are particularly strong

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.120
in the subject areas of Bible and
Rabbinic, liturgy, Hebrew language

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.150
and literature, Responsa
and Jewish history.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.620 position:56%
Two of our missions in this division
are to publicize our collections

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.360
and to bring people
into the library.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.180
One way we accomplish this second
goal is by holding lectures

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.710
and having programs such as the
one we are hosting here today.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.250
Before I introduce today's
speaker, it is my pleasure

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.210
to call upon Dr. Eugene Alpert,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.770
President of the Jewish Genealogy
Society of Greater Washington

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.070
and one of today's
program's co-sponsors

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.750
to say a few words
about the society.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you Sharon.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.990
Even though it was
stated that Mr. Horowitz

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.860
and Sharon Horowitz are not
related, you never know [laughter].

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.270
I went through my life saying
I wasn't related to Herb Alpert

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.930
until I started doing
genealogical research.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.050
Although I don't know for sure our
families came from the same town

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.260
in Belarus so you never
know [laughter].

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.320
It is my honor to be here
today and to thank the Africa

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.210
and Middle East division of the
Library of Congress for helping

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.880
to sponsor and support
the celebration

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.680
of Jewish American Heritage Month.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.310
I represent the Jewish Genealogy
Society of Greater Washington.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.860
We are a non-profit
organization founded in 1980.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.530
Our mission is to help
people discover, document,

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.950
and share their Jewish
family history.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.160
We have over 300 members.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.530
We meet about once a month
with a special program

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.670
and Mr. Horowitz was there
yesterday to talk about his work

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.770
with DNA testing through my
heritage and we do help people

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.380
to help find their relatives
around the world using DNA,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.660
or using research, or using
personal family recollections.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.290 position:56%
We have some membership brochures on
the desk over there in the corner.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.930 position:56%
I have one up here so you can always
contact us through wwwjgsgw.org.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:03.280
You're really in for a treat today
because you're going to be hearing

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.300
from someone who has given so
many different presentations

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.870
on so many different
topics in genealogy.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.020
I know Daniel will
be probably swamped

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.850
after the presentation today.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.550
He is like a walking encyclopedia
of genealogy so you're really going

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.880
to enjoy the presentation.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.510
Thank you very much.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.370
[ Applause ]

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Alpert, and
now a word about our speaker.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.520
and he speaks at conferences

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.310
A resident of Israel since 2005,
Mr. Horowitz is on the Boards

and the International Association

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.970
of Jewish Genealogical
Societies and others.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.150
One item of business
before we begin,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.410
this event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.020
There will be a formal question
and answer period after the lecture

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.080 position:56%
at which the audience is encouraged
to ask questions and offer comments.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.560
Please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.910

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.330 position:56%
By participating in the question and
answer period, you are consenting

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.680

so I urge you to look at them and
subscribe because you'll be amazed.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.540 position:56%
There are very wonderful things that
are being put up on that website.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.510
And now, please join me in
welcoming Mr. Daniel Horowitz.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you very much.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.680
It's really a pleasure and
an honor for me to be here

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.340
after such a wonderful presentation
introduction and I really hope

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:27.500
that you will learn today more
than about my own personal family

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.130
but the ways and the
tasks that I did in order

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.090
to find them and to research them.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.040
I'm going to start with just this
very first screen and you can see

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.890
in the back a family
picture, a family picture

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:47.160
that probably we all have and we
recognize from different houses

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160
of relatives that we have visited.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.330
I was very young, some
day I was very young yes,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.720
and I saw this picture
and I actually started

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.480
to ask who these people were.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.590
Who is this one, and who is this
one, and how they are related,

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.930
and how I am related
to those individuals.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.790
I learned very fast that
this is my Singer family

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:20.280
and immediately I turned out to
the salon and I see this object

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.140
in the middle and I say,
"Oh, so we should be famous.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.420
Probably we created this machine"

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.780
and for many years I was
very proud in secrecy.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.670
Still, some day I asked
and they said, "No,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.700
this belongs to the other family.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.390
Well yes, your mother's side of
the family, they were tailor's

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:50.960
and your grandfather used this
as work", so I very fast learned

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.170
that we should ask about any
object that we have in our houses

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.840
because there are histories
hidden within.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.250
Immediately of course, in
my mind I made a connection

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.350
so my mother's family
which are from Romania,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.310 position:56%
Chabotaro's [phonetic] are connected
to my Singer family who has come

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.830
from the Ukraine, through
this machine.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.430
Wonderful story.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.650
And then I discover
a lot of paperwork.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:21.910
Paperwork made by hand
many, many years before

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.160
by my dear Uncle Lotter
[phonetic] from England.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.780
By the time I discover this
paperwork and I realize

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:35.240
that all this scribbling are
actually names, dates, and places,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.320
my Uncle Lotter passed away
and because I was interested

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.930
in all this family history,
all this paperwork passed to me

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.440
and I'm pretty sure, it wasn't
that long about but until today,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.370
the first contact people had
with genealogy is in this way,

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.090
probably in a napkin in a
restaurant or a family gathering

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.640 position:56%
when you start collecting names,
dates and places and you think well,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.350
there should be a better
way to do that than

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.020
in this blank piece of paper.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:13.220 position:56%
Well yes, there is for sure and I
started using computers, technology.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.530
I started to type the names,
and the places, and the dates.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.910
The technology also allowed
me to take the pictures

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:26.130
of these individuals so they were
coming alive with their faces

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.850
over there and of course,

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.000
the technology allowed
me to make discoveries.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.530
We are discoveries.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.860
For example, my great grandfather
David Mayer Singer [assumed

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.040
spelling] was married to
Bertha Singer and of course,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.360
you would say well
obviously, Bertha took the name

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.930
of her husband when she married.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.110
Well no, she was Singer-Singer.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.510
Hmm, so when I actually put this
into the family tree I realized

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.940
that they were actually cousins.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.680 position:56%
Their parents were brothers and
really, with a very wide family tree

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.530
in paper was almost
impossible for me at the age,

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.860
I was probably 20 years old,
very difficult to realize

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.270
that these were the same people.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:20.650
So of course, I took more interest
in this and I just took my pen

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:26.640
and paper, camera, audio recording,
video recording, everything I could

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.320
to interview my relatives and ask
questions, questions about things

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.620 position:56%
that I already knew but I had to
reconfirm, things that I had no idea

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.050
about it and I wanted to know more,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:44.040
and things that may not be
even related and were only

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.770
in my mind and in my fantasy world.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.350
Some of them were confirmed indeed,

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.570
some of them unfortunately
were not real.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.350
We didn't belong to
the Singer family

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:02.210
that had the sewing machine
company, no money there.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:08.540
So, when websites came up, I also
posted my family tree in a website

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.370
and that allowed me to share with
other people and allow people

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.900
to see my research and to tell
me of course that I was wrong

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.560
so they thought, but I kept
both whatever I have researched

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:29.180 position:56%
and also what they told me and I
have then many dates and many places

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.730
and many names for the same
person until I found the paperwork

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.900
or I made the proper research.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.840
I kept all my doors open.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.430
But that is a way to collaborate
and to find new individuals

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.950
until one day in 2013, as
you can see over there,

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:55.720
I received this weird email
from somebody called Sattinger.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:02.670 position:56%
Okay, and Michael Sattinger tells
me that he picked on my family tree,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:07.170
he saw a few of my dead
individuals that are not privatized

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.930
in my family tree, and he
thinks that we are related.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.690
Of course, I get very
excited at the beginning,

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.310
I went to the family tree,
I tried to find those names,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.590
I found some similarities but of
course I said, "I'm sorry Michael,

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:29.020
but yes, your people came from the
same city Czernowitz in Ukraine

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.800
from my family but so far I
cannot prove that we are related."

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.230
But then, Michael sends me
back and email and says, "Well,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:47.750
I did further research and I am
attaching a naturalization paper

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.870
where you can see all the
relationships between the Singers

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:58.390
and the Sattingers and this is my
great-grandfather David Sattinger,

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.480 position:56%
then the name and the dates matches,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.560
came out with Haymen Sattinger
[assumed spelling] his grandfather"

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.050
and he tells me a little bit,
but this is what he sent me

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.260
and this is actually the
first contact that I have

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:20.520
with a paper trail in the US,
Petition of Naturalization.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.730
I had no idea what this paper
was about but of course,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.430
I started to read it and
I learned a lot of things

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.210
about not only this person
but his family and I found

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.740
out that David Sattinger
indeed was born in Romania,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:41.090 position:56%
was married to Bertha Singer (not my
great grandmother but another one)

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.630
and of course names repeat
across the family tree

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.620
so that was already a clue.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:52.500
I see other family left back
in Czernowitz, I see where

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.790
and how they immigrated to America,
no America was the name of the ship

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:03.690
and they came from Hamburg
1913, naturalization intentions,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:10.400
petitions, numbers, couldn't find
out what that was for now but then,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.710
I have two signatures on
this document from witnesses

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.830
and one is Max Singer,
restauranteur in New York

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.160
and the other one is Samuel Singer,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.680
also restauranteur
with two addresses.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.210
Well, by that time I was
already a very techy guy,

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:34.690
of course very nice handwriting
signature of this person

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:40.330
but I have these two addresses so
what I immediately did is going

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:46.900
into Google, put those
addresses into Google Maps,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.150
and find out very soon
how this house looked.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.930
I still am not sure if this is my
family but this is nice to have

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:01.770
to see the house where they may
have been living over there.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.740
So of course, by now I'm all
excited and I send an email,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:13.050
"Michael this is gold, thank you
very much, you opened me a door."

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:18.560
Well, what a door because
Michael just answered me

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.930
with a zillions more of documents
so I don't have to do any research,

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.240
documents are just raining down
my way, a picture of the vessel,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.560 position:56%
manifest, immigration list, records,
and everything, declaration,

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:40.000
petition, so for sure I had to
do a little bit of homework here.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.190
Now, very fast I started
to learn something

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.850
about American immigration
and paperwork.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:51.290
There is the Declaration of
Intent, which is a court record

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:57.280
and it was done mostly immediately
after arrival for this period,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.690 position:56%
there is the Petition of Citizenship
that has to have five years

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.530
after the person arrived to the
country and requires the witnesses.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.970
Remember the two Singer
guys that signed up?

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.040
And then, there is this
Certification of Naturalization

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:21.860
which since 2006, is
centralized by the INS with a form

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.020
and the Certificate of
Arrival, which consists

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.810
in a fourth document
about this paper trail.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:38.040
1906 to 1956, this is called C
files and they are all microfilmed.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.570
From 1944 until today
it's called the A files

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.920
and those are not microfilmed,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.190
to the best of my knowledge
up until today.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:55.320
Oh yes, and you can use the
United States CIS.gov research

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:00.820
to find the death certificate or
the certificate for dead people.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:05.580
This is the family that I put all
together through this paperwork.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.150
You can see over there
David Sattinger

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.320
that married Bertha
Sattinger Singer,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.330
father Hein Singer
[assumed spelling].

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:21.140 position:56%
Of course, remember the two brothers
that married my great-grandparents?

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.030
Well, this is a third brother
so yes, we are related,

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.080
we have pictures over there.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.510
I have another generation
of immigrants coming here

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.500
and then one little guy, the only

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.440
and the youngest person
from this family.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:45.420
Now, I wanted to learn more about
the immigration of this family

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.000
so immediately I went to
the Ellis Island database,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.180
the only database I knew about
immigration, the famous database

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.900
about immigration and I
typed David Sattinger.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.830
No results.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.560
Hmm, okay so let me look for one

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.190
of the second generation,
Herman Sattinger.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.860
Then, I got two Herman Sattingers.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:18.460
Well, maybe one is my guy in 1920
and the other one is another guy.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.440
Let's start exploring.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.670
Oh yes, to do that you need to
log in and create an account.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:29.780
Well it's free, no problem, let's
do it and then it will allow you

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:34.060
to actually see the record,
see more information.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.650
You can actually purchase a nice
copy of the immigration record.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.850
Not really my interest, I
have all the text over there,

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.110
all the information that I want.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:51.280
He's single, coming from
Romania, what he speaks,

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.470
the vessel that he was
traveling, manifest line number.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.930
Hmm, okay let me see the manifest.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.410
I'm a genealogist, I trust you but
I want to see the records so yeah,

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.160
I can right up there
see the ship manifest,

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.520
I can see ship information,
annotation, text passenger list.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:18.700 position:56%
This is the manifest, here they are,
and again an address in New York.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:24.570
Now, do you remember
635 North in New York?

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.750
That is the information,
the address that was

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:32.000
in the first naturalization
paper that I received

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.830
so this guy definitely is
the one that I'm looking for.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.660
Now, what about the
second one, 1950?

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:44.380
We're having only two individuals
here, let's look for it.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:51.770
I went into the passengers, I
see the document in the registry

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.410
and I don't know if you noted
something weird with this record.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.520
First of all 1950, well I didn't
know a lot about American history

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.280
by now but probably he came
through Ellis Island in 1950,

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.810
but definitely I know
from my childhood

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:16.560
that Pan American World Airlines
was not a ship [laughter].

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:23.020
Well, and then I learned that
although Ellis Island was in charge

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.760
of processing all the ships coming
through New York in a period

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.540
of time, also kept record
for planes coming to New York

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:40.110
and I learned also that
people were put in buses,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:44.400
transported from the
airport to Ellis Island,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:51.310
processed in Ellis Island and that
is the reason why this flight has

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.480
his passenger records down there.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.480
Now, this still doesn't answer me
if this is my guy or not but just

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:06.300
by zooming out and reading the
whole list, I can read and see

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.270 position:56%
that this plane came from Venezuela.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.360
Did that ring any bells to you?

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.880
Yes, I was born there,
my family was here

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.460
so this guy was also there
visiting my family over there.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.690
More than that, because
I'm from Venezuela I know

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:30.440 position:56%
that the identity cards in Venezuela
numbers are very similar to the one

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.890
that is written over there,
starting with a V. It means

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:42.030
that it's a Venezuelan guy but very
interestingly, he was statusless

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:47.210
so the guy came into the
United States in 1920,

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:52.440
it seems never nationalized or got
a residence here in the states,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:57.910
flew to Venezuela for what I
thought was visiting my family,

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.970
got an ID over there, and then
came back to the United States

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.590
without any nationality
or citizenship.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.610
Very strange, but definitely
yes, this is my guy.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.870
Now, I decided to go
with a wider search

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.250
and look only for the last name.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.200
After all, how many
Sattingers can me?

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.260 position:56%
No worries, I did the same search
for the Singers, very fast came back

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.650
to the Sattingers [laughter].

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.060
Well, I found also very
interesting information.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:37.570
You remember Bertha Singer
Sattinger with her daughter Yetti

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:43.440 position:56%
or Yetta [assumed spelling]
Friedman Sattinger from maiden name?

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.710
Here I found those two
ladies coming into America

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.840
on the same day, on the same ship.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.940
They must be my people so yup,
for sure I pull out the manifest

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.830
from the ship, I see that
they're listed right there.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.920
No other relative,
Sattingers, coming with them.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.470
Of course, then I browse all
these ship manifests for Singer,

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.720
Sattinger, or any other related.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.360
No, they came alone.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.010
The mother and the daughter came,
mother was 48, the daughter was 16.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:24.670
It gave me the address back
in what I said by then Romania

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:28.360
where they are coming
from, everything and just

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.360
to make it easier to read, here
you have all the transcription

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.200
of the information.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.830
So I decided to use another
search engine and try to look

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:44.150
for Bertha Sattinger and for sure,

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:50.770
I went to the 1930 United States
Federal Census because if she came

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:57.220
in the 20th, the next census for
sure was the 1930 and indeed,

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:04.860
I find here over there listed
with her husband David Sattinger

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.830
and I have all the information.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.220
They are still living in
Brooklyn, New York, the district

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.150
and the address matches
all the places

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.670
that I had from the paperwork.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:23.090
I could see the census page right
there, David, Bertha, Yetti.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:29.880
Hmm...do you see who are
below the Sattingers?

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.720
They are my Singers so not only
they are related, they are living

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.430
at least close enough if
not one on top of the other.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:47.500
The next step was of
course after 1930, 1940.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:55.460
No record hmm...strange
things are happening here.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.800
Well, probably they died right?

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.960
People die, what can we do so
I wanted to find their graves.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.670
Very famous website, I put over
there the name that I was looking

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:14.220
for and very fast I
get the information

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.770
in Mount Hebron Cemetery
in Flushing, Queens.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.900
They stick to New York, good guys.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.640
Of course, very frustrating,
no photo of the tombstone.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.470
I already said I'm a genealogist.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:33.370
I trust you but I want to see the
records with my own eyes so I found

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:37.580
out the website of
Mount Hebron Cemetery.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:42.380 position:56%
They very graciously have a search
engine where I can put the last name

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.230
and the first name of the person.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:49.680
By now, I look only for last
names and not only Bertha,

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.100
which you already know, not only
Herman which you already met,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.570
but now we have an Ernestina buried

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:05.810
in if not the exact location very
close, for sure on the same plot

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:11.190
so pretty much sure
this is all my family.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.890
Of course, I see that there is
a link, I try to hit the link.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.260
No images, too bad.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.680
I know I can go to the New
York Department of Records

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.650
and ask for a death certificate.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.430
It's really inexpensive, it
has a lot of information,

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:32.250
but there is only one problem and
no, it's not that I'm in Israel

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.550
and this is in New York

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.970 position:56%
because through the internet you can
still ask for the records and get it

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:43.270
but it takes time and we
genealogists are very impatient.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:48.440
we want everything and we
want it now so I did fill that

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.970
but in the meantime I went
to other websites to try

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.030
to look for more information.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:00.510
So I go to the birth,
marriage, and death category.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:05.970
I type by Bertha Sattinger
information, for sure I found her

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.470
over there, I found the
find a grave record,

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:15.340
I found Jewish chain information
about her but I also find her

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:22.910 position:56%
in the death certificate record with
a lot of information but no image.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.220 position:56%
Okay, at least I am one step further

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:31.520
on my research getting this
information but then I learn

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:38.780
from a friend that all those images
were microfilmed by the Mormons

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:44.630
by Family Search and they are also
available through their catalog.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.930
They have a lot of records.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:52.310 position:56%
They also have the census' available
on their website from your house

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.880
without any problem but the death
records, those you need to go

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.440
to the library in order
to see it and copy them.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.430
So well what's the problem?

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.280
Let's go to the library.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.060
I'm fortunate enough to
visit Salt Lake City.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.590
The Family History Library there
is what I consider the Disneyland

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.500
for genealogists.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.810
They have over there every
record and every microfilm

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:25.150
that they have ever scanned
and digitized and if not,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.060
because you're asking for a
very rare microfilm, no worries,

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.810
you do a petition, in 24 hours
they copy it from their vault

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.010
and they bring it up
to you and you can go

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.610
and scan it so this is what I did.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:44.860
I looked for the microfilm and
there are 11 or 12 corridors just

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.990
like that, you open the drawer, you
take out the microfilm and you sit

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:55.220
on one of the microfilm readers
and you start making exercise.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.450
Well, very soon I found the page
that I was looking for and faster

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.370
than what the New York
Office could give me,

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.570
I have the death certificate
of Bertha Sattinger,

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:11.980
married to David Sattinger,
with all the information,

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.610
his father Haim Singer from
Austria, her mother maiden name,

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:23.210
and the signature, the address,
everything I know how she died now.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.760
Now, she died, she passed away.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.170
I already know that Herman that you
have over here also passed away.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:37.840
By the year, I assume
everybody else also passed away

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.330
but this has this little
guy down the line,

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:47.240
probably the only living individual
that I know from this family.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.580
So I knew that he was
married with Sara,

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.630
he had to be about 65 years
old, maybe living in New York

00:32:54.630 --> 00:33:00.200
because if the family didn't move
for so long why he would move?

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.830
Well again, I went to Rev
Google, as my son says,

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:11.610
and I type Solo Sattinger,
age approximately 60,

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:16.560
and I came up with this White
Pages website where it tells me

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:24.020
that he lives in 1753 63rd
Street in Brooklyn, New York.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.040
Now how good is your memory?

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.770
Did it ring any bells?

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.070
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.370
&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the same address

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.300
from the naturalization
record that I had before.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.820
Bingo, I have my guy right here.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:44.860
Now of course, I could
also go to other places

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.960 position:56%
and check his criminal records, his
bank account, and all kind of things

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.050
that don't mind for me,

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.930
I'm a genealogist not
a private investigator

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.050
so I have here all the information.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.880
Now very curiously, they
give me the possible related.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.020
Now, I have no idea who
is Alexandra Sattinger

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:09.450 position:56%
but look here, Herman pops up again.

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:13.770
Good, I'm on the right track!

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:22.220 position:56%
Yup, so same Herman that was burned
on the cemetery over there so again,

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:28.190
Google gives me the picture
of the house where he lives

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.310
and My Heritage gives
me the opportunity

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.620
to travel do New York
and what do I do?

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.550
Ding dong.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:43.010
No, of course I talk first on the
phone and I invite myself yes,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.840
and then I met this wonderful
guy, Solo Sattinger Singer.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.240
He gives me all this information,
he shows me all the pictures.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.960
Of course, he has the very black
and white Singer family picture

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.760 position:56%
that was passed to every descendent,
that was like the sealing

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.850
that he belongs to my family

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:10.380
but then he said, "Do
you know Carl Wolf?"

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:17.010
No. Well, this guy Carl Wolf lives
in California and he's a descendent

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:21.780
of someone in the family,
you should contact him.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.050
Of course I'm going to contact
him, give me the phone number.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:30.750
He gave it to me, I have all the
information so now I'm in New York,

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.610
I have some time and I have a car.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.390
What would you do?

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:40.550 position:56%
Well, my wife will go shopping sure.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:47.250
I go to the cemetery, remember
Flushing, Queens right there,

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:52.510
my family's waiting
for me so let's go.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:57.260
And then of course I get to the
cemetery, I go to the office,

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.530
I ask for the Sattingers.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:05.360
They gave me names that are
not listed on the website,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.670
the names that they have

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:10.650
on the website are not
listed in the office.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:16.590 position:56%
Very clearly they have no idea who
they have buried over there and then

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:21.640
of course they tell me
well you know, it's 4:15

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.880
and we close the cemetery at five.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.310
If you're not out by five, you
will need to jump the fence.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.960
Well that's not a problem but the
car is going to be a little bit

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.910
of a challenge so I have two
options, either go to the plot

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:43.030
and look for my relative and then
take pictures for the cemetery

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:48.850
of the tombstones or
pull out my smartphone,

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.270
pull out my billion
graves application,

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:57.460
and start taking pictures of
every tombstone that I see.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.020
Now, this is not the
first time that I do this,

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.340
I normally do this in Israel.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:10.400
I can do between 400
and 450 tombstones

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:15.030
in an hour very easy, very fast.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:22.050
I will strongly suggest you to
try it so I have about 40 minutes

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.470
to take pictures and
take my car out of there.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:29.020
I run into the whole area,
I don't read the tombstones,

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.820
I just make sure I capture
all the stone in the picture,

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.650
I surround the stone, make sure
that there's nothing on the sides,

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.570
I take out a little
bit of the bushes.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.810
Now this is my first experience
also with a US cemetery

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.060
and this is the first time
that I see all this pillars

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.380
and the entrance of the plot
and I learned a little bit

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.580
of how Jewish groups
bought this piece of land

00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:00.150
and they made a collaborative
office to put money into it

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.730
and benefit everybody over there.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.570
And there I start,
afterwards of course back home,

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:10.940
I start reading those names and
do you see those names over there?

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:17.890
Singer, Singer, Max Singer, Max
restauranteur, also here involved

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:22.010
in the community and of
course, after I looked

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.320
into my pictures I have
over the Bertha Sattinger,

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.390
I have David Abram Sattinger, I
have Herman, we already know him

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:35.520
but then I have Regina, I have
Sally, I have Joseph, I have Enya,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:41.510
I have everybody or almost
everybody in my family over there.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:48.040 position:56%
Of course, now if I go into Billion
Graves, I can look for more records,

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:54.270
I can find other people buried
not only in that cemetery but also

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.610
in other ones and they very
great advantage is that if I want

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.690
to go back, because remember
I just took pictures,

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.830
I had no idea where the
location of this stone was.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.400
I have the picture with the
information on the Billion Graves,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.230 position:56%
it will mark exactly the geolocation
of that stone so next week when I'm

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.130
in New York, guess
what I'm going to do?

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:21.030
Yes, I'm going to visit
the cemetery and I'm going

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.280
to light a candle in those stones.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.140
Now, back to Carl Wolf.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.960
Who was this guy?

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.970
Well, you already knew my
great-grand uncle Haim Singer

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.860
so he had a daughter Hencia Singer,

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:47.210
you just saw her tombstone right
there so she had also a couple

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.560 position:56%
of sons and daughters and I realized

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.520
that I was actually
missing one person here.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:40:01.040
They have a third kid, a girl
in this kid, Sally Singer Wolf.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.480
She married Jacob Wolf
and they had a son,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.880
Carl Wolf so let's get
in touch with this guy.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.770
I phone him, he's in
California, I woke him up.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:17.050
Yes, there's a time
difference between New York

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.360
and California [laughter].

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.920
Curious the things you
learn with genealogy.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.110
He was very gracious to
give me all the information.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.250
Look how beautiful my
family tree looks now.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:34.380
I have pictures, I have dates,
I have places, I have everything

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.040
over there and of course I
have more people to research.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:47.410
And then, I went to the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.700
because I learned that all
these people didn't leave

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.770
with the other part of the
family, they were in the Holocaust.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:00.120
They were survivors of
the Second World War

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.100
and they were registered
somehow, or at least I thought,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:11.710
in the Holocaust Museum Memorial
and there's another place

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.390
which I definitely
encourage you to research.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:20.640
The only caveat here is that for
better research you should do it

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.900
physically and there's
only 11 countries,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.310
meaning 11 places where
you can do that.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:32.070
Well, actually 12, in Israel
we cheat a little bit.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.980
In Israel, you should
go to Yad Vashem,

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.820
which is the Holocaust
Museum over there

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.950 position:56%
but what not everybody knows is that
the Jerusalem one everybody knows,

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:47.840
huge museum, huge research over
there but there's another branch

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.110 position:56%
in a little city called [inaudible]
and over there you can go of course,

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.230
nothing like the Library of
Congress but they have computers

00:41:56.230 --> 00:42:00.350
and they have access to
this database and for sure,

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:06.020
I went here in Washington
and I found Joseph Singer

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.280
with Henya Singer in a
collection named over there.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.420
Now, these are what they
call DP camp cards meaning,

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.970
after the war people
went to these camps.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:23.830
They were catalogued, they were
recorded, not only themselves

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:27.980
but also the people that
were together in the family

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:33.280
so here I learned that Joseph
Singer was also accompanied

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.690
by Nora Malley Wolf Jacob hmm,

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:41.840
name starts to appear,
Regina and [inaudible].

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.300
I found also the dates
match, the people match.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:52.270
I found the Nora Singer hmm.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:59.310
Same date okay, that's weird but
that's a name I have and then

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:03.060
of course I went back to
immigration records because I knew

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:09.630
that they died here and I found
an Anora Singer so it's Henya,

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:12.750
it's Nora, it's Anora [assumed
spellings] or depending the day

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:17.550
of the week she changed her name or
probably somebody typed it wrong,

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:22.160
but the dates all were together
the same, the address was the same

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.170
so definitely yes,
this is my relative

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.820
so keep an eye on the names.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.040
Names change and I'm not
taking about last names,

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.420
I'm talking about first names.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.810
So, I have my family here
and if you see the people

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:43.060
that accompany this Joseph
Singer guy I see Jacob and Sally,

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:49.660
just as my family tree and Carl
gave it to me and I found Beryl,

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.200
Tepera and Regina [assumed
spellings] right there,

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.620
and I found the cards
for the Hollenberg family

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.750
and Beryl and Tepera right there.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:07.560
Regina Tepera you remember from the
cemetery that I took the picture.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.170
Now Beryl, it's totally a mystery.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.030
He was not buried over there.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:19.070
I haven't been able to find
him in any other cemetery.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:24.450
Nobody knows what happened and
if you see and if you notice,

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.400
there is a discrepancy
with the last name.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:32.120
He left Europe with the name
Hollenberg and he was recorded

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.940
in the United States
with the name Tepera.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.990
Hm.. this is a mysterious guy.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:40.890
If you see it somewhere
around please let me know,

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.810
I'm still looking for him.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:49.120 position:56%
Now of course, the more
information I put in my family tree,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.690
the more records, the more
matches, the more connections I do

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.590
with other people and
with other families.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:00.010
My Heritage is very useful for
pointing me in the right direction

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.540
and of course, I don't
take anything for granted.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.450
I like to see the records
so I go over

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:09.890
and I researched all those
collections right here

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:13.290
and this is only a sample
of the US collections

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.020
where my family is recorded.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:24.070
This is a sample of Bertha Singer
and Sattinger, how they appear.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.420
You can see the pictures, you
can see other family trees

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.680 position:56%
that also have the same information.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.170
Most of them, my own cousins
that are stealing my information

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:40.180
but I'm fine with it as long as
they said it's coming from me.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.690 position:56%
Now, I also have another branch of
my family that I would like to share

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:48.270
with you and this is
the Menchel family.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:52.660
Now, this family came a little
bit earlier to the United States

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:58.270
and a little bit different
records and experience here.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.880
Of course, I'm already kind of an
expert with immigration records

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.020
in the United States, I know
the index back and forth,

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:12.190
I know the numbers and I very
easily find Tessie Menchel and only

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:18.580
because she was registered with
her married last name of course,

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.620
because otherwise I
would never find her.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.050
Well, this is the Petition
of Naturalization,

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:30.890
you already know those type
of documents and if I zoom in,

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:36.200
you can see that she
was known as Pese Grun.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.700
That's why I said I would never
find her if she was not kind enough

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:44.740
to mention in the same
document that [inaudible]

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.720
and Tessie Menchel is actually
the same person and of course,

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.770
a wealth of information
again for me.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:57.240
I have dates, I have
places, I have addresses.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.450
I'm not surprised already Bronx,
New York, the same streets,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:07.540
the same places but I have
here also the kids, Donald no,

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:18.070
not that one this is another one
and the other one Sidney yes,

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:21.590
thanks you yes Sidney and
Donald with their birth dates

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:28.020
and all the information so let's
look more into Pese Grun now,

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:33.830
I know the name she came before
and I have the immigration record

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:37.030
and this is another
wealth of information.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:43.290
I have Pese Grun and I can see that
somebody wrote over there Green,

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:47.270
and at certain point somebody
decided to correct it to Grun,

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.980
Grun/Green is actually
the same thing.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.070
It all depends on the
language and the pronunciation

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.280
and I find more people here.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.990
Pese was 18, was a child when
she arrived with the mother 48,

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:07.340
but she had also two siblings over
there and if I scroll to the side

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.190
of the record, I find
actually more information.

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:17.130
I know Tessie's grandfather
Lev Green,

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:20.970
I told you Green/Grun
is the same thing.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:30.100
He was left back in Poland, I guess
alive for this time of the year.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.520
Of course all these numbers,
I'm already an expert.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:39.120
It means all the naturalization and
petition so I can go to the index

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:43.850
and I can get all the
information from there.

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:48.030
Now remember that she was
married to Abram Menchel

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:54.710 position:56%
and of course I found him in the
1940 census with all the information

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:59.350
where he lived, the relatives and
everybody over there and I found

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:06.070
that Sidney in 1940, was 14
years old and Donald was seven.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.830
Now I'm very bad with math but I
can tell you that if they were 14

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:15.660
and seven, especially
Sidney in 1940,

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:22.170 position:56%
by the time of the war he was
already available for military duty.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.350
So, I went to the National
Archive because I heard

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:31.840 position:56%
that they had a wonderful collection
of military records so I scan

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.500
over there, I read
all the information,

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:40.480
I make a few phone calls, send a
few emails and very fast I found

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:46.630
that indeed Sidney Menchel
was in the military since 31

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:55.150
of October 1943, until at
least 31 of January 1945.

00:49:55.150 --> 00:50:00.370
What he did, he was a raider
operator and he was stationed here

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:06.740
in the United States so he never
went back to Europe to fight.

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:13.540
Now if I am already in New
York, I don't know how many

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.780
of you have the knowledge of this,

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.550
Risen Initiative, Reclaim
the Records.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:25.590
New York and other places are being
requested to submit those indexes

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:28.020
to make them pubically available.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:32.340 position:56%
My very good friend I have to share,

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:37.260
Brook Ganz [inaudible] she
is managing this initiative,

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.190
getting the images
transcribed and available

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.020
to everybody on the internet.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:50.760 position:56%
She received a few years directly on
digital so she made this search page

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:58.970 position:56%
where I just put Donald Menchel, I
heard that he was married to Barbara

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:03.290
and there she is right
on the first line,

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.220
Barbara Winograd [assumed
spelling] with Donald Menchel,

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.150
married in Brooklyn
1957, and how wonderful!

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:14.880
This record is more than 50
years so it's actually open

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:20.130
and I already filed a petition
to get a copy of the certificate.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:26.360
Now of course, I have many, many
more family in the United States

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.550
but my time is limited
because I have a job,

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:33.610
because I have another
family to take care of

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.650
and because I'm traveling a lot
but don't worry, I'm pretty sure

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:41.460
that with a little help of the
technology and with a little help

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:45.330
of other genealogists and
researchers, I will be able

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:49.670
to keep track of all this family,
all these events that happen

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:56.050
across the United States and for
sure my very most excited dream is

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.600
to keep traveling and
keep visiting family

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.320
and knowing those different
people over there.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.460
Now, here are the techniques to
research data I would like you

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.550
to adopt, or suggestions.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:15.310
First, build your family tree
especially with good technology.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:20.980
I have no problem if you start with
a pen and paper but move as fast

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:24.420
as you can to a good technology.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.510
Contact and interview
your relatives.

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:32.040
Those that you already know please,
make phone calls, send emails,

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.900
the sooner the better
because you know people,

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.400
as I said, life is short.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.810
Travel the country.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.800
Well, if you can, enjoy.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:49.140 position:56%
If not, internet is still a good
way to at least virtually traveling.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:54.390 position:56%
Google has not only a search engine
but also the places, the Google Maps

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:57.800
that you can see where
your relative lived.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.260
Try to encourage family reunion,
which is what I do in every place

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:06.620
that I'm going, try to contact
my family and gather together

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.250
to have more information.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:12.910
Share and collaborate with
them, tell them what you know,

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:16.440
tell them what you don't know,
and I'm pretty sure they are going

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:21.460
to start telling you stories and
facts that you never heard before.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:25.920
It's also very convenient
to invite them afterwards

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.280
to the family tree so they can see.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.900
Depending on how many individuals
you have in your family tree,

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.170
depending on how much information
you have researched you can either

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:38.120 position:56%
allow them to touch and collaborate.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.750
In my case, 7,000 individuals
and more than 30 years

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:44.670
of research, nobody touches it.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.000
You want to add something
not a problem, send it to me

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.190
and I will be more than happy
not only to add it but also

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:57.670 position:56%
with the proper source citation,
this was given to me by this person,

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:00.200
on this date, in this way.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.410
And last thing for sure,
subscribe to forums

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.820

every time you have a gathering,

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.260
tell everybody the last names,
the names, your brick walls,

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.950
the things that you're researching.

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:22.510
You never know, as it was
said already at the beginning

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.720
of the presentation, you
never know from where

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.670
and how your brick wall is going
to be broken and you're going

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:34.710
to discover a wonderful wealth
of information over there.

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:39.040
So thank you very, very much
for having me here again.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.940
Now, you have also met
my US Jewish family.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:48.770
I really hope that you picked on
some of the tips and the research

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:52.030
that I have done and you
can apply to your family

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:56.770
and hopefully you also will find
a lot of your family members.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:01.660
Thank you very, very much and I can
answer any question that you want.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.460
Yes, go ahead.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:09.470
&gt;&gt; Yes sir?

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:14.600
&gt;&gt; I noticed you didn't mention
the Jewish online burial records

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.780
and you didn't mention [inaudible].

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:20.510
Have you had any-

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:25.410
&gt;&gt; The question was that
I didn't mention the JOBAR

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:28.920
or Jewish World Burial
Records and JewishGen-

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.880
&gt;&gt; No, Jewish Data.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.980
&gt;&gt; Jewish Data, that's a separate
website so let's focus first.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:38.870
Jewish Data, that's an easy
one yes, it's a website

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.230
that collects Jewish
information for sure,

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:43.400
it's subscribed, it's
a paid membership.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.590
Some societies some
places have it for fee.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:52.130
I did research over there
including the Library of Congress,

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.670
didn't know that, thank you
very much for letting me know.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:56:04.140 position:56%
I did search over there but didn't
find unfortunately I would say a lot

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.440
of good stuff.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.070
Yes, I found the burials
and the places but no images

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:14.350
and just the numbers or the places
depending for the cemeteries.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:21.350
Now, JewishGen and the Jewish World
Burial Records Project again yes,

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:27.340
I did find a little bit over
there, not always with images.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:32.520
I mentioned actually I did mention
JewishGen when I was searching

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.330
through Ancestry because
there is a partnership

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:38.980
and in Ancestry you can find
records from over there.

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.150
The only reason that I
didn't mention it here was

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.820
because of how I built
my presentation.

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:50.950
I for sure used them and
have a few pieces and beads

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:53.740
of my family gathered from there.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.690
&gt;&gt; Abraham Lubble [phonetic]
is putting on gravestones

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:04.140
on Jewish Data and I'm learning, if
we're talking about the same thing,

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:10.790
any time we find information
about graves on Jewish Data,

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.890
there will be a photograph
about the grave.

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:14.740
&gt;&gt; Okay so the comment is

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:18.170
that photos are being
placed in Jewish Data.

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:23.890
You mentioned the creator of
the website Abraham Lubble,

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:30.130 position:56%
I'm familiar with him and again, I
didn't mention a lot of other places

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.370
and websites available over there.

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:37.440 position:56%
I have to be constrained on the time
of the presentation but even more

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:41.330
than that just go ahead and
Google, you will find a lot

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:45.640
of other resources there.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.130
Yes?

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.930
&gt;&gt; You mentioned family reunions.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:57.920
Have you had a family
reunion with US family?

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.000
&gt;&gt; I mention family
reunions and yes,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.890
I had one in New York
with the Menchels.

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:08.810
Actually, one of the
cousins lives here in DC

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.680
and I will meet him today.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:16.720
Then yes, Carl Wolf, of course
I met him also in California.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:24.710
Interesting fact, I didn't find
Carl's mother's burial although

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:32.420
by that time she was 102, and the
reason is because today she is 104

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:40.570
and kicking so yes, every place I
go I try to meet with my family.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:47.660
Unfortunately there has not been a
huge United States family reunion,

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:50.030
distance here is quite big,

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:54.730
but definitely I would encourage
you to contact everyone.

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:57.030
Yes sir?

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:15.210
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:20.370
&gt;&gt; So the question is how, if and
where I document all the stories

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:24.320
that I get from the families
so yes, the first thing

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.780
that I do is I ask permission

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:32.380
and immediately I pulled this small
device where we used to make calls

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:38.760
with it so now I use it to record
video and audio the conversations

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:43.050
and then I go over it and I
transcribe the pieces and the data

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:47.360
that I collect for the
family tree for the facts

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:53.450
but I also have the digital
recording uploaded to the website

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:56.060
and then I tag that recording

00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.870
with the people mentioned
in that recording.

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:03.120
The next step of course will be

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.940
to transcribe the whole
conversation and the whole history.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:11.880
Normally, software and
websites have places to do that.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.720
You have other websites
and other software

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.060
that are specially dedicated

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:22.030
into family history recording
and you can use them.

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:25.790
It all depends on what do
you feel comfortable with

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.980
and you should try a
few and you should work

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.380
with whatever feels more
comfortable but definitely record,

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.990
save, and share for sure.

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.290
Yes madam?

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:40.620
&gt;&gt; Did you finally get an identity
for every person in this picture?

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:44.920
&gt;&gt; Finally yes for sure, I have
the names and the relationship

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.400
of everyone in this family
including that little baby boy

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.780 position:56%
that actually gave me the year and
the date that the picture was taken.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.700
Yes indeed, thank you.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.000
Yes madam?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.240
&gt;&gt; Were you able to find out
which of your family died

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.540
in the Holocaust in Europe?

&gt;&gt; Family that died in the Holocaust
yes, both the Holocaust Museum here

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.230
in Washington, both Vad

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:19.500
which you can very easily
access through the website,

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.150
they have pages of
testimony over there.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:26.920
I found the people that perished
over there mostly reported

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:33.840
by those survivors but yes, I could
go a little bit further into Europe

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:41.220
and again, thankful enough I also
visited the places where we lived

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:46.320
and managed to gather
the information firsthand

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.060
from there so yes, it is possible.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.120
and you know how was
the second person?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.790
Remember that 104 year old lady,
well she suffers Alzheimer's,

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:11.220
she has no idea who she is
and why this guy was trying

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:16.770 position:56%
to open her mouth to scrub her inner
cheek but yes, we have her DNA,

01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:23.180
we have Carl Wolf's DNA as well
and I'm encouraging everybody

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.650
in my family to take a DNA test.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:30.280

really my family just in case

enough, yes I found relationship

&gt;&gt; The number of the
family members I have found?

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.860
Well, my family tree has now 7,000
individuals, a little bit more

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:06.040
than 7,000 individuals but
I cheated a little bit.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.860
I had also to put boundaries.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.030
If somebody marries
into the family I may

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:15.560
or may not put their
parents and that's it.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.180
For example, you saw the
example of Tessie Green.

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:23.560
I have her although I
don't have the records,

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.350
I don't have her grandparents
or the siblings

01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:31.790
and it's just more a
personal choice than other.

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:38.700
I would say probably a couple
hundred I found through research

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.570
with documents, interviews

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:46.810

didn't know, although the big part

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:51.920
of the family I knew from
my childhood in Venezuela.

I had a question, where does Mr.
Horowitz come in because you talk

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:09.000 position:56%
about the Singers and the Sattingers
but you didn't go into Horowitz.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Where does my Horowitz come from?

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:17.390
My Horowitz came from the town of
Chernowicz, same as the Singers.

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:22.660
Actually, my grandfather Horowitz
married my grandmother Singer

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:27.280
in Chernowicz, but then
they immigrated either

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.170
to Venezuela or to Israel.

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:33.880
They were not in the United States.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.840
I also have done a lot of
extensive research about them

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.970
in Chernowicz, in Venezuela,
in Israel.

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:47.170
A branch also went with
my Uncle Lotter to England

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.260
and I have found it over there

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:55.100
but for some reason they
didn't come to United States.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:00.230
One more question and I can
stay for later on if you want.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.530

organizations on the cemeteries?

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:14.540
I will suggest JewishGen for sure.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:21.730
JewishGen has an extensive list
of burial societies and plots

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.330
that were bought for
these societies.

to look for the, the [inaudible]

should bring you the information.
