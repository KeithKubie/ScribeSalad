00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.270
In the past, people used to find tricks
and detours to make Google search engine

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.170
think that they should be
ranked at the top of the page.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.500
But the algorithm just
became smarter than us, and

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.710
it understands when
people try to do evil.

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:19.255
Tricks like writing your top key words
in white in the background of your page

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:21.875
just don't work anymore, but nice try.

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:26.805
That being said there are still things
that you can do to help your SEO.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:29.815
Your best choice is to make
sure your website is relevant

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.130
to the key words that
you're trying to promote.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.550
If your keyword is pet sitting you
really want to make sure that people

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.690
that are searching for pet sitting
will find your website useful and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.580
will want to spend more
time on your website.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.640
That being said, words matter.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.070
The search algorithm searches
every single word on the web,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.060
including every word on your page so
the words you put on the page matter.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.630
However, don't just pack
your site with search terms.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
Because the algorithm is going to
be able to tell if they're actually

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.970
relevant to your site or not.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.940
And if it's actually useful to
the person doing the searching.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.500
So if it's not, the algorithm is
going to end up working against you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.870
You're going to want to make sure
that you refresh your content so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.850
it's always up to date and
staying alive.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.410
If you have quality, growing content
on your site and growing links to your

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.410
site, the better the search engine
algorithm is going to rate you.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.420
On that note,
what other people say matters.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.570
It's even better when other people say
the great things about your website that

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.770
you would like to say yourself.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.360
For example, if on the first page of
TechCrunch they say that Abarkment is

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.480
the best pet sitting app, with a link
to our site, that makes us look

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.800
really good, because they're
validating that, well, we're awesome.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.850
So this will help our SEO.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.550
However, don't forget that
the algorithm is smart.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.830
If you try to just buy
links to your site.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.150
That aren't actually relevant,
the search engine is going to know.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.610
The more trustworthy your site is,
the higher the algorithm rates you.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.940
The title of your page or
the meta data on your page also matter.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.750
Now, this isn't visible to users,
it's actually hidden in your code base.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.000
But it matters because it's
used as a suggestion for

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.910
the title in the Google search results.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.030
This is where you're going to want to
describe your business in an informative

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.180
and concise phrase.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.700
This is also true for your domain name.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.510
It needs to be easy to read and
easy to understand.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.380
And finally,
don't leave your images hanging.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.130
People often forget to
optimize their images.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.160
You're going to want to give your images
a short, descriptive file name, and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.790
in the alt attribute,
describe what the image is.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.560
And don't forget to add a caption for
each image.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.720
Your caption should also
contain your keywords.
