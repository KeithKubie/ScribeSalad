00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.240
It's not an easy job teaching children right
from wrong, or the tough truths of the word,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.169
let alone keep them entertained.

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.260
Sometimes, a TV shows attempts to grab attention
(or headlines) can lead to some episodes that

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.230
were destined to be banned and destroyed.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.760
By all accounts, there is no reason these
stories should have ever been made let alone

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.760
make it to the air.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.559
Here are Screenrant's 10 Banned Kid Show Episodes
You Won't Believe.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.190
TaleSpin – “Flying Dupes”

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.790
The Disney series that took the animal stars
of The Jungle Book into the world of commercial

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.980
air transport couldn't be too serious with
Baloo as it's star.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.489
But one episode banned by Disney had too many
problems to count.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.350
The final episode of the series had Baloo
deliver a bomb to a foreign leader's home,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.070
in hopes that the resulting war would mean
high profits for bomb makers.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.159
Baloo didn't know he was attempting an assassination,
but the terrorist themes, and transport of

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.969
a bomb on an airplane alone make it hard to
believe it actually made it to air.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.300
Unsurprisingly, Disney permanently banned
the episode shortly after.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.400
Peppa Pig – “Mister Skinnylegs”

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.030
When you're a kid, there are too many things
to be afraid of to even count.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.549
The British animated show Peppa Pig set out
to tackle that problem by explaining that

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.750
spiders might seem scary, but can't really
hurt you.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.170
The message was a good one in Britain, but
in Australia, where spiders actually CAN kill

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.780
you, broadcasters saw a horrible problem brewing.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.500
Rather than encouraging kids to get close
to venomous spiders, the episode of the series

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.899
was deemed unsuitable for public safety, and
banned.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.070
Tiny Toon Adventures – “One Beer”

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.780
Children's TV shows and cartoons make an habit
of setting a good example for younger viewers,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.299
with episodes meant to spread awareness about
drugs, alcohol or abuse all but expected.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.229
But just like every other issue, Tiny Toons
took that idea beyond the extreme.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.590
The youngsters Buster, Plucky and Hampton
down a beer knowing they're going to teach

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.039
young viewers a lesson, but the bender that
followed gets out of hand fast.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.109
After stealing a cop car and plunging to their
deaths, the studio decided the story went

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.180
too far, even if it was all a joke.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.039
Although the episode still airs in Canada,
it's banned on American airwaves.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.330
Sailor Moon – Young Love

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.590
The story of young girls turned into superheroes
was an absolute phenomenon when it hit American

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.120
shores, but the addition of English voices
wasn't the only change made when bringing

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.340
the show from Japan.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.480
Fans may never have realized that in its original
form, Sailors Neptune and Uranus aren't just

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.879
friends, but lovers.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.450
Rather than deal with a lesbian relationship
in a kids cartoon, other countries came up

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.030
with some strange solutions.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.030
For starters, editing out or refusing to air
episodes that hinged on their romance.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.110
In America, the pair were written as "cousins,"
which made their flirting even more unsettling.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.360
But in Russia and France, Sailor Uranus' civilian
form was claimed to be a man, with Neptune

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.480
pretending to be his girlfriend to keep their
superhero identities a secret - even going

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.760
so far as hiring a male voice actor for the
part.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.239
Gargoyles – “Deadly Force”

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.879
This cult hit from Disney TV offers one more
example of the times when trying to teach

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.650
kids a lesson ends up shocking more than it
helps.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.620
Playing off the idea that violent movies and
video games glorify violence and gunslingers,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.569
the not-too-bright gargoyle Broadway learns
that guns aren't toys - in as shocking and

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.980
traumatic a way as possible.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.060
While playing with the service weapons of
the group's human ally Elisa, Broadway ends

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.769
up shooting her by accident.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.260
Understandably, parents and protest groups
complained about their kids watching a beloved

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.120
cartoon hero shoot a woman and put her in
intensive care.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.560
The episode was banned for re-airings, but
has more recently returned to the rotation.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.030
Arthur – “Room to Ride”

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.660
Sometimes, a plot line or celebrity cameo
can make sense at the time, but events in

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.310
the real world conspire to make it an awkward
problem for networks to solve.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.349
When the children's cartoon Arthur decided
to tackle the issue of cycling on city streets,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.760
Binky turns to a reliable expert for inspiration:
Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.319
Just a few years later, Armstrong would admit
to taking banned substances, and be stripped

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.510
of his seven championships.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.140
It was probably in the show's best interest
to make sure the episode would also reflect

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.409
the ruling, stripping him of a cameo to top
everything off.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.099
Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood – “Conflict”

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.040
Few children's TV hosts are as respected as
Mr. Rogers, and an entire week's worth of

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.470
episodes might have gotten banned for trying
to teach kids *too much*.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.840
The five episodes focused squarely on giving
kids a crash course in the Cold War - and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.730
the paranoia and fear that helped it spin
out of control by the time they aired in 1983.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.940
A strange package delivered to Corny the Beaver
is all Good King Friday needed to suspect

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.950
him of amassing a nuclear arsenal, letting
fear escalate the situation.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.070
The analogy worked, but the subject matter
was just too frightening for kids to handle,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.610
and the storyline was never aired again.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.720
Dexter’s Laboratory – “Dial M For Monkey”

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.590
Aside from the central plot of each episode
of Dexter's Laboratory, the 'Dial M For Monkey'

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.620
segment gave comic book superheroes a top-notch
send up.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.310
Parodying heroes from Nick Fury to the Fantastic
Four, one episode starring "the Silver Spooner"

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.500
caused seem controversy.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.860
It wasn't the presence of a drunk Hulk, or
even a ripoff of Marvel's Galactus - but the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.620
fact that Silver Spooner was one long joke
based on gay stereotypes.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.930
The writers may have thought they were being
clever, but the episode was never aired with

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.940
other reruns of the series.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.720
Sesame Street – Wicked Witch of The West

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.639
That's right, even sesame street wasn't safe
from the terror of the Wizard of Oz antagonist,

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.900
with the Witch - played by Margaret Hamilton
- appearing after dropping her broom around

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.050
Mr. Hooper's store.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.340
Naturally, Oscar the Grouch was immediately
fond of the Witch, but kids at home apparently

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.340
weren't.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.330
When parents complained en mass that the Villains
appearance had upset their kids or reduced

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.620
then to tears, the network acted fast.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.180
The apparent terror was nowhere to be found
in test audiences, but figured they would

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.270
play it safe anyway.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.360
The episode hasn't aired since.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.560
Pokemon – “Electric Soldier Porygon”

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.830
The fun of this infamous episode all started
when Ash was forced to travel inside the depths

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.229
of one of his own Poke balls.

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.750
When Pikachu used lightning to detonate incoming
missiles, he saved the day.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.830
But for the kids watching the show, things
didn't go so smoothly.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.190
The flashing red and blue explosion sent almost
700 Japanese children into bouts of dizziness,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.780
headaches, blurred vision, or in some cases,
even seizures.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.789
"Pokemon Shock" made headlines around the
world, but didn't just get the episode banned

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.400
- the entire show went on a four month break.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.650
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.460
