00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.210
Welcome back.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.000
I shouldn't try to squeeze in
videos because then I rush,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.900
and then you won't learn, and
everything breaks down.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.030
So problem number 7, a, b, and
c are different positive

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.460
integers, and 2 to the a times 2
to the b times 2 to the c is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.770
equal to 64.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.900
They want to know what is 2
to the a plus 2 to the b

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.380
plus 2 to the c?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740
Well, here two things
we can use.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.120
We can use our exponent rules
where if we have the same base

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.080
and we multiply it we can
just add the exponents.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.140
So this is equal to 2 to
the a plus b plus c.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.580
Then, can we write 64
as a power of 2?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.380
Sure.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.730
Let's see, 2 to the
third is equal to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270
8 and 64 is 8 squared.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.510
So if we square both sides of
that, that's 2 to the sixth.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.360
You might already know that,
2 to the sixth is 64.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.890
You could think of it as
2 to the fifth is 32.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.410
2 to the sixth is
64, of course.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.625
So a plus b plus c
has to equal 6.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.470
What do they tell us?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.740
a, b and c are different
positive integers.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.750
So what are a, b and c?

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.040
Well let's see, they could
be 1, 2 and 3, right?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.430
Because 1 plus 2 plus
3 is equal to 6.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.610
So there we have it. a, b,
and c are 1, 2 and 3.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.370
So 2 to the a plus 2 to the b
plus 2 to the c is the same

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.590
thing as 2 to the 1, plus
2 squared, plus 2 cubed.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.540
That's equal to 2
plus 4 plus 8.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.800
6 plus 8 is equal to 14.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.500
That is choice A.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.730
Next problem, I'll switch
colors for variety.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.810
Problem number 8, in the xy
plane, the center of a circle

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.820
has the coordinates
3 comma minus 7.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.750
Let's see if I have
to draw this.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.990
If one endpoint of a diameter of
the circle is minus 2 comma

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.090
7-- so this is an endpoint of
the diameter, this is center--

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.740
what are the coordinates
of the other

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.670
endpoint of this diameter?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.080
Well sure, maybe I'll draw it
for you, just so you get a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.260
sense of all this action
that's going on.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.600
So the center is 3
comma negative 7.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.680
So this is 3-- let me
do it in a different

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.470
color-- 3, minus 7.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.700
So this is the center.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.755
This one diameter is
at negative 2, 7.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.640
Actually, I drew this too big.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.780
So this is one endpoint.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.820
So actually the circle
is going to be huge.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.100
Actually let me redraw this
because it's going to be a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.990
huge circle.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.655
I didn't do this
appropriately.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.510
This is the coordinate axes--
I'll draw it big like this.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.540
So the center-- and I'll do it
in a different color-- the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:45.240
center is at 3, then minus 7.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.300
Right?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.280
And then one endpoint
is at minus 2.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.660
Oh no.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.610
You know what?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.500
I misread the problem.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.790
The other endpoint is
at minus 2, minus 7.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.810
So the other endpoint is
here, minus 2, minus 7.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.770
So it's here.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.570
So I could use this graph.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.840
So the other endpoint
is minus 2, minus 7.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.445
It shows you how important
it is to read

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:09.990
these problems properly.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.840
So if you drew the circle,
the circle actually looks

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.090
something like this.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.899
The important thing to realize--
and you actually

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.750
didn't even have to draw the
circle-- is that this

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.420
diameter, it. this is
the diameter that

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.760
they're talking about.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.310
I know I'm drawing it kind of
funny, but this is the point

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.670
right here, 3, minus 7.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.240
This is minus 2, minus 7.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.320
So to go from this point to this
point we didn't change

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.330
our y-coordinates.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.430
We just changed x.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.970
What did we do?

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.710
We went how far back?

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.990
We went from x equals 3
to x equals minus 2.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.300
So we went 5 back, right?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.600
So the other endpoint of the
diameter-- we just have to go

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.840
5 in this direction.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.950
So if we started x equals
3, we're going to end up

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.840
with x equals 8.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.440
Then the y is going to stay the
same because we're moving

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.780
horizontally.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.190
So it's 8, negative 7.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.520
That is choice E.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.440
Sorry for misreading it at
first, but that shows it can

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.460
happen to the best of us.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.280
No, just kidding.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.720
I'm not even the best of us.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.970
All right, next problem.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:30.110
9, a regulation for riding a
certain amusement park ride

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.110
requires that a child be between
30 inches and 50

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.440
inches tall.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.280
So between 30, so height has to
be greater than 30 and less

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.920
than 50 inches tall.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.930
Fair enough.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.590
Which of the following
inequalities can be used to

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.680
determine whether or not a
child's height satisfies the

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.830
regulation for this ride?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.600
OK, so they are essentially just
rewriting this equation

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.870
and saying it as
absolute value.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.670
A number line could probably
be useful here.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.400
So if I say-- that's my
number line-- this is

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.130
30 and this is 50.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.770
We know, just from this
inequality, that my height can

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.620
be anywhere around here.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.440
Whenever I see these absolute
value problems, they're really

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.740
picking kind of a median, or the
middle point, between the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.760
two, and they're using the
absolute value to say, well my

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.120
distance away from that middle
point can't be more than a

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.210
certain amount.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.550
So what you can do is you can
pick the middle point.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.410
If you want to convert this
into an absolute value

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.010
equation, you pick
the middle point.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.030
So what's the middle point?

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.390
30 plus 50 is 80.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.780
The middle point is 40, right?

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.430
I should have been able to do it
in my head because it's 10

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.110
away from each other.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.090
So we can say-- instead of
saying that the height has to

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.580
be greater than 30 or the height
has to be less than

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.750
50-- we could say that the
difference between the height

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:02.270
and 40, and it's absolute
value-- we don't care if the

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.620
height is less than 40 or
greater than 40-- but that

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.790
absolute distance between
the height and 40 can't

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.605
be more than what?

00:07:09.605 --> 00:07:12.620
Well, we can't go more than 10
to the positive and we can't

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.640
go more than 10 to
the negative.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.860
So the absolute value has
to be less than 10.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.415
That's how you should
[? convert ?]

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:18.600
this.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.190
If you wanted to convert this
to absolute value, how they

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.810
tend to do it on the SAT, pick
the average point and then

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.150
figure out how far can you
vary from the average?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.820
The average point was 40, and
you can vary at most 10.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.850
So the difference between
the height and 40 has to

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.630
be less than 10.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.860
This could also have been
written as 40 minus h

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.220
is less than 10.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.490
But the choice is h minus
40 is less than 10, and

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.200
that is choice D.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:57.850
Problem 10, a right, circular
cylinder with radius 5 and

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.600
height 4 has volume V.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.330
In terms of V-- oh
look at that.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.560
OK.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.530
So a right, circular cylinder,
so it looks like this.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.210
That's the base.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.350
That's the top of
the cylinder.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.000
Then you have a line like that
and you have a line like that.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.640
What are they telling us?

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.280
They're telling us
it's radius 5.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:34.620
So this distance is 5,
radius 5, height 4.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.870
The volume is V.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.150
OK, so the volume is V.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.250
So what does V equal?

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.850
So V is equal to-- you just
have to figure out

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:46.986
the area of the space.

00:08:46.986 --> 00:08:48.820
Actually I have a minute left.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.060
So I'm going to do problem
number 10 in the next video so

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.770
as to not rush
