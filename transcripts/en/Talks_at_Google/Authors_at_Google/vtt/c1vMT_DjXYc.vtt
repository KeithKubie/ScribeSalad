00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.180
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you to everyone

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.540
for joining us here today and
sharing your lunch time with us

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.200
to welcome Cara Alter.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.250
I know that many of
you have read this.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.710
And this is why
you're here today.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.219
So I want to share a little bit
about what you haven't read,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.630
and how we were fortunate
enough to meet Cara and bring

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.490
her back to Google, because
she's been here consulting

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.500
for us in the past.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.030
I was at the professional
businesswomen's conference

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.660
with several of
our women leaders.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.970
And as we went back to
the table at lunchtime,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.530
everyone had the same feedback.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.259
Did you go to that talk,
that Cara Alter talk?

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:38.800
Oh my god, that
totally blew me away.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.440
And we encouraged
other folks to go.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.440
And then we were
fortunate enough

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650
to speak to her after
the talk, and convince

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.150
her to come back to Google and
share her message with many

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.860
of us.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.350
So a little bit more
about Cara-- she's

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.220
provided training
on public speaking

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.250
and managing nervousness
to some of the world's

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.550
best known companies, including
Alliance, Caterpillar eBay,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.960
Gap, Google Ideas
and Williams-Sonoma.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.460
And what we really
loved about her talk

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.700
was how approachable
her methods were,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.660
and how it was
really easy for us

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.780
to take a lot of what she
shared to the forefront right

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.910
after the talk.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.970
So thank you, Cara, for
joining us here today.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.200
CARA HALE ALTER:
Hello, everyone.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.040
Great.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.680
This conversation
is going to look

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.530
like a conversation
about public speaking,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.300
because it's pretty formalized,
in that I'm standing up here

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.674
at the front of
the room, and you

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:37.070
are sitting in audience mode.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.750
But this is really about
the image that you project.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.630
And that can be one on one,
or around the conference room

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.670
table, or standing up
to give a presentation.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.597
But this is about inspiring
confidence in your abilities.

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:54.180
There are some people,
just in the way

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.160
that they carry
themselves, you immediately

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.210
have faith that they
can get the job done,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.220
whatever the job might be.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.210
And some people do it with a
big, bold, dynamic personality.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.180
And some people do it with
a very calm, down-to-earth

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.500
demeanor.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.410
But whatever the style,
you just believe in them.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.350
The fallacy is that those
kinds of positive assessments

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.860
that we make about
other people--

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.890
that they're all very
subjective, that they're

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.710
based on nuanced or
indefinable criteria.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.250
And I've spent the last 20
years of my life researching

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.850
how human beings assess
other human beings.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.140
And the bottom line is that
there are ground rules.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.450
There are metrics.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.990
Certain behaviors lead to
very predictable assessments

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.740
on the part of the listener.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.250
So you can better
understand what behaviors

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.030
lead to what assessments.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.210
You can just be more in charge
of the image that's coming

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.300
across on the other side.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.470
Are you aware that
certain facial expressions

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.090
are hardwired into us?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.760
Not all facial expressions, but
certain core facial expressions

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.080
like fear, joy, anger, grief.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.380
And it's why we can read facial
expressions across cultures,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.890
or why babies can read facial
expressions a very early age.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.160
Well, the same thing is true
for your body language signals.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.380
A significant portion of
your body language signals

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.580
are what we call universal--
how human beings assess

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.220
other human beings.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.420
And so I'll give you
an example of one--

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.180
keeping your head level.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.090
So literally being
level-headed is

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.670
a show of confidence across
the globe, wherever you go.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.970
Now whether you should show
confidence is a value system.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.450
And sometimes that changes
from culture to culture.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.950
Sometimes, in some
cultures, being deferential

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.630
is a far better
way to do business.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.310
But being level-headed is a show
of confidence wherever you go.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.760
If I raise my chin
just a bit, this

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.470
is a very high-status
position to be in.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.700
And if I continue to speak
to you with my chin just

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.370
a little bit high, you
are very likely to find

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.930
me a little condescending,
a little arrogant.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.110
Can you see that?

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.690
If I lower my chin just a
bit, this is a very low status

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.850
position to be in.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.330
And if I continue to speak
to you with my chin low,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.640
you're very likely to find me
a little shy or differential,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.380
and especially if
I tilt my head.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.170
Now whether or not
I personally am

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.780
aware of the
position of my chin--

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.310
because I could be oblivious
to what's happening up here--

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.150
it is still having an
impact on your side.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.900
And even your side,
you're not consciously

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.670
aware of what behavior is
sending the message, because it

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.780
just happened so fast in there.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.120
So if I had started today
with my chin up like this,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.320
and said, hello,
everybody, I'm very

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.617
excited to have this
opportunity to talk with you,

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.560
you would all begin to
make an assessment of me

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.480
really quickly.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.280
And your exact adjective
would be up to you,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.860
but you would all be leaning
in the same direction.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.380
But it is doubtful
that any of you

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.020
would have identified
that it was

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.610
my chin that was bothering you.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.432
I mean, you wouldn't
leave afterwards and say,

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:08.520
you know, Cara was OK, but
her chin-- it was so high.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.340
You would just be stuck
with your assessment of me.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.530
So that's why it's
my job as the speaker

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.980
to be very aware of the
signals that I'm sending out,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.770
because they're having an impact
whether I am aware of them

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.100
or not.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.820
And have you heard
studies about how long

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.800
it takes for someone to come
up with an assessment of you?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.270
AUDIENCE: Under 30 seconds.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.686
CARA HALE ALTER:
Under 30 seconds,

00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:30.760
seconds, right, so seconds.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.040
I recently read the
research from Nalini Ambady.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.150
She was highlighted in the book
"Blank" by Malcolm Gladwell.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.900
But she is the researcher who
coined the term "thin-slicing",

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.290
which is our ability to see
a pattern in just a very thin

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.930
slice of information.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.900
In one of her
research projects, she

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.880
showed people videotapes
of individual strangers.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.080
She had them assign
adjectives that they

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.510
would use to describe
the person on the screen.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.944
And at first, she showed the
videotapes for two minutes.

00:06:04.944 --> 00:06:06.860
But then she just cut
it back and cut it back.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.370
And she got down to two seconds.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.260
And she found that
the adjectives people

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.880
would use to describe the
stranger on the screen

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.640
were the same whether
they had the opportunity

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.590
to see the videotape for two
minutes or for two seconds.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.169
That's pretty amazing.

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.710
Actually, it's
amazing on two levels.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.300
First of all, it's amazing
that it happens so quickly.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.990
But more importantly for
today's conversation,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.150
it's amazing that there's
general agreement.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.870
When we watch a
videotape of a stranger,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.820
we will all use about
the same adjectives

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.540
to describe that person.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.432
So if that is true, there
have got to be ground rules.

00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:51.140
And so that's really
what the credibility

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.420
code is all about-- what
are the ground rules?

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.080
What are these behaviors?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.470
How much impact do they have?

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.490
How much control do
you have over them?

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.540
I had the pleasure to
have worked with Google

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.080
over the last few years.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.890
So I know a good deal
about your culture.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.470
And in a workshop, early
on in the workshop,

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.420
one of the things that
comes up is a conversation

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.850
about authenticity.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.390
Because there's a high value
here on being authentic.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.927
And I want to knowledge
that and support it.

00:07:23.927 --> 00:07:25.510
I want you to know,
I believe that you

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.441
are going to be at your best
if you're first yourself.

00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:30.940
And that it is really great if
you have some strong speaking

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.530
skills on your side.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.160
So I want you to think
about the ground rules

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.480
that I'm about to lay out,
like the rules of punctuation

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.470
or grammar.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.280
As a writer, we don't feel
inauthentic in our writing

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.370
because we're following
the rules of punctuation

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.710
and grammar.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.430
And you wouldn't say,
as a writer, well,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.390
we're all following
the exact same rules.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.320
How will my unique
voice come through?

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.840
So the truth is, if
you aren't following

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.930
the rules of
punctuation or grammar,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.522
people aren't likely to
pay attention to you.

00:08:05.522 --> 00:08:07.230
And there are some
really talented people

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.100
who can break the rules.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.520
So let's acknowledge that, too.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.840
And just makes it
more interesting--

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.140
I give you permission
to break the rules, too.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.330
But break the rule because
you know the power of it

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.410
and you choose to do it
differently, as opposed to just

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.900
being oblivious as to how that
behavior might come across.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.670
All right, I've broken
the conversation up

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.680
into three sections-- first,
what I call the basics.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.720
And these are those
behaviors that you

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.650
need to do just to get those
basic level adjectives,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.929
where someone might
describe you as comfortable,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.580
competent, capable, credible.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.747
Of course, you want
that as your baseline.

00:08:46.747 --> 00:08:49.080
And then we'll talk about
those things you shouldn't do.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.080
I call those derailers--
so those behaviors that are

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.181
almost always invisible to us.

00:08:54.181 --> 00:08:55.680
We don't know that
they're going on,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.840
but they nonetheless
undercut our image.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.580
And then I'll talk about
the perfect balance

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.780
between being authoritative
on the one side

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.230
to being approachable
on the other.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.890
And the best
communicators of all

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.540
know how to do both
at the same time.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.420
And just to give
you a quick preview,

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.910
I will show you what it's like
to lean too heavily in one

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.530
direction or the other.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.640
If you're using a lot of
authoritative behaviors,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.380
and I just kicked into a
few more of them right now,

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.140
you're very likely to come
across as capable, competent,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.630
an expert.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.850
But if you rely too
heavily on these behaviors,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:39.030
you could also come across
as unreceptive or inflexible,

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.530
which isn't going
to help you create

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.960
a relationship with the
person on the other side.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.359
On the other end
of the spectrum,

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:47.400
if you're using a lot of
approachable behaviors--

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.900
and I just kicked into a few
more of those right now-- well,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.490
you're very likely to come
across as interactive,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.040
personable, maybe even dynamic.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.580
But if you rely too
heavily on these behaviors,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.470
you could also come
across as a light-weight--

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.850
nice, but inconsequential.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.340
So you need to have a
balance between both sides.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.490
And if you personally
know that you

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.500
need to bolster one end of
the spectrum or the other,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.080
I will give very
specific behaviors that

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.490
tend to send those messages.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.040
OK, going back up to the top,
the very first thing someone

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.810
notices about you is
the visual picture.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.110
So your body language
has a big impact

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.310
on your appearance of
credibility and confidence.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:37.190
The three pillars that hold up
your appearance of leadership

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.500
presence, of credibility,
of personal presence,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:47.480
are strong posture, strong
voice, strong eye contact.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.220
If you're doing
those three things,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.340
you are going to look good--
strong posture, strong voice,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.730
and strong eye contact.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.630
Now most people have heard some
version of this advice before.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.270
It's not like it's a brand
new concept out there.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.110
But most people severely
underestimate just how

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.190
important those behaviors are.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.270
So let me be explicit.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.220
Strong posture means that
if you're standing up,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.307
your weight is balanced
equally over both feet.

00:11:17.307 --> 00:11:18.890
And whether you're
seated or standing,

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:24.720
your spine and your shoulders
form a T, like a metal T bar.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.090
And this area right
here is rock solid,

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.822
has literal core strength.

00:11:30.822 --> 00:11:33.030
So notice how if I allow
myself to have just a little

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.060
more wishy-washiness
in my spine,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.050
I lose a lot of my
executive presence.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.830
So you have literal core
strength through here.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.490
Then your head and shoulders
move independently.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.260
So your head moves like a
camera on a tripod, which

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.160
means I can look over here,
and I can look over here,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.280
and I can look over here.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.990
What's not happening is this.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.550
Again, I'm back to
wishy-washy or being

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.820
a little kid in trouble.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.910
And think about how eagles and
owls survey their surroundings.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.350
We call them regal and wise.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.190
And then one more--
your nose has

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.920
to point directly toward the
person you're speaking to.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.410
So if I'm looking
at you, my nose

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.060
points directly towards you.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.440
And if I look at you, my
nose points directly to you.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.160
Notice what happens
when my eyes move

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.090
a little more
independently of my nose.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.810
I'm very likely to
look uncomfortable.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:34.650
But I could also look sneaky,
or mischievous, or judgmental,

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.490
or skeptical.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.710
Have you heard the phrase,
looking out the corner

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.740
of your eye at someone?

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.120
What does that mean?

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.780
Reticent, questioning.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.580
So if you want to come
across as straightforward,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.870
you have to literally be
straight on with the person

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.320
you are speaking to.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.280
There's a concept
in communication

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.162
that is called marked and
unmarked communication.

00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:03.370
And ultimately, what we're
trying to do with our body

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.570
language signals is
unmark the communication,

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.270
so that the power of our
words will take precedent.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.970
Sometimes we're sending
some accidental signal

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.450
that sends a mixed message.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.140
And so let me give you an
example of how this played out

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:16.750
recently.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.670
I was working with a
group of teenagers--

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.260
actually a group of young
mothers in a job placement

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.310
program.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.390
And one of the young
women said to me,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.620
parents and teachers say
that I show attitude.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.720
And I don't get what they mean
by that, because I really don't

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.180
feel like I show attitude.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.300
But she said it to me like this.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.890
Parents and teachers say
that I show attitude,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.330
and I don't get-- you need
to straighten that out.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.940
So if I look at
you this way, this

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.190
is unmarked, straightforward
communication--

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.900
me just talking to you.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.760
And as soon as I start
to move my chin around,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.180
it marks the communication.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.890
So if you want to unmark the
communication so people will

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.660
really hear what
you have to say,

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.860
you need to be literally
straight on, direct.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.820
So here's the takeaway in
this particular section--

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.910
if you want someone
to describe you

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.500
as having a strong
spine and a level head,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.810
you need to literally have a
strong spine and a level head.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.410
And if you want
someone to describe

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.050
you as straightforward
and direct,

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.140
you have to literally be
straightforward and direct.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.870
It is pretty amazing
how the language we use

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.250
is a literal translation of the
attribute we are describing.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.830
So standing with your weight
balanced over both feet,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.610
how might you describe me?

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:48.330
Grounded, balanced, on solid
footing, upright, strong spine,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.640
firm backbone, level-headed,
head square on my shoulders,

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.710
standing on my own two feet,
not easily pushed over.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.130
There are so many positive
metaphors here-- fully evolved.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.530
So you want to make
sure-- oh, and let's

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:06.610
take some negative metaphors--
being a slouch, or shifty,

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.440
or unbalanced, or crooked.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.080
So you want to physically
embody the metaphors

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.649
you want people to use
when describing you.

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:19.940
All right, now if you just
learned in this conversation

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.660
that you should
stand stock still,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.540
well, that would
be a problem, too.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.510
Because part of
leadership presence

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.820
of looking perfectly
comfortable is fluidity,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.820
owning the space around you.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.820
So your core provides the
solidity and your hands

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.800
and your facial gestures
provide the fluidity,

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.360
the interactivity.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.550
Hand gestures are hard
wired into all of us.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.340
They're are a form
of communication

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.120
that's deeper and older
than verbal communication.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.990
And even blind people
gesture when they speak.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.920
It's not something
we learn visually.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.150
It's hardwired.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.640
But what is most interesting
about hand gestures is

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.670
that they are an unconscious
communication process, which

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.150
means when you are
not thinking about it,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.530
your hands are very much
engaged in the conversation.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.425
And as soon as you become
self-conscious-- as soon

00:16:17.425 --> 00:16:21.420
as you begin to think
about the hands--

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.550
you have no idea what to
do with these appendages

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.730
at the end of your arms.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.000
And when that
happens, we tend to go

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.100
into some sort of lock-down
mode, or I call it masking,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.330
masked mode.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.900
And it's that apparent
self-consciousness

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.810
that gives away the fact
that you are intimidated

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.250
or nervous by the situation.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.090
When we are perfectly
comfortable,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.880
our hands talk when we talk.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.300
If you want to exhibit
executive presence,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.250
personal presence,
the second your mouth

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.880
begins moving your body
language has to talk, too.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.860
Because what intimidation looks
like is your mouth is moving,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:09.000
but no other body language
signal is online yet.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.280
You don't have to learn
how to hand gesture.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.528
You gesture hundreds
upon hundreds of times

00:17:13.528 --> 00:17:14.319
throughout the day.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.829
It's not a skill
you need to learn.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:21.109
What you need to
learn is not to mask,

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:24.640
not to allow yourself to go
into these lock-down positions

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.410
when you are, in
fact, intimidated

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.160
or nervous by the situation.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.090
And the way to counteract that
is to reach out, literally.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:39.100
Another literal metaphor-- reach
out, hand them information.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.790
And by the way, this gesture
where I reach out and hand you

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.020
information, is the
most common hand gesture

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.920
we use when we are talking--
hands reaching out.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.670
And you can do it when
you welcome people.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.280
I could say, hello, everybody.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.810
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.697
I'm excited to have
this chance to talk

00:17:56.697 --> 00:17:57.780
to you about this project.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.010
So you can do it as a welcome.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.610
But you can also do it when
delivering facts and figures.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.940
I could say, the towers
of the Golden Gate Bridge

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.960
are 746 feet above
the water line.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.280
So it doesn't matter what
you're talking about.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.570
Hand them the information.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.909
Since hand gesturing
is unconscious,

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:21.700
you might have to get
over a learning curve

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.960
where thinking about reaching
out is a little weird at first.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.060
You have to do it enough
times that your brain stops

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.880
having a conversation about it.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.800
And usually that happens about
20 times practicing anything.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.540
So everybody do this
for me for a second.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.330
Close, put your hands
like this, and just know

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.366
what thumb is on top.

00:18:42.366 --> 00:18:43.270
And now switch.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.640
Yeah, feel a little weird?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.310
Exactly, but there's nothing
more natural than this or this.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.000
It's just one is
habitual and one is not.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.260
Now if every single day
for about 20 seconds

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.170
for the next 20 days, you
did this-- the other thumb

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.204
on top-- by that time
you might begin to think,

00:19:03.204 --> 00:19:04.370
which one did I like better?

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.060
I've forgotten.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.842
So if you just keep
doing the behavior,

00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:10.300
pretty soon your
brain doesn't have

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.030
to have a conversation about it,
doesn't feel unnatural anymore.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.550
And that would be true about
opening up your body language

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.440
signals on purpose.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.600
But let's practice.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.810
I know we have some people
in remote audiences.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.150
So I want you to practice, too.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.530
I want everybody to stand up.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.610
Stand with your weight balanced
equally over both feet.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.890
And where your feet should
be depends on your gender.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.690
This is not a societal issue.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.220
This is about balance point,
because for women, our center

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.940
of gravity tends
to be-- not always,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.750
but tends to be-- in our hips.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.860
So the most balanced
place for your feet

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.450
would be directly
underneath those hip joints,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.130
directly underneath
those joints.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.350
And for men, because
your center of gravity

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.790
tends to be in your shoulders,
the most balanced place

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.340
for your feet would be directly
underneath your shoulder

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.440
joints, which is a
little wide for me.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.570
And I don't know if
you can see my feet,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.860
but this is another example
of marked and unmarked

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.930
communication.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.510
This is not a natural
position for my feet.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.450
So if I stood like
this, it would

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.420
look like I'm trying to tell
you something with my body

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.320
language-- a little
extra message coming on.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.690
So this is the much more
natural position for my feet.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.160
And for men, the same
thing would happen.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.220
If you stand with your feet
a little too close together,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.290
it marks it in the other
direction, certainly

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.300
but it will look a
little unnatural.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.210
So just so you know, in all of
my research about body language

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:33.540
signals, I filter for, what
does natural look like?

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.490
So basically, we could
do it on purpose,

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.330
even if we're not feeling
natural or comfortable.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.410
I am firmly in the school of
"fake it till you make it."

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.230
But one reason that's
true is that when

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.890
you begin to embody
these skills,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.300
you really do you begin to feel
internal authentic confidence.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.659
So I support that.

00:20:50.659 --> 00:20:52.950
All right, so you're standing
with your weight balanced

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.167
over both feet.

00:20:54.167 --> 00:20:55.000
Hands by your sides.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.840
Most people feel a little
uncomfortable with their hands

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.810
by their sides, but this
is a natural position,

00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.980
believe it or not.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.240
So make sure your head can move
independently on your head,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.610
like a camera on a tripod.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.930
Now some people tell me
that they feel stiff.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.260
Are you feeling a little stiff?

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.892
So let me show you
what stiff looks like.

00:21:13.892 --> 00:21:15.607
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:17.940
So your head and your shoulders
moving together-- that's

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.124
what stiff looks like.

00:21:19.124 --> 00:21:20.540
And your head
moving independently

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.600
on your shoulders-- that's
what loose looks like.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.225
And if you were
sitting on a park bench

00:21:24.225 --> 00:21:25.980
somewhere, looking
around, your head

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.230
would be moving independently.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.560
You wouldn't be turning
as you looked around.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.200
All right, so now
pick up your arms

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.890
like you're holding the biggest
ball you could possibly hold,

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.920
but your fingers are
touching-- huge ball

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.460
but your fingers are touching.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.540
Where your fingers
are touching, put that

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.000
in front of your belly button.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.250
Draw that circle in you mind.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:50.570
Really see that circle in your
mind, and then drop your arms.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.920
This is your personal space.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.630
So now show me with
your hands this way

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.338
that you are perfectly
comfortable moving

00:21:56.338 --> 00:21:58.760
in this bubble of
space in front of you.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.780
If you reach past this
space, OK, that's weird.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.530
But this space belongs to you.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.290
This is your personal territory.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.350
And try to avoid the
T Rex version of this.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:11.344 --> 00:22:12.260
That's not it, either.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.640
OK, so you want to
prove that you're

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.431
perfectly comfortable
whether you're seated

00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:17.870
or standing, the second
you're mouth begins moving,

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.310
allow your body
language to say, hey,

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.920
I'm comfortable here in
this space in front of me.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.920
You may now have a seat.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.990
All right, so there we
have strong posture.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.780
And when I say posture, I
really mean posture gesture.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.050
They go together like two
sides of the same coin.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.640
They really have
to happen together.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.650
But now strong voice--
there's a big difference

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.590
between being technically
understandable

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.632
and really reaching people.

00:22:45.632 --> 00:22:47.340
And I want to hit this
point pretty hard,

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.060
because this is where
most people have

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.520
an opportunity for growth.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.730
In a workshop, if I can
have the opportunity

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.860
to give someone
individualized feedback,

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.170
I use a metric from
1 to 5, that goes

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.510
from just being OK to
truly being exceptional,

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.730
to evaluate that skill.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.139
So for volume, let me give
you my scale from 1 to 5

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:10.930
so you can hear what
this might sound like.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.107
One on a scale with
volume-- well, 1,

00:23:13.107 --> 00:23:14.440
you wouldn't be able to hear me.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.356
So I'm actually not going
to demonstrate that.

00:23:16.356 --> 00:23:18.940
But you get the idea--
1, couldn't hear me.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.940
2 is a bit like
this, which means

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.810
you have to work pretty
hard at hearing me.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.007
Now you can hear me.

00:23:24.007 --> 00:23:26.340
Actually, the microphone's
not helping, but there we go.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:26.880
You can hear me.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.588
It's just that you're
doing all the work.

00:23:28.588 --> 00:23:31.410
So this is Level
2, below average.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.800
Level 3's about like this.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.750
Level 3 is average.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.260
And most people, by the way,
speak at average volume.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.000
It's OK.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.280
It's adequate.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.797
And if you like being
described as adequate, it's OK.

00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:45.130
Level 4 is hopefully where
I've been speaking all along.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.280
Now with this volume, I'm
coming all the way to you.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.200
I don't expect you to do the
work in this communication.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.710
So 4 means optimal
for that situation.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.155
It's always a sliding scale.

00:23:57.155 --> 00:23:59.000
It depends on the
size of the room,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.700
the acoustics, the background
noise, the situation itself.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.710
Level 5 is that one step too
far, where if, at Level 4,

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.810
I was really making a
connection with you, at Level 5

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.450
you begin to put up boundaries.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:18.670
It's a really big drop from 4,
getting the perfect connection,

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.970
to 5, getting you the
opposite of what you want.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.500
People put up barriers.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.530
Most people
intuitively know this--

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.570
that if you come on too strong,
people will put up barriers.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:35.490
So they gravitate to the
safety of the average zone.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.390
And that is the
most common mistake

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.300
I see anywhere I go-- people
who are willing to be average.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.600
Most people would
consider it an insult

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.330
to be described as average,
and yet that's the safety zone.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.540
Unless you have gotten
feedback in the past

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.470
that you really are too loud
at work on a regular basis--

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.580
it doesn't count at home.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.240
Because the thing is, the
more comfortable we are,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.446
the louder we get.

00:25:02.446 --> 00:25:04.070
So it doesn't count
if you get feedback

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.278
at home that you're too loud.

00:25:05.278 --> 00:25:07.710
But if you get feedback on
a regular basis that you're

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.780
too loud at work, or
too much, or too big,

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.610
or something along that line,
OK, pay attention to that.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.070
But if that does not come
your way on a regular basis,

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.590
you have room to expand.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:22.890
You can just bump it up a notch
and you will be more effective.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.130
The payoff is huge.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.290
The stronger your volume,
the more confident,

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.520
the more comfortable, the more
authoritative you come across.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.570
For articulation-- and that's
the clarity with which you

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.890
pronounce your consonants--
the more clearly you enunciate,

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.180
the more intelligent
you come across,

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.020
the more attentive to details.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.330
So for example, if I'm
using this especially clean

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.430
articulation, it's going
to be very hard for you

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.830
not to get the impression
that I'm attentive to details.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.702
Because my articulation
is attentive to details.

00:25:58.702 --> 00:26:00.660
But if I'm using the type
of articulation right

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.500
this very second, I know you
can understand what I'm saying,

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.170
but I doubt that I
sound as intelligent

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.110
as I did just a second ago.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.630
So it's not about being
technically understood.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.990
It's helping them to get
the right impression of you.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.510
And the more clearly you
enunciate, the more intelligent

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.180
you will sound.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.250
For pacing-- that is your
words per minute-- in general,

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.280
the more slowly you speak,
the more comfortable, the more

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.970
confident, and the
more authoritative.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.210
And this makes sense.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.100
If I'm speaking
slowly, I indicate

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.060
that I have the authority
to take up your time.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.100
But also, we tend to associate
nervousness and pace.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.300
And so if you just
speak quickly,

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.420
purely as a matter
of habit, you are

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.470
likely to come across as less
comfortable because of it.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.970
Expression-- the
more expression you

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.370
bring to the conversation,
the more personable,

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.130
the more dynamic, the more
engaging you will come across.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.440
And then the last one
on my list is resonance.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.570
Resonance is your vocal quality.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.630
It's the tone, the timbre,
the texture of your voice.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.630
And on this pie chart
that is your vocal image,

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.405
it takes up the most
space-- takes up

00:27:13.405 --> 00:27:16.280
a lot of space on that list.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.085
So let me bump up the
level of resonance

00:27:18.085 --> 00:27:19.460
in my voice at
the moment, so you

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.010
know what I'm talking about.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.510
Right now, when I'm
speaking to you,

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.800
there's a lot more
rumble to my voice

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.844
than there was a moment ago.

00:27:26.844 --> 00:27:29.385
Now if I began this conversation
with this level of resonance

00:27:29.385 --> 00:27:32.760
in my voice, you would
be thinking to yourself--

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.192
why is she talking like that?

00:27:35.192 --> 00:27:35.900
Because I get it.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.640
It's too much.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.750
But you get the idea
of what resonance is.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.060
I can do a lot of things wrong.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.860
But if I have
resonance in my voice,

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.300
I'm going to sound like a
force to be reckoned with.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.744
So for example, if I'm using
this level of resonance

00:27:52.744 --> 00:27:54.910
in my voice, but I'm giving
you some classic signals

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.150
that I'm very uncomfortable
up here, because I'm

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.540
crossing my legs, and
playing with my fingernails,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.560
and darting my eyes.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.180
Even though my body
language signals

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.080
are screaming that
I'm uncomfortable,

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.675
my voice is compensating
heavily in the other direction.

00:28:08.675 --> 00:28:10.800
And so would be hard to
get the impression I lacked

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.710
a certain personal power.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.580
But this can work
against you as well.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.970
I can give you lots
of physical signals

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.230
that I'm in charge-- balanced
weight, fluid gestures,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.464
direct eye contact.

00:28:22.464 --> 00:28:24.130
But if I pull back
on my speaking voice,

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.630
and now I have this little,
teeny speaking voice,

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.210
even though my body language
signals are nice and strong,

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:33.360
I'm not going to look like I
have a lot of personal power.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.420
The quality of your voice
says such a strong platform

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.480
for how seriously someone's
going to take you.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.010
And the quick fix
for bringing out

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:47.230
more resonance, more texture
to your voice-- speak up.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.580
Speak at optimal volume.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.910
That is the easiest
way to get there.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.760
Now, the deeper dive--
the technical thing

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.990
that's happening-- is you need
to get your diaphragm engaged.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.100
So right now, my diaphragm
is working overtime.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.410
And right now, my diaphragm's
not working at all.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.409
So that is the technical
thing that's happening.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.200
So let's do a couple
of exercises for that,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.050
so you can experience what
it's like to engage this area.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.850
To shortcut, I'm calling
this the diaphragm.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.660
But please recognize
there are lots

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.962
of muscles working in concert.

00:29:15.962 --> 00:29:16.920
You have the diaphragm.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.050
You have the abdominal muscles,
the intercostal muscles.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.030
But I'm just going to
shortcut, say diaphragm.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.930
We want to get this engaged.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.880
So in order to feel this area
engage, I want all of you

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.620
to say "shh" really loud.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.250
Here we go.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.660
Shh.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.080
No, twice as loud.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.066
Here we go.

00:29:33.066 --> 00:29:34.270
Shh.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:37.150
Great, so did you feel
this tuck under there?

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.570
I could see it happening,
so that's great.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.170
Excellent, so that's your
diaphragm being engaged.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.090
If you know anything
about exercise physiology,

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.072
you know that to build
any muscle group,

00:29:48.072 --> 00:29:50.030
you have to put it under
a little bit of strain

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.750
and then it'll get stronger.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.340
So we're going to put this area
under a little bit of strain.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.590
I want you to say the days of
the week all in one breath.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.800
And I want you to elongate the
vowels so that you can't take

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.210
a rest in between each sound.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.640
It's not going to sound normal.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.637
It might sound something
like this-- Monday, Tuesday.

00:30:10.637 --> 00:30:12.970
So that's what we're going
to do-- days of the week, all

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.350
in one breath, nice and loud.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.840
Here we go.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:29.858
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

00:30:29.858 --> 00:30:30.358
Sunday.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.170
Now you really should have
felt that toward the end.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.070
Now if you didn't feel it, you
probably took a catch breath.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.020
So try to avoid doing that.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.820
If you really didn't
take a catch breath

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.070
and you still
didn't feel it, you

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.890
weren't talking loud
enough, because I

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.200
have a really strong diaphragm.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.130
I can feel this any time I
want to just by getting louder.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.434
So you can get louder.

00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:53.850
But you could also
make it longer.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.860
You could do the months of the
year, or count from 1 to 30.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.590
You can definitely can
make this exercise work.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.190
Most people do not like that
feeling of the diaphragm

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.620
being so connected.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.220
And so we end up with
this kind of pattern--

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.300
the beginning of the
sentence is nice and strong

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.550
because there's plenty of air.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.519
But as soon as the
diaphragm begins to squeeze,

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:13.060
the person just
relaxes the diaphragm

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.737
and keeps talking anyway to
the end of their sentence.

00:31:15.737 --> 00:31:18.320
Next sentence, plenty of air at
the beginning of the sentence,

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.986
but then they just
relax that diaphragm,

00:31:19.986 --> 00:31:22.075
sometimes trail off down
here for a very long time

00:31:22.075 --> 00:31:23.866
before they reach the
end of that sentence.

00:31:23.866 --> 00:31:26.810
So you have to either breathe
more often, which is fine,

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.370
or develop more stamina.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.160
So basically stick the landing.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.290
Make sure you always speak to
the ends of your sentences.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:38.180
The diaphragm is
responsible for volume.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.256
Most people grip in
their larynx when

00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:43.380
they increase their volume.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.310
But this area right here
plays very, very little role

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.940
in volume.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.030
All of your effort should
come from this down here.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.960
So to practice this, we're
going to count from 1 to 5.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.040
And I want you to get
incrementally louder.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.540
So when you say one, it's as
if you were speaking to someone

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.140
two feet in front of you.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.870
And by the time
you say five, you

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.880
are talking to
someone 30 feet away.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.370
I will demonstrate first.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:12.880
One, two, three, four, five.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.667
So you hear I got
incrementally louder?

00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:16.000
All right, let's try that scale.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.403
I should hear a huge difference
between one and five.

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:19.822
Here we go.

00:32:19.822 --> 00:32:24.574
AUDIENCE: One two,
three, four, five.

00:32:24.574 --> 00:32:26.240
CARA HALE ALTER: All
right, pretty good.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.170
So I heard an increase
in volume, for sure.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.120
I also heard an
increase in pitch.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.920
Now when your pitch goes
up with your volume,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.847
that's what yelling sounds like.

00:32:38.847 --> 00:32:40.930
So right this very second
when I'm talking to you,

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.750
my volume is not
hurting your ears,

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.190
but my pitch would
drive you crazy,

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:46.800
because I'm yelling at you.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.070
So when you say five, you
can't say (HIGH PITCHED) five.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.302
You have to say
(NORMAL PITCH) five.

00:32:53.302 --> 00:32:54.760
All right, so let's
try that again.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.135
This time, don't let your
pitch go up as you're speaking.

00:32:57.135 --> 00:32:58.460
Nice and easy on one.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.360
ALL TOGETHER: One,
two, three, four, five.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.290
CARA HALE ALTER: Exactly, that's
where your voice lives-- five--

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:06.790
right there.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:07.873
That's where the power is.

00:33:07.873 --> 00:33:09.670
That's where the resonance is.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.090
Try to keep this
area very relaxed.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.370
All right, so there
we have voice.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.560
Eye contact-- in human
communication, eye contact

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.890
is vital.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:26.900
In Western business, eye contact
may be the number one indicator

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.040
of trustworthiness.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.990
Have you heard the phrase,
"Can you look me in the eye

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.420
and say that?"

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.970
So to Westerners
especially, it's

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.990
not just making eye contact.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.700
It's holding eye contact.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.310
It's the duration
of the eye contact.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.450
And across the globe,
there's a wide range

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.550
of what is appropriate
from culture to culture.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:50.520
So you should be very sensitive
to the areas you find yourself

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.280
in.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.830
But in the Western
world especially,

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:57.275
three to five seconds per
person is comfortable.

00:33:57.275 --> 00:33:59.150
So let me give you my
scale from one to five.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.456
You can see what
this looks like.

00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:03.330
One on the scale, I'm
not looking at anybody.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.140
I'm sure you've seen
plenty of speakers

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.655
where he or she just simply
doesn't look at the people

00:34:07.655 --> 00:34:08.900
he or she is talking to.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.110
So this is off the scale
in the wrong direction.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.650
This would be a one.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.560
Level two eye contact is a
scanning sort of eye contact.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.060
And in some schools
of thought, this

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.060
would be considered good,
because my eyes are up

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.420
instead of on the floor.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.810
But in my book, this
isn't good enough.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.310
I'm not really
seeing you out there.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.310
My eyes just happen to
be glancing across yours.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.060
So this is level
two-- below average.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.730
Level three eye contact is
about a second or so per person.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.580
And so what I'm
doing now is fine.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.120
There's nothing wrong with
this level of eye contact.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.540
It's just that I'm missing
so many opportunities

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.285
with this level.

00:34:41.285 --> 00:34:42.909
Level four eye contact,
hopefully, I've

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:43.840
been doing all along.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.670
I really see you over there.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.630
You know that I see you.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.830
We are having a
conversation for a moment.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:54.139
So this is much more organic,
so much more connected, so

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.304
much more like
one-on-one communication.

00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:57.970
And I know you can't
count in your head,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.050
because of course,
your brain is busy.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.700
But the technique is
to look at someone

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.199
until you get to the comma
or the pause in the phrase.

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:06.990
And then you turn and
look at somebody else

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.949
until you get to comma
or pause in that phrase.

00:35:08.949 --> 00:35:10.406
And then you look
at somebody else.

00:35:10.406 --> 00:35:12.060
So you're using your
sentence structure

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.530
as a way of moving
from person to person.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.850
That also keeps it very organic.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.400
There are so many great reasons
to make strong eye contact.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:27.450
One, there is research that
shows the person of highest

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.700
rank or position
in the conversation

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.560
holds eye contact longer
when they are speaking,

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.800
and shorter when
they're listening.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.470
And the opposite
is true of someone

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.810
who has a lower rank or status
in the conversation-- they hold

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.860
eye contact longer when
listening, and shorter when

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.922
they personally are speaking.

00:35:46.922 --> 00:35:49.130
Now I think it's a good idea
to hold eye contact both

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.690
when you are listening and
when you were speaking.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:55.060
But don't accidentally
lower your status.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.012
Because as a listener, you've
been making great eye contact.

00:35:59.012 --> 00:36:00.720
And as soon as your
mouth begins to move,

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.760
you cannot keep the connection.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.980
So you need to at least
balance that out so

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.740
that you can have both
sides of the equation.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.770
Especially because I
work with a lot of people

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.150
who are very technically
minded, sometimes someone

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:19.890
will say to me, Cara, I
just don't feel comfortable

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.690
making eye contact.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.170
It makes me uncomfortable.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:25.670
And I get that.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:30.150
I completely get it, in that
it's such a common issue

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.430
that I definitely understand.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:37.160
But I put it in the category
of someone who might say to me,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.640
you know, I just don't feel
comfortable with computers.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.520
I mean, I've tried.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.100
I'm uncomfortable
with technology.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.220
That's true-- extremely
common out there,

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.180
that people are
uncomfortable with that.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.450
It's just that in
both cases, you

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.800
might have to just get
past that learning curve.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.510
Because if you don't want,
it might hold you back

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.980
from reaching your full
potential in the business

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.297
world.

00:37:03.297 --> 00:37:05.130
All right, one way you
can practice your eye

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.310
contact-- and this
really, really

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.650
works-- take some Post-It
notes, put them up

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.390
on the walls around you or
the chairs in front of you,

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.370
talk about something--
maybe some information

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.659
you have to deliver-- and
look at this Post-It note.

00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:20.950
Then when you get to the
comma or pause in that phrase,

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.000
look at this Post-It note.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.083
When you get to the comma
or pause in that phrase,

00:37:24.083 --> 00:37:25.190
look at this Post-It note.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.810
Because part of
learning eye contact

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:30.770
is just learning the rhythm
and the choreography of what

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.200
it's like to keep
your eyes focused

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.774
and think at the same time.

00:37:35.774 --> 00:37:38.190
And so while of course we want
the human connection-- that

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.240
is absolutely a vital
part of eye contact--

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.750
really seeing people on the
other side-- at least early on,

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.010
there's truly a skill set of
being able to think and keep

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.690
your eyes up at the same time.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.600
And that's one way
to practice that.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.550
All right, so there we have it--
strong posture, strong voice,

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.909
and strong eye contact.

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.700
So far, everything I've
been talking about,

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.460
these are things you should do.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.697
And you really should.

00:38:03.697 --> 00:38:05.780
You're going to look great
if you do these things.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.490
But now let's take a
look at some things

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:11.390
you shouldn't do-- things
that can undercut your image.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:15.065
The number one derailer
out there-- filler words--

00:38:15.065 --> 00:38:19.760
you know, kind of, sort of,
actually, basically, I mean,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.270
right, OK-- of
course, uh's and um's.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:28.940
This behavior is often invisible
to the speaker, and quite often

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.770
invisible to the listener,
until the listener notices.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.190
And then it's like a big,
red flag that goes off.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.060
Have you ever had
that happen to you,

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.643
where you catch on
to someone's filler

00:38:37.643 --> 00:38:41.750
and you start keeping
a little tally?

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.100
I had a woman in one of
my workshops recently,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.630
and there were eight
people in that workshop.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.050
In her introduction, which
lasted about a minute--

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:54.320
she introduced yourself--
she said "you know" 15 times.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.170
When I was giving
her feedback, I said,

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.160
are you aware that you
said "you know" a lot?

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.440
And she wasn't aware she'd
even said it one time.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.830
What was most interesting
is I turned to the rest

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.044
of the group.

00:39:06.044 --> 00:39:07.710
And as I said, eight
people in the room.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.560
I said, did any of you notice?

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.120
Only two out of
eight had noticed.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.550
So it was invisible to
her, and it was also

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.400
invisible to most of them.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.299
This is what we call
selective attention.

00:39:20.299 --> 00:39:22.090
And think goodness for
selective attention,

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.781
or we wouldn't be able to have
a conversation with a friend

00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:26.780
in a crowded restaurant.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.420
We are really good
at tuning into just

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.180
the stream of
information we want,

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.480
and ignoring everything else.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.170
So this is a talent that we
all carry around with us.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.930
So it's true that most of
us have selective attention.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.610
We are trying to
listen to the message

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:42.401
that somebody else is
saying, and we're not

00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:44.350
noticing the filler words.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.800
But once someone catches
on to your filler words,

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.870
oh, game over.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.470
That's all they can
pay attention to

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.100
for a period of time.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.890
And even if they're not noticing
the actual fillers, what

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.260
they are noticing
is a quality of not

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.037
being concise, or focused,
or as direct as you

00:40:03.037 --> 00:40:04.120
might want to come across.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.090
So you just don't want to give
them the ammunition out there.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:12.020
The solution for eliminating
the fillers is to pause.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.950
Leave that white space there,
just that anti-pause there.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.940
And that is absolutely
easier said than done,

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.231
because most people develop
the problem because they're

00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:21.200
uncomfortable pausing.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.590
So you have to go back and
learn that particular skill.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.060
I have a game that
we do in class,

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.280
and we don't have time today
for us to do this right now,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.340
but I'll teach it to you.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.510
And then I hope
sometime today you

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.970
will do it with someone else.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.560
So you sit across from a
partner, and each of you

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.360
will talk for 90
seconds on a topic.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.950
And it might be
something like places

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:43.366
in the world you'd
like to visit--

00:40:43.366 --> 00:40:46.180
so something you can easily
talk about for 90 seconds.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.280
And your goal is to
eliminate the uh's

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.410
and um's from the conversation
while you're talking.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.260
So you have your own
turn for 90 seconds.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:59.980
The listener flags
like this any uh or um

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.230
he or she hears-- hand
up and back down again.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.697
So you can catch
them in the moment.

00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:07.530
As the listener, if
you're playing this game

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.980
as the listener-- I
would never give you

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.780
this advice in any
other situation--

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.210
but don't really listen to them.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.901
Just listen for uh's and um's.

00:41:15.901 --> 00:41:18.400
Because you've been trained
your entire life to ignore them.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.774
And now I want
you to catch them.

00:41:19.774 --> 00:41:22.140
And it's actually quite
hard to catch them,

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.390
because you do get caught
up in what they have to say.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:27.539
So just like a social
scientist, pay attention

00:41:27.539 --> 00:41:29.580
to the words that are
coming out of their mouths,

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.700
and see if you can catch
those filler words.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.427
And to help you out
with this-- so I

00:41:34.427 --> 00:41:36.260
want you to play that
game with someone-- so

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.180
90 seconds each on the topic.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:38.840
Flag like this.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.420
You might be amazed
how difficult it

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.980
is to pull them out, even when
you are thinking about it.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.720
With everything I've
talked about today,

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.390
there is a learning curve.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.520
And some are longer or
shorter than others.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.240
But of everything
I've talked about,

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.690
eliminating the fillers
is the longest learning

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:01.070
curve-- takes longest time to
get them out of your style.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.340
But if you were to play
this game, this flag game,

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.050
for three minutes
a day for 20 days,

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:11.910
the problem would be
gone-- absolutely gone.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.140
And most people
don't follow through

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.170
and play a game for 20 times.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.410
But if you were to play it for
20 times over the next 20 days,

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:21.580
the problem would be gone.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.570
The reason why you
only have to focus

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.616
for three minutes on the
skill and it'll be gone

00:42:26.616 --> 00:42:28.240
is that the rest of
the day, your brain

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.840
won't be able to stop
thinking about it.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.500
And so you only have
to force yourself

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.220
to do the three minutes.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.000
And the problem will,
in fact, be gone.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.560
So I have a tool that
I'd like to give you.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.610
And it's called my
flag game checklist.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.120
And it's 20 impromptu questions,
so you can play this game.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.744
It's got little check
marks next to it,

00:42:44.744 --> 00:42:47.260
so you have to check it off
and prove to yourself that you

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.310
actually followed through
with this particular exercise.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.410
And I'm going to post
on my website for you.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.330
I didn't know exactly what
I was going to cover today.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.040
This was going to be
a little bit fluid.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.760
But I did set up a page so if
I ever mentioned a resource,

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.010
I could post it there for you.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.884
And that is SpeechSkills--
that's my company-

00:43:03.884 --> 00:43:06.980
SpeechSkills.com/googletalks.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.280
So if you want this checklist,
you can get it free.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.270
Just go to that page, and you
can download the checklist.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.740
And I can guarantee you,
if you play for 20 days,

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.940
the problem will be gone.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.310
So those are the fillers.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.880
The next few derailer
that I want to talk about

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.940
is this misplaced
upward inflection.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.320
So a downward inflection is when
your pitch cascades downward

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.310
at the ends of your
phrases and sentences.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.855
The upward inflection can be
as bad as this Valley Girl type

00:43:37.855 --> 00:43:41.090
thing, where I have a question
word at the end of my sentence.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.700
It doesn't have to be this bad.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.730
But if my voice just keeps
going up into these upper tones,

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.820
and I don't come back
down into my lower times,

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.930
I'm not going to sound
as committed or as mature

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.050
as I might want to come across.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.260
So the downward inflection
when speaking in English

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.330
is the traditional, or rather
unmarked, dialect of English,

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.960
where we start high
and we end low.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.234
It's the function
of a statement.

00:44:05.234 --> 00:44:07.400
The upward inflection is
the function of a question,

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.800
and it starts low and ends high.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.590
So let me just demonstrate the
down inflection starts high.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:16.200
The other day, I went to
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.290
And while I was there, I watched
the sailboats in the water.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.712
So that's just classic,
unmarked dialect in English.

00:44:22.712 --> 00:44:24.670
The upward inflection
does the exact opposite--

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:25.920
starts low, ends high.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.320
The other day, I went to
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.540
And while I was there, I watched
the sailboats in the water.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.690
So if you want to
change the behavior,

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.359
you can't just change
the end of the sentence.

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:41.400
You have to change the
beginning of the sentence.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.510
You need to start high and low.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.440
My daughter, when she
was in high school,

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.660
she and all of her friends
spoke in near-constant upward

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.280
inflections.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.890
And so did her
teachers, by the way,

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.240
when I would go to
parent-teacher conferences.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.566
This is the arena she
lived in every single day.

00:45:00.566 --> 00:45:02.940
Well, I didn't want to ostracize
her from her peer group.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.189
And it was fine when she was
speaking with their peers

00:45:05.189 --> 00:45:07.200
to have that particular
style-- no problem.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.540
But every now and then when
she would be talking to me,

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.370
I would say, can you
turn around for me?

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.660
Can you just put that
in a downward function?

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.450
And so, of course she
would roll her eyes,

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.491
but then she would do it.

00:45:17.491 --> 00:45:22.805
But pretty soon, she became very
much like being multilingual.

00:45:22.805 --> 00:45:25.180
She could use upward inflections
or downward inflections.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.690
They were easy
for her to adjust.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.380
Well, this gives her a
significant advantage

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.180
over her peer group.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.740
Because when she goes
for a job interview,

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.580
and the person in front
of her being interviewed

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.670
is saying something
like, I honestly

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.700
believe that I can be the
go-to person for this position?

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.310
And if you just
give me the chance,

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.740
I know that I can
get the job done?

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.000
My daughter will be
saying, I honestly

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.420
believe that I can be the
go-to person for this position.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.150
And if you just
give me the chance,

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.580
I know I can get the job done.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.620
And the interviewer
won't know why

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.420
she sounds more committed,
more mature, more intelligent

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.340
than the person he just
interviewed, but she will.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.990
So she has this advantage.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.900
And you can also
have this advantage.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.380
The downward inflection
is never a penalty.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.130
It's an unmarked version
of speaking in English.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:16.950
And there can, in
fact, be a penalty

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:18.650
for using the upward inflection.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.830
So I'm just encouraging you
to gain control over that.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.610
In your particular demographic,
that upward inflection

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:27.420
is very, very common.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.740
All right, so those
are the derailers.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.560
There are a lot of
derailers, but those

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.832
are the two most common.

00:46:33.832 --> 00:46:36.290
So now this balance between
authority and approachability--

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.720
the great news is I have
covered all of this information.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.410
I'm just going to put it into
a slightly different context

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.080
for you.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.470
If you'd like to appear
more authoritative,

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:51.610
take up space, maintain
direct eye contact,

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:55.240
keep your head level,
try to be still,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:00.910
use strong volume and resonance,
and downward inflections.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.577
That would bolster up
the authoritative side.

00:47:03.577 --> 00:47:05.660
If you'd like to come
across as more approachable,

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.190
what can you do?

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.910
Well, you can take
up less space,

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.990
but let me just put a
caution on this one.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.340
The reason this one makes my
list, taking up less space,

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.610
is that there just are some
people who come on too strong.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:18.300
And the very first
thing they need

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.120
to do to be more approachable is
to take up a little less space.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.360
Unless you get that
feedback on a regular basis,

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.650
that's not the best place
to find approachability.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.520
Better places to find
approachability-- fluid,

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.800
interactive gestures, fluid,
interactive facial gestures,

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.000
lots of expression
in your voice,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.680
and then ability to
elicit a response,

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.820
to engage with the
person on the other side.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:45.945
Now I'm trying to do both of
those lists at the same time.

00:47:45.945 --> 00:47:48.320
With the exception of taking
up more or less space, which

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.430
I can fluidly move
between, I am trying

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.130
to do both of those lists.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.500
I'm hoping, I'm
hoping you would find

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.480
it difficult to decide if I
am more authoritative or more

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.780
approachable on this topic.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.620
But depending on
the situation, I

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.440
can absolutely lean one
direction or the other,

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.387
depending on what's needed
in the communication.

00:48:08.387 --> 00:48:10.720
The problem exists when you're
trying for one attribute,

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.790
but you're using a negative
behavior to get there.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.660
So these are not the
only ways to create

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.650
authority and approachability.

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.980
You could create authority
by having a poker face, being

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.660
monotone, emphatic gestures.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.340
But those are pretty
negative behaviors,

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.673
and they would completely
undercut your approachability,

00:48:27.673 --> 00:48:29.310
so I don't recommend them.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:32.040
You can create more
approachability by bobbing

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.550
your head a lot when you
speak, have excessive smiling,

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.570
and use that upward inflection.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:38.510
But that would undercut
your authority.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.240
So I don't recommend
that, either.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.700
The behaviors on these two
lists are actually safe.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.270
You build that
behavior, you're not

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.560
likely to get any kind of
push back because of it.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.820
They are positive
ways to develop

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.440
authority and approachability.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.660
All right, if you were
thinking in your head,

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.420
I do not know how I'm going to
think about all these things

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.770
and talk at the same time,
of course I get that.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.020
There's no way you can think
about all of these things

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.460
and talk at the same time.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.860
It is conceivable you can think
about one of these behaviors

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.090
and talk at the same time.

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:15.320
That's how you practice,
as a matter of fact.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.710
All of these behaviors have
to be in your muscle memory,

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.920
in your habits,
your subroutines.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.400
Subroutines are all those
channels of communication that

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.640
are happening simultaneously.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.390
There is no way you can think
about them all actively,

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:35.730
but they are happening
simultaneously.

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:37.910
And in every
category of behavior

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:41.860
that I've talked about here, you
already have these subroutines.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.690
These behaviors are already
in your subroutines.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.700
It's just that you
may not have the best

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.770
behavior in your subroutine.

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:50.910
So you might have to
go back and rewrite

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:54.060
that, practice a little bit,
develop that new subroutine.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.090
Once you develop
a subroutine, it

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.790
is effortless to
perform that skill.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:03.250
It takes no brain
space whatsoever.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.450
It's kind of like riding a bike.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:08.961
Do you find it difficult
to ride a bike?

00:50:08.961 --> 00:50:10.460
Depends on whether
you ever learned,

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.560
because once you've
learned to ride a bike,

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.880
once that's a
competent subroutine,

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.200
it takes hardly any
effort at all to do it.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.900
Now learning to
ride a bike, that

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.120
is a whole different thing.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.779
That is actually difficult,
takes a lot of mental energy,

00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:25.320
as a matter of fact,
mental attention

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.860
to learn to ride a bike.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.710
But once you know how to ride
a bike, you could ride a bike

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.390
and write a poem
at the same time,

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.885
or do a complicated
math problem,

00:50:35.885 --> 00:50:38.010
or have a conversation with
the person next to you.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.860
So you could do a lot of
upper-level mental processing

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.052
and still be able
to ride a bike.

00:50:43.052 --> 00:50:45.010
But if you were trying
to learn to ride a bike,

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.220
you wouldn't be able to
do any of those things.

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.470
And so that's what it's like
to develop these skills.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.630
You have to put in
the practice time

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:53.600
so that you can develop
that subroutine.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.520
Once you develop the subroutine,
actually it is effortless.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.470
And it doesn't take
any mental energy.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:02.004
You own the behavior.

00:51:02.004 --> 00:51:03.920
There are three reasons
people don't typically

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.110
take on these skills.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:08.350
And one is that there's a belief
that these skills are actually

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:09.610
talents.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:13.000
Some people have more talent
in this area than others.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.640
And hopefully, I've
dispelled some of those myths

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.730
today-- that these are
actually behaviors.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:20.240
And any one of these
behaviors you can do.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.540
If you discover that your
chin is low like this,

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.470
it does not take talent
to get your head level.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:29.820
And so does it take
talent to ride a bike?

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.910
No, it takes practice.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.990
And certainly some people
are going to learn quicker

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.930
than others, so that's where the
talent component might come in.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.840
But once you learn,
it's the same skill.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.319
Doesn't matter
who learned first.

00:51:43.319 --> 00:51:44.610
You still have the same skills.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.920
So hopefully, you'll
see these as talents.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.670
Now sometimes people don't
know what to practice.

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.254
And hopefully, I've helped
with some of that today, too.

00:51:52.254 --> 00:51:54.420
And you'll find more
information in "The Credibility

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.440
Code," the book itself,
or in my online course.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:03.060
So today's conversation, I
have tried to be concise.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.040
I call this "The Credibility
Code in a Nutshell."

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:10.240
But we can take a much
more comprehensive look

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.370
at this information
if you're interested.

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:16.230
And if you go, by the way, to my
SpeechSkills/googletalks page,

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.860
you can get some information
about my online course.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.740
And in that course, my intention
is to be comprehensive,

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:25.330
to really thoroughly answer
this question, complete with how

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:29.460
do you self-assess, and skill
drills, and practice ideas,

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:34.654
so you can truly learn to embody
these particular behaviors?

00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:36.070
But the second
reason people don't

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:37.970
tend to master these
skills is that--

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.000
and this is a tough
pill to swallow--

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.990
but we are blind to
our own inefficiencies.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:46.250
And that makes perfect sense.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.640
If we are being ineffective,
it is almost certainly

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.640
unintentional, because nobody
is ineffective on purpose.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.810
And so we are either blind to
the behavior that is going on,

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:01.090
or we are blind to the impact
that behavior may be having.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:02.880
And we're back to subroutines.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.730
Once something
becomes a subroutine,

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:07.000
it takes no mental
energy whatsoever.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.369
So we don't even
know we're doing it.

00:53:09.369 --> 00:53:10.910
I have to say, the
number one thing I

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:14.650
hear when people watch
their videos is, wow,

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:19.480
I had no idea I was doing
whatever that thing might be.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.700
So it's very, very helpful.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.510
Be brave.

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:23.580
Take a look at yourself
from the outside.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:27.250
And of course, it's helpful
to get feedback from a coach.

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:30.410
But don't underestimate the
power of doing it on your own.

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:34.050
Set up a video camera in your
office or in your living room,

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:35.810
and just get a look
at yourself and see

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:38.591
what might be coming across.

00:53:38.591 --> 00:53:40.840
And the third reason people
don't take on these skills

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.280
is that you just severely
overestimate how much time it

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.680
takes to take them on.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.550
As I mentioned, with
the hardest behavior

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:49.330
we're dealing with today--
eliminating the fillers-- three

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:52.480
minutes a day for 20 days
would solve the problem.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.520
In my online course--
it's a six-week course,

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.700
and I only require 10
minutes a day of practice

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:01.820
to master all of the skills
we've been talking about.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.940
So people severely overestimate
how much time it will take.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.740
But I will say this--
the reason it only

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.810
takes 10 minutes
of practice a day

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:11.060
is that your brain
won't be able to stop

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.580
thinking about it for
the rest of the day.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.970
So you only have to
commit to the 10 minutes,

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:19.330
and then the rest will
take care of itself.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:22.279
All right, I'll take any
questions you might have.

00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:24.070
If there's something
pressing on your mind,

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.028
you've been dying to ask
a particular question.

00:54:26.028 --> 00:54:27.572
Yeah.

00:54:27.572 --> 00:54:29.280
AUDIENCE: So I'm
wondering if you thought

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.820
of any of these skills
through the filter of that

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.000
being a part of your day.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.050
This also applies
to teleconferencing.

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:39.640
CARA HALE ALTER:
OK, so first of all,

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.700
if you find video
conferencing weird,

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:48.530
it's because it's weird in that
it's amazing how finely attuned

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.970
we are so the subtle signals
we read in other people

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.301
and also timing.

00:54:53.301 --> 00:54:54.800
That if you ask
somebody a question,

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:59.047
if a split extra second goes by
before they answer, we wonder,

00:54:59.047 --> 00:55:00.130
was there something wrong?

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.504
Are you feeling
weird about that?

00:55:01.504 --> 00:55:04.700
So we're very, very attuned to
timing and physical signals.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.870
And that's really messed up
on the video conferencing.

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.510
And so you first of all just
have to have room for that.

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:13.670
And then verbally, be
as explicit as you can

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:16.122
when you're talking to
people on the other side.

00:55:16.122 --> 00:55:17.580
So often it will
happen in meetings

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.050
that I have that heads
will nod around the table,

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:25.260
but the people on the other side
are not necessarily hearing,

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.740
noting, the head nods.

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.340
So try to be as
explicit about what

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.400
you might be seeing
in the room if you're

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.483
the facilitator-- oh, it
looks like everybody here

00:55:31.483 --> 00:55:33.010
agrees with that,
or we have a lot--

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:34.570
something along that line.

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.620
And just leave extra room.

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:39.160
Also, one of the
things I find funniest

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.840
about video
conferencing is watching

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.410
people who are not speaking.

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.330
So because you're
basically on camera,

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.870
you might have to be a little
more attentive to the fact

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:53.365
that you are being watched, even
if you're not the one talking.

00:55:53.365 --> 00:55:54.740
And recognize that
you still need

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.730
to project a confident image
even in listening mode.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.021
We haven't had a chance to
talk about listening skills,

00:55:59.021 --> 00:56:00.580
but they are vital as well.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:04.770
So in this short conversation,
hard for me to go deep in that.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.840
But I would say, just
recognize it is strange.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.560
And verbally try
to hold up your end

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.440
of the non-verbals that would be
going on in the communication.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.040
Any other questions?

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:14.560
Yes.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.070
AUDIENCE: So when it
comes to speaking,

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:21.480
how does it work for the
non-native English speakers

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.610
and non-native speakers,
and accent, voice,

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:27.590
lots of differences of that.

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.870
So do you have any--

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:29.530
CARA HALE ALTER:
Absolutely, I've

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:31.110
got something to say about that.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.650
So what's interesting about
accents-- so first of all,

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:36.000
we all have accents.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.810
We just have different ones.

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:44.120
And our brains are
wired for novelty.

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.740
So if you have an accent that's
different than the people

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.910
you are speaking
to, you're already

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:50.500
going to have more
of their attention.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.570
So an accent can be
a huge advantage.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.930
Also, let me say this--
do you like listening

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.260
to accents, people who have an
accent different than your own?

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.990
Almost everyone says yes.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:02.560
We like listening to accents.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.830
So we don't want
to get rid of them.

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:08.000
Almost always when someone
has an accent problem,

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
that's not really
what's going on.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.990
It's usually some other element.

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:15.000
They have an
articulation problem.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.050
So our brains, when we
hear an accent that's

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.130
different than our
own, immediately

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.274
recognize the substitutions,
because there are

00:57:21.274 --> 00:57:22.440
rules that you're following.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.650
It's not just willy-nilly.

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:27.100
You are substituting a
certain vowel or a consonant.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.240
Our brains will
catch on, and then

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.050
be able to make those
substitutions-- unless we

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.850
can't hear them.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.760
So sometimes, it's articulation.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.470
The person, maybe
because they're

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:39.830
shy that they have an
accent, will kind of

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:43.130
slide by the consonant so
they don't make mistakes,

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.770
or they're not blasting the
difference in their accent

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:46.620
out there.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.380
Same thing with
volume-- people who

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.680
are speaking in an accent
or a language that's

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.630
not their [? second ?]
language will

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:53.463
often pull back in
volume because they don't

00:57:53.463 --> 00:57:54.900
want to make loud mistakes.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.040
They'd rather make
soft mistakes,

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.310
which means that the other
people can't hear you

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:00.010
very well.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.800
And that's the
communication problem.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.360
And then amazingly,
sometimes it's pace.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.170
I can't tell you
how often it happens

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:12.000
when someone is speaking English
to me as their second language,

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.150
that they talk too fast for me.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:16.730
And I don't know if this is
over-compensation for maybe

00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:19.760
wanting to show that
fluidity with language.

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.760
But often, pace is the issue.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.780
It's hard for me to keep up.

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.590
So I would say rather
than changing your accent,

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.250
accent could be a
positive for you.

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:31.330
But do make sure that your
volume, your articulation,

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:34.690
and your pacing is clear
and appropriate at optimal.

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:37.990
That's how you handle an
accent problem-- "problem"--

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:39.220
not really a problem.

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.480
Great, if there's another
pressing question out there,

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.604
yes.

00:58:42.604 --> 00:58:44.270
AUDIENCE: What's the
appropriate posture

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:47.179
when you're on stage presenting
but not necessarily speaking?

00:58:47.179 --> 00:58:49.220
CARA HALE ALTER: This
happens to me all the time.

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.750
So you are in waiting mode.

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:55.580
And so I-- first of all, there's
a difference between listing

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:56.952
posture and speaking posture.

00:58:56.952 --> 00:58:58.410
So everything I've
been doing, I've

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.290
been demonstrating
speaking posture.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:02.820
But when you're listening,
it's like the difference

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:05.910
between being the pitcher
and being the catcher.

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:08.350
And so if you're sitting
and listening, actually

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:11.000
rounding out a little
bit, it looks like you're

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.480
absorbing the message better.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.790
If I sat stock still
and listened to you,

00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:17.300
you might not think I
was being very attentive.

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.860
So the same thing
is true up here.

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.240
If you ask me a question,
and I sit here like this

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.350
and listen to you, that might
not seem very receptive.

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:27.521
So I have a tendency to
go into listening mode

00:59:27.521 --> 00:59:29.020
where I round out
just a little bit.

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.144
If you were to talk for
over a long period of time,

00:59:31.144 --> 00:59:33.020
I might even take my
weight to my side.

00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:36.310
But I will say this-- my
spine is always straight.

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:39.310
So you still want to have the
core straight through here.

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:41.380
And it's nice to find
a listening posture

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.572
for yourself-- it can look
different on you than on me--

00:59:44.572 --> 00:59:45.780
that you feel comfortable in.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:48.520
And then use it as
your go-to position

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.080
if you ever become
uncomfortable.

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:54.390
I was giving a talk at
the Bar Association,

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:57.190
so just about 200
lawyers in the room.

00:59:57.190 --> 01:00:01.360
And one man took issue
with what I was saying,

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.795
and all of a sudden began to
do this while I was talking.

01:00:06.795 --> 01:00:07.770
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:12.295
So when I asked for
questions, his hand popped up.

01:00:12.295 --> 01:00:12.800
Great.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.290
So I asked him, questions.

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:17.777
He stood up, and then he went on
for a couple of minutes railing

01:00:17.777 --> 01:00:18.610
on me for something.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:20.630
He had misunderstood
something I said.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:21.980
We did clear it up.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.060
But so I had to follow
my own guidelines there.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.860
And I had to continually
give myself instructions

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:28.890
to look comfortable.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.820
So I had to do things like,
OK, try to stay still,

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.510
round out, take a
couple of steps.

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:37.520
Stand still, nod.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.590
So I was trying to get myself
to look perfectly comfortable,

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:43.200
even though inside, my
brain was going augh.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.720
So you find something that
looks comfortable on your body.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.360
This is really
comfortable for me.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.270
So if I'm just waiting,
if somebody else

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:53.530
is talking on stage, I
usually would stand like this,

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.655
or I might possibly take
my weight over to one side

01:00:55.655 --> 01:00:56.450
while I'm waiting.

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.160
And of course, you have to
be attentive to your partners

01:00:59.160 --> 01:00:59.960
on stage.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.866
You can't zone out,
because if you have

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:03.750
to use active listening skills.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.490
Good to cheat out
to the audience,

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:07.370
so that you look like
you're including them

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.980
in the conversation.

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.079
And so, did that
answer your question?

01:01:11.079 --> 01:01:13.245
All right, good, because
it looks like we have, yes,

01:01:13.245 --> 01:01:13.828
one other one.

01:01:13.828 --> 01:01:16.390
AUDIENCE: So my question
is that if you suddenly

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:18.825
lose your train of
thought, then how

01:01:18.825 --> 01:01:22.360
do you compensate
that and still be

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.567
seen as like you're confident?

01:01:24.567 --> 01:01:26.150
CARA HALE ALTER:
Yes, so first of all,

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.690
it's important to note that
thinking on your feet--

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:31.270
so I put that as a category--
thinking on your feet

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:33.490
is a skill.

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:37.030
And most people hate feeling
flustered and uncomfortable

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.532
so much that we avoid
it any time we can,

01:01:39.532 --> 01:01:41.990
which means you only have to
go through that when it really

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.620
matters.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.990
So I encourage you
to play games where

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:46.073
you have to be in that
thinking on your feet mode,

01:01:46.073 --> 01:01:49.030
where you have to come up
with answers really quickly.

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.840
Just so you, if
you want to know,

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.360
I came up with a boxed
set of impromptus

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.640
just for this purpose.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.780
So I can give them to my
clients so you can always

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.946
have some sort of fresh
question you have to take up

01:01:58.946 --> 01:02:00.160
the top of your head.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.661
So thinking on your
feet is a skill.

01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:04.160
And one of the
problems that happens

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.576
when we're thinking
on our feet is

01:02:05.576 --> 01:02:08.522
there's a lot of self
criticism if we go blank.

01:02:08.522 --> 01:02:10.730
So you go blank, and then
all of a sudden, your brain

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.470
starts to say things
like, oh, my gosh,

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:13.290
now I've lost my
train of thought.

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:14.210
Oh, everybody's waiting for me.

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:15.001
Oh, gosh darn this.

01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:16.310
I wish I wasn't in this mode.

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:18.600
You've got that screaming
going on in your head.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.450
It is really hard to think when
that's happening in your head.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.660
So one of the things you learn
in the thinking on your feet

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.580
exercises is just to put
that conversation aside.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.889
Go find the information
that you need.

01:02:30.889 --> 01:02:32.555
But when you're
panicking about the fact

01:02:32.555 --> 01:02:36.030
that you've gone blank, your
head is busy talking about that

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:37.992
rather than finding the content.

01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:39.950
So that's the first thing
I would suggest-- get

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:42.240
good at that particular skill.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.030
And then note that you have so
much more time than you think.

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:48.360
Your listener will wait if
you find the information.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.070
I suggest that you not
apologize for yourself.

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.510
So that's really important.

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:55.120
If you have lost your train
of thought, try not to say,

01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.860
oh, gosh-- like, beat yourself
up in front of your audience.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.580
You simply say
something like, huh,

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.080
that thought was just there a
second ago, and now it's gone.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.054
Give me a second.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.150
All right, well, so it's
OK to take some time.

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:15.009
And/or, you can say, I've
lost my train of thought.

01:03:15.009 --> 01:03:16.300
I'm sure it'll come back to me.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.550
Let me move forward.

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.760
But you say it with
confidence, so it

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.299
doesn't look like you
are yelling at yourself,

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.840
so you aren't, in fact, yelling
at yourself inside your head.

01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:29.440
One of the derailers
I didn't bring up

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.840
is what we call self-commenting.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.730
And it is a pretty
prevalent derailer.

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:35.420
And so self-commenting
is when you

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:40.160
comment on or apologize
for some perceived mistake

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:40.820
that you make.

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.986
And so I'm going to make a
mistake on purpose so you

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.107
can hear me apologize for it.

01:03:45.107 --> 01:03:46.690
Let's just say that
I'm talking along,

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:52.220
and I mispronunce-- I'm
sorry-- mispronounce something,

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:55.340
and make a big show out
of it, like I just did.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.500
I tripped over that word.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.470
I laughed at myself.

01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:58.480
I said I was sorry.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.799
I did a little, cute dance.

01:03:59.799 --> 01:04:00.840
And then I moved forward.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.840
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.970
So that pointed
fingers at the mistake.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:07.090
That was a pretty
obvious self-comment.

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:09.277
Here's a much more
subtle self-comment.

01:04:09.277 --> 01:04:10.860
Let's just say that
I'm talking along.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:16.180
And I mis-, mis-, mispronounce
something and then keep going--

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:19.040
so just a little flinch or
scold of myself before I move

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.040
forward.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.420
We make those kinds of errors
where we mispronounce something

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.680
and correct it or use
incorrect grammar and fix it--

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.790
we do this so often.

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:31.860
The metric on this is that
it happens once or twice

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.660
per paragraph in
everyday communication.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.240
We trip over a word,
fix it, and move on.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.030
I have done it
numerous times up here.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:41.720
Have you noticed?

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.410
Typically, we just
correct and move on.

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:44.070
It's seamless.

01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:46.020
It is a seamless subroutine.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.547
Here's how it'd sound.

01:04:47.547 --> 01:04:49.130
Let's just say that
I'm talking along.

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:51.379
And I mi-, mispronounce
something and then keep going.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:58.510
No reaction whatsoever, but when
we are feeling self-conscious

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.790
we notice every
mistake that we make.

01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:02.350
We react.

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:05.210
That's what chips away
at your credibility.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:07.402
So you do have to correct
a mistake if you make one.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:09.360
You just shouldn't
apologize for it in any way.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.830
Correct and move on.

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:13.850
Never let them see your
internal conversation

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:16.690
about how you are doing.

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:18.780
I am going to wrap up this
conversation with just

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.180
a one-minute story.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.410
This is a true story,
happened in my life.

01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.480
When my kids were little,
I played with them

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.540
in the morning, and then
took them off to preschool.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.870
And that particular day,
as I ran my errands,

01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:33.040
and I went to the bank,
and to the grocery store,

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:37.300
and to the dry cleaner,
everywhere I went,

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.755
people greeted me with
these big, beaming smiles.

01:05:40.755 --> 01:05:42.880
It's like the whole, entire
world is in a fantastic

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.540
mood, like fairy dust had
sprinkled on the earth

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.200
and they were in a
fantastic mood out there.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.640
And then I got home, and I
caught a glimpse of myself

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.910
in the mirror.

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:55.820
And I had forgotten that when
I was playing with the kids,

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.410
I had drawn a kitty nose
and whiskers on my face.

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:00.610
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:05.040
So all day long, everywhere
I went, I had this kitty nose

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.710
and whiskers.

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:09.390
Now, nobody had
mentioned it-- nobody.

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:12.652
Now why do you think
they didn't mention it?

01:06:12.652 --> 01:06:14.610
AUDIENCE: They assumed
you intended to do that.

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.160
CARA HALE ALTER: Exactly,
they assumed I knew.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.830
So obvious a signal could
not have been accidental

01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:22.430
on my part.

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:25.430
So this leads us to a very
important lesson about

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:29.940
today's conversation, and
that is you cannot assume

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.130
you're going to get
outside feedback.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.270
You have to seek out outside
feedback on your skills.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.625
Because people assume you know.

01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:39.500
And if you don't know,
they don't necessarily

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.820
want to be the one to tell
you if you are blind to it.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.220
But I encourage you
to get an outside look

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.860
at yourself, and
especially on video camera,

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.020
so you can see what
you might need to fix.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.350
The reason people make
such amazing progress

01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:56.560
in such a short
period of time is

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.980
that this is not about ability.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.699
It's about awareness.

01:07:00.699 --> 01:07:02.740
That when you know you
need to change a behavior,

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.880
it's actually fairly easy
to change the behavior.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.510
It's the awareness
that is the component

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:09.600
that you need to work on.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.370
So I encourage you, by all
means, when you leave here

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:13.140
today, try to get
some outside feedback.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.550
You can ask others, but your
best bet is video camera,

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:18.332
even if it's your own iPhone.

01:07:18.332 --> 01:07:20.290
All right, thank you for
being here, everybody.

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:21.190
I enjoyed my time.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:23.940
