00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
That's right. It would have to be C.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If α is 360 degrees, that means we're looking at the entire circumference.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This d would be identical to C.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, we're starting to see an equation emerge.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This circumference somehow depends on this distance and this angle α.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, I guess we'll have to add the distance to our wishlist,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because we don't know that yet either.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Before we go any further, let's just rewrite this equation.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's solve it for C.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to bring this C up here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and I'm going to bring these--α and 360--over to the other side.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So, this is it. This is our answer for the circumference of the earth.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We just need to know α and d.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, let me just talk about this equation a little bit before me move on.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
First of all, there is nothing wrong with the way we wrote it before.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This was a totally true expression that you could use to calculate the circumference.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The reason I like this a little better is because

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it explicitly tells us this is the circumference.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Then the way we've written it over here is nice as well.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I see I have here 360/α.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, these are both in degrees.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When I do degrees divided by degrees,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I get some unit-less number.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is just some multiplier

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that multiplies a number with a unit of distance.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I can see just by looking at this equation that what I will get is a unit of distance.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I can see how it depends on this distance from Alexandria to Syene

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the angle of the shadow.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I think that's a nice way to show this equation.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now, let's just worry about this angle and the distance and keep track of our units as we do.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This may require a new mathematical tool as well.

00:01:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, let's go to Florence Italy to talk to an expert in the field.
