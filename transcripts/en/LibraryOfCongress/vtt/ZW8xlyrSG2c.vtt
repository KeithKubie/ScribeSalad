From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:14.190
[Music] And, as in
uffish thought he stood,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.010
The Jabberwock, with eyes
of flame, Came whiffling

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.820
through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.130
-The Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.430
&gt;&gt;Juann Felipe Herrera:
I want to talk

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.730
to you about Jabberalking.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.320
It's a brand-new
book I just put out.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.280
It all comes from I
wanted to write a book

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.250
where I could teach others
how to write the way I write.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.210
And I figured I do very basic
things, for me, very basic.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.310
I scribble, I walk and write.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.610
I'm very visual.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.050
I used giant sheets of paper,
little tiny sheets of paper.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.240
The pens are big
and the crayons,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.180
they feel excellent in my hands.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.550
The newspapers are exciting

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.240
because there's things
on the newspapers.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.460
Then I use fountains
pens, Japanese quills,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.380
an assortment of colors.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.700
[Music] Jabberwock, with
eyes of flame, Came whiffling

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.080
through the tulgey
wood, and it's burbling

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.460
as it's moving through it.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.480
Because then the writer has
eyes of flame as it moves

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.050
through her environment
and burbles

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.030
in that human movement-which
is expressing ourselves,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.330
which is writing.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.460
So Jabberwalker is always
moving, is always noticing,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.070
is always observing,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.650
and is always participating
in the larger group.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.980
[Music] When we got to the
open space on the top floor,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.000
and all the beauty-sculptures,
marble, different kinds

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.200
of marble, mythological
figures, names of disciplines,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.870
philosophy art, Jefferson's
Library.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.180
So much detail, so much
knowledge, so much taking

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.160
in for the Jabberwalker.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.250
And then we went
downstairs, to the tunnels.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.180
It just had things and pipes
and maybe two or three colors.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.710
I thought that was just
an amazing contrast.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.870
It went from scribbles, doodles,
walking, moving, screaming,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.020
experimenting, to an
amazing experience

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.700
and collection of material.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.680
And then it morphed into
a mural and a mosaic.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.370
And that's the beauty of
Jabberwalking that you can go

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.520
through an alley or a street
that you go through every day

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.040
and maybe you notice
something and maybe you don't.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.030
For the Jabberwalker,
you notice things

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.020
that maybe you didn't
notice before

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.220
and that's what poetry is.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.680
&gt;&gt;Student: Darker
darker, brighter brighter,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.600
Some sense of things getting
lighter Flowing pipes,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.930
dirty stairwell Cellar deep,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.900
chairs all stacked Lighthouse
lights, doors to the end

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.200
&gt;&gt;Juann Felipe Herrera:
So I encourage you

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.040
to be professional
Jabberwalkers.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.940
Moving, being creative,
taking in what's going on.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.080
Pipes and birds and trees
and bark and little dogs

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.150
and a baby crying
and a baby laughing

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.060
and the leaf falling down,
slowing in front of you,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.840
and a feather floating by.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.150
And you will go "Oh!

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.450
I can't believe it!

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.340
That feather was amazing!

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.900
I want to write a
poem about it!"

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.200
And then you do that.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.960
That's Jabberwalking, full of
inspiration, just like you.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.690
