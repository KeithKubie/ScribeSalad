00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.003
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.990
<v 1>[inaudible] in a town where you're never quite sure if you were in Mexico,</v>

3
00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:13.700
the old west, uh,

4
00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:18.590
down-home us city with classic Americana feel or just up another coldest in

5
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:21.140
southern California. Endless suburban sprawl.

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.910
The one thing that seems to unite everyone is a love of good Mexican food.

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.610
I'm not just talking about your standard Tacos,

8
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.120
burritos and chips and salsa in this town.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.950
I'm looking for Morley. There are more days Galore.

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.510
You've heard of Guacamole, but there are Red Malays, Black Malays,

11
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:44.480
green moleys. There are Malays with namesakes,

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.460
like the famous multiple Villano from the town of Pueblo in Mexico.

13
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:54.060
These are often linked proudly to some place a region. Wahaca is the

14
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.540
[inaudible], the land of the seven moleys, but don't forget,

15
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:01.640
we're back up here in San Diego.

16
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.950
Our story starts a few blocks past this beautiful stretch of architecture at the

17
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:11.930
city's famous zoo with this guy. I bring him up for two reasons.

18
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.430
One. He's a subject of extreme interest to some members of my travel party

19
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.630
and to his historical territory includes much of Mexico where he was and even

20
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.360
still is an iconic figure for many traditional cultures,

21
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.460
cultures like the Aztecs.

22
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
And that's where I show you that we're on this tangent for a reason besides

23
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.460
showing you fuzzy animals, because like the Mayan,

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.030
the Zapotecs as take people's ground of chilies and other ingredients and cook

25
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:44.760
them together to form these beautiful sauces.

26
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
And they've done this for hundreds and hundreds of years.

27
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
Don't think that these groups are all just Pre-columbian peoples of ancient

28
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:57.210
Mexico either. The language of the ancient Aztecs was classical.

29
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:01.470
Now what? And today there are more than a million speakers of modern.

30
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:06.090
Now what that brings us to the real stuff, these savory,

31
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:09.270
spicy, complex sauces, that's what you're here for, right?

32
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.910
The Aztec word is moly.

33
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.620
The Spanish added some ingredients to the mix and added their language to the

34
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.220
mix too. But sometimes the mixing went both ways.

35
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.660
The Spanish borrowed the word Moly, pronounced it more lame,

36
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.710
and that's the way it sounded when these hardy Mexican sauces made their way to

37
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:32.850
the southwestern quadrant of these United States where a lot of people speak

38
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.970
English, at least in some towns and some days,

39
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.220
thanks to all this history,

40
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.700
you can scour San Diego for mo lays in English or more or less in Spanish.

41
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.750
But I don't know how much luck you'll have speaking now. Wattle around here.

42
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
