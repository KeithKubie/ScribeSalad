00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So in order to answer the question what is electricity, we're going to look at a lot

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of the contributions made by Benjamin Franklin.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Franklin gave us the idea of charge both positive and negative.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He gave us the notion of conservation of charge, which is very similar to

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
conservation of energy, which we talked about in Unit 4.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He described the properties of conductors and insulators.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to learn about all of these and more in this unit,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but one thing I want to point out is that in some sense we might be historically

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
inaccurate at some points.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to use vocabulary that we would use today when talking about electricity.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Some of the words Benjamin Franklin used might have been a bit different.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So let's start with this idea of charge. Well, what is charge?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Charge--and I'm going to use the convention way I label charge  with the variable Q--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Well, it's a property of matter.  Well, that's all fine.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But what does it mean to be a property of matter?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, we've gotten used to in our force diagrams that described

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the motion and forces on an object to writing the mass on that object.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Because the mass was such an important property of the matter.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Well, let's think about mass. Why was mass so important?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We need to think about this and answer the following question.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Why is mass so important? Is it because mass causes friction?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Is it because mass tells us how much space an object occupies?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Or is it because mass is somehow relevant to gravity?

00:01:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Think about this and choose what you think is the best answer.
