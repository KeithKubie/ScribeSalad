00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.610
 Mike Gordon: Kongregate was founded by Jim and Emily Greer. 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.440
 They have decided to create a web platform for developers 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.600
 And independent games. 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.580
 Initially this platform was named the platform for games on YouTube. 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.219
 My name is Mike Gordon, Vice President for Publishing 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.440
 In Kongregate. 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.850
 We've seen a lot of web developers moving to use 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.940
 Mobile, so we need a partner like Kongregate 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.544
 To enter the mobile world. 

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:25.960
 Peter Eckmens: My name is Peter Eckmens 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.590
 One of the advanced producers in Kongregate. 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.970
 One of the first challenges we faced when we switched to mobile 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 Is to realize what he is looking for 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.910
 Game users in the gaming market. 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.370
 Tammy Levy: We were aware of what we could do on the web 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.060
 To find out what he likes and does not like game users, 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.380
 However, we did not have these tools on mobile. 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.730
 And then we started a painstaking research on how 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.720
 Translate it? 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.700
 My name is Tammy Levy, Product Manager 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.284
 Mobile games in Kongregate. 

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.200
 Mike Gordon: The Google Play Developer Console is available 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.460
 Application developers have a lot of useful tools 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.710
 In a manner that is easy to use. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.918
 Peter Eckmens: A good way was not needed 

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:02.220
 To distribute versions. 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.239
 Using alpha testing frameworks and use 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.080
 Demo on Google Play, we're easily able to do so. 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.230
 We can add mailing lists or groups of people 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.740
 Or Google Forums, rather than individually mailing APK over 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.300
 E-mail, we can only say "click on this 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.020
 Site and accept laboratory status 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.190
 Go to download the version. 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.500
 We need only that. 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.541
 Tammy Levy: Is this the reason for experimenting? 

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.115
 The thing is not thrown for everyone. 

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:28.730
 Because if proven incompetence the thing is considered how to improve it 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.784
 Before making it available to everyone? 

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:32.200
 Peter Eckmens: One of the first uses of an experiment 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 Store Lists Conduct an experiment on binary symbols. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.540
 Through which we introduced a symbolic hero in the game 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.120
 In front of the helicopter, which were of units 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.160
 Inside the game. 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.580
 We found that the users who showed them the helicopter code 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.180
 They have an increase in downloads by 92% 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.780
 Compared to users who saw the symbolic hero. 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.510
 And then we moved to the screenshot experience 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.440
 Where we discovered a 14% increase in downloads 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.640
 Users who have the new look have a different shape. 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.860
 Then we moved to the written text about the game, 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.020
 Where we developed an explanation of the strategy and types 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.860
 Units that appear to users. 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 When we tried all that, we discovered an increase 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.750
 At all levels of the painting. 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.479
 And when calculating everything 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.250
 We found a 45% increase in downloads 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.090
 Users who have chosen the new format have. 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.380
 This was a great experience for us. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.360
 Tammy Levy: It was very exciting 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.330
 So we started to apply it to each game separately. 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.520
 We are fully aware that the results we will get 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.870
 It will be effective. 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.020
 We took advantage of that 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.480
 The certainty that we are 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.830
 We offer the best game. 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.100
 Hence we recommend all developers in the world 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.490
 Taking advantage of all the tools available in 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.194
 The developer console to ensure you qualify yourself towards success. 

00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:39.860
 Mike Gordon: There is a tremendous amount of 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.060
 The information is available in the Developers console. 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.340
 You can access it whenever you want. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.005
 It is also easy to use because it is quite clear 

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.140
 Its information is very useful. 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.760
 Peter Eckmens: Non-renewal makes you take 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.265
 One pattern of the first impression, 

00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:54.640
 So make sure you try everything, 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.940
 Because you have to make sure that the art you love will find 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.260
 Echo to users as well, 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.770
 They may not be right all the time.
