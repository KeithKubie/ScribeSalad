00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.249
we are finding out about well that's
what the first one was missing was

00:19:38.249 --> 00:19:38.259
what the first one was missing was
 

00:19:38.259 --> 00:19:39.869
what the first one was missing was
actual character development there was

00:19:39.869 --> 00:19:39.879
actual character development there was
 

00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:41.970
actual character development there was

you right yeah I think further yeah I
 

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.659
you right yeah I think further yeah I
got spooked early on because this movie

00:19:45.659 --> 00:19:45.669
got spooked early on because this movie
 

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:47.610
got spooked early on because this movie
opens up like an attack and Hydra and

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:47.620
opens up like an attack and Hydra and
 

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.440

honestly the CGI is very bad way it's it
 

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.789
honestly the CGI is very bad way it's it
gets better

00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799

00:19:56.919 --> 00:19:58.409
Jeb either gets better if you're
watching in the first 15 minutes that

00:19:58.409 --> 00:19:58.419
watching in the first 15 minutes that
 

00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:00.210

plastic black widow jumping it is the

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:04.450
plastic black widow jumping it is the
 

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.159
plastic black widow jumping it is the
most ridiculously CGI like cheap looking

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:08.169
most ridiculously CGI like cheap looking
 

00:20:08.169 --> 00:20:10.440
most ridiculously CGI like cheap looking
thing but it did they get better after

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:10.450
thing but it did they get better after
 

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.119
thing but it did they get better after
that 15 minutes and like there was no

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:12.129
that 15 minutes and like there was no
 

00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:13.619
that 15 minutes and like there was no
real character development it was just

00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:13.629
real character development it was just
 

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.240

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.539
whole movies gonna be like this and then
yeah when the characters start

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:18.549
yeah when the characters start
 

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:20.039
yeah when the characters start
interacting I'm like well this is what I

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:20.049
interacting I'm like well this is what I
 

00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:21.480
interacting I'm like well this is what I
was kind of missing from the first one

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.490
was kind of missing from the first one
 

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.850
was kind of missing from the first one
as much as I loved the first one it's a

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:23.860
as much as I loved the first one it's a
 

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.710
as much as I loved the first one it's a
series of just events that happen I

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720
series of just events that happen I
 

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.509
series of just events that happen I
never feel like I got to know the

00:20:27.509 --> 00:20:27.519
never feel like I got to know the
 

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:30.149
never feel like I got to know the
characters anymore yeah like this one

00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159
characters anymore yeah like this one
 

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:32.580
characters anymore yeah like this one
who fixes a lot of that problems the

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:32.590
who fixes a lot of that problems the
 

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.680
who fixes a lot of that problems the
villain I think is kind of even weaker

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:34.690
villain I think is kind of even weaker
 

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.269
villain I think is kind of even weaker
than Loki and that's kind of saying

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:36.279
than Loki and that's kind of saying
 

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:39.600
than Loki and that's kind of saying
something um but yeah so it's kind of

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:39.610
something um but yeah so it's kind of
 

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.720
something um but yeah so it's kind of
like a mixed bag it's like it fix some

00:20:44.289 --> 00:20:46.230
things some things are the same it's
kind of derivative because again I feel

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240
kind of derivative because again I feel
 

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.519
kind of derivative because again I feel
like we're just watching stuff that

00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:47.529
like we're just watching stuff that
 

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:49.769

this movie as much because we probably
 

00:22:01.169 --> 00:22:03.200
this movie as much because we probably
over praise the living fuck out of the

over praise the living fuck out of the
 

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.880
over praise the living fuck out of the
first movie and like that's it feels

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:04.890
first movie and like that's it feels
 

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.409
first movie and like that's it feels
like some sort of overcorrection like

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419
like some sort of overcorrection like
 

00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:09.289

only two things I will say is yeah the
 

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.149
only two things I will say is yeah the
movies kind of derivative I feel like

00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159
movies kind of derivative I feel like
 

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:22.490
movies kind of derivative I feel like
plot wise we still really aren't going

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500
plot wise we still really aren't going
 

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.440
plot wise we still really aren't going
anywhere this is just a setup for Civil

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:24.450
anywhere this is just a setup for Civil
 

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:29.570
anywhere this is just a setup for Civil
War you know and it's the villain is not

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580
War you know and it's the villain is not
 

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.700

as great as it could be the story's

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:31.710
as great as it could be the story's
 

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.090
as great as it could be the story's
dated but everything else there's more

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100
dated but everything else there's more
 

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.680
dated but everything else there's more
character development so that kind of

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:36.690
character development so that kind of
 

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.539
character development so that kind of
offsets that and it's it's very much the

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:38.549
offsets that and it's it's very much the
 

00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:39.710
offsets that and it's it's very much the
same thing over again if you like the

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720
same thing over again if you like the
 

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.279
same thing over again if you like the
