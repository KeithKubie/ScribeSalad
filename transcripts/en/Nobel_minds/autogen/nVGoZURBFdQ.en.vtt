00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709
need more sort of intelligent to keep to
 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.369

destruction weapons and making wars we

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239
destruction weapons and making wars we
 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.210
destruction weapons and making wars we
need to be more social intelligence to

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220
need to be more social intelligence to
 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.839
need to be more social intelligence to
give our our climate our our planet safe

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849
give our our climate our our planet safe
 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.990
give our our climate our our planet safe
and peaceful for every one of us so what

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
and peaceful for every one of us so what
 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.240
and peaceful for every one of us so what
the last speaker said about we haven't

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250
the last speaker said about we haven't
 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.309
the last speaker said about we haven't
seen anything yet I think that was the

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319
seen anything yet I think that was the
 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.619
seen anything yet I think that was the
most important part of the thing because

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629
most important part of the thing because
 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.429
most important part of the thing because
this is part of the evolution and it's

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439
this is part of the evolution and it's
 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.110
this is part of the evolution and it's
important that we have this discussion

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120
important that we have this discussion
 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.409
important that we have this discussion
because everything that our develop

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419
because everything that our develop
 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.439
because everything that our develop
could be used in a wrong way so we have

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449
could be used in a wrong way so we have
 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.309
could be used in a wrong way so we have
to

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319
to
 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.459
to
to understand that and develop it

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:12.469
to understand that and develop it
 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.770
to understand that and develop it
together into something good but what we

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780
together into something good but what we
 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.199
together into something good but what we
see here in 10 years back we couldn't

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209
see here in 10 years back we couldn't
 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.479
see here in 10 years back we couldn't
imagine any 10 years ahead that will

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489
imagine any 10 years ahead that will
 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.729
imagine any 10 years ahead that will
even more so it's very interesting

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739
even more so it's very interesting
 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.340
even more so it's very interesting
future about these technology well what

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350
future about these technology well what
 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.950
future about these technology well what
I find is really interesting is that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960
I find is really interesting is that
 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.830
I find is really interesting is that
such a wide definition of intelligence

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840
such a wide definition of intelligence
 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.450
such a wide definition of intelligence
because usually we think of technical

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460
because usually we think of technical
 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.480
because usually we think of technical
intelligence and I'll active behavioral

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
intelligence and I'll active behavioral
 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.999
intelligence and I'll active behavioral
point of view which I don't think that

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009
point of view which I don't think that
 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.760
point of view which I don't think that
we we sort of think about in in there

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770
we we sort of think about in in there
 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.779
we we sort of think about in in there
are day to daily lives so to speak

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789
are day to daily lives so to speak
 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.120
are day to daily lives so to speak
intelligence is when you are able to

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130
intelligence is when you are able to
 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.700
intelligence is when you are able to
deal with people and understand them but

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710
deal with people and understand them but
 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.050
deal with people and understand them but
you also need the wisdom to the ability

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060
you also need the wisdom to the ability
 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.659
you also need the wisdom to the ability
to understand yourself that was really

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669
to understand yourself that was really
 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.629
to understand yourself that was really
interesting and yeah I'm swearing thank

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639
interesting and yeah I'm swearing thank
 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:06.219
interesting and yeah I'm swearing thank
you great okay so this is the science

well to talk about intelligence art and

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789
well to talk about intelligence art and
 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:01.040
well to talk about intelligence art and
science and it strikes me that one of

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050
science and it strikes me that one of
 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.290
science and it strikes me that one of
the hallmarks of artificial intelligence

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300
the hallmarks of artificial intelligence
 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.490
the hallmarks of artificial intelligence
and natural intelligence that we've

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500
and natural intelligence that we've
 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.309
and natural intelligence that we've
heard a lot about today is the ability

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319
heard a lot about today is the ability
 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.399
heard a lot about today is the ability
to recognize patterns in the world

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409
to recognize patterns in the world
 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:13.010
to recognize patterns in the world
around us to study these patterns and

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020
around us to study these patterns and
 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.990
around us to study these patterns and
make representations and this is

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000
make representations and this is
 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.879
make representations and this is
something which you both have done such

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:16.889
something which you both have done such
 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.100
something which you both have done such
wonderful work with in your own ways

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110
wonderful work with in your own ways
 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.309
wonderful work with in your own ways
maybe you by studying the patterns in

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319
maybe you by studying the patterns in
 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.649
maybe you by studying the patterns in
the hippocampus of rodents to see how

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:24.659
the hippocampus of rodents to see how
 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.309
the hippocampus of rodents to see how
they represent space around them and you

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319
they represent space around them and you
 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.110
they represent space around them and you
have created such incredibly elaborate

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120
have created such incredibly elaborate
 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.390
have created such incredibly elaborate
patterns in the art world so to explore

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400
patterns in the art world so to explore
 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.519
patterns in the art world so to explore
this connection meet them in art and

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529
this connection meet them in art and
 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.350
this connection meet them in art and
science i would like to start to ask you

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360
science i would like to start to ask you
 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.070
science i would like to start to ask you
a lot for how has science and in

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080
a lot for how has science and in
 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.079
a lot for how has science and in
thinking about intelligence inspired

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.089
thinking about intelligence inspired
 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:48.140
thinking about intelligence inspired
your art well more generally I've I look

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150
your art well more generally I've I look
 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.600
your art well more generally I've I look
often at times to see what they come up

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610
often at times to see what they come up
 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.480
often at times to see what they come up
with with regards how to verbalize with

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490
with with regards how to verbalize with
 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.800
with with regards how to verbalize with
what on earth's they're doing because

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810
what on earth's they're doing because
 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.019
what on earth's they're doing because
obviously I think what is exciting is

00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:57.029
obviously I think what is exciting is
 

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:58.579
obviously I think what is exciting is
that the subject matter can be so

00:07:58.579 --> 00:07:58.589
that the subject matter can be so
 

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:01.879
that the subject matter can be so
incredibly abstract and and and on one

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:01.889
incredibly abstract and and and on one
 

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:04.969
incredibly abstract and and and on one
side and on the other side do you hear

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979
side and on the other side do you hear
 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.850
side and on the other side do you hear
me Frank yeah because I wanted to get

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860
me Frank yeah because I wanted to get
 

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.930
me Frank yeah because I wanted to get
the body language to

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:10.940
 

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:18.350
I'm here traction not at all not at all

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360
I'm here traction not at all not at all
 

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.190
I'm here traction not at all not at all
i'm super focused now but so the point

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.200
i'm super focused now but so the point
 

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.590
i'm super focused now but so the point
being so for instance in cosmology or in

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:24.600
being so for instance in cosmology or in
 

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.990
being so for instance in cosmology or in
deep astrophysics i guess you call it

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000
deep astrophysics i guess you call it
 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.820
deep astrophysics i guess you call it
measuring of deep space I mean so

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:28.830
measuring of deep space I mean so
 

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.530
measuring of deep space I mean so
exciting to see how do they come up with

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:30.540
exciting to see how do they come up with
 

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.110
exciting to see how do they come up with
a terminology that somehow covers the

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120
a terminology that somehow covers the
 

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.430
a terminology that somehow covers the
stuff they turned their trying to

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440
stuff they turned their trying to
 

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.400
stuff they turned their trying to
somehow how do they map with regards to

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.410
somehow how do they map with regards to
 

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.980
somehow how do they map with regards to
mapping what they're working on right

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:39.990
mapping what they're working on right
 

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.570
mapping what they're working on right
because it seems that the one of the

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:41.580
because it seems that the one of the
 

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.300
because it seems that the one of the
limits is simply to imagine what they

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.310
limits is simply to imagine what they
 

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.220
limits is simply to imagine what they
are working on and so as an artist I

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.230
are working on and so as an artist I
 

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.840
are working on and so as an artist I
look into them because you know it's

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:47.850
look into them because you know it's
 

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.820
look into them because you know it's
actually it has to do with abstraction

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:49.830
actually it has to do with abstraction
 

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.310
actually it has to do with abstraction
something really abstract and then they

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320
something really abstract and then they
 

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.680
something really abstract and then they
had to apply words I'll keep are to some

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:54.690
had to apply words I'll keep are to some
 

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.250
had to apply words I'll keep are to some
extent models visualizations experiments

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260
extent models visualizations experiments
 

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.230
extent models visualizations experiments
on to this very curious because

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240
on to this very curious because
 

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.180
on to this very curious because
obviously it's like spacing the

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.190
obviously it's like spacing the
 

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.270
obviously it's like spacing the
unsurpassable adding space to something

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:05.280
unsurpassable adding space to something
 

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.730
unsurpassable adding space to something
and for that they bring about you know

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740
and for that they bring about you know
 

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.440
and for that they bring about you know
patterns like the one you are

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:09.450
patterns like the one you are
 

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.460
patterns like the one you are
successfully evolved and and and as an

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:13.470
successfully evolved and and and as an
 

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.800
successfully evolved and and and as an
artist I'm very curious in that yeah and

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:18.810
artist I'm very curious in that yeah and
 

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.350
artist I'm very curious in that yeah and
let me ask the same corresponding

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360
let me ask the same corresponding
 

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.460
let me ask the same corresponding
question to you my retina how has art

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:24.470
question to you my retina how has art
 

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.820
question to you my retina how has art
inspired your science would you say I

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:27.830
inspired your science would you say I
 

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.330
inspired your science would you say I
think as humans we depend on art because

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:32.340
think as humans we depend on art because
 

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.420
think as humans we depend on art because
it gives us I know that you don't like

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:35.430
it gives us I know that you don't like
 

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.610
it gives us I know that you don't like
that that I say that it gives us

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620
that that I say that it gives us
 

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.710
that that I say that it gives us
pleasure but it's challenging at the

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720
pleasure but it's challenging at the
 

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.050
pleasure but it's challenging at the
same time and that is part of the art

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.060
same time and that is part of the art
 

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.970
same time and that is part of the art
that it's challenging for it or not

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980
that it's challenging for it or not
 

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.340
that it's challenging for it or not
right and I think that is what we see in

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:46.350
right and I think that is what we see in
 

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.450
right and I think that is what we see in
science too so when we saw these grid

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:50.460
science too so when we saw these grid
 

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.780
science too so when we saw these grid
cells that we discovered in our lab that

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:53.790
cells that we discovered in our lab that
 

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.520
cells that we discovered in our lab that
you have cells that just expand

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:58.530
you have cells that just expand
 

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.510
you have cells that just expand
throughout the environment and the cell

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:02.520
throughout the environment and the cell
 

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.470
throughout the environment and the cell
knows how when it should be silent and

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480
knows how when it should be silent and
 

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.290
knows how when it should be silent and
when it should not be silent and it

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300
when it should not be silent and it
 

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.660
when it should not be silent and it
creates a pattern that looks like a

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:11.670
creates a pattern that looks like a
 

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.300
creates a pattern that looks like a
hexagon looks like looks a lot like your

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:14.310
hexagon looks like looks a lot like your
 

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.690
hexagon looks like looks a lot like your
handbag there yeah with the hex

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:18.700
handbag there yeah with the hex
 

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.190
handbag there yeah with the hex
a hexagonal grid pattern I think that is

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200
a hexagonal grid pattern I think that is
 

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.570
a hexagonal grid pattern I think that is
kind of of art just to see that and you

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:27.580
kind of of art just to see that and you
 

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.980
kind of of art just to see that and you
have to have this creative mind in order

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:31.990
have to have this creative mind in order
 

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.900
have to have this creative mind in order
to see and I think that is what

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:33.910
to see and I think that is what
 

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.050
to see and I think that is what
hopefully we share that we have eyes

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.060
hopefully we share that we have eyes
 

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.070
hopefully we share that we have eyes
that can see something that is right but

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.080
that can see something that is right but
 

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.320
that can see something that is right but
I think so so I totally agree but we

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.330
I think so so I totally agree but we
 

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.180
I think so so I totally agree but we
also have to see there is an there's a

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:45.190
also have to see there is an there's a
 

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.100
also have to see there is an there's a
potential for criticism and this is the

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.110
potential for criticism and this is the
 

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.810
potential for criticism and this is the
kind of how do we then evolved because

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:48.820
kind of how do we then evolved because
 

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.000
kind of how do we then evolved because
what we make the mistake and often think

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.010
what we make the mistake and often think
 

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.830
what we make the mistake and often think
is that the grits the patterns the

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:52.840
is that the grits the patterns the
 

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.260
is that the grits the patterns the
architected the urban planning society

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.270
architected the urban planning society
 

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.900
architected the urban planning society
at a whole we take it for granted as

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:57.910
at a whole we take it for granted as
 

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.290
at a whole we take it for granted as
being natural or static and no not

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300
being natural or static and no not
 

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.480
being natural or static and no not
non-negotiable so the learning in this

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:03.490
non-negotiable so the learning in this
 

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.970
non-negotiable so the learning in this
is of course once you can understand

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:05.980
is of course once you can understand
 

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.490
is of course once you can understand
alternative patterns as a model you can

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:08.500
alternative patterns as a model you can
 

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.470
alternative patterns as a model you can
also apply that and realize that what we

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480
also apply that and realize that what we
 

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.110
also apply that and realize that what we
normally define as reality max you

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120
normally define as reality max you
 

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.900
normally define as reality max you
listening what we normally defined as

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:15.910
listening what we normally defined as
 

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.890
listening what we normally defined as
reality is in fact a cultural and and

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:19.900
reality is in fact a cultural and and
 

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.810
reality is in fact a cultural and and
you know very much relative and so there

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:21.820
you know very much relative and so there
 

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.030
you know very much relative and so there
is a critical potential once you

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040
is a critical potential once you
 

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.270
is a critical potential once you
discover let's face it a new model it's

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:27.280
discover let's face it a new model it's
 

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.470
discover let's face it a new model it's
not that the new model represents

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480
not that the new model represents
 

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.620
not that the new model represents
reality it is the critical potential

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:31.630
reality it is the critical potential
 

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.690
reality it is the critical potential
that that has on to what you normally

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:33.700
that that has on to what you normally
 

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.150
that that has on to what you normally
take for granted as being real which

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160
take for granted as being real which
 

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.940
take for granted as being real which
then suddenly is not so real anymore

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:37.950
then suddenly is not so real anymore
 

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.400
then suddenly is not so real anymore
yeah so so that is so exciting with the

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:41.410
yeah so so that is so exciting with the
 

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.820
yeah so so that is so exciting with the
brain when we record these cells because

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:44.830
brain when we record these cells because
 

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.970
brain when we record these cells because
sometimes I've told myself oh this cell

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:47.980
sometimes I've told myself oh this cell
 

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.010
sometimes I've told myself oh this cell
should respond to this environment in

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:50.020
should respond to this environment in
 

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.750
should respond to this environment in
this and that way and then I suddenly

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760
this and that way and then I suddenly
 

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.810
this and that way and then I suddenly
think about this response as what the

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:54.820
think about this response as what the
 

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.330
think about this response as what the
animal is thinking and of course that is

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:57.340
animal is thinking and of course that is
 

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.240
animal is thinking and of course that is
not true and also when we discovered

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.250
not true and also when we discovered
 

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.360
not true and also when we discovered
this grid cell we first thought of it as

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:03.370
this grid cell we first thought of it as
 

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.430
this grid cell we first thought of it as
a universal pattern that was hardwired

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440
a universal pattern that was hardwired
 

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.650
a universal pattern that was hardwired
inherit but then we see that environment

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:10.660
inherit but then we see that environment
 

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.880
inherit but then we see that environment
can change this pattern and the geometry

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:14.890
can change this pattern and the geometry
 

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.570
can change this pattern and the geometry
of the environment can change how this

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:18.580
of the environment can change how this
 

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.780
of the environment can change how this
is expressed interesting yeah very

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:21.790
is expressed interesting yeah very
 

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.490
is expressed interesting yeah very
interesting now I'm the same question

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:23.500
interesting now I'm the same question
 

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.030
interesting now I'm the same question
Frank you've thought a lot about the

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040
Frank you've thought a lot about the
 

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.000
Frank you've thought a lot about the
relationship between art and science in

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.010
relationship between art and science in
 

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.759
relationship between art and science in
fact you just wrote this book

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:31.769
fact you just wrote this book
 

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:33.379
fact you just wrote this book
where the core premise is that maybe we

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:33.389
where the core premise is that maybe we
 

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:34.790
where the core premise is that maybe we
should think of our universe out there

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800
should think of our universe out there
 

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.269
should think of our universe out there
as a work of art you want to tell us a

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279
as a work of art you want to tell us a
 

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:41.119
as a work of art you want to tell us a
bit about how you see art related the

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:41.129
bit about how you see art related the
 

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:45.739
bit about how you see art related the
science of how this inspires you yes I

00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:45.749
science of how this inspires you yes I
 

00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:47.090
science of how this inspires you yes I
have a couple of things let me address

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100
have a couple of things let me address
 

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.970
have a couple of things let me address
the audience he is polite one thing is

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980
the audience he is polite one thing is
 

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.879
the audience he is polite one thing is
that it's naive I think although common

00:12:58.879 --> 00:12:58.889
that it's naive I think although common
 

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:01.400
that it's naive I think although common
to think of the brain has a single organ

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:01.410
to think of the brain has a single organ
 

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.280
to think of the brain has a single organ
the brain human brain actually has many

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.290
the brain human brain actually has many
 

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.150
the brain human brain actually has many
different sub units that have different

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160
different sub units that have different
 

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.559
different sub units that have different
strengths a lot of our brain is

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:11.569
strengths a lot of our brain is
 

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:13.609
strengths a lot of our brain is
developed is devoted to visual

00:13:13.609 --> 00:13:13.619
developed is devoted to visual
 

00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:17.030
developed is devoted to visual
processing and we're very good at it and

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040
processing and we're very good at it and
 

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.929
processing and we're very good at it and
that's a lot of what art is about a cup

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:20.939
that's a lot of what art is about a cup
