hi there this is Jessica from Germany do

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510
hi there this is Jessica from Germany do
 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.280
hi there this is Jessica from Germany do
you believe in any other thing than

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
you believe in any other thing than
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.009
you believe in any other thing than
human life and the universe hi Jessica

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
human life and the universe hi Jessica
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.020
human life and the universe hi Jessica
do I believe in other things than human

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
do I believe in other things than human
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.150
do I believe in other things than human
life in the universe well yes I think

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
life in the universe well yes I think
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.859
life in the universe well yes I think
it's very likely and I don't know

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
it's very likely and I don't know
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.720
it's very likely and I don't know
whether we'll ever know but it's

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
whether we'll ever know but it's
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.189
whether we'll ever know but it's
certainly a good question to approach

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
certainly a good question to approach
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920
certainly a good question to approach
scientifically to make a guess you could

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
scientifically to make a guess you could
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.900
scientifically to make a guess you could
say well we believe that there are about

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
say well we believe that there are about
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.089
say well we believe that there are about
a hundred billion galaxies that we could

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
a hundred billion galaxies that we could
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189
a hundred billion galaxies that we could
observe with our telescopes and that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
observe with our telescopes and that
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.870
observe with our telescopes and that
each of those galaxies has a hundred

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
each of those galaxies has a hundred
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.569
each of those galaxies has a hundred
billion stars in it and that at least in

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
billion stars in it and that at least in
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.940
billion stars in it and that at least in
our galaxy about 10% of the stars have

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
our galaxy about 10% of the stars have
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430
our galaxy about 10% of the stars have
planets so that means there's an immense

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
planets so that means there's an immense
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350
planets so that means there's an immense
number of places that life could

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
number of places that life could
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.500
number of places that life could
potentially exist around stars elsewhere

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
potentially exist around stars elsewhere
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940
potentially exist around stars elsewhere
in the universe and it seems pretty

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
in the universe and it seems pretty
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369
in the universe and it seems pretty
likely to me that that would happen

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
likely to me that that would happen
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.229
likely to me that that would happen
there's an awful lot of chances for it

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
there's an awful lot of chances for it
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.810
there's an awful lot of chances for it
to occur now will we find it well we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
to occur now will we find it well we
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540
to occur now will we find it well we
have to try and we have many methods to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
have to try and we have many methods to
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.869
have to try and we have many methods to
try we will probably in the next few

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
try we will probably in the next few
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.340
try we will probably in the next few
years discover an earth-like planet

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
years discover an earth-like planet
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.979
years discover an earth-like planet
around a sun-like star with the

around a sun-like star with the
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.140

observing of Observatory recently

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
observing of Observatory recently
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.000
observing of Observatory recently
launched called Kepler and other

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
launched called Kepler and other
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039
launched called Kepler and other
competing projects might even get there

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
competing projects might even get there
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469
competing projects might even get there
sooner if they're lucky so we certainly

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
sooner if they're lucky so we certainly
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270
sooner if they're lucky so we certainly
will find places where life could exist

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
will find places where life could exist
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.710
will find places where life could exist
I think in the next few years and it'll

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
I think in the next few years and it'll
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.929
I think in the next few years and it'll
take probably a few more decades to tell

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
take probably a few more decades to tell
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550
take probably a few more decades to tell
whether those places could possibly

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
whether those places could possibly
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950
whether those places could possibly
support life whether they have the right

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
support life whether they have the right
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080
support life whether they have the right
chemical composition with water and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
chemical composition with water and
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.620
chemical composition with water and
carbon dioxide and signs of life such as

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
carbon dioxide and signs of life such as
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.230
carbon dioxide and signs of life such as
oxygen which is produced here by plants

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
oxygen which is produced here by plants
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.630
oxygen which is produced here by plants
and which wouldn't occur here on the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
and which wouldn't occur here on the
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850
and which wouldn't occur here on the
earth without those plants so we can

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
earth without those plants so we can
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.230
earth without those plants so we can
tell from a distance if a planet is

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
tell from a distance if a planet is
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.380
tell from a distance if a planet is
alive if that planet is like Earth

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390
alive if that planet is like Earth
 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.819
alive if that planet is like Earth
people also ask could there be

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
people also ask could there be
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.639
people also ask could there be
intelligent life and I think yes I don't

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
intelligent life and I think yes I don't
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.050
intelligent life and I think yes I don't
think there's any reason to think that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
think there's any reason to think that
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.910
think there's any reason to think that
our situation is so unusual that there

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
our situation is so unusual that there
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.260
our situation is so unusual that there
could be no intelligent life elsewhere

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
could be no intelligent life elsewhere
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359
could be no intelligent life elsewhere
in the universe on the other hand

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
in the universe on the other hand
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340
in the universe on the other hand
calculation says the universe is very

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
calculation says the universe is very
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.499
calculation says the universe is very
large and so it's very unlikely that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
large and so it's very unlikely that
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.080
large and so it's very unlikely that
we'll find the places where other people

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
we'll find the places where other people
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.359
we'll find the places where other people
are living and sending us messages we're

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
are living and sending us messages we're
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980
are living and sending us messages we're
looking but we haven't found anything

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
looking but we haven't found anything
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.859
looking but we haven't found anything
yet so here the problem is just that the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
yet so here the problem is just that the
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.050
yet so here the problem is just that the
Unity universe is too large for us to be

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
Unity universe is too large for us to be
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.679
Unity universe is too large for us to be
sure we'll ever find those other people
