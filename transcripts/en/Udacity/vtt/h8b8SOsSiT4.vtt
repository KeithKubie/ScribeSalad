00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.290
So far, we've talked about author-driven visualizations that are typically

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.180
linear and have predetermined narratives.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.760
We've also talked about viewer-driven visualizations, that allow viewers to

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.540
interact with the data directly to craft their own data story.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.400
I like to call these types of visualizations Choose Your Own Adventure.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.900
There's a third narrative structure,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.630
common in more complex data visualizations called the martini glass.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.760
It's called the martini glass because of its unique shape.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.600
Think of a martini glass set it on its side.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.990
It has a base, a long narrow stem, with a wide mouth.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.680
Viewers start at the base and work through the neck of the martini glass.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.520
Typically through a single path that is author-driven.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.380
When they reach the mouth, the visualization opens up and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.920
allows the viewer to freely explore different paths within the data.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.690
And to tell their own narrative.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.264
This way, it combines with the author-driven and

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:56.020
viewer-driven narrative structures in a single cohesive whole.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.170
Let's look at a few examples.
