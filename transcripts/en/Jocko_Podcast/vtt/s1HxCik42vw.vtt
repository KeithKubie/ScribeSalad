1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.630
Being around someone like you.
Like I used to be the guy who could,

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.020
I don't need to drink.
I'd go months and be like,
oh yeah,
I haven't had a drink.

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:09.240
Like you know what,
I'll have a drink and,

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.480
and you don't drink and you haven't drank since you were like in your twenties I

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.290
think I haven't drank since I retired.
Oh,
okay.

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:20.190
So last time I felt the effects of alcohol,
which I felt quite strongly.

7
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.850
Was that basically the day I retired.
Yeah,
you're in the day I retired,

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.350
which was October 1st,
2010 you know,

9
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.680
of course me and the boys,
we went out,
we had a bunch of drinks.

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.370
I woke up in the morning cause I still wake up early and I woke up in the

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.300
morning and I was like,
well yeah,

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.700
that's done because I've got other stuff I've got to do now.

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.520
And basically when I no longer had,

14
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.230
we'll call them friends to drink with.
Yeah.
Then I was like,
yeah,

15
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:50.490
well I'm done with that.
And I just ever since then,
just haven't really,

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.050
I've had,

17
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.380
and another thing is sometimes people think I'm like offended if they have

18
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:58.440
drinks or whatever.
And I'm hearing,
I'm not,
you know,
I remember actually I went,

19
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.510
I was on the first podcast I was on was Tim Ferriss.
Yup.

20
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.340
And we got done with the podcast and he,
you know,

21
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.610
we went out to grab some food because I was staying the night at his house and

22
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:12.330
we went out and we got some food,
we've got some mistake.
And he's like,

23
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.610
do you mind if I have a glass of wine with this?
And I was like,
Bro,
I don't care.

24
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.820
You know?
Yeah.
You know,
like a reformed alcoholic.
Yeah.

25
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.470
You just decided one day you're like,
my dad one day he was like,
Eh,

26
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:24.350
this gets in the way of work.
Yeah.
That's Kinda,

27
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.330
that's kind of my attitude doesn't really,
yeah.
I mean,

28
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.660
if I want to drink something that tastes good,
then I'll drink chocolate milk,

29
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.840
which I love the taste of Jocko white tea.
Right.
I mean,

30
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.440
that stuff makes me feel good and I just,
um,
yeah,

31
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.480
and people asked me about a lot and I need is something that I need to address

32
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:42.240
on the podcast because the other thing is just,

33
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.190
I might as well double into this a little bit right at this moment,

34
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:49.020
but when I was a kid,
I was into hardcore music I was into and,

35
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.040
and the type of music that I listened to was against drinking and against the,

36
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:58.890
it was punk that you talked about.
It is,
yeah.
We're talking straight edge.

37
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.550
We're talking minor threat.
Yeah.
Really?
Yes,
absolutely.

38
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.500
And so it was almost,
and I was,
again,
I was never really,
I'm very,

39
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.120
I'm very,
I'm not a real good follower.

40
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.980
So any time there's some kind of a movement going on,
I'm always like saying,

41
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:20.910
wait,
why is this moving going?
Why am I always questioned?
I don't just jump in.

42
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.810
I'm hard to get on board with something like that.

43
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.400
So it was around,
I wasn't like,
so there's a,
there's a thing with straight edge.

44
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.860
Okay.
So this,
this thing was called straight edge.
It started in,

45
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.520
I'd say you'd see the,
the epicenter of it was in Washington DC.

46
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.990
The first band really to coined the term was minor threat,

47
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.960
which is a punk band.
A heartburn if I've heard of them.

48
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.140
I assume they were partiers.
No,
not at all by the name.
No.

49
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.910
And so one of the things that,
one of the symbols of straight edge was uh,

50
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.060
you know when you go to a bar or when kids used to go to bars for a show for a,

51
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.950
for a music show,
if they were too young to drink once when the bouncer,

52
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:01.420
I looked at their ID card that they'd put a big x on their hands.

53
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.490
And so the straight edge symbol was they'd put the x's on their hands,

54
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.520
meaning look,
I don't drink.
And it's actually funny cause I took my,

55
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.320
two of my kids to see the white buffalo the other night in San Diego and it was

56
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.700
awesome.
And,
but when they came,
when they show their ideas,

57
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.920
they got the x's on their hands and I was like,
Oh yeah,
it always is.

58
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.120
So what the straight edge kids would do is they would draw big x's on their

59
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.400
hands,
meaning,
hey look,
I'm not drinking.

60
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.300
So there was the Adnan that of course morphed into like a gang.

61
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.740
And there was no,
by the time I was,
uh,
you know,
middle teenager,

62
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:43.741
there was hardcore gangs that would assault people that drank and would get

63
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.900
crazy vinyls guys and together with the Juggalos.
Yeah.
So it just,
so,

64
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.670
so,
so when I was a kid I was okay and I wasn't like a full on,

65
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.790
I wasn't drawing.
I don't think,
I know I never like had x's on my story,
but I,

66
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.000
but I understood philosophically what was being said,
right.

67
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.690
Which was,
look,
I want to win,
right.
I'm hardcore,

68
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.570
I want to be stronger,
I want to be aware,

69
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.110
I want to be alert and drinking and doing drugs doesn't give me any of those

70
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:17.860
things.
So at that point,
that,
so sorry,
but even at that age,

71
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.880
you understood the fuel that goes into the machine affects the performance.
Yes.

72
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.830
See I didn't get that as a young man.
Yes.
So here I am.
And,
and it was,

73
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.180
you know,
I was disciplined and you know,
I had a before the seals,
oh yeah.

74
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.280
I had a band,
a hardcore band.

75
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.720
The name of my hardcore band was rage of discipline.

76
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.780
That was the name of my hardcore band.
That was af.
That's what,

77
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.600
that's what Bronson's children.
Cause my first band when I was like 13,

78
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.860
was called Bronson's children.

79
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.970
But then as I got older I got more hardcore than it became a rage of discipline.

80
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.550
There was also about nine all,
it's broad since children Bronson,

81
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:56.140
she bronzes Charlesville he didn't drink,
I don't even know.
Oh,

82
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.430
[inaudible] name.
We do know Charles Bronson was a Badass when I was a kid.

83
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.130
I thought Charles Bronson was the man because he was the baddest man on the

84
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:07.940
planet.
He was,
you know,
uh,
a tail gunner in a,
you know,

85
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.920
bomber in World War II.
And he grew up in the mines when he was a kid,

86
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.650
when he was 10 years old or 11 years old,
he was working in the mines.

87
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.940
And until he was old enough that he used to have to wear a dress,

88
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.480
cause he didn't have parents that have money to buy him clothes.

89
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.770
He had to wear one of his sister's dresses down to the mind.

90
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.650
So then he went to World War II and then he became,
and you know,

91
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.130
he's just had great movies.

92
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.630
He always played this stoic character that was on emotional.
And so I was,

93
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.510
you know,
hey,
when I grew up going to be Charles Bronson of course.

94
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.330
So then we had a band,
it was called Bronson children.
Well,

95
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.040
as we got more hardcore,

96
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:43.340
eventually that name morphed into rage of discipline of which Elgin.

97
00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:46.840
And James was the guitarist,
who's another buddy of mine that echo is met,

98
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.470
who will come on the podcast at some point and tell his crazy life story,

99
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.310
which I'm a big part of in the beginning until I joined the military.

100
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:58.610
When we get to hear the pre military Jocko.
Yeah.

101
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.590
So I'll be tuning into that one long story.
Then I joined the military.
Yeah.

102
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.380
So when I joined the military,
what do I want to be?
I want to be,

103
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.240
I want to be a seal.
I want to be a frog man.

104
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.670
I want to be the best frogman I can be.
I show up at a seal team.

105
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.990
Guess what frogman do frogman drink.
Okay,
cool.
I didn't know that.

106
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.310
Now that I know that,
give me a,

107
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.860
give me a shot of Jagermeister cause I'm ready to rock and roll.

108
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.950
And that was sort of how you proved yourself and that's what we did.

109
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.040
And I was immature and dumb and,

110
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.570
and despite everything I just said about like,
Hey,
I'm a little bit,

111
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.900
I'm hesitant to really follow,
well now I'm in the seal teams.

112
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.500
This is my dream job and this is what I want to do.
If you don't buy in,

113
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.540
you're not in.
Yeah.
And it's like it's not,

114
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.870
I don't even know if it's just like that's the way it is.
Yeah.

115
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.800
My first drink I was 17 right after I finished basic training,

116
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.370
I show up at the regimen and they're like,
all right,
what are you drinking?

117
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.460
And I'm like,
cause my family's full of alcoholics on both sides.

118
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.190
And it's nothing against them.
Like,
you know,

119
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:59.210
Grandpa was my other grandpa was and Grandpa's Grandpa was and you know,

120
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:03.020
one of my uncles,
okay,
they might hear this,
but like we all know what you do.

121
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:07.070
Okay.
Right.
So not a big deal,
but um,
and dad,
but dad was one of those guys,

122
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:09.590
he was like,
well,
that just doesn't affect me and me personally,

123
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.350
like you as a kid,
I'm like,
I don't really see the interest.
Like,

124
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:15.500
what am I going to throw up on myself and whatever,
whatever.

125
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.310
And I was one of those kids that say no to drugs,
actually worked on,
you know,

126
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:21.380
like,
uh,
now I'm older and I'm like,
man,

127
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:26.030
I should've been smoking weed since I was like 12 and shit.
But,
um,
I still don't,

128
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:29.150
but I did.
I just like,
you see the effects on people.
Like when I was a Bouncer,

129
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm like,
yeah,
like the guy who smoked weed,
a really mellow,

130
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.800
and the guy that had coke and drank or like,

131
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:38.210
they were the ones who are the problem.
But,
um,
when I get to the regimen,

132
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.790
the first night of parade has done and they're like,
okay,
what are you drinking?

133
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.900
And I'm like,
well I'm 17.
They're like,
this is an army mess.
Like it's okay,
just,

134
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.510
we'll worry.
We're all going to keep an eye.
Like it's up to like,

135
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.990
I'm not trying to tell the world like,
Hey,
underage people drink,
but hey,

136
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:51.860
underage people drink,

137
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:54.950
but it's an environment full of people that are there to look out for each
other.

138
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:59.030
Anyway,
so I had a couple of drinks and I'm like,
okay,
this is the way it is.

139
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.580
And same thing work Monday to Friday.
You work your ass off,
you,

140
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.430
you go hard as you can.
Like you go hard in the paint,
right?
Your,
your,

141
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:12.320
your tires are or are stripped at the end of the day.
Friday rolls around.

142
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.240
Okay.
We don't see it.
8:00 AM Monday morning boys.
And uh,
you know,

143
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.690
if you're going to drink,
don't drive.
But if you do drink driver,

144
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.860
that's what you got told when you were dismissed for the weekend.
Right?
Yeah.

145
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.530
And so basically have fun,
blow off the steam.

146
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:31.130
Don't hurt anybody and take care of each other is basically what you're told.

147
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.270
So the seal teams definitely is a culture.

148
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.300
It was even more when I first got in because now you're talking about the old

149
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:42.200
Vietnam guys and there wasn't a war going on and it was just,
hey,

150
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:44.900
what are you going to do if there's no war going on and you're,

151
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.040
you're a frog man,
what are you gonna do?
Well,
we drank and,
and I'm not,

152
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:53.030
I'm going to look down on,
I mean,
we had a great time.
It was fun,
you know,
it was,

153
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.920
it was fun.
It was what you know was what we did.

154
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.240
And I'm not even trying to say anything negative about it,

155
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.590
but that's what it was.
And unfortunately,
there's a lot of guys,

156
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.503
I shouldn't even say a lot.

157
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.540
There's a decent number of guys that don't do well with alcohol man.

158
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.090
And it ruins their lives.
It ruins or careers.
And that sucks.
It sucks to see.

159
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.750
I never really had any issues.
I drank when I drank.

160
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.440
It never interfered with my one year of your time in any way.
And you know,

161
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.710
that was it.
It wasn't a huge deal.
And I mean,

162
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:27.060
of course what I mean when I'm talking,
when I was 1920 2122,

163
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.290
I mean we drank a lot.

164
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.240
We drank all lots of weird how your body lets you at that age a lot.
Yeah.

165
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.530
And you got up the next morning,

166
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.440
we got up the next morning property like it was nothing we,

167
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.330
and that's what we did.
Um,
but then like I said,
and even now,
you know,
when I,

168
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360
when I go out and hang out with some of my old buddies or actually it's more not

169
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.160
when I just went,
if I go and hang out with some of my old buddies,

170
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.760
we probably don't even,
you know,
maybe have a beer.
But when I go out,

171
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.520
let's see the young guys,
the young guys are getting after it.

172
00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:59.910
I don't look down on them at all.
I think you know,
you're getting after it.

173
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.773
I found,

174
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.930
I've found when I hung out with my buddies that are still serving you,

175
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.450
not in the gig anymore,
you're not doing the job.
So you're a little out of shape.

176
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.790
Your,
your drills are a little rusty maybe,
or whatever.

177
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.230
I find when I'm around guys my age that are still operational,

178
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.940
I can't keep up with them drinking or because it's part of the training.

179
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:24.870
It's part of the culture.
I've fallen off.
And even like before I was in,

180
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:28.800
I didn't really drink.
And then when it got out,
I stopped drinking as much,

181
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.480
you know,
and it's not like,
again,
guys,

182
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.620
we're not Jocko and iron saying in the military were all functional alcoholics.

183
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:38.040
What we're saying is it's just what we do.
And you know,

184
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.950
and remember the job that we volunteer to do,
we,

185
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:45.810
we volunteered or run into gunfire,
uh,
for our countries and for fun,
like,

186
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.580
let's face it,
a lot of us think it's fun.

187
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.260
I thought it was the best time of my life,

188
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.090
but he's still got a blow off that steam.
