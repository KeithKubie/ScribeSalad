00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:02.548
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians,
today I want to talk to you

00:00:02.548 --> 00:00:05.479
about the idea of the
perfect aspect of verbs.

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:07.698
And what that means is
that it's not, you know,

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:10.599
beyond reproach, or that it's
like beautiful and shiny.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.619
No, no, no, no, no.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.624
What it means is really that
whatever we're talking about,

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:17.654
whatever action we are
talking about is complete.

00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:20.647
So we use the perfect aspect in all tenses

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:23.371
to illustrate when
something has been completed

00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:25.197
prior to the present moment.

00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:26.829
So when we talk about the present,

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.852
we're talking about one point: now.

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:32.402
But when we're using, when we use aspect,

00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:37.402
it enables us to talk about a
period between then and now.

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:40.946
You're speaking in the now
referring to a point previous.

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:43.587
So we could say, using the perfect,

00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:46.654
the way you form the perfect
is you simply add have

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:49.507
and then you use the
past form of the verb.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:53.165
So if my assignment, for example,
were to wash some dishes,

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.968
when the dishes were complete,
I would say to the person

00:00:55.968 --> 00:01:00.968
that told me to wash the dishes,
"I have washed the dishes."

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:04.108
So I'm using the present
tense form of to have,

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:07.077
and the past tense form of washed.

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:09.234
So as with the progressive aspect,

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:11.906
the thing that changes is the helper verb.

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:15.210
This part, the main verb, does not change.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.250
It remains in the past tense, even if

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.436
we're talking about the
present or the future.

00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:21.632
The part that changes is have.

00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:25.480
So if we want to put
this story in the past,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.980
you know, talk about a period
that is "then" but also say

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.656
that we washed the dishes at
a period before then, right,

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:38.991
before the moment in the past
that we're talking about,

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:40.736
if that makes sense, we would say,

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:45.047
"I had washed the dishes."

00:01:46.547 --> 00:01:49.367
And if we want to talk about
something in the future

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.628
that happens before that
future moment but after now,

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:55.253
we would use the future perfect to say,

00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:59.658
"I will have washed the dishes."

00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:02.646
And that's what the perfect
aspect allows us to do.

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:06.578
It allows us to travel backward
in time a little bit extra.

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:10.520
It allows us to say, oh, well,
before the point in the story

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.033
that I'm mentioning, this
thing was already completed.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.646
So the perfect enables us
to say, here is a thing

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:18.952
that happened in the past,
here is a verb action

00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:20.459
that has completed in the past

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.059
prior to the moment I'm talking about.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.722
So to recap, the perfect
refers to something finished.

00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:29.740
You can learn anything, David out.
