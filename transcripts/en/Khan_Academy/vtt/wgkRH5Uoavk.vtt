00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.658
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that we have some function

00:00:02.658 --> 00:00:04.135
f of x right over here.

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:07.500
And let me graph an arbitrary f of x.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.280
So, that's my y-axis, that is my x-axis

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.360
and maybe f of x looks
something like that.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.322
And what I wanna do is I
wanna approximate f of x

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:18.970
with a Taylor polynomial

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.830
centered around x is equal to a.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.590
So this is the x-axis, this is the y-axis.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.326
So I want a Taylor polynomial
centered around there.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:29.926
And we've seen how this works.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.254
The Taylor polynomial
comes out of the idea

00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:34.820
that for all of the derivatives up to

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.300
and including the degree
of the polynomial,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.573
those derivatives of that
polynomial evaluated at a

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.760
should be equal to the derivatives

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.390
of our function evaluated at a.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.090
And that polynomial evaluated at a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.522
should also be equal to that
function evaluated at a.

00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:51.420
So our polynomial, our Taylor polynomial

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.760
approximation would look
something like this.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.316
So, I'll call it P of x.

00:00:57.316 --> 00:00:59.795
And sometimes you might see
a subscript, a big N there

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.030
to say it's an Nth degree approximation

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.381
and sometimes you'll
see something like this.

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:06.923
Sometimes you'll see
something like N comma a

00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:10.096
to say it's an Nth degree
approximation centered at a.

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:11.690
Actually, I'll write that right now.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.350
Maybe we might lose it if
we have to keep writing it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.090
over and over but you
should assume that it is

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630
an Nth degree polynomial centered at a.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.960
And it's going to look like this.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.280
It is going to be f of a,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.071
plus f prime of a,

00:01:27.118 --> 00:01:29.500
times x minus a,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.900
plus f prime prime of a,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.391
times x minus a squared over--

00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.550
Either you could write
two or two factorial,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.750
they're the same value.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.760
I'll write two factorial.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.890
You could write a divided by

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.119
one factorial over here, if you like.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.990
And then plus, you go to the
third derivative of f at a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.710
times x minus a to the third power,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.295
I think you see where this is going,

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:54.820
over three factorial.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.020
And you keep going, I'll
go to this line right here,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.220
all the way to your Nth degree term

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.220
which is the Nth derivative of f

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.651
evaluated at a times x minus a

00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:11.700
to the N over N factorial.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.226
And this polynomial right over here,

00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:15.936
this Nth degree polynomial centered at a,

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:21.379
f or P of a is going to be
the same thing as f of a.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.160
And you can verify that
because all of these

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.142
other terms have an x minus a here.

00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:27.129
So if you put an a in the polynomial,

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.956
all of these other terms
are going to be zero.

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:31.330
And you'll have P of a is equal to f of a.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.373
Let me write that down.

00:02:34.512 --> 00:02:36.717
P of a is equal to f of a.

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:38.513
And so it might look something like this.

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:40.626
And it's going to fit the curve better

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:43.226
the more of these terms
that we actually have.

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:44.856
So it might look something like this.

00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:47.836
I'll try my best

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.793
to show what it might look like.

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:55.943
So this is all review,
I have this polynomial

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.496
that's approximating this function.

00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:00.310
The more terms I have, the
higher degree of this polynomial,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.096
the better that it will fit this curve

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:04.852
the further that I get away from a.

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.450
But what I wanna do in
this video is think about

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.026
if we can bound how good it's fitting

00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:15.099
this function as we move away from a.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.659
So what I wanna do is
define a remainder function.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.258
Or sometimes, I've seen some text books

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:21.053
call it an error function.

00:03:21.053 --> 00:03:22.686
And I'm going to call this--

00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:26.666
I'll just call it an error--

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:28.826
Just so you're consistent with all the

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:30.311
different notations you
might see in a book,

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.201
some people will call
this a remainder function

00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.691
and sometimes they'll
write a remainder function

00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:37.256
for an Nth degree
polynomial centered at a.

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:40.022
Sometimes you'll see this
as an error function.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.993
The error function is sometimes avoided

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:45.767
because it looks like expected
value from probability.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:49.191
But you'll see this often,
this is E for error.

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:50.886
E for error, R for remainder.

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:52.026
And sometimes they'll also have

00:03:52.026 --> 00:03:54.496
the subscripts over there like that.

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:56.286
And what we'll do is, we'll just define

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.676
this function to be the difference between

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:05.252
f of x and our approximation
of f of x for any given x.

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:07.566
So it's really just going to be,

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:10.469
I'll do it in the same colors,
it's going to be f of x

00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:13.722
minus P of x.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.886
Where this is an Nth degree polynomial

00:04:19.148 --> 00:04:20.391
centered at a.

00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:23.486
So for example, if
someone were to ask you,

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:24.918
or if you wanted to visualize.

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:27.390
What are they talking
about if they're saying

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.657
the error of this Nth degree
polynomial centered at a

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:33.124
when we are at x is equal to b.

00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:36.456
What is thing equal to or how
should you think about this.

00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:38.723
Well, if b is right over here.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.911
So the error of b is going to be f of b

00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:43.943
minus the polynomial at b.

00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:46.566
So f of b there, the
polynomial's right over there.

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:48.966
So it'll be this distance right over here.

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:51.194
So if you measure the error at a,

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.177
it would actually be zero.

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:56.556
Because the polynomial and the
function are the same there.

00:04:56.556 --> 00:04:58.329
F of a is equal to P of a,

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:00.064
so the error at a is equal to zero.

00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:01.202
And let me actually write that down

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:02.477
because that's an interesting property.

00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:05.780
It'll help us bound it
eventually so let me write that.

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:09.050
The error function at a.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.296
And for the rest of this
video you can assume

00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:13.675
that I could write a subscript.

00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:16.849
This is for the Nth degree
polynomial centered at a.

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.426
I'm just gonna not write that everytime

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:21.030
just to save ourselves a
little bit of time in writing,

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.777
to keep my hand fresh.

00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:25.118
So the error at a is equal to

00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:27.696
f of a minus P of a.

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:29.356
And once again, I won't
write the sub-N, sub-a.

00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:30.686
You can assume it, this is an

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:32.953
Nth degree polynomial centered at a.

00:05:32.953 --> 00:05:35.696
And these two things
are equal to each other.

00:05:35.696 --> 00:05:37.333
So this is going to be equal to zero.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:38.426
And we see that right over here.

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:41.426
The distance between the
two functions is zero there.

00:05:41.426 --> 00:05:43.248
Now let's think about something else.

00:05:43.248 --> 00:05:47.023
Let's think about what the derivative

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:52.187
of the error function evaluated at a is.

00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:55.051
Well that's going to be the
derivative of our function at a

00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:58.096
minus the first derivative

00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:00.270
of our polynomial at a.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.514
And if we assume that this is

00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:06.595
higher than degree one, we
know that these derivates

00:06:06.595 --> 00:06:08.496
are going to be the same at a.

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:10.112
You can try to take the
first derivative here.

00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:12.790
If you take the first
derivative of this whole mess--

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.331
And this is actually why Taylor
polynomials are so useful,

00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:19.350
is that up to and including
the degree of the polynomial

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.988
when you evaluate the derivatives
of your polynomial at a

00:06:21.988 --> 00:06:22.956
they're going to be the same

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:25.341
as the derivatives of the function at a.

00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.426
And that's what starts to
make it a good approximation.

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:29.156
But if you took a derivative here,

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.760
this term right here will
disappear, it'll go to zero.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.086
I'll cross it out for now.

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.970
This term right over here
will just be f prime of a

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.725
and then all of these other
terms are going to be left with

00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:41.108
some type of an x minus a in them.

00:06:41.108 --> 00:06:42.519
And so when you evaluate it at a,

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.626
all the terms with an x minus a disappear,

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:46.419
because you have an a minus a on them.

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:47.766
This one already disappeared

00:06:47.766 --> 00:06:50.750
and you're literally just left with

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.426
P prime of a will equal f prime of a.

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:56.356
And we've seen that before.
So let me write that.

00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:58.954
So because we know that P prime of a

00:06:58.954 --> 00:07:01.626
is equal to f prime of a,

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:04.743
when you evaluate the error function,

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:06.556
the derivative of the error function at a,

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:09.756
that also is going to be equal to zero.

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:12.294
And this general property right over here,

00:07:12.294 --> 00:07:14.696
is true up to an including N.

00:07:14.696 --> 00:07:16.676
So let me write this down.

00:07:16.676 --> 00:07:21.096
So we already know that P
of a is equal to f of a.

00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:25.086
We already know that P prime
of a is equal to f prime of a.

00:07:25.086 --> 00:07:26.696
This really comes straight
out of the definition

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.286
of the Taylor polynomials.

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.426
And this is going to be true all the way

00:07:30.426 --> 00:07:34.664
until the Nth derivative
of our polynomial is going,

00:07:34.664 --> 00:07:37.756
evaluated at a, not everywhere,
just evaluated at a,

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:40.390
is going to be equal to the Nth derivative

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.156
of our function evaluated at a.

00:07:44.156 --> 00:07:46.486
So what that tells us is
that we can keep doing this

00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:50.084
with the error function all
the way to the Nth derivative

00:07:50.084 --> 00:07:53.391
of the error function evaluated at a

00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.076
is going to be equal to,

00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:57.055
well that's just going
to be the Nth derivative

00:07:57.055 --> 00:08:00.886
of f evaluated at a,
minus the Nth derivative

00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:03.151
of our polynomial evaluated at a.

00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:04.672
And we already said that
these are going to be

00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:06.714
equal to each other up
to the Nth derivative

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:08.226
when we evaluate them at a.

00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:10.793
So these are all going
to be equal to zero.

00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:12.156
So this is an interesting property

00:08:12.156 --> 00:08:13.992
and it's also going to
be useful when we start

00:08:13.992 --> 00:08:16.686
to try to bound this error function.

00:08:16.686 --> 00:08:18.166
And that's the whole
point of where I'm going

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:20.179
with this video and
probably the next video,

00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:22.084
is we're gonna try to bound it so we know

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:24.540
how good of an estimate we have.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.659
Especially as we go further and further

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:27.991
from where we are centered.

00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:30.426
&gt;From where are approximation is centered.

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:33.877
Now let's think about when we
take a derivative beyond that.

00:08:33.877 --> 00:08:35.178
So let's think about what
happens when we take the

00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:36.878
N plus oneth derivative.

00:08:38.498 --> 00:08:39.316
What's a good place to write?

00:08:39.316 --> 00:08:41.923
Well I have some screen
real estate right over here.

00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:46.143
What is the N plus oneth derivative

00:08:46.143 --> 00:08:48.086
of our error function?

00:08:48.086 --> 00:08:49.836
And not even if I'm just evaluating at a.

00:08:49.836 --> 00:08:52.226
If I just say generally,
the error function E of x,

00:08:52.226 --> 00:08:54.306
what's the N plus oneth derivative of it?

00:08:54.306 --> 00:08:56.034
Well it's going to be the
N plus oneth derivative

00:08:56.034 --> 00:08:57.669
of our function

00:09:02.954 --> 00:09:06.665
minus the N plus oneth derivative of our--

00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:08.284
We're not just evaluating
at a here either.

00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:10.036
Let me write a x there.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.713
I'm literally just taking
the N plus oneth derivative

00:09:16.713 --> 00:09:20.246
of both sides of this
equation right over here.

00:09:20.246 --> 00:09:21.756
So it's literally the
N plus oneth derivative

00:09:21.756 --> 00:09:24.414
of our function minus the
N plus oneth derivative

00:09:24.414 --> 00:09:26.476
of our Nth degree polynomial.

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:32.544
The N plus oneth derivative
of our Nth degree polynomial.

00:09:32.544 --> 00:09:34.826
I could write a N here,
I could write an a here

00:09:34.826 --> 00:09:38.258
to show it's an Nth degree centered at a.

00:09:38.258 --> 00:09:42.151
Now, what is the N plus onethe derivative

00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:44.858
of an Nth degree polynomial?

00:09:44.858 --> 00:09:47.166
And if you want some hints,

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:52.686
take the second derivative
of y is equal to x.

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:56.154
It's a first degree polynomial,
take the second derivative,

00:09:56.154 --> 00:09:57.994
you're gonna get zero.

00:09:57.994 --> 00:10:02.366
Take the third derivative
of y is equal to x squared.

00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:05.226
The first derivative is 2x,
the second derivative is 2,

00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:07.026
the third derivative is zero.

00:10:07.026 --> 00:10:10.486
In general, if you take
an N plus oneth derivative

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:11.911
of an Nth degree polynomial,

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.062
and you could prove it for yourself,

00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:14.226
you could even prove it generally

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:16.860
but I think it might make
a little sense to you,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.255
it's going to be equal to zero.

00:10:19.255 --> 00:10:21.336
It is going to be equal to zero.

00:10:21.336 --> 00:10:24.021
So this thing right here, this
is an N plus oneth derivative

00:10:24.021 --> 00:10:26.086
of an Nth degree polynomial.

00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:29.593
This is going to be equal to zero.

00:10:33.826 --> 00:10:34.726
Let me write this over here.

00:10:34.726 --> 00:10:38.397
The N plus oneth derivative
of our error function

00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:40.326
or our remainder function,
we could call it,

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:43.290
is equal to the N plus oneth

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.591
derivative of our function.

00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:49.459
And so, what we could do now

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:51.923
and we'll probably have to
continue this in the next video,

00:10:51.923 --> 00:10:54.742
is figure out, at least can we bound this?

00:10:54.742 --> 00:10:57.426
Can we bound this and if
we are able to bound this,

00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:58.509
if we're able to figure out

00:10:58.509 --> 00:11:00.086
an upper bound on its magnitude--

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.044
So actually, what we want to do is,

00:11:02.044 --> 00:11:03.941
we wanna bound its overall magnitude.

00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:06.036
We wanna bound its absolute value.

00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:07.680
If we can determine that it is

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.198
less than or equal to some value M,

00:11:11.198 --> 00:11:12.400
so if we can actually bound it,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.486
maybe we can do a little bit of calculus,

00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:15.896
we could keep integrating it

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.529
and maybe we can go back
to the original function

00:11:18.529 --> 00:11:20.156
and bound that in some way.

00:11:20.156 --> 00:11:23.756
If we do know some type of
bound like this over here.

00:11:23.756 --> 00:11:26.580
So I'll take that up in the next video.
