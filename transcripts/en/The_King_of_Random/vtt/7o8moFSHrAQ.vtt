00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.750
What would your friends say, on a hot summers
day, if you could open up a bottle of water

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.759
and pour out an instant snow cone? In this
project we're exploring some tips, some tricks,

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.839
and everything else you'll need to know, to
master the art of making instant ice.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.690
In a previous video, we turned water like
this, directly to ice in just an instant.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.010
For this project you'll just need some purified
water, and the easiest place to find that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.890
is in a water bottle. Go ahead and throw about
6 bottles in the freezer, because the more

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.489
bottles you start with, the better chances
you're gonna have for success. The temperature

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.680
dial in my freezer was set to 5 of 7, and
that settled to a temperature of -24ºC or

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.380
around -11ºF. Now, these bottles have been
sitting at room temperature overnight, and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.409
in my experience this trick works best if
they're evenly spaced, and placed on their

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.320
sides. The minute the door closes, make a
note of the time. After an hour and a half,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.590
check your bottles to see if any of them have
frozen. If they're all still liquid, then

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.290
quickly close the door, but keep checking
on them every 15 minutes. For these particular

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.390
bottles, it took 2 hours and 45 minutes for
the first one to freeze. Looking at the bottle,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.329
you can see it's not frozen solid, but you
should see flakes of ice floating around under

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.649
the plastic. At this point, stop and take
note of the time. Then subtract 15 minutes,

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.430
and now you have a supercooling formula for
your favorite brand of water. In my case,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.860
this trick works from 2-1/2 hours to 2 hours
and 45 minutes. Now if the bottles in the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.560
freezer, haven't frozen yet, take them out
very gently. This water is well below freezing,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.270
but hasn't frozen yet because there aren't
any impurities to get it started. The water

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.329
does want to freeze, and that's why something
as simple as a jolt to the side can be enough

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:15.930
to nucleate the ice formation, and just like
magic, you've got instant ice. You'll notice

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.540
that bottles this cold will develop a layer
of condensation making it harder to see inside,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.370
so go ahead and wipe that off. This way, when
you hit it, you'll have a much better view

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.010
of the crystal formations. Another way to
start your water freezing, is to use a piece

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.680
of ice. Put the ice anywhere you want, and
then pour your water overtop. You should see

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.699
it freeze instantly, and build quickly into
instant ice sculptures like these. I put an

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.299
ice cube on this rock, and you can see the
crystals build every time the water makes

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.989
contact with the ice. You could make this
easier by using a whole bowl of ice. Now if

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.949
you start pouring your water, and it doesn't
look like it's building pillars very quickly,

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.930
it means your water hasn't cooled enough,
and probably needs another 5-10 minutes in

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.510
the freezer. This bottle did come out 10 minutes
later, and you can see a dramatic difference

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.949
in how quickly it freezes. If you leave your
bottles in the freezer too long, They may

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:11.880
be so sensitive that even wiping the side
of the bottle initiates the freeze. And it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.900
could be complete before you even get the
cap off. If you do get the cap off, pouring

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.250
too slowly might result in this effect where
the water doesn't pour out at all. And that's

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.060
because it iced up in the bottle neck, and
it's freezing the rest of the way down. If

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.360
you're wondering how cold the water actually
is, I was able to measure one bottle at -4.5ºC

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.100
/ 24ºF, and there's a good chance they are
actually colder than that. If you try pouring

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.400
this supercooled liquid into a glass, you
might notice it looks a little thick and syrupy.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.040
If you get to this point, try touching the
surface gently with an ice cube. Everything

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.449
freezes firm enough to hold the ice cube in
place, and makes a nice little platform to

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:55.150
continue building your ice towers. When trying
this approach, it's important that the glass

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.970
is extremely clean, because even a microscopic
impurity can trigger the nucleation, and solidify

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.449
your experiment prematurely. You could try
using this effect to pour yourself an instant

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.850
snow cone. As the water freezes, it actually
releases latent heat in the reaction and warms

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.259
the ice into a delicious slush. I tried using
the juice in these freeze pops as a make-shift

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.699
snow-cone syrup, and poured it on top to get
3 different flavors. Well, now you know everything

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.930
you need to know about making instant ice.
If you want to see colored crystals, try pouring

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.510
2 drops of food coloring in the water before
you freeze it. Well, that's it for now. If

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.730
