00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:06.473
&gt;&gt; Jon: HELLO, FRIENDS. IT'S
HAPPENED AT LAST. WINTER'S

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:15.582
CHILL GREY HAS YIELDED TO
THE FULL WARMTH OF SPRING 

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:20.287
THE NEW SEASON'S SEEDLINGS AWAKE
FROM THEIR SLUMBER AND BURST

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.522
THROUGH THE THAWING LOAM
BLOSSOMING IN GLORIOUS COLORS

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.257
AND RELEASING ANOTHER YEAR'S
BOUNTY OF POLLEN

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:24.258
 WHICH WHILE IT IS NICE FOR

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:30.831
THE PLANTS, THREATENS TO
KILL US ALL!

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.001
&gt;&gt; ALLERGY EXPERTS THIS
MORNING ARE WARNING OF A

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.203
POLLEN TSUNAMI.
&gt;&gt; A POLLEN TSUNAMI IS SWEEPING

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.671
ACROSS MOST OF AMERICA RIGHT
NOW.

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:40.040
&gt;&gt; POLLEN TSUNAMI SUDDENLY
HITTING VERY HARD.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.609
&gt;&gt; POLLEN TSUNAMI, SOUNDS
LIKE WE MADE IT UP.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.377
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO!

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:47.147
(LAUGHTER)
NO, NO, POLLEN TSUNAMI,

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.317
DEFINITELY SOUNDS LIKE A
REAL SCIENTIFIC TERM.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:54.054
AND INCREDIBLY APPROPRIATE
ONE COMPARING ITCHY EYES AND

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.156
SNEEZING TO NATURAL
DISASTERS THAT KILL HUNDREDS

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.357
OF THOUSANDS.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.427
REALLY! I CHECKED IN A BOTANY
TEXTBOOK, POLLEN TSUNAMI.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.528
RIGHT THERE IN THE GLOSSARY

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.398
NO, I DON'T EVEN NEED TO
CHECK IT I TRUST YOU, YOU ARE

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.399
THE NEWS.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.668
ALTHOUGH I FEEL LIKE LAST
YEAR THEY GAVE ALLERGY

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:09.803
SEASON A DIFFERENT DISASTER
MOVIE NAME.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:13.240
&gt;&gt; WE ARE DONE AND DONE WITH
THAT POLAR VORTEX FOR THIS

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.309
YEAR BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
POLLEN VORTEX.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:18.011
&gt;&gt; WHAT SOMEWHERE NOW
CALLING THE POLLEN VORTEX.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.781
&gt;&gt; THE POLLEN VORTEX IS
LAUNCHING AN ASSAULT.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.549
&gt;&gt; YES, YES, YES.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.454
POLLEN VORTEX OR AS IT IS
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO, THE

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.255
GARDEN.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:31.725
(LAUGHTER)
SO SOMETIMES THE CREATIVE

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.861
DESCRIPTIONS OF ALLERGY
SEASON MISS THE MARK.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.932
BUT ISN'T THAT WHY GOD
INVENTED CLICHES

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.468
&gt;&gt; ABOUT 40 MILLION AMERICAN
SUFFER FROM SEASONAL

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.502
ALLERGIES.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.538
AND THIS SPRING THEY'RE
GETTING HIT WITH A PERFECT

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:45.639
STORM OF MISERY.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:49.142
&gt;&gt; A PERFECT STORM FOR
ALLERGY SUFFERERS.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.611
&gt;&gt; THE PERFECT STORM OF
ALLERGIES.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.214
&gt;&gt; PERFECT STORM FOR ALLERGY
SUFFERERS.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.050
&gt;&gt; THE PERFECT STORM, A LOT
OF SNOW, A LOT OF WATER AND

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.954
NOW A LOT OF WARM WEATHER,
PERFECT STORM.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.457
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; IF IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:08.595
AT THE SAME TIME, THAT
DOESN'T REALLY COUNT AS A

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.197
PERFECT STORM, REALLY.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:12.065
IT'S JUST A [BLEEP] STORM.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.502
IN FACT THE ONLY THING
PERFECT HERE IS HOW

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.604
PREDICTABLE THE COVERAGE OF
POLLEN IS YEAR AFTER YEAR.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.873
&gt;&gt; THIS SPRING IS SHAPING UP
TO BE THE WORSE ALLERGY

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.108
SEASON IN YEARS.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.377
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE WORST ALLERGY
SEASONS IN AREAS.

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:26.380
&gt;&gt; THE WORST ALLERGY SEASON
THAT WE HAVE EVER, EVER

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.347
SEEN.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.782
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE WORST ALLERGY
SEASONS ON RECORD.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.151
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE WORSE ALLERGY
SEASONS EVER.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:34.021
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE WORSE ALLERGY
SEASONS IN YEARS.

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.223
&gt;&gt; ALLERGY SEASON IS ALREADY
ONE OF THE WORST IN RECENT

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.090
MEMORIES.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.692
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE WORST ALLERGY
SEASON EVER.

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:41.395
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE WORST ALLERGY
SEASONS IN YEARS.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:44.464
&gt;&gt; THE WORST ALLERGY SEASON
IN A DECADE.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:50.504
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN EVERY YEAR BE THE

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.938
WORST EVER.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:59.613
WHAT, IS IT THE KNICKS?
66
00:02:59,613 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
