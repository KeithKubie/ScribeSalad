whatever and I didn't feel identified
with them so I didn't really understand

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219
with them so I didn't really understand
 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.550
with them so I didn't really understand
what this idea of being either

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
what this idea of being either
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.389

American but I was somehow didn't feel
like I was Arab American so it was

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209
like I was Arab American so it was
 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.459
like I was Arab American so it was
confusing and also my parents you know

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469
confusing and also my parents you know
 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.190

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
my father was an English professor so I

my father was an English professor so I
it didn't make sense that you know

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
it didn't make sense that you know
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.209
it didn't make sense that you know
nothing made sense and we were Christian

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219
nothing made sense and we were Christian
 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.190
nothing made sense and we were Christian
and not only Christian we were Quaker so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
and not only Christian we were Quaker so
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.649
and not only Christian we were Quaker so
all of the things that I would hear

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
all of the things that I would hear
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.599
all of the things that I would hear
about what an Arab was I didn't fit any

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609
about what an Arab was I didn't fit any
 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.179
about what an Arab was I didn't fit any
of them and so it was difficult but I

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189
of them and so it was difficult but I
 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.739
of them and so it was difficult but I
find it was funny because when I was at

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749
find it was funny because when I was at
 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.469
find it was funny because when I was at
a school with mostly Christian people

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479
a school with mostly Christian people
 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.519
a school with mostly Christian people
even though I was Christian and I felt

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:55.529
even though I was Christian and I felt
 

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:57.499
even though I was Christian and I felt
really different and then I went and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
really different and then I went and
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.059
really different and then I went and
switched schools and I went to high

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069
switched schools and I went to high
 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.949
switched schools and I went to high
school with mostly Jewish people and I

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959
school with mostly Jewish people and I
 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.169
school with mostly Jewish people and I
felt more comfortable and it's sort of

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179
felt more comfortable and it's sort of
 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.209
felt more comfortable and it's sort of
that funny thing of how because they

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
that funny thing of how because they
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.029
that funny thing of how because they
were Jewish and they knew about Israel

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
were Jewish and they knew about Israel
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.139
were Jewish and they knew about Israel
and what was going on in the Middle East

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
and what was going on in the Middle East
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.610
and what was going on in the Middle East
somehow I became able to know what it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
somehow I became able to know what it
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.750
somehow I became able to know what it
meant to be Arab and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760
meant to be Arab and
 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.580
meant to be Arab and
way in a more personal way and so I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
way in a more personal way and so I
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.580
way in a more personal way and so I
suddenly began exploring and finding out

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
suddenly began exploring and finding out
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.250
suddenly began exploring and finding out
who I was but it was it was really

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
who I was but it was it was really
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.660
who I was but it was it was really
really confusing as a general

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
 
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.190
 
I found a way in because I started with

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200
I found a way in because I started with
 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.630
I found a way in because I started with
the premise of everyone thinks I'm

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
the premise of everyone thinks I'm
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.010
the premise of everyone thinks I'm
Jewish and so I this has been

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020
Jewish and so I this has been
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.660
Jewish and so I this has been
misconstrued because people haven't seen

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670
misconstrued because people haven't seen
 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.400
misconstrued because people haven't seen

sensational thing about how I talk about
being Jewish and they get confused but

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
being Jewish and they get confused but
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.400
being Jewish and they get confused but

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000
that like you couldn't offend anyone so
 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.099

on the other hand so on the one hand I I

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109
on the other hand so on the one hand I I
 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.930
on the other hand so on the one hand I I
managed to say a lot of truths about

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940

what goes on in Israel and Palestine and
 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.530
what goes on in Israel and Palestine and
the Middle East in general but on the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540
the Middle East in general but on the
 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.699
the Middle East in general but on the
other hand I was able to do in a

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709
other hand I was able to do in a
 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.160
other hand I was able to do in a
disarming way which I think you can only

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170
disarming way which I think you can only
 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.640
disarming way which I think you can only
get if you're born of two cultures

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650
 
 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.780

about my youth and I talked about this

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860
about my youth and I talked about this
 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.650

only time I've ever been there when I
 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.029
only time I've ever been there when I
was 18 in 1992 at the time I was very

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039
was 18 in 1992 at the time I was very

anorexic that part was less it was
difficult but it was less difficult than

difficult but it was less difficult than
 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.719
difficult but it was less difficult than
some of the more recent stuff because it

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729
some of the more recent stuff because it
 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.689
some of the more recent stuff because it
was long ago and I've processed it and

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699
was long ago and I've processed it and
 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.379
was long ago and I've processed it and
been through in therapy and I'm better

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389
been through in therapy and I'm better

so everyone thinks oh you're so brave
too but that part was really it was

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720
too but that part was really it was
 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.900
too but that part was really it was
difficult on a daily basis to rehearse

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910
difficult on a daily basis to rehearse
 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.689
difficult on a daily basis to rehearse
this period of you know who wants to be

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699
this period of you know who wants to be
 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.730
this period of you know who wants to be

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740
18 again who wants to be an adolescent
 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.560
18 again who wants to be an adolescent
again it was everything was miserable

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570
again it was everything was miserable
 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.870
again it was everything was miserable
and so dramatic and you don't want to go

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880
and so dramatic and you don't want to go
 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.070
and so dramatic and you don't want to go
through that again but on the other hand

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080
through that again but on the other hand
 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.900
through that again but on the other hand
it was nice to go back and just be like

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910
it was nice to go back and just be like
 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.279
it was nice to go back and just be like
I'm not this person anymore look how

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289
I'm not this person anymore look how
 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.480
I'm not this person anymore look how
much I've grown um but there and like

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490
much I've grown um but there and like
 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.310
much I've grown um but there and like
the more recent stuff like my father's

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320
the more recent stuff like my father's
 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.010
the more recent stuff like my father's
death I kept in rehearsal when we got to

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020
death I kept in rehearsal when we got to
 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.480
death I kept in rehearsal when we got to
the part where my father died I kept

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490
the part where my father died I kept
 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.600
the part where my father died I kept
skipping the section and going on to the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610
skipping the section and going on to the
 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.460
skipping the section and going on to the
next one they were like go back you

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470
next one they were like go back you
 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.409
next one they were like go back you
after your father has to die and it's

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419
after your father has to die and it's
 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.900
after your father has to die and it's
chronological so it was you know it was

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910
chronological so it was you know it was
 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.640
chronological so it was you know it was
just this mental block in my head and

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650
just this mental block in my head and
 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.339
just this mental block in my head and
and I found that very very challenging

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349
and I found that very very challenging
 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.890
and I found that very very challenging
but I think what happened ultimately was

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900
but I think what happened ultimately was
 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.529
but I think what happened ultimately was
that I began to feel like my father was

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539
that I began to feel like my father was
 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.770
that I began to feel like my father was
on stage with me for the duration of the

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780
on stage with me for the duration of the
 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.270
on stage with me for the duration of the
performance so I tried to flip it so it

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280
performance so I tried to flip it so it
 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.620
performance so I tried to flip it so it
was like a positive thing that I was

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630
was like a positive thing that I was
 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.399
was like a positive thing that I was
with him for the whole hour and 40

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409
with him for the whole hour and 40
 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.560
with him for the whole hour and 40
minutes and I think that helped a little

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570
minutes and I think that helped a little
 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.089
minutes and I think that helped a little
but it was it was definitely difficult

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099
but it was it was definitely difficult
 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.960
but it was it was definitely difficult
and also one last thing was I spoke

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970
and also one last thing was I spoke
 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.770
and also one last thing was I spoke
about being in Lebanon as a nine year

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780
about being in Lebanon as a nine year
 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.339
about being in Lebanon as a nine year
old being bombed and then again in 2006

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349
old being bombed and then again in 2006
 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:17.219
old being bombed and then again in 2006
as a grownup being bombed and what's

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229
as a grownup being bombed and what's
 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:23.219
as a grownup being bombed and what's
interesting about that is that I didn't

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229
interesting about that is that I didn't
 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.680
interesting about that is that I didn't
really realize that I was traumatized as

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690
really realize that I was traumatized as
 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.290
really realize that I was traumatized as
a little girl until I was there in 2006

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300
a little girl until I was there in 2006
 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.390
a little girl until I was there in 2006
and I heard the bombs again and I had a

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400
and I heard the bombs again and I had a
 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.350
and I heard the bombs again and I had a
very sort of overwhelming seemingly

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360
very sort of overwhelming seemingly
 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.620
very sort of overwhelming seemingly
melodramatic

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630
melodramatic
 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.110
melodramatic
action which I guess is trauma or

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120
action which I guess is trauma or
 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.040
action which I guess is trauma or
post-traumatic stress so when we

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050
post-traumatic stress so when we
 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.950
post-traumatic stress so when we
recreated both of those events both

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960
recreated both of those events both
 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.290
recreated both of those events both
being bombed in Lebanon is an 8 year old

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.630
and as a however old I wasn't 2006 I'm
really bad at math um I my reactions

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640
really bad at math um I my reactions
 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.780
really bad at math um I my reactions
were real and so he they made it very

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790
were real and so he they made it very

there's no way you can replicate the

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050
there's no way you can replicate the
 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.590
there's no way you can replicate the
sound of a bomb when it's real because

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600
sound of a bomb when it's real because
 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.760
sound of a bomb when it's real because
part of it is the psychological

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770
part of it is the psychological
 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.000
part of it is the psychological
knowledge that it's a bomb and the other

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010
knowledge that it's a bomb and the other
 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.100
knowledge that it's a bomb and the other
thing is that it's just louder and

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110
thing is that it's just louder and
 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.600
thing is that it's just louder and
scarier than anything you've ever heard

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610
scarier than anything you've ever heard
 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.630
scarier than anything you've ever heard

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640
so they very consciously used a sound
 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.340
so they very consciously used a sound
cue that was like a drum you can tell

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350
cue that was like a drum you can tell
 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.770
cue that was like a drum you can tell
it's a drum but the loud noise really

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780
it's a drum but the loud noise really
 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.610
it's a drum but the loud noise really
really really scared me but then again

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620
really really scared me but then again
 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.640
really really scared me but then again
that was an advantage because I was

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650
that was an advantage because I was
 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.710
that was an advantage because I was
really scared every night so on the one

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720
really scared every night so on the one
 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.660
really scared every night so on the one
hand when you're retelling a story it's

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:30.670
hand when you're retelling a story it's
 

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.700
hand when you're retelling a story it's
you know it's it can be very emotionally

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.710
you know it's it can be very emotionally
 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.830
you know it's it can be very emotionally
intense in a in a negative way but it

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840
intense in a in a negative way but it
 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.690
intense in a in a negative way but it
also serves you because you're really

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:39.700
also serves you because you're really
 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.320
also serves you because you're really
able to relive it in a very pure way for

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330
able to relive it in a very pure way for
 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.590
able to relive it in a very pure way for
the audience so I think that that was

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:46.600
the audience so I think that that was
 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.439
the audience so I think that that was
kind of great

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449
 
 

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:53.480
 
I think one of the things that was

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490
I think one of the things that was
 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.369
I think one of the things that was
important to me was that it not be

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:55.379
important to me was that it not be
 

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:00.800
important to me was that it not be
dismissed as a shallow you know young

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:00.810
dismissed as a shallow you know young
 

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.240
