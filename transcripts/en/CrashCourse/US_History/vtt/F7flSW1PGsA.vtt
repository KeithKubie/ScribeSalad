Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. History and today we’re going to finish

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.529
our discussion of Progressivism, and indulge
in a bit of “great man” history.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.339
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Great man history, huh?
Well I was born on a sunny, summer morning

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.099
in 197--
Yeah you’re not great, Me from the Past.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.920
Also, you’re a boy not a man, and the only
historically significant thing you ever participated

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.650
in was a brilliant senior prank that wasn’t
even your idea.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.740
However, 39 of our 43 presidents were, at
least arguably, great men and today we’ll

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.970
be talking about three of them. It will be
kind of like a Jefferson vs. Hamilton for

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.760
the 20th century, except not like that at
all. But there will be a canal, and TWO people

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.990
get shot.
Intro

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.990
So, as we saw in CrashCourse World History,
national governments were on the rise from

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.060
the middle of the 19th century until basically
now.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.020
And in the U.S., Corporations became national
and then, by the twentieth century, international.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.960
Like, the British East India Company was kind
of an international corporation, but it wasn’t

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.850
the same as Coca-Cola, although they did both
deal in narcotics.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.140
And this mania for nationalization even affected
sports. Like, in baseball, the National league

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.330
and the American league were formed and in
1903 they played the first inaccurately named

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.790
World Series.
I’m sorry, was Botswana invited? Then it’s

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.240
not a World Series.
Anyway, the rise of a strong, national government

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.240
was seen as an alternative to people’s lives
being controlled by provincial city and state

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.080
governments or by ever-growing corporations.
Like, Herbert Croly, editor of the New Republic,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.690
thought that to achieve the Jeffersonian democratic
self-determination ideal of individual freedom,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.490
the country needed to employ Hamiltonian government
intervention in the economy. And he wasn’t

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.120
the only one who believed that.
Okay, so in 1901, 42-year-old Theodore Roosevelt

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.280
became the youngest American president ever
after William McKinley was assassinated by

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.540
Leon Czolgosz. Czol--? Czolg--? Czol--? Hold
on.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.810
“Czolgosz. Polish.”

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.409
Czolgosz? Czolgosz? His name was Leon Chuckles?
Man, Leon Chuckles was a real barrel of laughs

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.119
for an anarchist. Usually they’re very serious.
Right, so Leon Chuckles paved the way for

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.129
Teddy Roosevelt, who in many ways the model
of the 20th century president.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.719
He was very engaged in both domestic and foreign
policy and he set the political agenda for

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.189
the whole country. His political program,
the Square Deal, aimed to distinguish good

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.609
corporations that provided useful products
and services at fair prices from evil corporations

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:30.879
that existed just to make money. That is hilarious.
A corporation that doesn’t exist just to

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.900
make money. That’s fantastic, Teddy.
Everybody knows that corporations are just

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.049
inherently greedy people, but they are people.
Roosevelt felt it was the federal government’s

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.219
responsibility to regulate the economy directly
and to break up power of wealthy corporations,

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.749
and he used the Sherman Act to prosecute bad
trusts such as the Northern Securities Company,

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.069
which was a holding company created by J.P.
Morgan that directed three major railroads

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.439
and monopolized transport.
And that did not make J.P. Morgan a happy

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.169
bunny. Thank you for that, Stan. That’s,
that’s wonderful.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.269
Shockingly, the legislative and executive
branches managed to work together and Congress

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.109
passed some actual legislation, including
the Hepburn Act of 1906, which gave the Interstate

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.329
Commerce Commission the power to regulate
railroad rates and examine their company books.

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.109
And Roosevelt was also a conservationist.
He wanted to preserve the environment from

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.279
economic exploitation, probably so that there
would be plenty of animals for him to hunt

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:24.059
with his big stick while he walked softly.
Having appointed noted progressive Gifford

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:28.930
Pinchot head of the forest service, millions
of acres were set aside for new, highly managed

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.469
national parks reflecting the progressive
idea that experts could manage the world.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.049
But then in 1908, Teddy Roosevelt decided
to go elephant hunting instead of running

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.459
for re-election and he picked William Howard
Taft to be his successor, but the man who

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.389
became our largest president massively disappointed
Roosevelt.

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.180
When I say “our largest,” by the way,
I don’t mean our greatest. I mean our largest.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.139
Taft was a pretty hard-core trust-buster who
ordered the prosecution that broke up Standard

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:00.349
Oil in 1911, but he didn’t see big business
as bad unless the corporations stifled competition.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.489
He also supported the 16th amendment, allowing
Congress to pass an income tax, and that paved

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.279
the way for the 18th amendment, Prohibition,
because with an income tax, the federal government

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:13.129
didn’t have to rely on liquor excise taxes.
So, why didn’t Roosevelt like Taft? Well,

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.079
not only was Taft more conservative than most
progressives, he also fired Pinchot in 1910.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.090
And Roosevelt was so frustrated with Taft
that he actually challenged the incumbent

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.669
president for the Republican nomination in
1912.

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.639
Which Roosevelt lost, but he didn’t let
it drop. He founded his own Progressive Party,

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.240
called the Bull Moose Party so that he could
run again.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.430
So, the election of 1912 featured four candidates:
Taft; Teddy Roosevelt for the Bull Moose Party;

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.169
Eugene Debs, for the Socialist Party; and
Democrat Woodrow Wilson.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.310
It’s worth noting that in contemporary American
political discourse, all four of these people

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.090
would have been seen as somewhere between
crazy liberals and actual communists.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.289
So Eugene Debs, from right here in my home
state of Indiana, did not support the Socialist

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.259
Party’s goal of abolishing capitalism, but
he ran on a platform that included public

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.340
ownership of railroads and banks, and laws
limiting work hours.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.259
And running on the socialist ticket, Debs
won 6% of the vote, which was, to quote another

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.900
president, “not bad.”
But the election of 1912 turned out to be

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.000
a contest between Wilson and Roosevelt’s
competing views over the dangers of increasing

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.349
government power and economic concentration.
Wilson claimed, “Freedom today is something

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.370
more than being let alone. The program of
government must in these days be positive,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.970
not negative merely.” That’s just not
good grammar, sir.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.650
His program, called New Freedom, was supposed
to reinvigorate democracy by restoring market

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.240
competition and preventing big business from
dominating government. It included stronger

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.759
anti-trust laws and policies to encourage
small businesses.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.129
Roosevelt’s answer to New Freedom was a
program he called New Nationalism, because,

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.979
of course, in election years all things are
new.

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.979
Roosevelt recognized the inevitability of
big business and hoped to use government intervention

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.229
to stop its abuses.
New Nationalism included heavy taxes on personal

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.699
and corporate fortunes and greater federal
regulation of industries.

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.099
So, the Bull Moose Party platform was in some
ways a vision of a modern welfare state, it

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:01.889
called for:

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.129
Women’s suffrage
Federal regulation

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.500
National labor and health legislation for
women and children

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.689
Eight hour days and living wage for all workers
National systems of social insurance for health,

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:15.360
unemployment, and old age

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.680
What are we, Canada?
God, I wish we were Canada...You weren’t

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.550
recording that, were you, Stan?
Roosevelt thought his party’s platform was

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.379
one of the most important documents in the
history of mankind, and Americans agreed,

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.680
they supported him and elected him in a landslide.
Oh wait, no they didn’t.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.300
Instead, he lost. And also, a guy shot him
at one of his campaign stops, that’s shooting

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.289
#2. Roosevelt however survived and even went
on to make the speech after being shot.

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.159
What happened in the election is that Taft
and Roosevelt split the Republican vote, leaving

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:49.639
Woodrow Wilson president with a mere 42% of
the popular vote, giving us our only democratic

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.849
president between 1896 and 1932.
Oh, it’s time for the mystery document?

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:59.270
The rules here are simple.
I guess the author of the mystery document.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.719
If I’m wrong, I get shocked by the shock
pen, which many of you insist is fictional,

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.870
but I promise, it’s not.
“The two things we are fighting against,

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.710
namely, excessive tariffs and almost universal
monopoly, are the very things that these two

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.889
branches of the Republican party both decline
to combat. (...) They intend to accept these

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.680
evils and stagger along under the burden of
excessive tariffs and intolerable monopolies

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.319
as best they can through administrative commissions.
I say, therefore, that it is inconceivable

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:30.699
that the people of the United States, whose
instinct is against special privilege and

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:35.409
whose deepest convictions are against monopoly,
should turn to either of these parties for

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.960
relief when these parties do not so much as
pretend to offer them relief.”

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.199
Alright, it’s definitely about the 1912
election. It talks about the Republican party

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:50.719
being split into two parts, so it’s by a
democrat. Or a socialist, but probably a democrat

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:55.229
judging from the Mystery Document itself.
You always make it hard, Stan. So it’s not

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.249
going to be Woodrow Wilson because that would
be obvious, but I do not know the names of

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:06.139
any other prominent democrats, so I am going
to guess Woodrow Wilson. YES? Get in!

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:12.210
So, with its stirring anti-tariff, anti-monopoly,
do not pass GO, do not collect $200 stance,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.569
New Freedom won out, and because the Democrats
also controlled Congress, Wilson was able

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:19.580
to implement this program.
The Underwood Tariff reduced import duties

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.909
and after the ratification of the 16th amendment,
Congress imposed a graduated income tax on

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:27.770
the richest 5% of Americans.
Other legislation included the Clayton Act

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.880
of 1914, which exempted unions from antitrust
laws and made it easier for them to strike;

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.940
the Keating-Owen Act, which outlawed child
labor in manufacturing; and the Adamson Act

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.090
which mandated an eight hour workday for railroad
workers.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.170
If Wilson’s New Freedom sounds a lot like
Roosevelt’s New Nationalism, that’s because

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.000
they ended up being pretty similar.
Wilson engaged in less trust busting than

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.790
expected, and more regulation of the economy.
Wilson didn’t institute a national system

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.530
of health and unemployment insurance, but
he did expand the powers of the Federal Trade

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.160
Commission to investigate and prohibit unfair
monopolistic practices. He also supported

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.690
the founding of the Federal Reserve System
in 1913, which gave the government much more

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.630
control over banks in response to the Panic
of 1907 where the U.S. had to be bailed out

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.530
by J.P. Morgan.
Fear not, big banks, the government will bail

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.780
you out in due time.
So, under Roosevelt, and Wilson, and to a

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.230
lesser extent Taft, Progressivism flourished
domestically, but it also became an international

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:26.390
phenomenon as presidents expanded national
government power outside the country’s border,

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.400
mostly in the Western Hemisphere.
Like, between 1901 and 1920, U.S. marines

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.530
landed in Caribbean countries over 20 times,
usually to create a more friendly environment

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.360
for American businesses, but sometimes just
to hang out on the beach.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.280
And this points to an interesting contradiction,
Progressive presidents were very concerned

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.030
about big business as a threat to freedom
in the United States, but in Latin America

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.210
and the Caribbean, they weren’t that concerned
about freedom at all.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.720
Teddy Roosevelt especially was much more active
in international diplomacy than his predecessors.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.320
He was the first president to win the Nobel
Peace prize, for instance, for helping to

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.150
negotiate the Treaty of Portsmouth that ended
the Russo Japanese War in 1905.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.820
You may be familiar with his motto, “Speak
Softly and Carry a Big Stick” – which

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.640
essentially meant “the U.S. will intervene
in Latin America whenever we want.”

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.580
And probably the most famous such intervention
was the building of the Panama Canal. It featured

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.320
feats of engineering and succeeding where
the French had failed...Stan, these are my

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.820
favourite things! Let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.820
The way we got the 10 mile wide canal zone
wasn’t so awesome. In 1903, Panama was part

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.980
of Colombia but the U.S. encouraged Philippe
Bunau-Varilla to lead an uprising. Bunau-Varilla,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.350
a representative of the Panama Canal Company,
was so grateful after the U.S. sent a gunboat

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.650
to ensure that the Colombian army couldn’t
stop him that he signed a treaty giving the

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.960
U.S. the right to build and operate the canal
and sovereignty over newly independent Panama’s

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.160
Canal Zone, which we gave up in 2000 after
enjoying nearly 100 Years of sovereignty thanks

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.270
to Carter’s stupid altruism.
Roosevelt also added the Roosevelt Corollary

00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:00.410
to the Monroe Doctrine, the 1823 statement
that the U.S. would defend independent Latin

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.640
American states from European intervention.
Now, according to Roosevelt, we would wield

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.990
our big stick like a policeman waving around
a nightstick exercising an “international

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.920
police power” over the western hemisphere.
In practice, this meant using American troops

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.380
to ensure that Latin American countries were
stable enough for Americans to invest there.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.560
Like, in 1904 we seized the customs house
in the Dominican Republic to make sure that

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.330
they paid their debts to investors, then by
“executive agreement” American banks got

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.950
control of the DR’s finances. Roosevelt
also encouraged investment by the United Fruit

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.070
Company in Honduras and Costa Rica, helping
to turn those nations into Banana Republics.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.050
No, not the store, Thought Bubble. Yes.
Taft, on the other hand, maybe because of

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.660
his experiences as governor of the Philippines,
was less eager to wave America’s Big Stick.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.520
He emphasized loans and economic investment
as the best way to spread American influence

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.060
in a policy that came to be known as Dollar
Diplomacy. Ultimately, Dollar Diplomacy was

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.270
probably more effective, but it seemed weak
to many people in contrast to Roosevelt’s

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.260
strategy of SEND ALL THE TROOPS RIGHT NOW.
Thanks, Thought Bubble. I wore my Banana Republic

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.410
shirt just for this occasion.
So, we’ve discussed Roosevelt and Taft’s

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:11.560
foreign policy. Let’s move on to Wilson,
who was, of course, an isolationist. No. Woodrow

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.730
Wilson. Okay.
Woodrow Wilson was not a volleyball. He was

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.240
the son of a Presbyterian Minister, a former
American history professor and once had been

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.320
governor of New Jersey, so he understood moral
indecency.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.070
Wilson thought the best way to teach other
countries about the greatness of America was

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.980
to export colossal amounts of American products.
Like, in 1916, he instructed a group of businessmen,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.990
“Sell goods that will make the world more
comfortable and happy, and convert them to

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.740
the principles of America.”
In short, Woodrow Wilson believed correctly

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.650
that the the essence of democracy is the freedom
to choose among hundreds of brightly coloured

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.490
breakfast cereals.
Still, Wilson intervened in Latin America

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.980
more than any other U.S. President and his
greatest moral triumph was in Mexico, where

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.350
he wanted to teach the Mexicans “to elect
good men”.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.290
To do this, Wilson sent troops to stop weapons
from flowing to the military dictator Victoriano

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:07.660
Huerta but the Americans, who landed at Veracruz
were not welcomed with open arms, and 100

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.670
Mexicans and 19 Americans were killed.
And then in 1916, having learned his lesson

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.620
(just kidding), Wilson sent 10,000 troops
into northern Mexico to chase after revolutionary

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.360
bandit Pancho Villa.
Villa had killed 17 Americans in New Mexico.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.150
And everyone knows that the proper response
to such a criminal act is to send 10,000 troops

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:28.550
into a foreign country. Pershing’s expedition
was a smashing success fortunately…except

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.640
that he actually did not capture Pancho Villa.
But all of that was a prelude to Wilson’s

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.530
leading America to our first international
moral crusade, our involvement in the Great

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.770
War.
So, this period of American history is important

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:44.060
because Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson oversaw
the expansion of the power of the federal

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:49.430
government both at home and abroad, and in
doing so they became the first modern American

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.630
presidents.
I mean, these days, we may talk about small

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.030
government and large government, but really,
we’re always talking about large government.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.430
Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson recognized that
the national government was going to have

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.970
to deal with big business, and that it would
have to get big to do that. And also that

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:09.140
it had a role to play in ensuring that Americans
would retain some freedom in this new industrial

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.920
era.
And they also built neo-imperialistic foreign

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.580
policies around the idea that the safer the
world was for American business, the better

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.640
it was for Americans.
As our old friend Eric Foner wrote: “The

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.690
presidents who spoke the most about freedom
were likely to intervene most frequently in

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.280
the affairs of other countries.”
Sometimes for good and sometimes for ill,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.700
we’ll see an extreme and ambiguous case
of that next week when we look at America

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.820
in World War I. Thanks for watching. I’ll
see you then.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.000
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.110
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
Our show is written by my high school history

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.460
teacher, Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Rojas, and
myself. And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.500
Every week, there’s a new caption for the
libertage. If you’d like to suggest one,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.850
you can do so in comments where you can also
ask questions about today’s video that will

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.920
be answered by our team of historians.
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.780
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.
