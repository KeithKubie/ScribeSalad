00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.240
PROF.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.940
JERISON: So, we're ready to
begin Lecture 10, and what I'm

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.060
going to begin with is
by finishing up some

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.880
things from last time.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:42.810
We'll talk about approximations,
and I want to

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:50.420
fill in a number of comments and
get you a little bit more

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.350
oriented in the point of view
that I'm trying to express

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.980
about approximations.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.740
So, first of all, I want to
remind you of the actual

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.800
applied example that I
wrote down last time.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.730
So that was this
business here.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.590
There was something from
special relativity.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.990
And the approximation that
we used was the linear

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.360
approximation, with a - 1/2
power that comes out to be t(

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.730
1 1/2 v^2 / C^2).

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.290
I want to reiterate why
this is a useful way

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.930
of thinking of things.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.830
And why this is that this
comes up in real life.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.200
Why this is maybe more important
than everything that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.820
I've taught you about
technically so far.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.750
So, first of all, what this is
telling us is the change in t

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.440
/ t, if you do the arithmetic
here and subtract t that's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.970
using the change in
t is t' - t here.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.440
If you work that out, this is
approximately the same as 1/2

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.140
(v^2 / C^2).

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.270
So what is this saying?

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.670
This is saying that if you have
this satellite, which is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.280
going at speed v, and little c
is the speed of light, then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.220
the change in the watch down
here on earth, relative to the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.270
time on the satellite, is going
to be proportional to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.050
this ratio here.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.710
So, physically, this
makes sense.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.120
This is time divided by time.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.670
And this is velocity squared
divided by velocity squared.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.620
So, in each case, the
units divide out.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.880
So this is a dimensionless
quantity.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.960
And this is a dimensionless
quantity.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.560
And the only point here that
we're trying to make is just

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.440
this notion of proportionality.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.470
So I want to write this down.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.010
Just, in summary.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.100
So the error fraction, if you
like, which is sort of the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.030
number of significant digits
that we have in our

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.390
measurement, is proportional,
in this

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.860
case, to this quantity.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.030
It happens to be proportional
to this quantity here.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.980
And the factor is, happens
to be, 1/2.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.450
So these proportionality
factors are what

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.350
we're looking for.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.590
Their rates of change.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.380
Their rates of change of
something with respect to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.550
something else.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.800
Now, on your homework,
you have something

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.740
rather similar to this.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:38.880
So in Problem, on Part 2b, Part
II, Problem 1, there's

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.580
the speed of a pitch, right?

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.640
And the speed of the pitch is
changing depending on how high

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.600
the mound is.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.390
And the point here is that
that's approximately

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.320
proportional to the change in
the height of the mound.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.390
In that problem, we had this
delta h, that was the x

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.890
variable in that problem.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.780
And what you're trying to
figure out is what the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.350
constant of proportionality
is.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.820
That's what you're aiming
for in this problem.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.070
So there's a linear
relationship, approximately,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.890
to all intents and purposes
this is an equality.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.290
Because the lower
order terms are

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.720
unimportant for the problem.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.120
Just as over here, this function
is a little bit

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.020
complicated.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.800
This function is a little
more simple.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800
For the purposes of this
problem, they are the same.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.240
Because the errors are
negligible for the particular

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.760
problem that we're working on.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.210
So we might as well work with
the simpler relationship.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.920
And similarly, over here, so
you could do this with, in

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.280
this case with square roots,
it's not so hard here with

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.980
reciprocals of square roots.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.300
It's also not terribly hard
to do it numerically.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.030
And the reason why we're not
doing it numerically is that,

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.570
as I say, this is something
that happens all across

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.560
engineering.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.040
People are looking for these
linear relationships between

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.240
the change in some input and
the change in the output.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.910
And if you don't make these
simplifications, then when you

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.680
get, say, a dozen of them
together, you can't figure out

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.540
what's going on.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.090
In this case the design of the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.640
satellite, it's very important.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.160
The speed actually isn't
just one speed.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.070
Because it's the relative speed
of u to the satellite.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.750
And you might be, it depends
on your angle of sight with

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.890
the satellite what
the speed is.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.300
So it varies quite a bit.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.280
So you really need this
rule of thumb.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.640
Then there are all
kinds of other

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.080
considerations in this question.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.530
Like, for example, there's the
fact that we're sitting on

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.250
Earth and so we're rotating
around on what's called a

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.250
non-inertial frame.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.790
So there's the question
of that acceleration.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.220
There's the question that the
gravity that I experience here

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.830
on Earth is not the same
as up at the satellite.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.070
And that also creates a
difference in time, as a

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.580
result of general relativity.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.470
So all of these considerations
come down to formulas which

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.910
are this complicated or
maybe a tiny bit more.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.330
Not really that much.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.700
And then people simplify them
enormously to these very

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.090
simple-minded rules.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.130
And they don't keep track
of what's going on.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.070
So in order to design the
system, you must make these

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.440
simplifications, otherwise you
can't even think about

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.630
what's going on.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.860
This comes up in everything.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.680
In weather forecasting,
economic forecasting.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.880
Figuring out whether there's
going to be an asteroid that's

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.140
going to hit the Earth.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.580
Every single one of these things
involves dozens of

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.900
these considerations.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.050
OK, there was a question
that I saw, here.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.450
Yes.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:38.920
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.320
PROF.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.120
JERISON: Yeah.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.600
Basically, any problem where
you have a derivative, the

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.100
rate of change also depends upon
what the base point is.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.850
That's the question.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.060
You're saying, doesn't this
delta v also depend, I had a

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.050
base point in that problem.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.290
I happened to decide that
pitchers pitch on average

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.350
about 90 miles an hour.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.390
Whereas, in fact, some pitchers
pitch at 100 miles an

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.410
hour, some pitch at 80 miles
an hour, and of course they

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.040
vary the speed of the pitch.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.510
And so, this varies
a little bit.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.165
In fact, that's sort of
a second order effect.

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:08.220
It does change the constant
of proportionality.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.790
It's a rate of change at
a different base point.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.230
Which we're considering fixed.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.060
In fact, that's sort of
a second order effect.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.250
When you actually do the
computations, what you

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.940
discover is that it doesn't
make that much difference.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.630
To the a.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.040
And that's something that
you get from experience.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.270
That it turns out, which
things matter and

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.980
which things don't.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.820
And yet again, that's exactly
the same sort of consideration

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.670
but at the next order of what
I'm talking about here is.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.540
You have to have enough
experience with numbers to

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.210
know that if you take, if you
vary something a little bit

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.950
it's not going to change
the answer that you're

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.680
looking for very much.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.530
And that's exactly the point
that I'm making.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:51.830
So I can't make them all at
once, all such points.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.590
So that's my pitch for
understanding things from this

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.470
point of view.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.090
Now, we're going to go
on, now, to quadratic

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:13.290
approximations, which are a
little more complicated.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.110
So, we talked a little bit about
this last time but I

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.850
didn't finish.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.930
So I want to finish this up.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:26.920
And the first thing that I
should say is that you use the

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:35.680
when the linear approximation
is not enough.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.660
OK, so, that's something that
you really need to get a

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.390
little experience with.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.480
In economics, I told you they
use logarithms. So sometimes

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.030
they use log linear functions.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.190
Sometimes they use log quadratic
functions when the

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.860
log linear ones don't work.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.840
So most modeling in
economics is with

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.730
log quadratic functions.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.250
And if you've made it
any more complicated

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.740
than that, it's useless.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.850
And it's a mess.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.810
And people don't do it.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.790
So they stick with the quadratic
ones, typically.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:07.010
So the basic formula here, and
I'm going to take the base

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.745
point to be 0, is that f (
x ) is approximately f

00:09:10.745 --> 00:09:14.380
( 0 ) f' ( 0 )x.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.100
That's the linear part.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.520
Plus this extra term.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.440
Which is f'' ( 0 ) / 2x^2.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.740
And this is supposed to
work for x near 0.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:34.310
So it shows in the base point
as simply as possible.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.060
So here's more or less where
we left off last time.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.950
And one thing that I said I was
going to explain, which I

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:48.390
will now, is why it's
(1/2) f'' ( 0 ).

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.610
So we need to know that.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.770
So let's work that out
here first of all.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.290
So I'm just going to
do it by example.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.720
So if you like, the answer is
just, well, what happens when

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.600
you have a parabola?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.640
A parabola's a quadratic.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.750
It had better, its quadratic
approximation

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.450
had better be itself.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.480
It's got to be the best one.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.010
So it's got to be itself.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.500
So this formula, if it's
going to work, has

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.550
to work on the nose.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.890
For quadratic functions.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.770
So, let's take a look.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.130
If I differentiate,
I get b 2cx.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.230
If I differentiate a second
time, I get 2c.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.580
And now let's plug it in.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.450
Well, we can recover, what is
it that we want to recover?

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.650
We want to recover these numbers
a, b and c using the

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.930
derivatives evaluated at 0.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.500
So let's see.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.680
It's pretty easy, actually.
f ( 0 ) = a.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.360
That's on the nose.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.320
If you plug in x = 0 here,
these terms drop

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.070
out and you get a.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.220
And now, f' ( 0 ), whoops
that was wrong.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.100
So I wrote f' but what
I meant was f.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.950
So f ( 0 ) is a.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:13.130
Let's back up. f ( 0 ) is a, so
if I plug in x = 0 I get a.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:18.870
Now, f' ( 0 ), that's this next
formula here, f' ( 0 ), I

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.180
plug in 0 here, and I get b.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.230
That's also good.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.620
And that's exactly what the
linear approximation is

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.540
supposed to be.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.480
But now you notice, f'' is 2c.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.440
So to recover c, I better
take half of it.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.120
And that's it.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.010
That's the reason.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.690
There's no chance that any
other formula could work.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.050
And this one does.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.310
So that's the explanation
for the formula.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.700
And now I remind you that I
had a collection of basic

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.090
formulas written on the board.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.700
And I want to just make sure
we know all of them again.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:07.580
So, first of all, there was
sine x is approximately x.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.610
Cosine x is approximately
1 - 1/2 x^2.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:19.230
And e ^ x is approximately
1 x 1/2 x^2.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.230
So those were three that
I mentioned last time.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:28.980
And, again, this is
all for x near 0.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.160
All for x near 0 only.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.760
These are wildly wrong, Far
away, but near 0 they're nice,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.730
good, quadratic approximations.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.800
Now, the other two
approximations that I want to

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:46.960
mention are the logarithm and we
use the base point shifted.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.500
So we can put it at x near 0.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.630
And this one - sorry,
this is an

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.420
approximately equals sign there.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.410
Turns out to be x - 1/2 x^2.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:07.350
And the last one is one (1 x)
^ r, which turns out to be 1

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:14.480
rx r ( r - 1) / 2x^2.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.980
Now, eventually, your mind will
converge on all of these

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.380
and you'll find them relatively
easy to memorize.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.820
But it'll take some
getting used to.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.000
And I'm not claiming that you
should recognize them and

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.370
understand them all now.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.630
But I'm going to put a giant
box around this.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:42.150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.293
PROF.

00:13:42.293 --> 00:13:42.580
JERISON: Yes.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.625
So the question was, you get all
of these if you use that

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:45.775
equation there.

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:48.920
That's exactly what are you
going to do. so I already did

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.350
it actually for these
three, last time.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.880
But I didn't do it yet
for these two.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.490
But I will do it in
about two minutes.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.405
Well, maybe five minutes.

00:14:00.405 --> 00:14:10.410
But first I want to explain just
a few things about these.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.850
They all follow from
the basic formula.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.780
In fact, that one deserves a
pink box too, doesn't it.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.020
That one's pretty important.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.770
Alright.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.020
Yeah.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.100
Maybe even some little
sparkles.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:32.830
Alright.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.430
OK.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.390
So that's pretty important.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.450
Almost as important as
the more basic one

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.190
without this term here.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:47.880
So now, let me just tell you
a little bit more about the

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.740
significance.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.050
Again, this is just to reinforce
something that we've

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.640
already done.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.780
But it's closely related to
what you're doing on your

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.880
problem set.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.230
So it's worth your while
to recall this.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:10.870
So, there's this expression
that we were dealing with.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.370
And we talked about
it in lecture.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:19.900
And we showed that this tends
to e as k goes to infinity.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.110
So that's what we showed
in lecture.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.460
And the way that we did that
was, we took the logarithm and

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:32.530
we wrote it as k times, sorry,
the ln of 1 (1 / k).

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.780
And then we evaluated
the limit of this.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.220
And I want to do this limit
again, using linear

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.220
approximation.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.850
To show you how easy it is.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.820
If you just remember the
linear approximation.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.630
And then we'll explain
where the quadratic

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.390
approximation comes in.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.770
So I claim that this
is approximately

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:59.300
equal to k ( 1 / k).

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.750
Now, why is that?

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.350
Well, that's just this
linear approximation.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.500
So what did I use here?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.600
I used ln of 1 x is
approximately x.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.760
For x = 1 / k.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.600
That's what I used in this
approximation here.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.330
And that's the linear
approximation

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.010
to the natural logarithm.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.250
And this number is relatively
easy to evaluate.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.150
I know how to do it.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.010
It's equal to 1.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.680
That's the same, well, so
where does this work?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.450
This works where this
thing is near 0.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.610
Which is when k is going
to infinity.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.170
This thing is working only when
k is going to infinity.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.660
So what it's really saying, this
approximation formula,

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.910
it's really saying that as we
go to infinity, in k, this

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.720
thing is going to 1.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.890
As k goes to infinity.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.410
So that's what it's saying.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.740
That's the substance there.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.200
And that's how we want to use
it, in many instances.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.580
Just to evaluate limits.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.000
We also want to realize that
it's nearby when k is pretty

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.800
large, like 100 or something
like that.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.660
Now, so that's the idea of
the linear approximation.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:22.120
Now, if you want to get the rate
of convergence here, so

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:27.950
the rate of what's called
convergence.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:34.260
So convergence means how fast
this is going towards that.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.220
What I have to do is take
the difference.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.670
I have to take ln ak, and I have
to subtract 1 from it.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.860
And I know that this is going to
0, and the question is how

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.870
big is this.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.760
We want it to be very small.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.810
And the answer we're going to
get, so the answer just uses

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:03.570
the quadratic approximation.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.750
So if I just have a little bit
more detail, then this

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.580
expression here, in other words,
I have the next higher

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.210
order term.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.420
This is like 1 / k, this
is like 1 / k^2.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:21.100
Then I can understand how big
the difference is between the

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.260
expression that I've
got and its limit.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.200
And so that's what's
on your homework.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.610
This is on your problem set.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.210
OK, so that is more or less an
explanation for one of the

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.860
things that quadratic
approximations are good for.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.900
And I'm going to give you
one more illustration.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.360
One more illustration.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.580
And then we'll actually
check these formulas.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.430
Yeah, another question.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:55.940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.020
PROF.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.470
JERISON: That's a very
good question here.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.520
When they, which in this case
means maybe, me, when I give

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:11.020
you a question, does one specify
whether you want to

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.430
use a linear or a quadratic
approximation.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.920
The answer is, in real life
when you're faced with a

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.130
problem like this, where some
satellite is orbiting and you

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.330
want to know the effects of
gravity or something like

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.780
that, nobody is going to
tell you anything.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.320
They're not even going to tell
you whether a linear

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.740
approximation is relevant, or
a quadratic or anything.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.170
So you're on your own.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:40.290
When I give you a question, at
least for right now, I'm

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.640
always going to tell you.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.050
But as time goes on I'd like you
to get used to when it's

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.840
enough to get away with a
linear approximation.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.720
And you should only use a
quadratic approximation if

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.690
somebody forces you to.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.960
You should always start trying
with a linear one.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.480
Because the quadratic ones are
much more complicated as

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.390
you'll see in this
next example.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.660
OK, so the example that I want
to use is, you're going to be

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.110
stuck with it because I'm asking
for the quadratic.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:17.450
So we're going to find the
quadratic approximation near,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:23.740
for x near 0.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.525
To what?

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:29.490
Well, this is the same function
that we used in the

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.840
last lecture.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:37.460
I think this was it. e
^ - 3x (1 x) ^ - 1/2.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.670
OK.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.390
So, unfortunately, I stuck it in
the wrong place to be able

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.620
to fit this very long
formula here.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.100
So I'm going to switch it.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:57.070
I'm just going to
write it here.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.140
And we're going to just
do the approximation.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.830
So we're going to say quadratic,
in parentheses.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:08.450
And we'll say x near 0.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.160
So that's what I want.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.520
So now, here's what
I have to do.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.310
Well, I have to write in the
quadratic approximation for e

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:25.710
^ - 3x, and I'm going to use
this formula right here.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:33.970
And so that's (1 (-
3x) (- 3x)^2 / 2).

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:38.670
And the other factor, I'm going
to have to use this

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.460
formula down here. because
r is - 1/2.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:53.040
And so that's (1 - 1/2 x 1/2
( - 1/2)( - 3/2)x^2).

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:09.970
So this is the r term, and
this is the r - 1 term.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.750
And now I'm going to do
something which is the only

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.550
good thing about quadratic
approximations.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.500
They're messy, they're long,
there's nothing particularly

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.450
good about them.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.670
But there is one good
thing about them.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.110
Which is that you always get
to ignore the higher order

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.980
terms. So even though this
looks like a very ugly

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.590
multiplication, I can
do it in my head.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.940
Just watching it.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.710
Because I get a 1 * 1, I'm
forced with that term here.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.070
And then I get the cross terms
which are linear, which is -

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.150
3x - 1/2 x.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.920
We already did that when we
calculated the linear

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.260
approximation, so that's
this times the 1 and

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.670
this times that 1.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.100
And now I have three

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.230
cross-terms which are quadratic.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.880
So one of them is these two
linear terms are multiplying.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.160
So that's plus 3/2 x^2.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.210
That's (- 3)( - 1/2).

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.160
And then there's this term,
multiplying the 1,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.730
that's plus 9/2 x^2.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.090
And then there's one
last term, which is

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.080
this monster here.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:23.260
Multiplying 1, and
that is - 3/8.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:37.930
So the great thing is, we drop
x^3, x ^ 4, etc., terms. Yeah?

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.156
PROF.

00:23:40.156 --> 00:23:42.500
JERISON: OK, well
so copy it down.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.620
And you work it out as
I'm doing it now.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.930
So what I did is, I
multiplied 1 by 1.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.290
I'm using the distributive
law here.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.560
That was this one.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.120
I multiplied this 3x by this
one, that was that term.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.550
I multiplied this by this,
that's that term.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.120
And then I multiplied
this by this.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.860
In other words, 2 x terms
that gave me an x^2

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.940
and a (- 3)( - 1/2).

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.720
And I'm going to stop
at that point.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.440
Because the point is it's
just all the rest of the

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.230
terms that come up.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.600
Now, the reason, the only reason
why it's easy is that I

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.170
only have to go up to
x squared term.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:21.600
I don't have to do
the higher ones.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.795
Another question,
way back here.

00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:23.420
Yeah, right there.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:29.020
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:29.196
PROF.

00:24:29.196 --> 00:24:29.550
JERISON: OK.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:38.690
So somebody can check
my arithmetic, too.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.470
Good.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.630
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.861
PROF.

00:24:40.861 --> 00:24:43.466
JERISON: Why do I get to drop
all the higher-order terms.

00:24:43.466 --> 00:24:46.600
So, that's because the situation
where I'm going to

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.610
apply this is the situation
in which x is, say, 1/100.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.030
So if here's about 1/100.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.210
Here's something which is
on the order of 100.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.130
This is on the order
of 1/100^2.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:05.220
1/100^2, all of these terms.
Now, these cubic and quartic

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.520
terms are of the order
of 1/100^3.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.420
That's 10 ^ - 6.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.870
And the point is that I'm
not claiming that I

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.230
have an exact answer.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.950
And I'm going to drop things
of that order of magnitude.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.890
So I'm saving everything
up to 4 decimal places.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:29.300
I'm throwing away things which
are 6 decimal places out.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.870
Does that answer
your question?

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:35.710
PROF.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:36.370
JERISON: So.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.850
That's the situation, and now
you can combine the terms. I

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.780
mean, it's not very
impressive here.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:54.300
This is equal to 1 - 7/2
x, maybe 51/8 x^2.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.610
If I've made that, if those
minus signs hadn't canceled, I

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.560
would have gotten the
wrong answer here.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.140
Anyway.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.430
So, this is a 2 here, sorry.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.920
7/2.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.940
This is the linear approximation
we got last time

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.970
and here's the extra information
that we got from

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.540
this calculation.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:17.650
Which is this 51/8 term.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.500
Right, you have to accept that
there's a certain degree of

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.220
complexity to this problem and
the answer is sufficiently

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.900
complicated so it can't be less
arithmetic because we get

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.380
this peculiar 51/8
there, right.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.090
So one of the things to realize
is that these kinds of

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:37.050
problems, because they involve
many, many terms are always

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:43.960
going to involve a little bit
of complicated arithmetic.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.740
Last little bit, I did promise
you that I was going to derive

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.360
these two relations,
as I said.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.020
Did the ones in the
left column.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.640
So let's carry that out.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.840
And as someone just pointed out,
it all comes from this

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.900
formula here.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:07.710
So let's just check it.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.160
So we'll start with
the ln function.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.810
This is the function, f,
and then f' is 1/1 x.

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:25.030
And f'', so this is f', this
is f'', is - 1/1 x^2.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.730
And now I have to
plug in x = 0.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:35.180
So at x = 0 this is
ln 1, which is 0.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.860
So this is at x = 0.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.850
I'm getting 0 here, I plug
in 0 and I get 1.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.720
And here, I plug in
0 and I get - 1.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.110
So now I go and I look up at
that formula, which is way in

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.270
that upper corner there.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.420
And I see that the coefficient
on the constant is 0.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.260
The coefficient on x is 1.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.160
And then the other coefficient,
the very last

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.290
one, is - 1/2.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.010
So this is the - 1 here.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.720
And then in the formula,
there's a 2 in the

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.340
denominator.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.820
So it's half of whatever
I get for this second

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.590
derivative, at 0.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.870
So this is the approximation
formula, which is way up in

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.260
that corner there.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.590
Similarly, if I do it for
(1 x) ^ r, I have to

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:27.630
differentiate that I get r( 1
x) ^ r - 1, and then r ( r -

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.270
1( x 1) ^ r - 2.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.830
So here are the derivatives.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:41.110
And so if I evaluate them
at x = 0, I get 1.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.240
That's 1 ^ r = 1.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:49.580
And here I get r.
(1 ^ r - 1)r.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:59.790
And here, I plug in x = 0
and I get r ( r - 1).

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.880
So again, the pattern is
right above it here.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.300
The 1 is there, the
r is there.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.920
And then instead of r ( r
- 1), I have half that.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:21.480
For the coefficient.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.660
So these are just examples.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.975
Obviously if we had a more
complicated functional, we

00:29:24.975 --> 00:29:26.050
might carry this out.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.810
But as a practical matter, we
try to stick with the ones in

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:42.460
the pink box and just use
algebra to get other formulas.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.430
So I want to shift gears now and
treat the subject that was

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.910
supposed to be this lecture.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:53.080
And we're not quite caught up,
but we will try to do our best

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.890
to do as much as we can today.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:59.880
So the next topic is
curve sketching.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:18.120
And so let's get started
with that.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.630
So now, happily in this subject,
there are more

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.880
pictures and it's a little
bit more geometric.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.420
And there's relatively
little computation.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.600
So let's hope we can do this.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.890
So I want to, so here
we go, we'll

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:44.930
start with curve sketching.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.520
And the goal here

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:56.860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:56.910
PROF.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.880
JERISON: So that's like,
liner, the last time.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:09.600
That's kind of sketchy
spelling, isn't it?

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.800
Yeah, there are certain kinds of
things which I can't spell.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.640
But, alright.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.970
Sketching.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:19.240
Alright.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.350
So here's our goal.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:38.280
Our goal is to draw the graph
of f, using f' and f''.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:47.190
Whether they're positive
or negative.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.440
So that's it.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.400
This is the goal here.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.120
However, there is a
big warning that I

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.020
want to give you.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:06.170
And this is one that
unfortunately I now have to

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.040
make you unlearn, especially
those that you that have

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.910
actually had a little bit of
calculus before, I want to

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.720
make you unlearn some of your
instincts that you developed.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.670
So this will be harder for those
of you who have actually

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.840
done this before.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.650
But for the rest of you, it
will be relatively easy.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:35.490
Which is, don't abandon your
precalculus skills.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:42.380
And common sense.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.760
So there's a great deal of
common sense in this.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.555
And it actually trumps
some of the calculus.

00:32:50.555 --> 00:32:53.850
The calculus just fills
in what you

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.190
didn't quite know yet.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.660
So I will try to illustrate
this.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.690
And because we're running a bit
late, I won't get to the

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.970
some of the main punchlines
until next lecture.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.380
But I want you to do it.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.120
So for now, I'm just going to
tell you about the general

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:10.620
principles.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.100
And in the process I'm going to
introduce the terminology.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.470
Just, the words that we need
to use to describe what is

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.000
that we're doing.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.150
And there's also a certain
amount of carelessness with

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.070
that in many of the treatments
that you'll see.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.750
And a lot of hastiness.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:29.350
So just be a little patient
and we will do this.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.740
So, the first principle
is the following.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:40.670
If f' is positive, then
f is increasing.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:44.630
That's a straightforward idea,
and it's closely related to

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.330
this tangent line approximation
or the linear

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.220
approximation that I just did.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.230
You can just imagine.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.050
Here's the tangent line,
here's the function.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:56.310
And if the tangent line is
pointing up, then the function

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.490
is also going up, too.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.310
So that's all that's
going on here.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:10.370
Similarly, if f' is negative,
then f is decreasing.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.220
And that's the basic idea.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:17.170
Now, the second step is also
fairly straightforward.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:21.130
It's just a second order effect
of the same type.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:29.190
If you have f'' as positive,
then that means that f' is

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.150
increasing.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.740
That's the same principle
applied one step up.

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.320
Right?

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.470
Because if f'' is positive,
that means it's the

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:42.710
derivative of f'.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.970
So it's the same principle
just repeated.

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:49.710
And now I just want to draw
a picture of this.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.470
Here's a picture
of it, I claim.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.790
And it looks like something's
going down.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.430
And I did that on purpose.

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.650
But there is something that's
increasing here.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.470
Which is, the slope is very
steep negative here.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.330
And it's less steep negative
over here.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.940
So we have the slope which
is some negative

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.135
number, say, - 4.

00:35:10.135 --> 00:35:13.500
And here it's - 3.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.800
So it's increasing.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.250
It's getting less negative,
and maybe eventually it'll

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.680
curve up the other way.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.180
And this is a picture of what
I'm talking about here.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.630
That's what it means to say
that f' is increasing.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.020
The slope is getting larger.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.610
And the way to describe a curve
like this is that it's

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:41.620
concave. So f is concave up.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:48.520
And similarly, f'' negative is
going to be the same thing as

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:59.770
f concave, or implies
f concave down.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:04.850
So those are the ways in which
derivatives will help us

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.270
qualitatively to draw graphs.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.950
But as I said before, we still
have to use a little bit of

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.360
common sense when we
draw the graphs.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.800
These are just the additional
bits of help that

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.850
we have from calculus.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:25.410
In drawing pictures.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:34.260
So I'm going to go through
one example to

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.190
introduce all the notations.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:40.970
And then eventually, so probably
at the beginning of

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.510
next time, I'll give you a
systematic strategy that's

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.890
going to work when what I'm
describing now goes wrong, or

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.360
a little bit wrong.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:58.730
So let's begin with a
straightforward example.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.360
So, the first example that I'll
give you is the function

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.690
f (x) = 3x - x^3.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.130
Just, as I said, to be able to
introduce all the notations.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:17.640
Now, if you differentiate
it, you get 3 - 3x^2.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.970
And I can factor that.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:26.440
This is 3 ( 1 - x)( 1 x).

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.750
OK?

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:33.140
And so, I can decide whether
the derivative

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.390
is positive or negative.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.830
Easily enough.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:49.520
Namely, just staring at this,
I can see that when -1 &lt; x &lt;

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.150
1, in that range there, both
these numbers, both these

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.360
factors, are positive.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.290
1 - x is a positive number and
1 x is a positive number.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:04.710
So, in this range, f'
( x ) is positive.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:09.700
So this thing is, so
f is increasing.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.540
And similarly, in the other
ranges, if x is very, very

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.290
large, this becomes, if it
crosses 1, in fact, this

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.570
becomes, this factor becomes
negative and

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.310
this one stays positive.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:29.680
So when x &gt; 1, we have that
f ' (x) is negative.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:35.510
And so f is decreasing.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:39.540
And the same thing goes
for the other side.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.500
When it's less than - 1, that
also works this way.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.950
Because when it's less
than - 1, this

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.420
number factors positive.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.300
But the other one is negative.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:56.290
So in both of these cases, we
get that it's decreasing.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:07.300
So now, here's the schematic
picture of this function.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.950
So here's - 1, here's 1.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:19.840
It's going to go
down, up, down.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.590
That's what it's doing.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:23.710
Maybe I'll just leave
it alone like this.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:28.120
That's what it looks like.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.050
So, this is the kind of
information we can get right

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.980
off the bat.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:38.415
And you notice immediately that
it's very important, from

00:39:38.415 --> 00:39:40.560
the features of the function,
the sort of key features of

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.690
the function that we see here,
are these two places.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:49.270
Maybe I'll even mark them
in a, like this.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:59.090
And these things are
turning points.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.430
So what are they?

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:03.990
Well, they're just the
points where the

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.800
derivative changes sign.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.105
Where it's negative here and
it's positive there, so there

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.850
it must be 0.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.830
So we have a definition, and
this is the most important

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:21.110
definition in this subject,
which is that is if f' (x0) =

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:33.370
0, we call x0 a critical
point.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.360
The word 'turning point' is
not used just because, in

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.880
fact, it doesn't have to turn
around at those points.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.710
But certainly, if it turns
around then this will happen.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.160
And we also have another
notation, which is the number

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:59.100
y0 which is f ( x0 ) is called
a critical value.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.680
So these are the key numbers
that we're going to have to

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.010
work out in order to understand
what the function

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:18.750
looks like.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:27.990
So what I'm going to do
is just plot them.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:29.220
We're going to plot
the critical

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.440
points and the values.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.650
Well, we found the critical
points relatively easily.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.240
I didn't write it down here
but it's pretty obvious.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:45.230
If you set f(x) = 0, that
implies that (1 - x)( 1 x) =

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:50.570
0, which implies that
x is or - 1.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.710
So those are known as
the critical points.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.720
And now, in order to get the
critical values here, I have

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.280
to plug in f (1), for instance,
the function is 3x -

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.480
x^2, so there's this 3 *
1 - 1^3, which is 2.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:17.180
And f ( - 1), which is 3 ( -
1) - (- 1)^3, which is - 2.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.780
And so I can plot the
function here.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:26.160
So here's the point - 1 and
here's, up here, is 2.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.620
So this is - whoops,
which one is it?

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.160
Yeah.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.560
This is - 1, so it's
down here.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.160
So it's (- 1, - 2).

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:41.570
And then over here, I have
the point (1, 2).

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:47.320
Alright, now, what information
do I get from - so I've now

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.630
plotted two, I claim, very
interesting points.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:55.000
What information do
I get from this?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.680
The answer is, I know something
very nearby.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.630
Because I've already checked
that the thing is coming down

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.770
from the left, and
coming back up.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:07.370
And so it must be shaped
like this.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.330
Over here.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:11.620
The tangent line is 0, it's
going to be level there.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.490
And similarly over here,
it's going to do that.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.280
So this is what we know
so far, based

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.250
on what we've computed.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.710
Question.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:37.230
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.416
PROF.

00:43:37.416 --> 00:43:38.240
JERISON: The question
is, what happens if

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:38.600
there's a sharp corner.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:45.050
The answer is, calculus, it's
not called a critical point.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.090
It's a something else.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.440
And it's a very important
point, too.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.570
And we will be discussing
those kinds of points.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:54.540
There are much more dramatic
instances of that.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.640
That's part of what we're
going to say.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.670
But I just want to save
that, alright.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:02.490
We will be discussing.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.010
Yeah.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:03.540
Question.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:08.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:08.516
PROF.

00:44:08.516 --> 00:44:11.330
JERISON: The question that was
asked was, how did I know at

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.960
the critical point that it's
concave down over here and

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.190
concave up over here.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:22.860
The answer is that I actually
did not use the second

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.300
derivative yet.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.510
What I used is another
piece of information.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.760
I used the information that
I derived over here.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.500
That f' is positive, where
f' is positive

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.670
and where it's negative.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.220
So what I know is that the graph
is going down to the

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.470
left of - 1.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.530
It's going up to the
right, here.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.920
It's going up here and it's
going down there.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.060
I did not use the second
derivative.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.960
I used the first derivative.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.410
OK, but I didn't just use the
fact that there was a turning

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.040
point here.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.360
So, actually, I was using
the fact that it

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.210
was a turning point.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.200
I wasn't using the fact
that it had the

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.730
second derivative, though.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.980
OK.

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.120
For now.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:09.500
You can also see it by the
second derivative as well.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.220
So now, the next thing that
I'd like to do, I need to

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.170
finish off this graph.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.950
And I just want to do it a
little bit carefully here.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.710
In the order that
is reasonable.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:27.310
Now, you might happen to notice,
and there's nothing

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:35.120
wrong with this, so let's
even fill in a guess.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.190
In order to fill in a guess,
though, and have it be even

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.080
vaguely right, I do have to
notice that this thing

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.800
crosses, this function
crosses the origin.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:48.660
The function f(x) = 3x - x^3
happens also have the property

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.780
that f ( 0 ) = 0.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.560
Again, common sense.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.590
You're allowed to use
your common sense.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.250
You're allowed to notice
a value of the

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.320
function and put it in.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.270
So there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:03.960
If you happen to have
such a value.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.060
So, now we can guess what
our function is

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:06.650
going to look like.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:10.010
It's going to maybe come
down like this.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.670
Come up like this.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.130
And come down like this.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.230
That could be what
it looks like.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.390
But, you know, another
possibility is it sort of

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.820
comes along here and
goes out that way.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.260
Comes along here and goes
out that way, who knows?

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.280
It happens, by the way, that
it's an odd function.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:25.570
Right?

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:26.640
Those are all odd powers.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.710
So, actually, it's symmetric
on the right half

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.860
and the left half.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.610
And crosses at 0.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:33.310
So everything that we do on the
right is going to be the

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.530
same as what happens
on the left.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.620
That's another piece
of common sense.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.000
You want to make use of that as
much as possible, whenever

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.060
you're drawing anything.

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.340
Don't want to throw
out information.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.540
So this function happens
to be odd.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.700
Odd, and f ( 0 ) = 0.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.520
I'm considering those to be
kinds of precalculus skills

00:46:52.520 --> 00:47:00.610
that I want you to use
as much as you can.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.990
So now, here's the first feature
which is unfortunately

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:08.880
ignored in most discussions
of functions.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.340
And it's strange, because
nowadays we

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.380
have graphing things.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:19.410
And it's really the only part
of the exercise that you

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:26.420
couldn't do, at least on this
relatively simpleminded level,

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.180
with a graphing calculator.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:33.790
And that is what I would call
the ends of the problem.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.000
So what happens off the screen,
is the question.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.600
And that basically is the
theoretical part of the

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.430
problem that you have
to address.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:42.920
You can program this.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.410
You can draw all the pictures
that you want.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.190
But what you won't see is
what's off the screen.

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:50.260
You need to know something
to figure out

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.780
what's off the screen.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.560
So, in this case, I'm talking
about what's off the screen

00:47:54.560 --> 00:48:01.930
going to the right, or
going to the left.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:06.100
So let's check the ends.

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.680
So here, let's just
take a look.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:12.280
We have the function f(x), which
is, sorry, 3x - x^3.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.620
Again this is a precalculus
sort of thing.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.650
And we're imagining now,
let's just do x

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.360
goes to plus infinity.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.670
So what happens here.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:25.460
When x is gigantic, this term
is completely negligible.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:29.410
And it just behaves like -
x^3, which goes to minus

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:32.600
infinity as x goes
to plus infinity.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:42.170
And similarly, f (x) goes to
plus infinity if x goes to

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:46.150
minus infinity.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.060
Now let me pull down this
picture again, and show you

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.140
what piece of the information
we've got.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.610
We now know that it is
heading up this way.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.560
It doesn't go like this,
it goes up like that.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.470
And I'm going to put an
arrow for it, And it's

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.580
going down like this.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.210
Heading down to minus infinity
as x goes out

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.310
farther to the right.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:15.120
And going out to plus infinity
as x goes farther to the left.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.270
So now there's hardly
anything left of

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.910
this function to describe.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:27.120
There's really nothing left
except maybe decoration.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.540
And we kind of like that
decoration, so we will pay

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.560
attention to it.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.580
And to do that, we'll have to
check the second derivative.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.200
So if we differentiate a
second time, the first

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.680
derivative was, remember,
3 - 3x^2.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:53.540
So the second derivative
is - 6x.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:50:02.470
So now we notice that f'' (x) is
negative if x is positive.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:08.310
And f'' ( x) is positive
if x is negative.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:13.170
And so in this part
it's concave down.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:18.990
And in this part it's
concave up.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:21.170
And now I'm going to switch
the boards so that

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:24.860
you'll, and draw it.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:30.630
And you see that it was begging
to be this way.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:32.960
So we'll fill in the
rest of it here.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.560
Maybe in a nice color here.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.100
So this is the whole graph and
this is the correct graph.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:41.450
It comes down in one swoop down
here, and comes up here.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:46.620
And then it changes to concave
down right at the origin.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.670
So this point is of interest,
not only because it's the

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:52.630
place where it crosses the axis,
but it's also what's

00:50:52.630 --> 00:51:00.690
called an inflection point.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:04.170
Inflection point, that's a point
where because f'' at

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:07.620
that place is equal to 0.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.970
So it's a place where the
second derivative is 0.

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:15.160
We also consider those to
be interesting points.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:21.010
Now, so let me just making
one closing remark here.

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:26.590
Which is that all of this
information fits together.

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:29.610
And we're going to have much,
much harder examples of this

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.570
where you'll actually have to
think about what's going on.

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.190
But there's a lot of stuff
protecting you.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:39.990
And functions will behave
themselves and turn around

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.920
appropriately.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.570
Anyway, we'll talk about
it next time.
