AND THIS BRINGS IN A NEW BREED
OF SURFER FROM AUSTRALIA.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.843
THEY WIN A BUNCH
OF COMPETITIONS.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.312
THEN THEY [bleep] GET
IN THE PRESS

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.848
AND THEY INSULT
HAWAIIAN CULTURE,

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.150 line:0%
 
SAYING, HAWAIIAN WAY
OF SURFING IS OLD.

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.119 line:0%
 
IT'S OUT OF DATE.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.287 line:0%
 
WE'RE THE FUTURE.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.357
WE'RE THE FUTURE OF SURFING.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.325
I DATED AN AUSTRALIAN
FOR TWO YEARS.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.327
CAN'T DO AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.730
I THANK GOD,
BECAUSE I'D DO IT ALL THE TIME.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.932
THE HAWAIIANS
ARE REASONABLE PEOPLE,

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.934
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN
PUSHED TO THE POINT.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.236
SO THE AUSTRALIANS
GET BEAT UP A FEW TIMES.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.405
PROBABLY MADE THEM
BETTER PEOPLE.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.074
AT A CERTAIN POINT,
THEY'VE GOTTEN BEAT UP SO MUCH

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:43.844
THAT THEY'RE, LIKE, HOLED UP
IN THEIR ROOM.

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:44.912
THERE'S A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:46.513
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.148
AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE,
OH, NO.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.684
SO THEY GRAB A BUNCH
OF TENNIS RACKETS.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.786
RABBIT GRABS THE DOORKNOB

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.655
AND HE TURNS IT LIKE,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.924
HE OPENS IT UP,
AND IT'S EDDIE.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.759
AND HE'S LIKE, HEY.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.127
I DON'T HAVE A TENNIS RACKET.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.428
PLEASE PUT THOSE AWAY.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.263
ALSO, WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY?

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.265
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:09.069
EDDIE WALKS THEM TO A HOTEL
WITH A CONFERENCE ROOM.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.405
AND EDDIE'S LIKE,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:16.276
HAS BEEN HAPPENING
ON THESE ISLANDS FOR SO LONG,

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.744
WHERE WHITE PEOPLE
ARE JUST SAYING, LIKE,

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.546
HAWAIIANS,
YOUR CULTURE'S NOT REAL.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:20.614
IT'S ALL BULL[bleep].

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.649
WE RECOGNIZE YOU SURF WELL,

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.118
BUT YOU'RE BEING
A [bleep] DICK.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.688
ALL OF YOU ARE A GROUP
OF PENISES SITTING HERE.

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.224
AFTER A WHILE,
THE AUSTRALIANS ARE LIKE,

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:31.625
WE DON'T WANT TO BE DICKS.

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.294
WE WANT TO BE COOL
SURFER DUDES.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.730
WE'RE SO SORRY.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.300
DO YOU KNOW THEY SAY
"WIDE ON" FOR A FEMALE BONER?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.203
THAT'S AN AUSTRALIAN TERM.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.873
AS OPPOSED TO A HARD ON,
IT'S A WIDE ON.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:46.807
DON'T YOU MAKE ME
EXPLAIN THIS MORE.
