00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.340
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.740
I just want to welcome
you to today's Topics

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.040
in Preservation series.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.090
I'm the chief-- name
would be helpful.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.870
Fenella France, chief
of the Preservation,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.440
Research, and Testing Division.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.510
And we're delighted today-- have
today here, Dr. Andrew Davis,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.920
who is one of our chemists here
in the Preservation, Research,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.220
and Testing Division, talking
about Centuries of Cellulose:

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.840
Lessons Learned from the
Molecular Analysis of Cellulose

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.080
in Aged Paper Collections.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.860
And Andrew has become
a very critical part

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.520
of our preservation team,
and we're really delighted.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.340
So Andrew has a background, his
Ph.D. was in polymer science

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.890
and engineering from
the University

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310
of Massachusetts,
Amherst in 2014.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.140
From there, he worked at 3M
developing adhesive chemistry

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.390
and photographic processes and
came to the library in 2016.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.910
And without further ado, I
will pass over to Andrew.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:25.330
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.630
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Great.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.930
Thanks, Fenella.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.910
So I will be talking today
a little bit about cellulose

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.400
and paper materials as they age.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.790
And so what I mean by aging--
I'll jump right into it--

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.310
is, as far as we're
concerned here,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.090
that means paper durability
and paper permanence.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.100
How does paper behave
and stay preserved

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.210
over a long period of time?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.100
And when we're looking
at it as preservationists

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.430
and conservators, a lot of times
we can judge it based on what I

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.990
like to call the "eyeball test."

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.220
Most of the time, you can look
at an object, you can look

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.140
at some paper, and say
what is bad, what is good.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.440
Is this in bad shape?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.310
Do we need to do something with
this object, with this material?

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.050
But that doesn't
always pass muster.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.620
Sometimes you need
quantitative measurements.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.110
And there are a number
of ways over the years

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.040
that people have taken
quantitative assessments

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.780
of paper-based materials.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.440
These range from chemical
assessments, like pH

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.070
or inductively coupled plasma,
or XRF, which are familiar

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.390
to various folks in this room

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.850
for analyzing elemental
compositions

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.240
or metallic components that
are in paper materials.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.710
There's spot testing.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.440
Again, identifying
specific elemental

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.710
or chemical components in paper.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.980
When the eyeball
test doesn't work

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.410
or you need something
a little more specific,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.710
you can do optical testing

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.700
and then you can also
do physical testing,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.970
things like fold or
tensile measurements

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.140
that give you a quantitative
assessment of material.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.940
But what none of these
techniques address is the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.270
underlying fundamental
building block

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.440
of paper itself, and
that's cellulose.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.230
And if anyone in here remembers
and really fantastic "Powers

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.210
of Ten" video where
it zooms in and out

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.510
of different length
scale scales.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.170
You can see what
materials or at what scales.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.030
Cellulose really is the
fundamental building block,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.410
about as small as you
can get, when you start

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.690
from the raw materials,
starting from it trees

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.790
or wood-based materials
or rag-based materials,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.220
all the way down past
the cellular structure,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.520
past cell walls, past fibrils,
past fibers, down to cellulose.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.630
And what cellulose
looks like is a string

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.040
of sugar molecules
linked together--

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.640
that's what this N represents--

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.670
over and over and
over and over again,

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.330
to make a very long
chain polymer.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.750
And there's actually even more
complicated structure there,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.240
where you have hydrogen
bonding, interacting both

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.580
within a cellulose chain and
between cellulose chains.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.850
But it really is the fundamental
building material building block

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.480
that makes up paper.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.080
And when we talk about
cellulose degradation,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.380
mostly what we're talking

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.330
about is cellulose
significant scission

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.430
or breakage of cellulose chains.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.620
And the two main mechanisms
that this can happen by--

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.800
and if you hold with
me for just this slide,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.990
this is about as deep into the
organic chemistry as I get.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.450
[laughter] You've got acid
hydrolysis where you can break,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.730
usually that oxygen
linkage there,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.410
and you'll take one long
polymer chain of cellulose

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.690
and you'll split that up
into two smaller ones.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.330
You can also have oxidation,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.430
where the rings often
will open up.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.300
And then these will expose some
functional groups that can go

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.490
on to perform additional
chemistry often

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.160
in a degradative nature,
either color changes or again,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.640
chain scissions, and start
breaking down the chains.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.610
And so when you talk
about quantifying this,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.750
how do you quantify
what's happening

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.190
to the cellulose molecules
that make up paper?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.870
There's a method that's very
popular in polymer science,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.500
and that's called size
exclusion chromatography.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.810
And like any chromatography,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.580
it separates chemical components
based on some criteria.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.290
And in this case, it
separates polymeric molecules,

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.620
large scale molecules,
based on their size.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.510
And it does this by taking
some samples with both large

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.570
and small chain cellulose, flows
them through a porous media

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.970
that physically separates
them by size,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.130
and so the larger molecules will
come out at a different time

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.430
than the smaller molecules.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.160
You can detect them
and then come

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.380
up with a quantitative
measurement

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.180
of how much small chain
cellulose there is relative

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.120
to large chain cellulose that
you started with in your sample.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.080
And we refer to this entire
series as the distribution.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.880
What's the distribution of
cellulose sizes in your sample?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.320
And so I'll refer to
this as the distribution.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.540
And that distribution
can be captured

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.710
by a single quantitative
simplification called the

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.010
molecular weight.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.760
And I can spend an
entire day talking

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.030
about how you make that's
simplistic quantification.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.440
There are different measurements

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.850
and points along this
distribution you can use.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.600
But the idea is it's
one simple identifier

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.650
for what this distribution
looks like.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.770
You may be more familiar
with that-- whoops--

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.960
in terms of the degree
of polymerization.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.980
And that's just another
way of referring

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.280
to the molecular weight.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.640
And so if I say "molecular
weight," or if I say "degree

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.260
of polymerization," degree of
polymerization just adjusts

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.540
for the size of those
sugar repeat units.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.610
But know that I mean
the same thing.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.230
And so if you're more
comfortable thinking about one

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.850
or the other, you can
swap those in your mind.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.300
They are both a simplification

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.260
of that more complicated
distribution.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.650
And I'll be showing
you examples of both.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.730
I'm not going to get too
deep into preparing samples

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.480
for size exclusion
chromatography.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.970
I will say that we are using
a direct dissolution method.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.370
We're taking the cellulose,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.600
we're not doing any
chemical modifications

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.900
to it from the paper.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.260
We are directly dissolving
it in a solvent system.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.600
And so for using solvents in
size exclusion chromatography,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.460
that's been used for
decades in polymer science

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.300
with synthetic polymers and
plastics, like styrene or PET.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.280
But for cellulose, it's
really just been pinned

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.890
down in the last decade
or so how to do this

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.500
through a direct
dissolution method.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.450
And that's because it's a
tremendously complicated solvent

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.190
and solute system.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.180
Ann Chapatist [phonetic
spelling] has done some

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.390
excellent work reviewing
what goes

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.600
into these different
systems that you can use

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.900
to dissolve cellulose.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.200
And so if you want to know more,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.020
I highly recommend
looking up her work.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.190
But it does take a long time and
it's fraught with complications.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.130
But it can be done, and the
method we're using is one

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.200
of the benchmark methods that is
used with cellulose scientists.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.030
It's something we use just
because it's comparative

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.280
to other cellulose
researchers in the field.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.500
And so why size exclusion
chromatography?

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.210
Like I said, it's a
direct measurement

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.840
of the fundamental building
block in your paper materials.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.840
And it's a cornerstone of
polymer science that the size

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.010
of a polymer is directly
related to material degradation.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.460
As the material degrades,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.180
the polymer chains
will start breaking.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.510
You can measure that.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.730
As the chains start breaking,
that's intimately related

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.570
to material properties; how
strong it is, how durable it is.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.370
It also reveals minor changes
that are perhaps undetectable

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.970
or only very subtly detectable
by physical measurements.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.100
And to give you an example
of that, I'll use something

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.830
that we use in the lab--

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.620
that we've used size exclusion
chromatography in the lab for,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.390
a pretty big team effort that's
been ongoing for a number

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.320
of years before I
came here even,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.810
on iron gall ink
treatments, and this is both

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.300
in preservation research
and with conservation.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.820
A number of folks I can see

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.610
in the room who've been
working on this project.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:12.790
An iron gall ink is a corrosive,
but historically important ink.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.270
And you can see iron gall ink
induced degradation on objects

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.970
from the library collection, as
well as on lab prepared samples

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.370
from lab prepared iron gall ink.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.760
And you can see how
corrosive it is.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.730
This is an aged paper
on the right there.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.160
And you can see that
the paper tends to break

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.920
and fracture right
along ink lines.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.220
We know this.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.520
We know this is a problem.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.150
But to me, it seemed like size
exclusion chromatography would

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.290
be interesting to see
what has happening

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.200
to the cellulose molecules in
the area that has been inked.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.260
That's just a little
bit of the chemistry

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.620
of how iron undergoes
Fenton reactions.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.210
Both of the bad actors
I talked about before,

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.140
acid and oxidative
species, are involved

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.560
with a redox reaction of iron.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.540
So really there's a perfect
storm in iron gall ink

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.800
for cellulose degradation.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.080
And what I want to see is
whether we can track any changes

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.650
of treatments that this team
has been working on developing

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.780
to see what's going on at the
molecular level of cellulose.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.190
And so this is that
lab prepared sample

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.910
with lab prepared iron gall ink,

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.080
and these are two control
samples, starting with unaged,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.250
so just right after inking.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.240
And you can see this is the
molecular weight distribution

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.420
from size exclusion
chromatography.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.910
And you can see that there's
high molecular weight species,

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.510
up to about a million
grams per mol,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.310
is the predominant size
of cellulose there.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.250
And you have some smaller
components, as well.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.140
And you have some smaller
components, as well.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.560
And this is just in that
heavily inked region,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.860
the underlying paper.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.160
And it gives you a
degree of polymerization

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.050
of about 2800 of the cellulose.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.530
After artificial aging, so this
is high heat, high humidity,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.400
in an oven for 28 days,
you can see that all

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.330
of those high molecular
weight cellulose molecules are

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.630
almost gone.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.150
There's very little left.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.520
They've all broken down into
much smaller cellulose chains,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.810
about 10,000 molecular weight.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:12.150
Degree of polymerization reduced
about ten-fold, about 150.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.890
And so these are papers
without any treatment on them.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.620
And the question
is, what are some

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.030
of the conservation
treatments we could apply?

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.330
What do they do over time?

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.230
How do they help preserve,
if they help preserve,

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.370
the cellulose and
molecular structure.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.830
And so I'm not going to get
too deep into the details here.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.670
This is something we're hoping
to publish and get out there,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.000
and I don't want to give away
the punchline to any of this.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.670
So I'll talk just very broadly
about different treatments.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.150
And so, for example, all
the treatments I'll show are

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.710
after aging.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.690
And I'm going to compare
them to these two controls.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.490
So all of these have
been aged in an oven

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.250
after the treatments
have been applied.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.670
And you can see this
first treatment

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.920
in red really doesn't seem
to do much of anything.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.690
And size exclusion
chromatography can tell

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.990
you that.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.070
You can see both the degree of
polymerization is about the same

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.650
and the distribution
shape itself,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.160
the size of all the molecules in
that sample, are about the same.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.810
They look almost
identical to that condition

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.880
without any treatment at all.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.620
And if you look at two
additional treatments, again,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.800
both after aging, but these
start to look much more

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.700
like pristine samples.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.860
And so by eye, it might be
hard to distinguish these two.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.740
They both look about the same
in the paper material itself

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.610
after aging, but these
distributions and this degree

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.010
of polymerization
measurement shows you that one

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.930
of them is actually slightly

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.580
and subtly better
than the other one.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.040
It helps preserve these high
molecular weight components

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.340
in the cellulose.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.770
You still have these million
molecular weight species

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.920
that match up to
if you had unaged.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.650
So we can stick it in an
oven, apply heat and humidity,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.660
and we know that this treatment
is perhaps better than this one.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.090
And we're trying to dig a little
bit into why that might be.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.690
But that's just an example to
start getting you thinking,

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.110
maybe perhaps get
used to looking

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.040
at what this data
might look like.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.300
And if you noticed on that Y
size exclusion chromatography

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.970
slide I showed, I talked
about micro-sampling.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.940
And a couple of the popular
methods that I talked

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.590
about for quantifying
paper condition take

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.430
up a lot of paper.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.800
And so that's a scale
schematic representation

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.040
of an 8 1/2 by 11
piece of paper.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.560
And to do a physical condition
test, a fold endurance test,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.600
example, needs about
half of an 8 1/2 by 11.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.390
Similarly, a pH extraction needs

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.770
about the same amount
of material.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.910
And so it's fine on
lab scale papers,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.210
but if this is something
you want to do

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.440
to a collections object,
that's just not acceptable.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.290
Size exclusion chromatography
can use dozens

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.210
of micrograms of
material, right?

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.810
So this is a cute little
paper biopsy machine.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.240
It's just a kind of tiny hole
punch that punches out samples

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.800
that are about one
millimeter in diameter.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.790
And those can perhaps be taken
from collections objects,

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.020
from blank pages in a back
of a book, from detritus

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.350
that has been shorn off of
a very fragile material,

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.950
and that's perhaps a
little more acceptable.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.710
And so the question is,
how can we apply this

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:09.060
to actual collections
items or perhaps books?

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.370
And so I wanted to start using
this on a collection of books,

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.110
and the books that
immediately came

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.950
to mind were the
Barrow Collection.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.060
And William Barrow may be
a familiar name to some

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.360
of the folks in this room.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.130
He was a paper chemist, did a
lot of work in the 50s and 60s

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.790
on naturally aged paper
chemistry and what's going on.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.270
And here, William Barrow is
working on a fold tester.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.500
There's Cindy Ryan from our
research group doing her best

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.050
William Barrow impression.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.950
And if you haven't seen a fold
tester, I'm a big fan of them.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.670
They're very visceral machines.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.500
You get a real sense
of what's going

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.710
on what a fold tester
is operating.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.730
And what William Barrow was
trying to do was he was trying

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.900
to connect physical properties
to chemical properties

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.750
in naturally aged books.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.450
So taking a naturally
aged collection

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.980
and seeing how you can connect
the chemical components in paper

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.830
to the physical condition
of the durability

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.130
and brittleness of that paper.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.100
So I'm going to take a bit of
a detour now, and I'm going

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.820
to step away from all of
the technical science stuff

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.850
and give you a little
bit of history

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.840
about William Barrow
and the Barrow Labs.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.820
Like I said, some
folks may be familiar

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.120
with him, some folks may not.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.260
And it's kind of an
interesting story.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.770
And so Barrow often times
gets a lot of credit

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.980
for being the originator
of research on pH

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.950
and alum-rosin sizing
and its effect

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.250
on naturally aged materials.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.310
But it built on a lot of work

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.480
that had already been
going on in the field.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.850
Kohler and Hall in Sweden

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:46.210
in the 20s had done perhaps
the first definitive connection

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.000
between acidity and
paper deterioration.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.910
There was then a lot
of work done in the 30s

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.420
at the National Bureau
of Standards,

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.720
at the Government
Printing Office,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.780
in the National Archives,

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.670
looking into the fundamental
science of paper degradation,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.730
looking at whether fiber
processing is more influential

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.620
than the fiber source, whether
ground wood papers have a

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.480
different effect on paper
longevity than rag papers,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.160
on whether sizing and the
acidity that's inherent

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.890
in sizing effects
paper degradation.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:24.340
William Barrow was a book binder

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.680
and a craftsman before
he started looking

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.590
into the chemistry of materials.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.320
And he started looking into
the chemistry of materials

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.780
and he started working
with these researchers

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.770
in the National Bureau
of Standards

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.460
in the National Archives,
learning chemistry

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.900
from them at that time.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.940
And that kind of sparked his
interests from just book binding

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.230
to the more fundamental
chemistry of paper conservation.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:53.220
And it led to his interests
spanning that type of chemistry,

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.110
ranging from cellulose acetate
lamination, to deacidification,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.040
to aging of book papers,
both artificial and natural,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.150
to the manufacturing
of durable papers.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.700
And I'm not going to
talk too much about it,

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.880
but it's impossible to
talk about William Barrow

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.150
without talking about
cellulose acetate lamination.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:16.450
And so he spent a lot of
time developing, refining,

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.080
and pitching the idea of
cellulose acetate lamination

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.700
as he learned alongside
these researchers at NBS

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.960
and the National Archives.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.140
And this was during the
1930s, took a lot of input

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.110
from Bourden Scribner, who was
the chief of the paper section

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.860
at the National Bureau
of Standards,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.640
worked with Arthur Kimberly,
chief of the Division of Repair

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.330
and Preservation at the
National Archives at the time.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.940
It involved development of
visits to the National Archives,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.590
prototyping with the Mariners'
Museum in Portsmouth, Virginia.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.020
And he came up with this method

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.250
for cellulose acetate
lamination, patented,

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.580
oddly enough, with all of that
collaboration with just his name

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.590
on the patent in 1941.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.850
And that's really where
Barrow got his claim to fame.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:04.250
And after that, he received
a grant from the Council

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.740
on Library Resources to do
studies on paper and book aging

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.580
in Richmond, Virginia
at his labs,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.690
and this was in the
1950s and 60s.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.950
And William Barrow
said about this,

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.350
perhaps in a quote illustrative

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.500
of the work he was undertaking
there, "The task of the ester is

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.890
to find, among the
hundreds of possible tests

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.850
of the characteristics
of a material,

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.410
those which are really
meaningful, i.e.,

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.570
those which can be
shown to correlate

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.100
with actual experience in use."

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.190
And so to undertake
this research,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.820
he collected a thousand books.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.860
These were a thousand
actual books spanning

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.350
about 400 years of print dates.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.380
So about 400 years of natural
aging in this book collection.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.920
All sorts of different
compositions, whether they came

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.180
from wood pulps, whether
they came from rag fibers,

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.490
different geographies,
mostly from western Europe,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.060
a lot from the United
States, but obviously

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.240
that included different
climates, as well.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.490
And his goal was to start
doing tests on these books

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.050
and to correlate, like I
said, physical properties

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.470
with chemical properties.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.770
And the initial tests were

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:14.630
on about 500 books spanning
the range from 1800 to 1900.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.890
Those eventually ballooned
out by another 500 books,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.340
going all the way back to 1500.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.420
And those included physical
tests of, you know, strength

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.370
and durability, by fold
testing, like I showed you,

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.300
and tear testing, which is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.250
Chemical tests started
off with acidity

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.690
and rosin testing expanded
out to looking at alum content

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.000
and metal carbonate content
and fiber analysis, as well.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.680
What type of fibers
were in there?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.880
How large the fiber size was.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.830
And these are pictures,
not quite as fun

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.130
as the animated pictures.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.350
But from the written reports
from William Barrow, 1950s,

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.500
showing the equipment
he was using.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.770
And if you look through these
reports from the 1950s and 60s,

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.960
actually what I find a little
bit more fun is they are very

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.240
1950s in their presentation.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.140
He is showing some of the
researchers from the lab here.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.110
It wasn't just William
Barrow, for example.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:15.650
Here is Mrs. Virginia Roberson,
both technician and secretary,

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.800
putting samples in
an aging oven.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.050
Mrs. Patricia Turner
working on the fold tester.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.600
Mrs. Emily Parr taking
pH measurements.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.410
So these are very much of the
time, but kind of fun pictures

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.720
that are shown in
the Barrow reports.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.140
Shows you how many people
are working in the lab here.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.290
And the lab from William Barrow
produced pages and pages of data

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.690
about pages and pages of books.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.430
And after he collected
all these data,

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.960
he started making correlations.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.780
So for example, year
of manufacture,

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.360
checking the tear strength.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.800
How does tear strength in
naturally aged books change

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.930
over time with printing?

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.980
How does pH and acidity
and chemical content change

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.490
over time with printing?

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.460
And then how do you
correlate those?

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.760
That's down at the bottom there.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.570
Some of the correlations between
alum content and acidity and how

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:15.220
that interfaces with age
of production of the books.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.790
And so the conclusions of
the Barrow Lab came out

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.500
and they were summarized.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.630
You know, the effects of
acidity, the effects of alum,

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.270
the effects of fiber type.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.120
High acidity, low
pH tends to lead

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.850
to poor physical conditions.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.370
The presence of alum is
usually a bad indicator,

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.280
unless it's present
alongside calcium carbonate.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.090
Fiber type, wood pulp
type papers tend to be

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:42.050
in worse conditions
than rag type papers.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.610
The mid-1800s onwards showed
to be particularly problematic.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.520
It was, again, the
perfect storm of all

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.980
of these components
coming together.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:57.040
And those ended up being in--

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.620
interpreted by Barrow's
suggestions

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.850
on paper manufacture, what can
be done to make more durable,

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.730
more permanent papers,
as well as work

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.360
on comparing artificial aging

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.100
and rigorously controlled
natural aging studies.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.540
And really, it was never
explicitly concluded by Barrow,

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.690
but the conclusion here is
those results really, right,

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.560
are not new conclusions.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.210
The work that was done by the
National Bureau of Standards,

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.550
by the National Archives
in the 20s and 30s new

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.620
that acidity was bad, knew
that alum-rosin sizing was bad.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:34.040
But what this proved was
that those results held

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.480
in actual naturally
aged book collections.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.420
Not just any naturally
aged book collection,

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.570
a really ambitious naturally
aged book collection,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.830
a rather ungainly naturally
aged book collection.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.940
So the fact that you could
take those conclusions

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.720
from test papers at NBS or
government printing office

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.900
and say, we collected a
thousand books from all over,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.180
all sorts of ages, all
sorts of compositions,

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.830
and these results hold,
is rather impressive.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.660
There were lots of
conclusions about Barrow's work.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:07.420
He is often interpreted as the
originator of results on pH

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.490
and alum-rosin and wood content.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.450
For example, Rutherford Rogers,
who was the University librarian

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.510
at Yale, 1985, was talking
about Barrow and said,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.040
"Barrow startled the library
world with his results."

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.600
Right? So it's not--
it's not uncommon

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.390
to see Barrow interpreted as
the originator of these results,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.690
even those some results
came before him.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:36.970
And his lab is not entirely
innocent in this perception.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.180
If you look at the citation
records in these reports,

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.000
starting with the very first
one in 1959, about a third

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.220
of them had in their
technical citations,

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.780
work from the National
Bureau of Standards,

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.700
work from the National Archives.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.430
By the last report in 1967,
most of them had disappeared,

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.960
less than 1 in 20 were
from those sources.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.050
They were mostly self-citations
of the Barrow Lab.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.800
And so some other folks
have become critical

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.870
of that assessment.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.300
Nicholson Baker, who is
perhaps a little bit infamous

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.590
for his critique on library
sciences, the total extreme

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.270
of the criticism here,

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:20.230
really questioning why Barrow
did any invasive testing

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.530
to begin with.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.260
He said, "If Barrow
hadn't chosen to destroy

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.370
yet another page in order
to perform his parlor trick,

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.760
the recipe for chicken a la
Terrapin would very likely be

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.560
with us today."

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.050
[ Laughter ]

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.300
So you can find both assessments
in the scholarly literature

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.830
about William Barrow, that
he really had this large

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.590
influential role to
play in paper science,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.180
and that he was just
duplicating others' efforts.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.790
And so I would say that
my personal opinion

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.090
of William Barrow is a little
more sympathetic with that

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.040
of Barbara Higginbotham
and Sally Cruz Roggia.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.170
And a lot of this history
comes from Sally Cruz Roggia.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.470
She did some excellent work.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.090
I highly recommend
looking up her deep dive

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.940
into William Barrow's history.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:07.060
Saying that, at the time that
that original research was done

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.600
in the 20s and 30s, librarian--
conservation minded librarians

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.890
at the time were more
interested in durability

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.200
and in-use durability,
in taking a page

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.090
and making sure it's not
breaking while users are

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.930
interacting with the books.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.820
And so the reports from the
National Bureau of Standards,

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.170
from the Government Printing
Office, were highly technical,

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.050
highly constrained
to the government.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.460
Didn't make their way
much to librarians

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.760
that did a lot of work.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.720
For example, here's at the
Enoch Pratt Free Library,

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.200
just doing mending and
working to make sure

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.490
that the books could be used and
were in good condition for use.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.650
And Barbara Higginbotham

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.070
and both Sally Cruz
Roggia make the argument

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.860
that Barrow is the
great promoter here.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.650
He's the one that takes
these results and perhaps

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.170
by using a collection of a
thousand actual books from all

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.050
over the place, a little
more representative

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.560
of what is actually
in libraries.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.590
It's something that
can be, you know,

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.530
connected with on
a visceral level.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.860
And so while he may not have
done exactly the original

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.150
research, his results
were widely influential

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.750
for a good number of reasons.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:21.580
And so after William Barrow's
work, the books found their way

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.010
to the library here

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.840
in Preservation Research
and Testing.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.200
And the value of these
books now is entirely

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.720
in their scientific content.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.650
They have been destructively
tested.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.010
There are very few books,
going back to the 1500s,

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.850
that have had pages
ripped out of them

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.140
for tear testing
and fold testing.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.520
And the fact that we can still
do this adds tremendous value

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.820
to that collection.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.110
And so those were donated
to the library in the 1970s.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.280
They've since been rehoused,
sorted, and barcoded.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.530
Now they're in PRTD Center

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.800
for the Library Analytical
Scientific Samples.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.940
They serve as kind of a small
scale museum of book art.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.850
You can take them apart,
look at what's going

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.920
on with different books
over different times.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.870
But they do provide another
opportunity for research.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.480
There's been progress
in material science.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.090
There's been progress
in polymer science.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.410
Polymer science was
barely a field

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.390
when Barrow started his work.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.520
There's been improvement
in analytical

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.610
and instrumental
methods since the 1950s.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.650
For example, size
exclusion chromatography.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:27.800
And as a study of natural
aging, it's kind of interesting

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.750
that there's been
another 50 years of aging.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.400
And we'll go back to
Rutherford Rogers,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.750
that librarian from
Yale University.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.360
We'll finish out his quote that
I gave you a taste of before.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.410
"Barrow startled the library
world with his research results,

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.490
which suggested that only three
percent of the papers published

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:47.380
between 1900 and 1949
could be expected to last

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.620
for more than 50 years."

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.370
William Wilson at the
National Bureau of Standards,

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:57.430
around the year 2000, could
do the math, and said,

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.320
"It's almost the end of
the century and somehow,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.880
most of those books
haven't known

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.260
that they were supposed
to disappear."

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.560
[laughter] So some
of the conclusions

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.230
from that data obviously
need revisiting.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.990
And so one of the
tremendous efforts

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.920
that have been undertaken in
PRTD is digitizing those pages

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.170
and pages and pages of data.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.060
So there are a thousand books.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.700
There's about 16-ish
data points each.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.510
I say "-ish," some books are
missing a couple of data points.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.880
So that gives you
16,000 data points.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.760
And they fall in all
types of categories.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.860
There's time and
chronological data,

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.220
what year they were published.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.260
There's categorical data, what
cities they were published in.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.890
There's binary data, right?

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.680
Yes or no, simple
thumbs up, thumbs down.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.380
Is there alum, is
there not alum?

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.130
And then there's numerical
data, pH and fold data,

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.550
which can span any
range of numbers.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:54.280
And so while William Barrow
had all sorts of, you know,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.270
interesting methods and
techniques and technicians

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.140
and secretaries working for him,

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.950
what he didn't have
was a desktop computer.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.180
And so now we can look at
these correlations again

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.180
and the first thing you can
do, once we digitized all this,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.450
is plot out all of the raw
data, the entirety of it.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.480
And it's not as pretty as
perhaps it once looked.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.920
There's a lot of scatter.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.730
There's a lot of outliers.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.030
And that's not unexpected.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.880
These are real books with
unknown histories from all

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.550
over the place, and who
knows where they were

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.050
at what point in time.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.130
But it just goes to show
how messy it can be.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.880
One thing I've done is started
manipulating it a little bit

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.340
to see if there's anything
else you can learn.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.500
So let's move away
from the big scatter.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.340
These are some box plots.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.410
I know box plots probably
something you haven't thought

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.920
about since high school.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.140
Honestly, not really
something I've thought

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.070
about since high school.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.470
But they do give you a
statistical snapshot by decade,

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.770
instead of Barrow's plots,

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.250
which were just median
values by decade.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.970
You pick the median value.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.530
And it gives you
nice clean plots.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.490
This gives you some more
data on what's going

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.200
on in the distributions
over time.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.950
For example, if you've
got a keen eye,

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.350
and the projector's colors
are behaving themselves,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.760
you can see that the
data is right skewed.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.240
What that means is
that the average value

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.890
for a decade is higher than
the median value for a decade.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.500
You've got a couple of odd,
high-end outliers usually,

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.430
for each decade, that pulled
data toward the right.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.730
Most of the lower
performing book.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.450
There are more lower
performing books

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.860
than there are higher
performing ones,

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.250
pretty much across
the board by decade.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.550
And you can do this for
any of the any of the data.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.230
For the fold data by year,
for the tear resistance,

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.780
for the chemical properties.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.290
And so what that does
and what I like doing

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.500
when I do this analysis is
it takes the original data,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.560
what Barrow was looking at--
he had this original data,

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.150
we have this original data, we
start with the same numbers.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.780
He's going just taking
the median values,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.370
making nice cleanish plots.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.810
And then we can take it and we
still get the same trend line.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.680
You can see up to about 1700,
there's a pretty even plateau

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.890
in physical properties and
then it declines precipitously.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:14.430
But you don't lose the data that
you lose in the representation

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.540
of data using just
median values.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.480
You can also do some nice
heat mapping to start looking

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.870
at combined variables over time.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:27.630
So these are now three variables
in one go, looking at year

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.980
and pH and how fold
endurance changes

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.520
over time with both of those.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.860
Right? The hotter
values correspond

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.340
to higher fold endurance.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.520
You can do the same
with tear resistance.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.340
Both are physical measurements.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.670
Right? You would expect
physical measurements,

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.580
the physical durability
of the books,

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.430
to kind of match each other.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.770
And you can see in some
cases that's true, right?

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:56.970
In the 1650s to 1700s-ish,
that high pHs, so non-acidic.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.980
That's true, they both match.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.980
But then it's very easy to
reveal these odd little outliers

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.550
that I don't have
answers to yet,

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:08.250
about why there's a couple
books in here, in about 1850,

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.860
that are acidic that have
really high tear resistance

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.220
but don't have corresponding
fold endurance.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.800
And so data manipulation
and representations

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.050
like this are something you
couldn't do in Barrow's day.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.700
And they're something now
that we can start looking at

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.690
and figuring out
what's going on.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.600
And so I'll jump back now to
the technical stuff I started

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.120
with at the beginning
about cellulose and size

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.900
and what's going on with
cellulose size in these samples.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.830
The Barrow data has
macro-scale measurements.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.390
What's happening at the physical
hand scale of brittleness?

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:44.180
It has all the way down to
chemical level information,

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.350
whether there's alum
present, whether the--

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.700
you know, what the acidity is,
which really is just a measure

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.290
of effective ion concentration.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.080
But it's missing this
intermediary scale.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.920
It's missing what's going
on at the size scale

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.710
of the cellulose molecules.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.260
And so we come back to
micro-invasive testing.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.300
That's why this collection
was so interesting to me

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.170
to use micro-testing on, is

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.990
that this is an actual book
collection, it has data on it.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.240
It's something we might
be able to correlate

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.890
to actual collections objects,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:19.620
and we can use now very small
minimally invasive sampling

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.080
to get another data point

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.380
on this interesting
book collection.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.000
And so the first
thing that I did is--

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.760
so I've got data points
now on about a hundred

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.490
of these a thousand books.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.170
Molecular weight
values of the cellulose

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:34.790
in about a hundred of the books.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:38.360
And you can check that against
the original Barrow measurements

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.720
of acidity.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.100
And you can see that
above neutral,

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.460
there's a lot of scatter.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.610
But below neutral pH, in
acidic books, there's a decent,

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:51.580
pretty good correlation
between acidity and size

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.070
of your cellulose,
the molecular weight,

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.330
the DP of your cellulose.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:00.070
And the first reaction on
seeing this plot is, well, duh.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.370
[laughter] Right?

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:02.770
As it's more acidic, your
cellulose is going to break down

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.070
and you're going
to have smaller,

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.370
lower molecular weight
cellulose.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.140
That's not terribly interesting.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.540
But it is interesting that
this is a real world collection

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.840
of books.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.140
These aren't lab scale papers.

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.440
These aren't things
that we've prepared

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.780
and artificially
aged in the lab.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.760
It's a real world
collection of books.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.060
It's unknown history.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.320
We don't know if any given
book in a collection sat

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.240
in grandma's attic
for a hundred years.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.540
It's unknown geography.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.840
It may have been
printed in Italy,

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.880
but did it then spend
the rest of its life

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.420
in Sweden before it found
its way to the collection?

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.720
We don't know what
the housing was like,

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.160
we don't know the composition.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.950
There's sizing all
over the place.

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.530
And we can draw essentially
a fairly universal trend line

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.610
between acidity and
molecular weight

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.800
in actual book collection
objects.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.240
That's a powerful method.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.180
And so how do they correlate
to physical properties?

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.480
These are color-coded.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.120
It may be hard to
tell by decade.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:59.050
And so you can see, as the
books get newer, less aged,

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:00.870
they actually are
in worse condition.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.940
That's not a surprise
to any of us.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.820
Books from the 18--
middle to late 1800s are

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.320
in worse condition
than the older ones.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.270
The physical condition is lower.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.870
The molecular weights are lower.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.490
The cellulose size is lower.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.860
But a lot of Barrow's
data used pH as one

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.920
of the primary indicators
of paper condition,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.270
arguing that if you know
pH, if you can control pH,

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.000
if you can measure
pH and acidity,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.920
you can predict what
the physical condition

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.660
of a book might be like.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.150
And what we can do is we
can say in this regime,

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.440
before you start seeing a lot
of scatter at the high end,

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.800
that the molecular weight,
the DP, actually correlates

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.720
to physical properties closer
than the best predictors

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.020
that Barrow had at the time.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.450
So there's some physical
meaning here to the size

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.620
of the cellulose and what the
physical condition is of a book.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:56.310
And that's really seemingly a
powerful tool to use, you know,

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.600
about one millimeter diameter
of a sample to be able

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.970
to tell you something about
the quantifiable condition

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.360
of a piece of paper without
having to take that half a page

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.190
of an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.640
There's also this question
of what's been going

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.310
on in the last 50 years.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.990
So this is Riley Thomas.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.470
She was working with me

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.440
as a junior fellow
this summer looking

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.220
at both molecular
weight measurements.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.400
She was responsible for some of
those data points that you saw

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.920
in the last couple plots.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.120
But also looking at the dynamic
changing over time, right?

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.420
The Barrow data is nice.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.580
You can say what happened
to a book 300 years ago,

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.390
but it is a snapshot
at this moment in time.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.690
It doesn't answer the question

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.750
of what's happening
dynamically with the books.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.350
How are any of those
properties changing

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.330
over natural aging conditions?

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:52.210
And so what Riley measured
was acidity and compared it

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.310
to Barrow's measurement for
acidity of the same books.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:02.090
And so what I'm showing here is
just Barrow's lab's measurements

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.180
of acidity, the recently
measured acidity.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.560
If we measured the exact
same values as Barrow,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.610
they would fall on
this straight line.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:15.250
And we see that at low
end, that's kind of true.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.800
At the high end,
that's kind of true.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.100
But in the middle, they tend

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:24.990
to start deviating consistently
lower than you would expect.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.880
And we, again, don't
have a good answer why.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.090
I have a couple of ideas.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.670
Maybe there's enough
buffer alkaline reserve

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.970
in the non-acidic books that
it prevents any significant pH

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.270
changes over time.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.810
Maybe these acidic ones
have kind of bottomed

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.130
out at the most acidic
values that they'll get to.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.820
And it's the neutral ones that
you expect to change over time.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.120
Just a thought.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.420
We don't have any
proof of that yet.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.890
Also looked at physical
testing data.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.210
Same scheme here.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.050
This is a lot more concerning.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:59.780
The physical condition,
here measuring by fold data.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.080
If we would expect everything
to fall in the same line,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.470
that's not what we get.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:06.430
In fact, everything
is a lot lower.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.550
The condition of the books
physically is changing a lot

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.730
more rapidly for the worse than
the chemical properties are.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.710
That's just a zoom-in of
that really clustered region

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.570
down at the bottom.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.870
And so there's this question

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.820
of the physical properties
changing,

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.590
seemingly to change very fast.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.420
The chemical properties,
in terms of acidity,

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.720
perhaps are changing a
little bit more slowly.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.350
And so what's going on?

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.030
And this is something that size
exclusion chromatography might

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.480
be able to shed some insight to.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.390
This is what I've started
doing some work on now.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.870
This is stepping aside
from Barrow for a second,

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:45.140
talking about artificial
aging of book paper.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.590
You can see that even
after just one day,

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.080
that's that green arrow
there, there's a drop

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.490
in physical properties.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.040
And that's something
we can measure

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.820
by size exclusion
chromatography.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.370
You can see changes in the
distribution of cellulose size,

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.500
even after just one
day of aging.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.140
These higher molecular weight
components are starting

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.440
to go away.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.740
They're starting to be replaced

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.760
by smaller molecular
weight components you expect

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.220
from chain scissions.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.920
Overall molecule weight
averages start going down.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.030
And you can see that, even just
one day of artificial aging.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:23.110
And so if you look at these,
what's a little bit deceptive

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.410
in these plots is it
doesn't tell you anything

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.710
about the individual books.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.010
You lose sight a little bit

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.150
of which book is connected
to which data point.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:35.760
And so I've pulled out two here,
pointing to them, red and blue.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.260
So the blue one is from 1664.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.720
The red one is from 1745.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.540
These were their pH values, the
old one, the new one, for both.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:51.360
And so these were books, one
that was non-acidic in nature,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.660
one that was about neutral.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.040
You can see there's
a dramatic reduction

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.750
in the fold endurance
of the neutral book.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.230
There's an even more
dramatic change, not in terms

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.490
of raw number, but in terms
of overall fold strength.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.790
You're losing almost-- you
know, almost, you know,

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.060
down to ten percent of your
original fold strength.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.860
This one, not quite as much.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.450
And can you tell anything

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:24.660
in the molecule weight
distributions of those books?

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.010
And what's perhaps
interesting here is this book,

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.280
the one in red, the one
from 1745 that showed

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.490
that big overall reduction
in fold endurance starts

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:38.980
to show a tiny shoulder showing

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.920
up in the lower molecule
weight region.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.650
What you would expect
to see from the result

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.610
of the beginnings of chain
scission, perhaps showing

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.310
that there are really
detrimental effects

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:58.420
on physical properties with even
just this really small amount

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.960
of smaller molecular weight
cellulose starting to form,

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.230
that you may not be able to
see from pH measurements alone.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:10.580
Right? This pH change, whether
you go from 7 to about 7 1/2,

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.940
whether your measure is
effectively unchanged

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:18.850
and shows you that this
book is not acidic at all.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:21.450
Doesn't quite match up with
the physical properties

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.750
you're seeing.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.630
Whereas these changes
in the size

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.360
of the cellulose is something
that does start correlative.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.950
Now, that's something that I've
found in general to be true,

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:33.740
that the books with
low fold endurance,

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:38.340
with low physical properties,
start having these really subtle

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.600
but indicative shoulders appear

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.360
in the lower molecular weight
regions of the cellulose.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.180
Now, you can see
something is happening

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.180
that perhaps is not revealed

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.820
in other measurement
techniques that have been used.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.240
And so technical conclusions.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.980
I hope I've showed you
that micro-sampling

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.350
by size exclusion
chromatography,

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.030
just one millimeter of sample,

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:05.120
something that I've been
developing and starting

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.090
to use now on the
Barrow collection

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:11.790
to show how it might be used in
real books, can be useful either

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:16.920
in addition to other measurement
techniques or as a replacement

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.160
for other highly
invasive techniques.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.140
It reveals some new insights
into the chemical mechanisms

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:27.350
of degradation that you
may have been misled

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:32.050
by measuring other
physical measurements alone.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.140
Having that Barrow
data is also nice.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.290
It gives us additional
statistical analysis

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.120
and correlations that
haven't been done before.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.670
They're things that
we can build on.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.000
There are things that we
can keep investigating,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.790
looking at that dynamic
age based tracking, right?

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:51.040
And so thinking about
dynamic age based tracking

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.850
and what's changed over
the course of 50 years.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.020
I want to talk-- I want
to take the last minute

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.920
to talk a little bit of my
thoughts just in general

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.320
on the Barrow Labs, and
hopefully you'll indulge me

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.480
in getting a little bit
philosophical for a moment

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.490
to discuss what I've
taken away from working

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.790
with the Barrow Labs
collections.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:18.770
I've been really glad to be able
to work with such an esoteric

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.970
and unique collection.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.470
And the thing I'm most impressed
by when I look at Barrow's work,

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:28.210
when I add to Barrow's work, is
not necessarily their insight

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.350
or even their outreach

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:34.860
in promoting what the
chemistry is of book paper.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.270
The thing I'm most impressed
by, by the Barrow Labs

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.200
and the collections that
we have is their notes

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.740
and their diligence.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.590
Right? Leave it to a
lab that's conserved--

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.240
that's concerned
with paper permanence

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.760
to find a permanent home for
these objects and these data

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.410
in a naturally aged collection
spanning half a millennium.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.420
It shows, to me, and
really highlights to me

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.980
and has stressed the
importance to me, the importance

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.750
of technical notebooks
and technical note keeping

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:10.930
and keeping track of everything
that you've done, particularly

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.140
for people who are
concerned with preservation

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.930
over the natural lifetimes
of materials, right?

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.150
I hope that my notes
are as useful someday

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.150
as Barrow's notes, even
if it's in regret, right?

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.710
[laughter] If, God forbid,

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:28.050
I do something that's
regretted later on,

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:31.700
hopefully no one should go
back and look on any of my work

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.230
and say, what the
hell was he thinking?

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.530
[laughter] And should
know what I did

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.230
so that they can go
back and change it.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.050
And so it strikes me
as especially true

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:43.670
when discussing natural
aging, right?

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:48.360
It's the nature of the job
as preservation researchers.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.440
Odds are good that none
of us will see the results

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.540
of our labor, for
good or for bad.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.070
Right? It's the nature of
long-term preservation.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.970
It's the nature of working with
materials where our goal is

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.960
to have them outlive us.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.390
Right? We could mess
it up badly.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.290
But I hope everyone else is
inspired here to let no one

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.510
to be able to say, what the
hell where they thinking?

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.050
[ Laughter ]

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.490
So I'd like to thank a lot
of interns who have worked

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.850
on this collection, a lot of
staff in PRTD who've worked

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.060
on this collection over the
years, making it look nice

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.550
and pretty and archivally
housed and digitized,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.810
which was a tremendous effort.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.570
As Fenella mentioned
in the very brief bio,

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.770
I do not have a conservation

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:37.100
or preservation background
before I came here,

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.030
so I'm especially thankful-- I'm
thankful to all the PRTD staff.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:43.420
I'm especially thankful to
Cindy and Lynn and Amanda,

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.940
who have helped kind of guide
me into the conservation

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.740
and preservation
world a little bit.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.040
There are a couple references

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.510
that have helped
me along the way

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:55.810
that I've referenced
pretty heavily.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.300
Sally Roggia, for example.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.300
But I'd be happy to
take any questions

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.590
or comments if you have them.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.390
Thanks.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.510
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So
we'll open for questions

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:16.350
and for the benefit of
our-- external viewers,

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.800
I'm going to ask Andrew
to rephrase the question

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.510
so that they can hear it.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:28.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.220
&gt;&gt; Hi. This might be a bit
too complex to get into,

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:42.140
but I'm just curious how you
isolate or purify cellulose

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:49.720
from paper, which has obviously
tons of other stuff in it.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:54.090
And then how you, from that,
are able to make sure you--

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.670
you know, you don't select

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.530
for non-degraded [inaudible]
incorporating artifacts.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:59.830
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Yep,
and that's a concern.

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.960
And I didn't dive
too deep into it.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.260
So-- sorry.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.060
The question for online
is how we make sure

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:10.860
that we isolate the cellulose
from the paper and make sure

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:14.260
that we're not introducing
other artifacts

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.240
by selectively removing parts of
it or not removing parts of it.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.970
And I would say that a lot

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:23.610
of the work has been
done before me.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.550
That's the hard work
that had been gone

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:31.130
on in fundamental labs.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:37.540
And that's what I was talking

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:43.890
about in this sample preparation
that's fairly non-trivial.

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:47.330
It involves a lot of
solvent exchange steps,

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:51.230
including warm water,
including ethanol,

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:55.190
including dimethylacetamide, and
that removes some of the inks.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:58.050
It removes the sizing, if
there's gelatin sizing,

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:01.290
if there's any kind of
large-- also large polymers,

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:04.740
protein-type materials
that are in there.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:08.760
There's all of these insoluble
components, too, right?

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.060
Fillers and lignin.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.370
Lignin, especially
in wood pulp paper,

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.280
very large scale, big molecules.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.780
Those get separated out by
centrification and filtration.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.220
We use very fine mesh filters.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.870
And the crux of it is
this solvent system,

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.600
this lithium chloride
dimethylacetamide

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.900
solvent system.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:34.270
And there's been some really
fundamental work on the physics

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.770
of that using light
scattering to show

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:40.830
that it is a good solvent,
by which I mean cellulose,

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.680
up to 10 million molecular
weight dissolves well

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.980
in this solvent system.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.830
And so if we know that
cellulose is well-dissolved,

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:48.430
if we know that we're removing
all these other fillers,

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.730
that's about the
best that we can do.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.030
I can't say for sure that if
there's degraded, you know,

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.330
lignin, little bits of
lignin that have broken off

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:53.630
that skew the averages
one way or another.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.930
If there's little
bits of gelatin sizing

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.230
that have degraded to
smaller molecular weight

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:57.530
that can survive and get
processed into solution,

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:58.830
that those aren't skewing the
results one way or another.

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.130
But it's about the best that
anyone has come up with so far.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.430
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:02.730
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Does
that answer your question?

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.330
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Okay.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.840
&gt;&gt; You mentioned
something about a punchline.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.780
Can you at least
give us clues as to

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.350
which journal you
might publish in

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:16.260
or what you might call
your article and/ or when?

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.950
[laughter] Because that
was quite a teaser.

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:22.660
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So that can
be linked to the website and go

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.650
out as an ROC [inaudible]
next published.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:27.300
So we can get that to you.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.930
But there's also some great
work that he mentioned that--

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:37.460
you know, in collaboration
with conservation.

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.760
So yeah, we'll make
sure [inaudible].

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:48.000
&gt;&gt; This is Judy Biggs, I'm
the team lead on the project

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.040
that you're referring to and
the work [inaudible] working

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:56.260
on the publication at the moment
and deciding where it'll be.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.000
So we'll keep you posted.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.900
Andrew's work is the last
part of this that we're--

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.220
that was really kind of
fundamental to the project,

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.620
so we're just looking
forward to [inaudible].

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.920
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Sorry.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.550
For listeners online, we're
just discussing publication

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.440
and how results are going to
get disseminated over time.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.740
But we'll be keeping
people abreast

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.930
who are interested in it.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.230
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Charles?

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:29.880
&gt;&gt; If you want to
use a molecular size

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:49.580
or molecular weight as a
measure of the quality of paper

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:56.070
and you're wanting to
evaluate degradation,

00:50:56.070 --> 00:51:01.590
time of historical samples, how
much variability would there be

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:06.860
in molecular weight or size
of the original material used

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:14.150
to make paper, depending on
source, species, et cetera?

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.790
For instance, cotton
versus wood fiber?

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.090
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Mm-hmm.

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:19.590
So the question was checking--

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:23.070
if you're measuring
the molecular weights

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:27.890
of naturally aged historic
samples, is there anything

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.620
that can be said for the
original molecular weights,

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.840
particularly as it
concerns, say, the sourcing

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.890
of the material or the
process, making the material,

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.190
wood pulp versus cotton.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.490
I get you, right?

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:43.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, how much variability is
there in the starting material?

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.070
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: That's
something that I've been working

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.470
on in the lab here using our
paper reference materials

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:53.870
in CLASS, Center for
the Library's Analytical

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.990
Scientific Samples.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:59.570
We have various wood
pulp papers.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.200
We have various standardized
papers.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.620
We have rag papers.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.050
We can go back to these papers

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.860
and look whether
they're rag papers,

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.670
whether they're wood pulp.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:14.770
And so the question about
what's the variability

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:16.330
in them is something I
can't quite answer yet.

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.630
I don't know.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.110
And we can't go back, obviously,

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:21.460
and measure where these
books started from.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:26.020
So we don't know how they've
been changing over time.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:31.560
But in terms of the papers
themselves, we can start

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.860
with our lab papers that
have been, you know,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.160
historically prepared
or that are rag papers

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.460
or that are wood pulp papers

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.760
and subject them to
artificial aging.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.060
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible] materials.

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.360
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Right, right.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.660
But we could start with--

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.960
we'd obviously measure the
molecular weight at the start.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.260
And I don't have an answer yet.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.560
There's no easy trend
to be drawn between--

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.860
&gt;&gt; When you go back and look at
cotton, do you see a difference

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.160
between Egyptian cotton
and some other species?

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.460
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: That
I have not done yet.

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.760
And that's a good question.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.060
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: We had
one question from online.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.360
Is there any one thing

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.660
that Barrow could
have done differently

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.960
that would have been more
informative in hindsight?

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.260
[inaudible]

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.560
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Oh, boy.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.860
[ Laughter ]

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.160
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Can you
try and remember anything--

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.460
[laughter] Can you
repeat [inaudible] Andrew?

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.760
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: So yeah.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.060
So the question from online
was, was there anything

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.360
that Barrow's labs could have
done differently in hindsight

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.060
that would have been
more helpful?

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.870
I'd say they did a
pretty tremendous job.

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:12.890
That's much more data
than you expect to get

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:14.190
from most researchers.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:17.170
That's dodging the question
a little bit, I know.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:24.490
[laughter] I would say that
[pause] you know, some of the--

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:26.910
where different samples were
taken in different parts

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:30.170
of a book would perhaps have
been a little bit interesting.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.640
We can go back and flip
through his books and see

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.330
where pages have been torn out,

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:36.330
but we don't know whether
those pages were used

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:39.490
for tear resistance in
the cross-print direction

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:42.330
or tear resistance in
the machine direction

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.630
or any of these things.

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:48.150
And so again, a plug for PRTD,
where we've got class D coming

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.160
up with meta-data, where we're
tracking which pages are removed

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.310
for which tests and what
data is connected to what.

00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:57.680
I think that's-- that
would have been interesting

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:03.020
to have kept track of because we
do see some differences whether

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.620
you take a sample from, you
know, the bottom edge of a book

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.920
versus the middle of a book.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.220
Or the middle of a page
versus the edge of a page.

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.750
There are some slight
differences.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.490
If you take it from the front of
a book or the back of the book

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:14.790
or the middle of the book,

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:16.090
there's a little
bit of differences.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:20.830
And how much those differences
come out in his data,

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:24.630
that would have been
interesting to know.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:36.750
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: We have
one more question here.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:41.870
How were the physical-- how
were the physical locations

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:46.000
of the samples within
each book selected?

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.300
[inaudible] material
edge or [inaudible].

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.000
And were you able to choose
similar locations [inaudible].

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.300
&gt;&gt; Andrew Davis: Yes.

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:54.420
So-- one thing we've been--
one thing Riley Thomas,

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:58.650
who was working here,
was also interested in is

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.750
where are we testing, right?

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.560
And so I'll use one
of her slides.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.410
And this book was only--

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:08.970
not quite accidentally
chosen for this past week.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.220
[laughter] Kind of timely
appropriate, it's the 1800s.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.420
Study of the Sky, with a chapter
on the moon and eclipses.

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.850
But Riley was interested
in where you're sampling.

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:20.680
And so the first answer
to that question is,

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.090
I can say that we've
been consistent

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:24.160
with these molecule
weight measurements

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:28.530
against Barrow's data of picking
just away from the margins

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:32.150
and away from the text block,
towards the bottom of the page.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:38.270
And every sample we've measured
so far using this method has--

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:42.110
from in a book has gone from
that spot, just for consistency,

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.850
from a randomly selected
page in the middle,

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.660
not close, to either end.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:51.980
We do see differences,
depending on where you check.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.880
And that's something that needs
a little bit of work to figure

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.300
out and a little bit of
work to systemize over time.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.230
And that I, again, don't have a
terribly good explanation for.

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:04.260
But for now, consistency

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.720
within the Barrow book
collections is what we're

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.020
going for.

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.390
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Any
more questions in house?

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:18.500
Well, thank you all for coming.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.220
As you can see, this is
still a work in progress.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.370
And maybe in a year
or two years,

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:26.880
we will do the next installment
and also the wonderful research

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.570
from conservation,
when that comes up.

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:32.510
So please if you could join
me in thanking Andrew again.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:36.840
[ Applause ]

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.470
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
