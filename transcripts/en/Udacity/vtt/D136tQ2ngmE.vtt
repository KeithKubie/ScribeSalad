00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.070
So we're going to start off by talking about scopes and closures.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.290
Since you really need to fully understand those aspects of functions and

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.552
variable access before we can move on to more advanced topics of

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:11.560
object-oriented programming.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.250
Then we'll discuss the parameter this and prototype delegation, which

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.110
are the two main language features allowing for object-oriented JavaScript.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.280
Finally, we'll cover a number of different ways that you can write JavaScript

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.610
classes and subclasses.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.600
By the end of this,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.030
you'll have a strong understanding of JavaScript's object-oriented features and

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.110
how the code you write impacts the interpreters in memory model as your

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.880
code is executing.
