00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.965
- [Voiceover] Part c,
find the time at which the

00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:06.410
speed of the particle is three.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.131
So let's just remind
ourselves what speed is.

00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.207
It's the magnitude of velocity.

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:16.205
So, if you have the x,

00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:17.575
actually let me draw it this way,

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:21.661
if you have the x dimension of,

00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.094
or the x component of

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:24.941
a velocity, right over there,

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.635
so this is the rate
of, which x is changing

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:29.190
with respect to time.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.347
And you have the y
component of the velocity

00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:34.756
you have the y component of the velocity,

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:36.562
let's say it looks something like that.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:39.636
That is dy dt.

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:44.000
Then the, then the speed is
going to be the magnitude

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.238
of the sum of those two vectors.

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:49.768
So, this right over here
the magnitude of this,

00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:51.441
of this vector right over here,

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:52.563
is going to be the speed.

00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:54.353
Well, what's the magnitude of that?

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:55.895
Well, the Pythagorean theorem tells us

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.613
it's going to be the square root of

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:01.550
your x component of velocity squared,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.697
so dx dt, the rate at which

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:07.866
x is changing with
respect to time, squared.

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:12.866
Plus your y component, dy dt, squared.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.726
This right here is the speed.

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.221
And we need to figure out at what time

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.053
is this thing equal to three?

00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:20.711
So let's figure that out.

00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:22.559
So the square root of,

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:25.051
what's the x component of our velocity?

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.131
Well, they told us over here,

00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:27.845
the x component of our velocity

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:30.775
is cosine of t squared.

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:35.605
So, cosine of t squared,

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:37.866
we're gonna square that whole thing.

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:41.551
And then plus the y
component of the velocity,

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:44.322
the rate of change, the
rate at which y's changing

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:45.613
with respect to time.

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:47.400
That's e to the zero point five t,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.032
and we're going to square that.

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:53.896
So plus e to the zero point five t,

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:56.253
and we're going to square that.

00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:58.784
This right over here is
our expression for speed,

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.293
as a function of time.

00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:01.269
And we still have to figure out,

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:02.825
when does this thing,

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:06.571
when does this thing equal nine?

00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.596
So there's a couple of ways,

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:09.964
we could just subtract nine, or sorry

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.601
when does this equal three?

00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:14.492
When does this equal three?

00:02:14.492 --> 00:02:17.151
And so we could try to, we
could just subtract three from

00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:20.495
both sides and input this into our solver,

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:22.410
or we could begin to
simplify this a little bit,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.581
we could square both sides,

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:28.972
and you would get cosine,
let me write it this way,

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:33.775
you could get cosine of t squared, squared

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:38.746
plus e to the zero point five
t, and then squaring that,

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:40.742
well two times zero
point five is just one,

00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:43.041
so this is the same thing as e to the t,

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.298
is equal to nine.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.144
And now we can subtract
nine from both sides,

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:51.971
and we get cosine of t squared, squared,

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.719
I could've written cosine
squared of t squared,

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.671
but this makes it a little
bit clearer, I think.

00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:00.232
Plus e to the t minus
nine is equal to zero,

00:03:00.232 --> 00:03:02.391
and now once again, in
this part of the AP exam,

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:03.657
we can use our calculators.

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:07.115
So let's use our calculators to solve

00:03:07.115 --> 00:03:10.767
let's use it to solve for, in this case,

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:14.470
t, but I'll do everything in terms of x.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.907
So, the equation, zero is equal to

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.737
is equal to,

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:22.267
let me just delete all of this actually,

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.375
just to get it out of the way.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:26.856
Alright, is equal to cosine,

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:28.574
and I'm gonna use x as my variable,

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:33.380
cosine of x squared,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.918
close that parenthesis,

00:03:34.918 --> 00:03:37.330
and then I wanna square the cosine,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.635
the whole thing,

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.700
plus e to the t.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.637
So second e to the,

00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:46.586
but my variable that I'm
gonna solve for is x,

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:48.120
I'm just replacing all the t's with x

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.059
just for inputting into the calculator,

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.784
e to the x minus nine,

00:03:52.784 --> 00:03:56.106
minus nine is equal to zero,

00:03:56.106 --> 00:03:57.589
is equal to zero.

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:59.830
We already have this set equal to zero,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.949
and so we click enter,

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.234
and then we could,

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:08.462
we could just use our previous
answer as our initial guess,

00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:10.834
and we click, we have to do
this little blue solve there,

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.736
so I click alpha, solve,

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:16.279
let the calculator munch
on it a little bit,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.647
and it gets t is equal to,

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:20.900
or x is equal to, but this is really t,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.371
two point one nine six.

00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:27.382
So we get t is approximately

00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:30.332
two point one nine six.

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:31.769
Did I type that in right?

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:34.611
Two point one nine, yep
and then round that up.

00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:38.321
And we are all done.
