00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
Hi.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome back.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.010
Today, we're going to do a fun
problem called the chess

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.280
tournament problem.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.640
Now, it's a very long problem,
so I just want to jump

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.870
straight in.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.300
Essentially, the problem
statement describes a very

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.080
special chess tournament, which
involves players named

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.150
Al, Bo, and Chi.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.510
Now Al is the current reigning
championship, and Bo and Chi

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.550
are this year's contenders, and,
of course, they're vying

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.040
with each other to beat out Al
and become the new champion.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460
And so essentially,
the tournament is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490
divided into two rounds--

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.470
a first round, during which Bo
and Chi play against each

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.230
other, and then a second
round, during which the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.390
surviving contender from the
first round plays against Al.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.750
And the problem statement also
gives you a bunch of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.760
information like what's the
probability that Bo beats Chi

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.820
in a particular game,
et cetera.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.040
So without further ado, let's
get started on part a.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.910
In part a, the first thing we're
asked to compute is the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.410
probability that a second
round is required.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.530
Now, to save myself some
writing, I used the notation

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.870
R2 to denote that event.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.300
So we are interested in
probability of R2.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.170
Now, I claim that this problem
is very sequential in nature

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.440
so I would like to draw a tree
to describe what's happening.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.380
So in the first part of the
tournament, when Bo and Chi

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.060
play their first game, exactly
one of two things can happen--

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.370
either Bo can win
or Chi can win.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.630
And we're told by the problem
statement that Bo wins with

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.610
the probability of 0.6 and,
therefore, Chi must win with

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.600
the probability of 0.4, right?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.580
Because these two possibilities
must sum to 1,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.190
because either this must
happen or this happen.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.490
Now, let's imagine that the
first game has been played and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.210
that Bo won.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.800
Well, during the second game,
there's still two options for

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.340
the outcome--

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.345
Bo could win the second
game or Chi could

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:14.380
win the second game.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.830
And because the problem
statement says that in every

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.310
scenario Bo always wins
against Chi with the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.640
probability of 0.6, we can go
ahead and put a 0.6 along this

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.200
branch as well.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.060
Similarly, 0.4 here.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.290
And similar logic, you've got
a tree that looks like this.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.440
And for those of you who haven't
seen trees before,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.650
it's just a structure that looks
something like this.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.920
And it helps us do better
accounting.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.060
It helps us keep straight in our
head what are the various

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.870
outcomes, so that we
don't get confused.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.160
And so very quickly here, you
can see that there's four

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.410
possible outcomes.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.490
So each node in this tree
corresponds to an outcome.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.170
And the leaves are those nodes
at the furthest stage.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.840
And it's convention to draw
the probability of a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.900
particular--

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.480
so for instance, the probability
that Bo wins the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.470
first game-- it's just
convention to draw that

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.560
probability over the
corresponding branch.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.440
And the reason why such diagrams
are so useful is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.980
because to compute the
probability of a particular

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.070
outcome, if you've designed your
tree correctly, all you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.650
have to do is multiply the
probabilities along the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.980
branches that get into
that outcome.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.530
So let's see that in action.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.800
When is a second
round required?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.670
Well, a second round is
required here, right?

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.450
Because in this case, Bo would
be the surviving challenger

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.730
and he'd play the next
round against Al.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.420
It's also required here.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.400
But of course, it's not required
here or here, because

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.100
no second round is played.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.020
And so these two outcomes
comprise the event R2.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.060
And now, to get the probability
of this outcome,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.790
you multiply along
the branches.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.980
So 0.6 times 0.6
give you 0.36.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.770
And 0.4 times 0.4
gives you 0.16.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.360
And we're almost done.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.040
We know that these two events
are disjoint, because if Bo

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.180
won the first two games, then,
certainly, Chi could've won

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.010
the first two games.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.800
And so you can just sum the
probabilities to get the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.930
probability of the reunion.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.070
So the probability of R2 is
equal to the probability that

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.090
Bo won the first two games or
Chi won the first two games.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.490
And that's equal to 0.36
plus 0.16, which

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.640
is equal to a 0.52.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.000
OK, now the second part
of part a asks for the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.260
probability that Bo wins
the first round.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.430
And this is first round.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.060
This is a very straightforward
one.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.810
So Bo wins the first round, that
correspondence only to

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.090
this particular outcome.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.440
And we already know the
probability associated with

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.760
that outcome is equal
to the 0.36.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.980
So we're done with that one.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.420
And now the last part is sort
of an interesting one.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.460
It asks for the probability
that Al retains his

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.895
championship this year.

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:34.010
 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.540
So I'm going to just call
that A for short.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.300
A is the event that Al retains
his championship this year.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.200
And for that we're going to need
a larger tree, because Al

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.485
has a lot of activity in the
second round, and so far our

00:05:47.485 --> 00:05:51.060
tree only describes what happens
in the first round.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.870
Now, to save time, I've actually
drawn the rest of the

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.360
tree over there up
in the corner.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.410
So let's get rid of
this one and let's

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.050
look at the full tree.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.320
So let's see when does Al
retain his championship?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.900
Well, Al certainly retains his
championship here, right?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.020
Because no second round
is required.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.440
Similarly, here.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.480
Al retains his championship
here, because the second round

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.940
was required, but Al beat Bo.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.610
And similarly, here Bo didn't
win both games in the second

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.490
round against Al, so Al wins.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.140
Here, Bo is the new
championship.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.230
So we don't want to
include about one.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.440
And sort of by symmetry,
we also get this

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.150
one and this one.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.610
So by my argument before, we
know that the outcomes that

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.810
comprise our event of interest
are this one, this one, this

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.680
one, this one, this
one, and this one.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.750
So we could multiply the
probabilities along each

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.910
branch and sum them, because
they're disjoint, to get the

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.390
total probability.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.850
But we're not going
to do that because

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.060
that's a lot of algebra.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.200
Instead, we're going
to look at the

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.170
complement of the event.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.620
So we're going to notice,
there's only two branches on

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.370
which Al does not retain his
current championship.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:18.160
So P of A is, of course, equal
to 1 minus P of A. And we're

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.120
going to get P of
A by inspection.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.350
I'm sorry, so P of
A compliment.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.290
I'm just testing you, guys.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.050
So P of A compliment corresponds
to here and to

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.470
here, because those are the
outcomes where Al didn't win.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.130
And so again, you multiply along
the branches to get the

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.380
probabilities.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:50.060
So you get 0.6 squared times 0.5
squared plus 0.4 squared

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.830
times 0.3 squared.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:01.640
And if you do all the algebra,
you should get around 0.8956.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.140
So we're cruising through
this problem.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.630
Let's go to part b.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.960
Part b is a little bit less
straightforward than part a,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.660
because it starts asking you for
conditional probabilities,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.380
as opposed to a priori
probabilities.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.790
So in the first part--

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.060
and again, I'm going to continue
my notation with R2--

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.060
we want the probability that
Bo is the surviving

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.690
challenger--

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.549
so I'm just going to use
B to denote that--

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.929
given R2.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.240
Now, by definition, you should
remember from lecture that

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.970
this is equal to probability
of B and R2 divided by the

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.120
probability of R2.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.290
And of course, we've already
computed this value right up

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.140
here with part a.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.510
We know it's 2.5.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.640
So we don't have to do
any more work there.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.650
We only have to look
at the numerator.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.410
So we need to go and figure out
what nodes in that tree

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.090
correspond to the event
B intersect R2.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.860
So let's use a new color.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:23.450
Let's see, Bo is the surviving
challenger here only, right?

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.830
And R2 is automatically
satisfied, right?

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:33.550
Because a second round is
required there and there, not

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.590
on those two.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.470
But here Chi is the surviving
challenger, not Bo, so we're

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.430
really only interested
in that node.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.530
And you multiply along the
branches to get the

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.910
probabilities.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.260
So we have 0.36 over
0.52, which is

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.240
approximately equal to 0.6923.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:58.270
OK, now, the next part wants
the conditional probability

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.370
that AL retains his
championship, conditioned,

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.380
again, on R2.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.680
So we already have A being
the event Al retains his

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.750
championship.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.930
So we want the probability
of A, given R2.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.920
And let's just apply the
direct definition of

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.140
conditional probability again.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:25.800
You get P of A and R2 divided
by a probability of R2.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.120
Of course, we have the
probability of R2 already, so

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.490
we just need to find the node
in the tree that corresponds

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.890
to A and R2.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.220
So where is R2?

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.810
R2 is going to correspond to
every node to the right that

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.730
is not one of these two.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.870
So a second round is required
here, here, here,

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.120
here, here, and here.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.710
 

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.770
Now, where does Al retain
his championship?

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.430
So Al retains his championship
here.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.440
He retains his championship
here.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.070
He retains his championship here
and here, but no second

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.650
round is required, so these
guys don't belong in the

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.310
intersection.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.290
But this does, and this does.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.630
So we can again multiply the
probabilities along the

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.060
branches and then some them.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.290
So let's see, we get--

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.290
this marker's not working very
well, so I'm going to switch

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.270
back to the pink--

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.520
so you get 0.6 squared
times 0.5.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.950
That gets rid of this one.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:42.535
And then we want 0.6 squared
times 0.5 squared.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.320
That gets rid of that one.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.100
And then plus--

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.990
let's see--

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:53.420
0.4 squared times 0.7, which
takes care of this one.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:12:04.650
And then lastly, 0.4 squared
times 0.3 times 0.7.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.560
And that is a long expression.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:17.860
But it happens to
be about 0.7992.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.620
OK, so we are done with
part b and we can move

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.920
along to part c.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.700
And I am, since we're running
out of room, I'm actually just

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.920
going to erase this.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.160
And hopefully you guys
have had a chance to

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.270
copy it down by now.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:42.520
If not, you can always pause
the video and go back.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:51.480
So let's see, part c asks us
given that the second round is

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.960
required and that it comprised
of one game only.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:05.080
So let's denote I. So let's I
be the event that the second

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.030
round was one game only.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.230
 

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.520
So essentially, in math
conditioned on R2 and I, what

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.900
is the probability that it was
Bo who won the first round?

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:27.420
So let's let B be the event that
Bo won the first round.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.850
 

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.310
OK, so again translating the
English to math, we just want

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:44.620
the probability of B given R2
and I. Now, I am once again

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.410
going to use the definition of
conditional probability.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:54.890
You might be concerned that we
haven't defined explicitly yet

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.460
the definition of conditional
probability, when what lies

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.780
behind the conditioning bar is
not a single event, but it's

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.980
rather an intersection
of an event.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.940
And so my claim to you is that
it doesn't matter and that the

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.480
same exact definition applies.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.380
But we'll go through
it slowly.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.710
So R2 is an event, I is an
event, and we know that the

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.880
intersection of two events
is itself an event.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.760
So I'm going to make up a new
letter, and I'm going to call

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.030
this event W. So just using
the new notation, this is

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.950
equal to probability
of B, given W.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.280
Now, this is the normal
definition that we know.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.460
We know that this is probability
of B intersect W

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:51.120
over probability of W. And then
we just resubstitute what

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.710
the definition of W was.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.680
And so if you do that over here,
you get probability of B

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:06.480
and R2 and I divided by
probability of R2 and I.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.230
So hopefully, jumping from here
ahead to here, you see

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.170
that the definitions act
exactly the same way.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.570
But these are two very short
intermediate steps that should

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.120
help you convince yourself
that the same

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.880
definition still works.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.550
So let's start with the
denominator, because the

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.040
denominator looks a
little bit easier.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.680
Where is R2 and I in our tree?

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.530
Well, let's see.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.970
Here, a second round was
required, but it

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.830
comprised two games.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.540
Same with this one.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.830
Here, a second round was
required and it was comprised

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.060
only of one game.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.132
So this is good.

00:15:49.132 --> 00:15:53.370
This is one of the outcomes
that we're looking for.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.410
Here, no second round
was required.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.590
So this doesn't qualify.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.020
Same with this one.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.530
Here, a second round was
required, and there was only

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.430
one game, so that's good.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.810
And then these don't qualify
for the same reasons

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.370
as we set up there.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.010
So we just have to multiply the

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.800
probabilities along those branches.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:18.350
And we see that it's 0.4 squared
times 0.7 plus 0.6

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.680
squared times 0.5.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.200
OK, we're almost done.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.930
We just need to look at the
intersection of R2 and I. So

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.570
R2 and I are the ones we've
already circled.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.990
But now, we want to add one more
constraint, which is that

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.930
Bo had to have won
the first round.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:41.100
And so we see here that Chi won
the first round, if we're

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.015
looking at this outcome.

00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:44.050
And so he's no good.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.960
Let's use a different color.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.840
Let's see, maybe this one.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.540
But here Bo did win
the first round.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:57.160
So we're going to get 0.6
squared times 0.5.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.370
And I got that, of course,
just by multiplying the

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.180
probabilities along the
right branches.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:11.069
And this, if you're curious,
comes out to be about 0.6164.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.819
OK, so I know that was a lengthy
problem, but you

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:20.910
should feel really comfortable
now doing sort of basic

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.819
probability manipulations.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:27.109
One thing that this problem
emphasized a lot was your

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.150
ability to compute conditional
probabilities.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.190
So you saw me apply the
definition of conditional

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.550
probability twice in part b.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.010
And then you saw me apply the
definition again in part c in

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.600
a sort of slightly
modified way.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.840
So that's one thing that
you should have

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.340
gotten out of this problem.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.050
And then another thing is that
hopefully, you noticed that by

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:54.870
using a tree diagram, we made
the problem much easier.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.210
We almost didn't even have
to think about computing

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.750
probabilities anymore.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.450
We reduced the problem to just
saying, OK, what are the

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.260
outcomes that comprise our
event of interest?

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.620
And then once you select
those, to compute their

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.130
probability you multiply the

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.400
probabilities along the branches.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.100
You have the right to just add
those together, because if you

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.200
draw your tree correctly, all
of these guys should be

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.200
disjoint from one another.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.970
So you have to be careful, of
course, to set up your tree

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.800
appropriately.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.670
But once you do set up your tree
appropriately, your life

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.270
is much simpler.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.520
So that's it for today.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.870
And we'll see you next time.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.234
