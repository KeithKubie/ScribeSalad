<i>- Welcome to Maelstrom Forge.</i>

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:05.338
This is where
all the magic happens.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.048
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:08.258
First thing's first;

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:09.634
we've got the gaping maw
from hell,

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:11.636
which is my, uh,
trusty propane forge.

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.346
Use it for the--
the workhorse stuff.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.724
And, uh, right here,
we have, uh, my grinder.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.518
Uh, this is where I spend the
bulk of every single project.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.979
It's definitely gotten
the hell kicked out of it,

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.356
but, uh, it's--
it's a good piece of equipment.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.400
Next up, I've got
my big block anvil.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.943
Just slab of 4140.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.571
The bulk of everything
that I could ever need to do

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.532
is done just with something
with four sides.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.950
And, uh, you know, a blacksmith

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.368
is only really
as good as his anvil,

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.203
so I have two.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.621
I got this fancy-schmancy

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.498
120-year-old wrought
P. Wright anvil.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.041
Uh, it does
absolutely everything

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.710
I could hope for it to do, uh,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.879
and it's definitely served me,
uh, pretty well.

we're here
in Shobonier, Illinois,

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.387
and this is the shop
I work out of.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.599
We got our, uh, brand-new--
as of 100 years ago--

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.225
power hammer here.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.352
It does the trick.
It's old, but it works.

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:04.230
Uh, I got the five burner
propane forge.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.358
We also got 2x72s over here.

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:08.735
Drill press.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.863
We've got a lot
of hearty tools.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.364
So, in this part of Illinois,

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:15.241
uh, we're kind of out
in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.202
There's cornfields
everywhere around you,

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.912
so if you need something,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.205
you pretty much learn
to make it.

It's got everything from
blade steels, not-blade steels.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.007
I've even got some really
funky stuff in here.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.050
This is 17-4.

It's a iron-based superalloy.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.553
Uh, not good for blades.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:37.347
Not good for a whole lot,
other than

jet engine components and--
and, you know, stainless parts,

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.311
uh, but I have it
in case I need it.

Uh, if I need to make
a jet engine at the forge,

uh, I've got--I've got
something to work with.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.068
Uh, right here,

This is 80CRV2.

Uh, it moves like butter
underneath the hammer,

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.700
uh, responds really,
really well to the heat treat,

and--and tough as hell,
so, uh,

is lined up the way
it's supposed to be

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.499
and I'm not under, you know,
a three-hour forging

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.669
