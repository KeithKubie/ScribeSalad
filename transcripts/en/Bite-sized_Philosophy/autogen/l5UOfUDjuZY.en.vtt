the story in the story of Adam and Eve

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030
the story in the story of Adam and Eve
 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.690
the story in the story of Adam and Eve
is a meta story and it's a meta story

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700
is a meta story and it's a meta story
 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.450
is a meta story and it's a meta story
for two reasons one is it's about how

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
for two reasons one is it's about how
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.940
for two reasons one is it's about how
stories transform because Adam and Eve

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
stories transform because Adam and Eve
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.530
stories transform because Adam and Eve
are in this unconscious paradise and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
are in this unconscious paradise and
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.539
are in this unconscious paradise and
then it collapses and that happens to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
then it collapses and that happens to
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.609
then it collapses and that happens to
every potential story right

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
every potential story right
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.800
every potential story right
that's Nietzsche's realization said look

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
that's Nietzsche's realization said look
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.870
that's Nietzsche's realization said look
imagine that you live within a belief

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
imagine that you live within a belief
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.000
imagine that you live within a belief
system and then something arises to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
system and then something arises to
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.460
system and then something arises to
challenge the belief system not only

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
challenge the belief system not only
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.589
challenge the belief system not only
does the belief system collapse but

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
does the belief system collapse but
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750
does the belief system collapse but
something worse happens your belief in

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760
something worse happens your belief in
 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.450
something worse happens your belief in
belief systems collapses and that's the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
belief systems collapses and that's the
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.920
belief systems collapses and that's the
road tonight now it doesn't have to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
road tonight now it doesn't have to
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479
road tonight now it doesn't have to
because you can jump from one belief

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
because you can jump from one belief
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430
because you can jump from one belief
system to another but sometimes that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
system to another but sometimes that
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.049
system to another but sometimes that
doesn't work is that you do a meta

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
doesn't work is that you do a meta
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270
doesn't work is that you do a meta
critique and you say oh I was living in

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
critique and you say oh I was living in
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.069
critique and you say oh I was living in
this protective structure and it turned

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
this protective structure and it turned
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.979
this protective structure and it turned
out to be flawed okay one alternative is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
out to be flawed okay one alternative is
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.770
out to be flawed okay one alternative is
jumped to another protective structure

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780
jumped to another protective structure
 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.690
jumped to another protective structure
fine another alternative is protective

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
fine another alternative is protective
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490
fine another alternative is protective
structures themselves are not to be

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
structures themselves are not to be
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.060
structures themselves are not to be
trusted

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070

you going to get out of that that's the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
you going to get out of that that's the
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.840
you going to get out of that that's the
pathway to nihilism well you can you can

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
pathway to nihilism well you can you can
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.700
pathway to nihilism well you can you can
you can work your way through that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
you can work your way through that
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189
you can work your way through that
that's difficult or you can do what Jung

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
that's difficult or you can do what Jung
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.530
that's difficult or you can do what Jung
would regard as a soil damaging move and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
would regard as a soil damaging move and
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750
would regard as a soil damaging move and
you can sacrifice your new knowledge

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
you can sacrifice your new knowledge
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.539
you can sacrifice your new knowledge
Andrey identify with something rigid and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
Andrey identify with something rigid and
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.399
Andrey identify with something rigid and
restricted which is what I would say is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
restricted which is what I would say is
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830
restricted which is what I would say is
happening to some degree with the people

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
happening to some degree with the people
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109
happening to some degree with the people
in you or Europe who are turning to a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
in you or Europe who are turning to a
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.080
in you or Europe who are turning to a
regressive nationalism as an alternative

regressive nationalism as an alternative

to to the current state of chaos it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
to to the current state of chaos it's
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.609
to to the current state of chaos it's
like I know that people need to identify

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
like I know that people need to identify
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.580
like I know that people need to identify
with local groups I understand that but

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
with local groups I understand that but
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859
with local groups I understand that but
that they risk the danger of making the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
that they risk the danger of making the
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.260
that they risk the danger of making the
state the ultimate God and that's order

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
state the ultimate God and that's order
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789
state the ultimate God and that's order
but that's not a good replacement for

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
but that's not a good replacement for
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.469
but that's not a good replacement for
chaos it's just another kind of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
chaos it's just another kind of
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.670
chaos it's just another kind of
catastrophe right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
catastrophe right
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.340
catastrophe right
too much order too much chaos both

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
too much order too much chaos both
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.859
too much order too much chaos both
catastrophes you want to stand in the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
catastrophes you want to stand in the
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.929
catastrophes you want to stand in the
middle somehow and mediate between the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
middle somehow and mediate between the
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.429
middle somehow and mediate between the
two and that's where you have your real

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
two and that's where you have your real
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289
two and that's where you have your real
strength because then it isn't that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
strength because then it isn't that
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.050
strength because then it isn't that
you've discovered a safe place

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
you've discovered a safe place
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700
you've discovered a safe place
because even the bloody right-wingers

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
because even the bloody right-wingers
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830
because even the bloody right-wingers
are after a safe place right they just

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
are after a safe place right they just
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959
are after a safe place right they just
want it to be the state yeah exactly

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
want it to be the state yeah exactly
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.929
want it to be the state yeah exactly
well there's no safe places and the next

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
well there's no safe places and the next
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.240
well there's no safe places and the next
issue is do you really want a safe place

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
issue is do you really want a safe place
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.580
issue is do you really want a safe place
is that what you want you want to be so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
is that what you want you want to be so
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.010
is that what you want you want to be so
weak that you want to be protected from

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
weak that you want to be protected from
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.290
weak that you want to be protected from
threat what the hell kind of life is

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
threat what the hell kind of life is
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.479
threat what the hell kind of life is
that you're a paralyzed rabbit in a hole

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
that you're a paralyzed rabbit in a hole
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.760
that you're a paralyzed rabbit in a hole
that's no life for a human being

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
that's no life for a human being
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950
that's no life for a human being
you should be confronting danger and the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960
you should be confronting danger and the
 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.020
you should be confronting danger and the
unknown and malevolence because and the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
unknown and malevolence because and the
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.480
unknown and malevolence because and the
reason for that too is this is the weird

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
reason for that too is this is the weird
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.550
reason for that too is this is the weird
paradox this is and I believe this is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
paradox this is and I believe this is
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.230
paradox this is and I believe this is
the paradox first of all that was

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240
the paradox first of all that was
 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.390
the paradox first of all that was
discovered in part by a Buddha but also

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
discovered in part by a Buddha but also
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.760
discovered in part by a Buddha but also
laid forth very clearly in Christianity

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770
laid forth very clearly in Christianity
 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.570
laid forth very clearly in Christianity
which is that the solution to the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
which is that the solution to the
 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.750
which is that the solution to the
problem of tragedy and malevolence is

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
problem of tragedy and malevolence is
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.840
problem of tragedy and malevolence is
the willingness to face them now who the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850
the willingness to face them now who the
 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.070
the willingness to face them now who the
hell would ever guess that it's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
hell would ever guess that it's
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500
hell would ever guess that it's
completely paradoxical it's a completely

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
completely paradoxical it's a completely
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.980
completely paradoxical it's a completely
paradoxical suggestion is that well why

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990
paradoxical suggestion is that well why
 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.110
paradoxical suggestion is that well why
does it work well because the more you

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
does it work well because the more you
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.610
does it work well because the more you
confront the two of them the more you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
confront the two of them the more you
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.680
confront the two of them the more you
grow and maybe you can grow so that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
grow and maybe you can grow so that
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.480
grow and maybe you can grow so that
you're actually larger than the chaos

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490
you're actually larger than the chaos
 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.370
you're actually larger than the chaos
and malevolence itself and you think

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
and malevolence itself and you think
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.810
and malevolence itself and you think
well what's the evidence for that and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
well what's the evidence for that and
 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.990
well what's the evidence for that and
that's easy that's what people do that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
that's easy that's what people do that
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that's easy that's what people do that
is how we learn like every time you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
is how we learn like every time you
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.040
is how we learn like every time you
expose your child to something new a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
expose your child to something new a
 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.850
expose your child to something new a
playground

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860
playground
 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.750
playground
what are they exposed to chaos and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760
what are they exposed to chaos and
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.890
what are they exposed to chaos and
malevolence now there's more to it than

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
malevolence now there's more to it than
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.870
malevolence now there's more to it than
that oh obviously because kids play and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
that oh obviously because kids play and
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.670
that oh obviously because kids play and
they you know they promote each other

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
they you know they promote each other
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.140
they you know they promote each other
and they form friendships and all of

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
and they form friendships and all of
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.330
and they form friendships and all of
that but in the playground itself there

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
that but in the playground itself there
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.250
that but in the playground itself there
is the complexity of the social

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260
is the complexity of the social
 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
is the complexity of the social
structure and the malevolence of the

way of thinking about that is not what

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450
way of thinking about that is not what
 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.940
way of thinking about that is not what
you do with people not with your

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950
you do with people not with your
 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.920
you do with people not with your
children not with your partner not with

children not with your partner not with
 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.800
children not with your partner not with
yourself you don't do that that destroys

yourself you don't do that that destroys
 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.500

people's adaptive competence and it and

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510
people's adaptive competence and it and
 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.440
people's adaptive competence and it and
it disarms them in the face of chaos and

it disarms them in the face of chaos and
 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.780
it disarms them in the face of chaos and
malevolence and that's a terrible unisen

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790
malevolence and that's a terrible unisen

if people aren't strong enough to manage
 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.020
if people aren't strong enough to manage
it then they get resentful and then you

it then they get resentful and then you

things will come up to disrupt it and
 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.810
things will come up to disrupt it and
sometimes the disruption is catastrophic

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820
sometimes the disruption is catastrophic
 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.250

everything falls apart that's what

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260
everything falls apart that's what
 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.720
everything falls apart that's what
happens to the Buddha and that's what

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730
happens to the Buddha and that's what
 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.490

we've got the problem the problem is the

and so you could say well what is that

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180
and so you could say well what is that
 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.150
and so you could say well what is that
it's the insufficiency of all potential

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160
it's the insufficiency of all potential

it's the insufficiency of all potential
conceptual schemes right your conceptual

the complexity of the world it's a
 

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.450
the complexity of the world it's a
permanent problem so what do you do you

00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460
permanent problem so what do you do you
 

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.370
permanent problem so what do you do you
stop relying on your conceptual schemes

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380
stop relying on your conceptual schemes
 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.470
stop relying on your conceptual schemes
that's part of the answer you start

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.480
that's part of the answer you start

so that makes you someone that

so that makes you someone that
 

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.090
so that makes you someone that

that provides a permanent solution to

that provides a permanent solution to
 

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.890
that provides a permanent solution to
the problem well then you might say

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:39.900
the problem well then you might say
 

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.380
the problem well then you might say
cynically what's your evidence that

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:42.390
cynically what's your evidence that

cynically what's your evidence that
that's a permanent solution an answer

that's a permanent solution an answer
that is while the evidence isn't all in

that is while the evidence isn't all in

that is while the evidence isn't all in
yet first of all because people only

yet first of all because people only
 

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.250
yet first of all because people only
live that way partially and so we

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.260
live that way partially and so we
 

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.300
live that way partially and so we
haven't put the hypothesis to the

haven't put the hypothesis to the

greater and lesser than we imagined

what would happen an answer to that is

you think that's beyond our capacity

you think that's beyond our capacity

you think that's beyond our capacity
could we make the world a place where no
