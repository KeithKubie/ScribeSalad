let's do this for a year even a month
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.869 align:start position:0%
let's do this for a year even a month
just<00:00:40.140><c> try</c><00:00:40.469><c> not</c><00:00:40.500><c> to</c><00:00:40.739><c> do</c><00:00:41.010><c> things</c><00:00:41.280><c> you</c><00:00:41.489><c> know</c><00:00:41.610><c> to</c><00:00:41.670><c> be</c>

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
stupid and wrong for a month and that
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.130 align:start position:0%
stupid and wrong for a month and that
means<00:00:44.640><c> not</c><00:00:44.789><c> to</c><00:00:45.000><c> say</c><00:00:45.210><c> things</c><00:00:45.539><c> you</c><00:00:45.750><c> know</c><00:00:45.899><c> to</c><00:00:45.960><c> be</c>
