00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.820
Something else they did,
was they tracked the state of the hand.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.370
So, what do you mean,
the state of the hand?

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.840
That's actually, you, I,
I encourage you to read the paper.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.160
They did a couple of really cool things.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.220
First of all, you have Translation.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.660
Okay?
Well, how many degrees of freedom in

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.710
translation?

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.110
Well, we're doing it in two dimensions,
so there's two degrees of freedom.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.200
They had a Rotation.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.610
Okay.
Which is one degree of freedom.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.490
But the other thing they added to
that was the shape of the hand.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.920
And you might ask, well how did
they encode the shape of the hand.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.010
Don't bother Megan.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.620
Well actually what they did was they
took a whole bunch of images of

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.460
contours.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.190
And then they did a form of
principle components analysis.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.510
Now you may not know what that is.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720
But the good news is you will.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.600
Very soon we're going to do principle
corner analysis when we talk about,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.540
recognition.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.560
The thing that matters is that it has
a low dimensional representation of,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.470
certain variation.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.700
And what they did is they
extracted out essentially,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.460
instead of keeping rotation separately,
they took ten degrees of freedom

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.870
that represented the shape of
the hand including rotation.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.040
So you had two for translation and
ten for rot, for the,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.670
for the rotation and shape.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.985
So, that's a 12 degree
of freedom of space.

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:11.467
So that's even more difficult to do the,
tracking with particles because you have

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.660
to have a lot of particles
in order to do this.
