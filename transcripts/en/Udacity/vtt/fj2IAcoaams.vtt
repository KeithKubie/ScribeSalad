00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Answering the question of where am I when you're at sea is not so easy, but luckily

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you'll only need to know two pieces of information.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The first is latitude and may be you remember from Unit 1 that lines and latitude run parallel

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and this 0Â° line of latitude is known as the equator.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The second piece of information we need is longitude.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The lines of longitude run from north to south and since they run this way,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
they actually tells us our position east to west.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now it turns out that one of these is very difficult to find and the one is very simple.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And let me give you a hint, you have used may be in one of the previous units

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
an effective method of calculating one of these--are the latitude or longitude.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can you tell me which one?
