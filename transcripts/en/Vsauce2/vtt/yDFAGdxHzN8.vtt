00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.339
Chelsea Loeb uses a responsive neurostimulator
implanted in her brain to help prevent seizures

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.590
essentially making her a real bionic woman.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.930
And a $200 million dollar plant in Maryland
is being built to create energy out of chicken

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.930
poop.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.930
Vsauce!

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.750
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
A new study shows that babies learn faster
from surprises.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.400
When presented with an object that defied
their expectations, babies not only paid more

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.210
attention to it, but also created and tested
hypotheses around their confusion.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.019
For example, when a ball appeared to roll
through a wall they tested its solidity by

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.550
slamming it against the table.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.329
Showing babies use what they know about the
world to motivate learning.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.550
And the researchers are trying to understand
how much knowledge humans are born with and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.589
how much is from a result of our observations
of the world.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.910
A new 3D printer can form soft objects using
fabric.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.280
Utilizing sheets of off-the-shelf fabric layers
are bonded with a heat-sensitive adhesive

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.750
and the contour is shaped with a laser cutter.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.640
It can even include conductive fabric to sense
touch as well as a fabric coil for wireless

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.250
power reception - for a soft cell phone case.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.530
1,962 feet below the Gulf Of Mexico researchers
from EVNautilus had a rare encounter with

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.869
a Sperm Whale.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.800
The remotely operated vehicle piqued the interest
of the whale and hearing the researchers reactions

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.159
is just great.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.740
Oh, wow.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.740
Gorgeous.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.119
Holy cow.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.760
I think we beat the other watch today.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.920
Oh man.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.240
This is so neat.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.400
*laughter* Wow!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.020
NASA recently unveiled their Modular Robotic
Vehicle.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.840
The MRV is a fully electric car with autonomous
and remote control featuring four independent

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.050
wheel modules capable of steering 180 degrees.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.369
It has a top speed of 40 MPH and they claim
the sideways driving is like driving on ice

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.180
but in complete control.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.009
Aside from Moon and Mars driving, applications
could be manifest in retirement communities

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.500
or taxi services.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.900
Parkinson’s diagnosis may be possible by
typing on a keyboard.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.940
Current diagnosis happens about 5-10 years
after the onset of the disease but by analyzing

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.050
the subtleties in people’s keystrokes we
can learn a great deal about psychomotor performance.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.370
Researcher noticed a huge difference between
people typing wide awake and typing after

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.560
being woken up in the middle of the night.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.050
And they hope to develop a way to use this
kind of data for early detection of Parkinson’s.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.100
Meanwhile, General Atomics is building the
world’s largest superconducting electromagnet.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.239
The 1,000-ton ITER Central Solenoid will be
used to drive a hot plasma for fusion energy.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.190
It will be among the most powerful magnets
ever built with six modules housing the energy

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.580
of 1,000 cars going 100 mph.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.280
The international nuclear fusion research
megaproject is a collaboration between 35

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.220
nations to demonstrate the viability of fusion
energy.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.470
Finally, researchers at Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory view a battery under a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.099
special microscope to see why a battery loses
strength over time.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.400
Each discharge of the battery leaves behind
lithium metal.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.410
In this trapped state, the dead lithium can't
contribute to a future charge.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.099
You can also see the electrode cracking from
stress.

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.650
I’m gonna leave you with a pack planter
robot transplanting rows of pansies.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:46.930
And as always - thanks for watching!

00:03:46.930 --> 00:04:28.580
