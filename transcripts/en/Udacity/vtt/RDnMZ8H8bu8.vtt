00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.370
What we've been doing here are the first steps of

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.220
what is called low fidelity prototyping. This is where we

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.730
take paper to make simple representations of our designs. We

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.020
create paper prototypes for communication, and to demonstrate our ideas.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.490
And to find out what works for a user. We

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.340
don't want to invest too much into it, sketching is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.330
cheap and engineering is expensive. You said the word wire-frames.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.970
Can you I've heard that word a lot. Can you explain

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.475
what that is?

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.287
&gt;&gt; Well, actually Clifton has a great example of a wire-frame.

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:34.640
A wire-frame shows the basic information and placement of different elements.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.950
So he's got a little token here that kind of represents an

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.430
image. You know, and I think that's become so familiar to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.510
us that we know that that's like a picture of somebody,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.670
even though it doesn't look like anybody I know. In fact,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.780
it looks kind of like a question mark with a little hump.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.970
And then this is text, placement for text. And he's out

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.600
it within this frame, which is actually very similar to this frame.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.273
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:58.170
&gt;&gt; Right? Of our device. So and then he's got some

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.960
call outs and labels. So this, essentially, is wire frames, all

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.595
these are wire frames. And the difference, say, between his wire

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:06.930
frames and yours is that he's constrained them by a frame.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.240
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] He's sort of put that around and he's thought a little bit about

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.690
how things are positioned within this constraint. So,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.770
he's already one step ahead, which is fine.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.370
&gt;&gt; Wire frames show placement in an actual frame

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.480
of a device. And flows are sequences of wire

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.480
frames. Flows work to create a user interface story,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.070
in much the same way as a comic strip tells

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.490
a story. Now, let's actually make some wire frames

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.780
and flows, using those conceptual models that we made earlier.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.770
In fact, let's bring all the elements you generated

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.190
before, including the conceptual models, the discoverable signifiers, and the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.650
feedback, into our wire frames and story board.
