00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:03.170
I don't know, I always would say
I'd get a Chinese symbol.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.088
This was like my big joke
when I was like oh

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:09.384
I'll get a Chinese symbol
that means Chinese symbol.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.261
Oh I was gonna get one
that meant unoriginal.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.512
I honestly researched it.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:13.764
I like that. Really?

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:16.225
I went to a Chinese restaurant
and was like, could you guys ...

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.935
that's my research,

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:21.980
I asked them what is
the symbol for unoriginal

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.399
and they couldn't give it to me.
They didn't understand.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.485
We don't have such a stupid word
in our language.

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:28.195
Yeah they kinda said that.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:32.824
Well Jews aren't allowed
to have tattoos.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.076
Right.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.619
So my mother would always
tell me that

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.163
but then she had her eyelids,
she had permanent eyelids.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.456
Right.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.666
So those are tattoos.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.251
Not eyelids, eyeliner.
I think you mean eyeliner.

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:45.170
Eyeliner, yeah.
She had permanent eyes.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.672
We'll get there,
we'll always get there.

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.839
She tattooed her eyes.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.841
He may not get us there
but we'll get there.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.426
As a team, as a family,
we'll get there.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.636
You're my favorite.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.847
It takes a village to understand
what the hell

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.224
Andrew is talking about.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.475
My mom-
So your mom got-

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.685
I'm good for radio.

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.895
Your mom got make up tattooed
onto her eyelids

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.188
which I think is a great-

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.439
That's a tattoo though.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.983
Yeah, it is a tattoo.
That's definitely a tattoo.

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:07.234
Yeah, she's not going to heaven.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.860
And she's like you can't have
a tattoo

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.154
and I was like you have
a tattoo, eyelids,

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.782
and you have a facelift.
You changed your whole,

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:16.118
no one even knows if you died
you're a different person.

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.619
But I can't have a tattoo

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.079
because I can't get
buried with it.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.083
But that eye make up means ...

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.297
what would you have gotten if
you wouldn't have felt anything?

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:30.632
A tattoo of her telling me
not to get a tattoo.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.259
No, I don't know
what I would have gotten.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.470
I would have probably gotten my
grandpa's initials or something.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.974
I don't know, somewhere
on my forearm or something.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.517
What are his initials?

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.228
I don't even know. HG I guess.

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.604
HG Wells.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.441
HG and then there's MC.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.152
Okay yeah that's what
you're gonna be

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.903
for the rest of your life too.
So that will be a good one.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.572
I heard Angelina Jolie being ...

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:57.743
remember Angelina Jolie
did Dateline or something,

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:00.579
some big interview after
she and Billy Bob broke up.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.499
And she said I realized
when I needed to break up

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.252
with him
when I had gotten ...

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.755
she had gotten his name
tattooed on her

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:11.173
and then she was thinking

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:14.468
I would never tattoo
Maddox's name,

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.471
her adopted son's name
on herself.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.890
And then she's like why did
I tattoo his name,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.309
why did I do Billy Bob but I
would never tattoo my son's

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.521
because I know I will always
have a relationship with my son.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.856
It's not threatened.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.317
And there was something
really interesting in that,

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.487
if you somehow worry
about a connection with someone

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.113
or you have an insecurity
about someone,

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.406
you tattoo their name-
Marriage-

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.909
... like Johnny Depp
and Winona Ryder.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.452
And Pete Davidson
and Ariana Grande.

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:43.288
Any kind of official thing-

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.082
It's like proof it exists.

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:47.042
Honestly marriage
even is like ...

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:53.632
I got you, forever okay.
I get it. I want that.

00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:55.425
That's so funny
because my ex,

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:57.552
who we were never
gonna get married,

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.638
I was like I want
to get tattoos.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:03.392
I wanted something
in writing on us

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:05.936
that was we're bound for life.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.230
You find a way to ...
you're so right.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.690
That's why we're gonna get
tattoos when your special,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.984
when you record it, we're gonna
get matching ones right?

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.236
What kind are you guys
gonna get?

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:15.779
Yeah what are we getting again?

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.280
She looks so terrified.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.990
You brought it up, remember.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.911
It's his joke that we're gonna
get matching tattoos

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:27.749
to celebrate my special which he
has been helpful with it.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.376
Why are you having anything
to do with this Andrew.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.710
Why not, why wouldn't
I be involved.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.381
I remember one time
Sabrina Jalees,

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.341
and I were gonna get tattoos
if we made it through

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.969
on Last Comic Standing,
past the semis.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.056
We told the NBC cameras
we're gonna get tattoos tonight

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.392
if we get Last Comic
Standing, if we get past, thank

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.852
God we didn't because
we would have done it.

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:48.061
We would have done it.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.147
And I remember we were joking
what would we get

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:52.524
and Greg Giraldo
was one of the judges

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.733
and we were like we'll get

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.986
Greg Giraldo's face tattooed
on our ass.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.780
Could you imagine
if that was ...

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.490
because knowing
what happened.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.741
It would be a nice tribute
I guess.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.702
Did you get to the semi-finals?

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.078
I got to the semis
but I didn't get-

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.329
So you didn't?

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.418
No we both got to that night
but no, maybe, I don't remember.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.962
I just ... no, yes, no, yes.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.257
Would you get like the best
looking version of Greg Giraldo?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.550
Who picks the picture?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.759
I don't know.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.511
I would never have gotten
Greg Giraldo's face.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.972
I mean it would be more
fitting now that he's gone.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.348
My step-brother has
so many tattoos

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.766
and they all mean something.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.976
Really?

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.352
Well he loves fishing,
he's very simple,

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:33.440
he lives in Florida,
he has a fish, a rattlesnake,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.734
his cousin that died
in a motorcycle accident,

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.778
his last name and a wave,
like surfing.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:38.987
Wow.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.238
These are the exact things,

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.615
and he lives these things,
I just don't-

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.824
He is that.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.117
When I was talking about
the accountant

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.953
with a skull that's bleeding,
it's like what is ...

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.580
Yeah you're right.
You're just trying ...

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.124
Oh my God I went out
with a guy like that once.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.375
We went on two dates.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.337
I just remember he worked
in the financial district

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:56.755
or on Wall Street
or something.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:59.883
He was an investment guy
and he was fully tattooed

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.426
and he had this whole
double life kind of.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.803
He was like a motorcycle guy
with a beard

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.348
but he wore a suit every day,
a three piece suit with a vest.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.557
But he did ride a motorcycle.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.059
I'm literally turned on by all
those tattoos

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.310
you just described.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.561
The fish?
I like that they-

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.230
I've showed you my step-brother,
he's a hot man.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.190
Yeah he has a purpose.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.484
He knows what he his,
he's leaning into it.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.986
I like it. I take back
everything I said about tattoos.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.780
I either want them
to have a ridiculous story

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.449
or I want them to be
so meaningful and stupid.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.868
But also still stupid,
but very meaningful.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.787
So you're not into like
ornate stuff.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.790
It's the same thing as someone
who had tattoos

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.959
when they were 18
and it meant something.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.336
As long as there was
a funny story associated

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.171
and it really,
truly meant something to you,

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.257
I think it's kind
of a good thing.

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.634
He has a wave
because he just likes water?

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.886
Because he likes surfing.
He has a surfer,

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:48.223
him cutting back
with the splash of the wave.

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.475
He has a bionic,
I don't know,

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.937
the rattlesnake's bad ass
and his name is Jake

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:57.065
and he goes by Jake the Snake.
So then he has a rattlesnake.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.568
It's all there and
it's coiled up ready to attack.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:01.194
And he would always get mad
at me if I go near his-

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.988
I would get a hummus platter.

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:06.866
A hummus platter down this side
and then I'm gonna do-

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.910
A little oil, a little pita,
extra cucumbers.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.330
Yeah, what else do
I love so much.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.582
My phone.

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:14.791
Starbucks?

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.751
Right here. Starbucks down here.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.170
Right in the middle
of your boobs.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.131
Down there.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.091
Something across your collar
bone would be cool.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.551
Just like a word.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.802
Me so latte?

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.221
You love that Hitachi
magic wand.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:32.559
Just a finger.
Just a finger there.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.561
And then a blunt to really show
how cool you are dude.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.812
Yeah man and then just-

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.355
Fucking burning blunt dude.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.649
On the back of my neck
so only people that,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.193
when I'm wearing a pony tail

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.279
that's when they know
I love blunts.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.072
And you'll get weed
inside your lip

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.159
so you say ah look at that.
Want to see, isn't that cool?

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.994
The thing that strikes me
with tattoos

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.163
though is that I go through
so many phases in life.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.915
I'm shocked that your cousin
has always liked these things.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.917
Because imagine
if you had tattooed stuff

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.169
that you like
when you were like 17?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.420
I wish I would have.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.047
I want to go get
a Dave Matthews tattoo

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.425
now that really faded
and raised really bad.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.136
I want it to look like shit
but it be fresh

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.806
because I would have had
that had I been allowed to.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.516
Yeah you can't get a freshy
Dave now.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.268
I'm glad I never did
the ankh symbol,

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.270
I would have unicorns
and ice skates and ponies.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.480
That's all I liked.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.567
Oh boy. And now I feel though
forever

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.861
I will always love
the things that I love now.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.112
That's not true.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.239
That's huge, that's great
that you know yourself.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.949
Narcissistic men.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.411
Love, love.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.121
Love.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.374
Micro-penis.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.376
Instagram. Just tattoo
the Instagram logo.

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.585
Just get it on the side

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.755
Andrew they won't be able
to fit it all but ...

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.006
Write micro on my dick.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.384
Yeah people who get tattoos
on their penises.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.302
Or if you get
your clit pierced.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.512
No thank you.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.223
I mean part of me wants
to just feel

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.724
what it would feel
like getting it pierced.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.267
I think that would be
a great feeling.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.270
It would be painful
but also probably pretty dope.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.357
Especially if you get it in the
middle of the mall at a kiosk.

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:07.570
Piercing Pagoda.
It's a teenager with a gun.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.864
One of those clamp, clamp.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.950
Yeah just get up
on this chair here, yeah.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.326
Don't mind the people
in Spencer's.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.870
That's the problem the guys
who has to pierce your clitoris.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.580
Did you have a stroke?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.418
He's gonna like hold it,
that would be so weird.
