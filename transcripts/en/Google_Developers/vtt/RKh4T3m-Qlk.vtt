00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.230
Hello, all.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.010
My name is Hariny,
and I am a coder.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.650
I have had the good
fortune of being

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.550
to some of the best schools in
the country and in the world.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.380
I received a bachelor's
in computer science

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.550
from the College of Engineering,
Guindy, Anna University,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.130
and a master's in the same
from Stanford University,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.860
California.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.990
My first job was with Lab126.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.090
For those of you who
haven't heard of Lab126,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.210
it is Amazon's research
base for its consumer

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.520
electronic products,
notably the Kindles.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.530
Now, this was a dream
come true for me,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.340
because Kindle is one
of those few products

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.870
that I admire to the
core for its simplicity,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.510
yet its powerful
impact that it's had

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.690
on the way people read today.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.610
So after that dream stint
of three years in the US,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.230
I relocated back to India in
the beginning of January, 2013.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.650
Now 9 out of 10 people
that I meet are stunned--

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.580
and not in a good way, I
might add-- with the fact

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.330
that I relocated too soon.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.750
It's a prevalent
perception amongst people

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.280
here that returning from
the United States, which

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.710
is the land of opportunities,
is not a great decision.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.140
It definitely features in Top
10 Stupidest Career Mistakes

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.280
You Can Make in a Lifetime.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.520
I have received reactions
ranging from the brutal--

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.590
are you out of your mind?--
to the sympathetic head tilt--

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.030
did you choose it?

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.690
Did your parents arm-twist you?

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.190
Wait.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.790
It doesn't end there.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.560
The cherry on the cake
for me is the reaction

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.041
I get from people when I tell
them that I'm a remote worker.

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:50.540
Yes.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.520
You heard right.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.150
I work from home for the
Amazon Chennai office

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.210
ever since I got married, and I
have been doing that for a year

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.750
now.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.680
People's perception
about working from home

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.730
is extremely interesting
and extremely flawed, too.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.770
Their gut reaction to
it is that remote work,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.040
that just does not work at all.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.790
And it's extremely
detrimental to career growth.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.730
How do you do it?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.990
Whatever perceptions
and assumptions you

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.470
might have about working
from outside an office,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.270
I can tell you that
there is definitely

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.650
a way to make it work and
a way to thrive doing it.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.480
So I figured this is
the perfect opportunity

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.020
to share three simple
tips that have helped me

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.350
make my remote work effective.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.850
Tip one.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.221
Create an office workspace
for yourself at home.

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:45.720
Duh.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.930
That's a simple and trivial
thing to say and do.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.880
Right?

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.550
But believe me, the
little things matter.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.510
The mind is fickle,
and you often

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.050
have to play your tricks
on it before it plays you.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.550
Doing this, creating a
replica of an office workspace

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.160
inside your house, infuses
the idea in you constantly

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.490
that you are no different
from a regular office-goer.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.200
And it sets the
tone for the day.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.670
You get up in the morning,
you walk into that space,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.500
a sense of conviction and
responsibility sets in,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.750
and it carries through the day.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.880
Also remember, a 9 to 5
timing, or some timing

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.990
should be set for
your office hours.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.390
Now, this kind of timing
system doesn't usually

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.720
work in an IT office.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.830
But believe me when I say this.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.400
This is very, very important
when you're working from home.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.100
Because guess what?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.790
The danger of procrastination
and distractions

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.410
just got multiplied
like a billion-fold

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.010
when you're working from home.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.230
So stick to your
timings, and instruct

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.630
to your family and friends.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.440
Sit them down nice and easy.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.180
Tell them to stay away
during those work hours.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.940
My husband usually
goes, do not disturb.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.680
Wolverine at work.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680
It has its moments.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.220
Tip two.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.930
Communication.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.410
Now, this poses a little
bit of a problem when you're

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.899
working, like, thousands
or probably 100 miles away

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.430
from your actual office.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.060
So it's normal for
you and your team

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.550
to feel cut off from each other.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.060
I won't lie to you,
this is a steep curve

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.890
that you need to get ahead of.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.100
But you can do it
through a lot of means.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.210
You can talk to
people over phone.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.450
You can do a video conference.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.300
And you can travel once
in a while to the office

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.560
just to have that little bit of
face time with your colleagues.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.140
What you will notice is
that with due cause of time,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.860
people start appreciating
and respecting,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.370
even, the fact that
you're making the effort

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.320
to constantly solicit
their opinions

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.150
and resolve issues quickly.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.880
Believe me, they will
respect you for it.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.970
And you will get
ahead of that curve.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.050
Tip three.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.750
This is probably the hardest of
them all and the simplest, too,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.010
at the same time.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.590
Determination.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.350
It is very, very normal
for mental anxiety

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.560
to kick in when you learn
a new task or you take up

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.090
a new challenge.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.970
Working remotely is
daunting, definitely.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.960
But what isn't?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.960
Nothing in life
comes easy, does it?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.140
With the right determination,
you can overcome any hump.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.690
Just take it one step at a time.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.900
Be proud of what you
do, and celebrate

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.910
what you've toiled for.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.020
If there's anything
I have learned

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.360
in the last year of
my working remotely,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.120
it is that where you
are should not come

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.280
in the way of what you do best.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.160
You just cannot let it.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.200
End of story.
