00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
This video was made possible by Skillshare.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.920
Churchill was a man with many talents.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.760
He was an artist, a butterfly enthusiast, and he had an unpublished manuscript about aliens.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.680
Clearly he was a man with an insatiable thirst for knowledge.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.960
Maybe he could have loaded up his computer,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.280
and logged on to Skillshare.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.800
An online learning community,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.140
with more than 19,000 classes in design,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.180
business, technology and more.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.380
Perhaps he was considering a side-career in fashion.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.420
But didn't know where to start.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.920
On Skillshare, he would've found courses on fashion design,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.060
and garment construction.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.340
Or if he wanted to learn app design,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.500
improve his photography,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.460
or just how to make a really good quesadilla,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.960
He would have found courses for all of these and more,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.840
on Skillshare.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.300
Skillshare gives you access to high-quality classes

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.520
taught by genuine experts working in their field.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.200
I work heavily with animation,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.100
and I was genuinely blown away by the number of really useful courses available to me.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.940
Like this class, full of tips and tricks for creating vector art.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.100
Or this one, for creating character walk cycles.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.820

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.780
Now, without further ado -

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.460
It's 1902.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.580
A young man by the name of Benito Mussolini moves from Italy to Switzerland

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.040
to avoid military service.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.680
He gets big into socialism,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.320
working for trade unions, writing for socialist newspapers,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560
advocating a violent overthrow of European monarchies,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.540
the whole shabang.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.540
This gets him in a bit of trouble with the Swiss police.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.480
So he gets arrested,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.400
sent back to Italy,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.200
set free,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.480
returns to Switzerland,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.560
is arrested again,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.920
goes back to Italy again,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.080
completes his military service after previously avoiding it,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.640
and then after a brief stint as an elementary school teacher,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120
he finally returns to work as an avid socialist.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.120
His speeches and journalistic abilities made him famous among Italian socialists.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.100
He was anti-war,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.140
so when Italy colonised Libya in 1910,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.980
he rioted.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.180
And got arrested.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.340
Then WW1 came along,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.580
and once again, he protested Italy's involvement.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.740
But then he thought, 'Wait a minute.'

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.300
'This war could bring about the social climate needed to overthrow European monarchies,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.740
and bring about the socialist revolution everywhere.'

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.300
And suddenly he was pro-war.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.620
But his fellow socialists didn't like his new pro-war stance,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.940
so they kicked him out of the party.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.420
So then he said, 'You know what?

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.620
I'm done with socialism.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.840
We need something new. Not based on class divisions tearing us apart,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.860
but based on unity through nationality.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.060
We'll conquer the Mediterranean,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.580
and reunite all Italian peoples,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.400
just like the days of the Roman Empire.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.580
I'll call it "Fascismo"

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.700
and it will guide the Italian nation to greatness.'

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.460
'That's all well and good, Mr Mussolini,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.860
but what kind of haircut am I giving you?'

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.080
'Let's go with...

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.140
bald.'

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.640
♪ Tchaikovsky - 1812 Overture ♪

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.960
Italy had been on the winners' side in WW1,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.660
and they hoped they were going to get a lot out of it.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.340
But in the end, they only got a little, and they felt cheated.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.820
On top of that, a bad economy,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.540
and weak governments meant that the Italian people were a little unhappy.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.020
So when Mussolini came along,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.280
and said that he could fix everything,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.400
his fascist movement gained a lot of support.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.760
In 1922, he went to the King and said, 'Make me prime minister, or I'll make me prime minister.'

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.540
And the King said, 'You and what army?'

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.700
'This army.'

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.640
'Fair enough.'

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.720
Then he went about establishing a dictatorship

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.100
with himself at its centre.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.220
Europe had its first fascist dictator.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.540
Next up: Germany.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.520
Germany had been on the losers' side,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.900
and they got absolutely wrecked

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.180
by the Treaty of Versailles.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.160
They lost territory,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.680
had to demilitarise the Rhineland,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.180
had to reduce their army to just 100,000 men,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.160
couldn't have an airforce,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.980
had to pay the Allies a huge amount of money that it didn't have,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.760
and a new rule was established that every Englishman witheld the right

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.160
to walk into the center of Berlin,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.800
pick out any German they wanted,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.920
and spank the hell out of them.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.900
I made that last one up,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.260
but it helps you understand how all of this felt to Germans.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.660
On top of that, a bad economy and weak governments

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.520
meant that when a small, angry man with a silly moustache came along

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.940
and said that he could fix everything,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.220
the German people loved it.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.960
Hitler had been a soldier during WW1,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.640
and he was crazy patriotic.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.560
And nobody was madder than him about Germany's humiliation.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.160
He helped start a new political party,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.320
and in 1923,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.380
attempted a march on Munich with his boys.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.880
And then he got arrested.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.600
But his popularity grew and grew,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.200
and in 1933, the President made him Chancellor.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.640
He believed he was Germany's great destined saviour,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.120
and he went full megalomaniac,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.780
establishing a dictatorship with himself at its center.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.260
Europe had Fascist Dictator No. 2.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.520
Hitler and Mussolini had a lot of the same ideas.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.460
But more importantly,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.680
they had the same enemies.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.940
And they started to get along.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.160
'Anyone else wanna be friends?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.960
Franco?

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.560
No?

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.420
You good?'

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.100
'I do.'

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.740
'Who's that?'

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.660
It's Japan.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.380
And they've taken over northern China.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.360
Let's rewind a bit -

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.840
Japan had isolated itself from the rest of the world for over 200 years.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.260
Until the Americans showed up and said, 'You're going to trade with us, and you're going to like it.'

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.840
Then the Western powers imposed a bunch of 'Unequal Treaties'.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.640
Meaning Japan's economy was bust.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.580
They also had no natural resources.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.240
So they decided to go get some.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.120
They went to war with China to gain a sphere of influence over Korea,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.620
and they took a bunch of China's stuff.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.840
But then the West said, 'Hey!

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.600
Cut that out.'

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.420
And since Japan couldn't take on the West,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.360
They said, 'Okay, I guess we'll just go home -

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.160
Wait a minute!

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.760
What are you doing?'

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.520
'Taking advantage of a weakened China and setting up spheres of influence.'

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.780
'But I was the one who weakened them.'

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.320
'We know.'

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.960
'And you guys didn't let me have anything.'

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.760
'We know.'

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.020
'That seems unfair.'

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.260
'We don't think so.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.340
Okay. See ya.'

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.900
So Japan thought, 'Screw this!'

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.060
and went to war with Russia,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.820
and stunned everyone by actually winning.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.220
Then they fully annexed Korea,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.200
but they didn't stop there.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.260
In WW1, they took Germany's colonies and islands in Asia.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.420
And then in an incident that was maybe staged by the Japanese army,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.540
a bomb blew up a Japanese train in Manchuria,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.420
giving them an excuse to launch an invasion and take over.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.680
So, here's the situation:

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.880
Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and Japan,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.480
all believe they're racially superior.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.360
All feel hostility towards the Allies,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.900
and all want to militarise and take over more stuff.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.600
And so they did.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.820
Let's start with Germany.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.740
Hitler hated the Treaty of Versailles,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.640
and now he was ready to begin undoing it.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.260
In complete violation of the treaty,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.160
the first Luftwaffe squadrons were set up,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.380
conscription was introduced,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.600
and he pimped up his army.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.840
The Allies did nothing.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.480
Then Hitler sent his army back into the demilitarised Rhineland,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.720
giving orders to immediately retreat if the Allies showed up.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.860
The Allies did nothing.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.000
With his military restrengthened, he could now move on to Step 2.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.600
He wanted to rapidly increase the Aryan population.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.580
And to do so, he needed lebensraum,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.560
or in other words, he would have to take over the world.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.540
But for now, a good portion of Europe would do.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.020
And he began eyeing up his neighbours.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.620
The Allies finally started to get worried,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.780
so they implemented a fairly useless diplomatic strategy called appeasement.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.440
And it went a little something like this:

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.040
Hitler would say, 'I want that thing.'

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.460
And the Allies would say, 'You can't have that thing -

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.360
Okay you can have that thing but no more.'

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.720
'I want that thing.'

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.820
And repeat.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.100
In 1938,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.680
Hitler's army marched into Austria,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.400
and just took it,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400
with no resistance.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.900
Boom.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.840
This is Germany now.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.180
Next, he demanded to be given the Sudetenland,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.640
an area of Czechoslovakia with many ethnic Germans.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.500
The Allies held a meeting with Hitler in Munich and said,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.600
'Look, we're going to give you wha -'

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.360
'HANG ON.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.260
This meeting is about my territory, shouldn't I come to the meeting too?'

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.460
'Anyway, we're going to give you what you want.'

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.420
'Really?'

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.920
'Yeah.'

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.100
'Just like that?'

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.600
'Yep.'

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.700
'What's the catch?'

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.080
'Just sign this piece of paper promising you won't invade the rest of Czechoslovakia.'

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.460
'Okay.'

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.620
Then Chamberlain returned home victorious, waving his signed piece of paper in the air,

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.940
declaring crisis to be averted,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.380
and the continuation of World Peace,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.180
and we built a statue of Chamberlain in his honour

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.600
and every day on the 30th of September we celebrate Chamberlain Day -

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.280
'Hitler's invading the rest of Czechoslovakia.'

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.300
'What?'

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.080
'He's invading the rest of Czechoslovakia.'

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.380
'Oh.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.220
You lied to me.'

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.480
'What do you expect?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.240
I'm Hitler.'

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.340
Not to be outdone, Mussolini also wanted to get in on the action.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.160
He thought to himself,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.140
'Isn't there a not-yet-colonised nation somewhere

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.300
which is so underdeveloped

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.580
that the people would be defending themselves against our tanks with literal bows and arrows

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.500
and wooden spears?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.080
Oh there is?

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.700
Fantastic!'

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.860
And so he took it.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.760
Italy also wanted to control the entrance to the Adriatic Sea.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.020
So they occupied Albania.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.700
Then, in another incident that was maybe staged by the Japanese,

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.240
gunfire was exchanged by Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.300
And the Japanese launched yet another invasion against China.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.040
They swept through Beijing and Shanghai,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.460
and then advanced through the Yangtze Valley to China's then-capital, Nanking.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.640
It was here that saw the worst of Japan's shocking atrocities

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.480
committed against the Chinese people.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.000
Back in Europe, Germany and Italy made their relationship status official

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.320
by signing the Pact of Steel.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.360
Then, Hitler turned his eyes towards Poland,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.980
and the hated Polish Corridor splitting Germany in two.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.280
At this point, the Allies really had to put their foot down.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.180
And they warned him that an invasion of Poland

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.020
would mean war.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.300
Hitler had planned to continue his advance eastward,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.280
but he didn't want to end up fighting a war on two fronts.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.300
So for now he made an alliance with Stalin, saying,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.900
'How about we both invade Poland and split it between the two of us,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.320
and I definitely won't not refrain from not betraying you sometime in the future.'

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.640
'Sounds...

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:27.900
good.'

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.920
This new alliance stunned the West.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.180
On the 1st of September 1939,

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.540
German troops entered Poland,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.200
and Britain and France declared war on Germany.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.380
The Poles fought hard,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.500
but they were no match for the two giants crashing down on them from either side.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.520
Then came a period known as 'The Phony War',

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.500
where everyone just sort of sat around not doing much.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.640
The French had launched a small invasion into the Saar Land,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.460
but they maintained mostly defensive positions,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.340
and after a while decided to just turn around and call it a day.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.540
Speaking of France,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.940
the French were still super proud of their victory in WW1.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.420
And they hadn't really moved on from it.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.660
They still used horses,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.380
they dispatched messages by motorbike instead of using the radio,

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.720
orders from the commander-in-chief were usually pretty vague,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.640
and the troops were rarely inspected.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.200
They built a line of defenses along their German border,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.220
but didn't bother extending it all the way to the Channel,

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.420
and they wouldn't launch artillery strikes against Germany

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.100
out of fear of being retaliated against.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.100
In a war.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.880
They didn't want to attack the enemy.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.840
And at first, the UK wasn't much better.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.000
Chamberlain still naively hoped that the war could be ended diplomatically.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.820
Instead of bombing raids, the RAF dropped propaganda leaflets over German cities,

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.520
which one air marshall said likely did nothing but provide the continent with toilet paper

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.720
for the duration of the war.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.880
They also only sent 200,000 men to France,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.480
while the French had mobilised millions.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.520
Both Britain and France wanted to avoid a repeat of the First World War,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.180
and so they wanted to keep the war as far from home as possible.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.880
So they turned their eyes north,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.040
towards Norway.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.460
Neutral Sweden was exporting iron ore to Germany,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.260
through neutral Norway.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.460
So the Allies asked them if they could please stop exporting iron ore to Germany.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.860
But this request was refused.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.840
Then, the Soviet Union attacked Finland.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.400
So the Allies said, 'How about we land troops in Norway

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.960
and move them across Sweden to go help out your good pal Finland?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.500
And then along the way maybe take control of all your iron fields.'

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.060
But Norway and Sweden still said no.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.900
So the UK mined the waters around Norway

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.340
to force any transport ships into international waters,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.740
and they also attacked a German tanker they found in the area.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.560
Hitler realised what the Allies were up to,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.700
and he quickly moved to secure his supply of iron ore.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.900
He launched an invasion through Denmark into Norway.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.240
The Allies rushed to land troops at quay ports along the coast,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.520
but Germany had taken control of Norway's airfields,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.660
and their air superiority decided to fight.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.340
The Allies had to retreat.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.160
After this slightly embarrassing failure,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.140
Chamberlain resigned.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.900
And was replaced with Winston Churchill,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.220
who had a slightly different approach to dealing with the Germans.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.720
Hitler's overall strategy was similar to Germany's WW1 strategy.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.120
Attack France, defeat France, knocking out the UK in the process,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.300
then turn on the Soviet Union and win the war.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.520
During the Phony War, the Allies had given Hitler enough time to prepare his forces.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.320
Now, he was ready to attack.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.340
The Allies had wanted to place troops in Belgium,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.440
but Belgium had refused.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.480
And in a move that surprised pretty much no one,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.920
Hitler launched an invasion to get around France's defenses.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.800
The Allies charged into Belgium at full speed,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.180
to meet the German invasion head-on,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.360
and it looked like a repeat of the First World War was coming.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.440
But this time, Hitler had a trick up his sleeve.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.320
Blitzkrieg.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.320
As the Germans advanced, they sent thousands of refugees westward,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.520
slowing down the Allies.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.540
Then, to the south,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.560
the French had left the Ardennes, an area filled with hills and forests,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.600
pretty under-defended,

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.440
because they thought it was naturally impenetrable.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.380
Well, the Germans were about to penetrate it with everything they had.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.200
They smashed 50 Wehrmacht divisions through,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.280
and encircled the Allied armies at lightning speed.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.460
The best of the Allied forces were now trapped.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.260
The Germans squeezed in from all sides,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.820
taking out France's best armies,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.420
and nearly wiping out the British, too.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.420
But they managed to make a desperate last-minute escape at Dunkirk,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.200
with British civilian ships even making the perilous journey to bring their young men home.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.120
With most of the French forces depleted,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.660
the Germans breezed through,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.380
taking Paris, and France fell.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.320
What the Germans couldn't do in WW1,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.300
Hitler had done just like that.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.360
Hitler hoped that with the fall of France,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.420
the UK would also lose hope and sue for peace.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.100
But quite annoyingly, it didn't.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.980
And he needed to secure the Western Front.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.720
So he tried to force them into submission,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.700
with mind games.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.520
The UK were now all alone and Hitler wanted to emphasise that.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.180
First of all, just before France fell,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.140
Italy finally declared war on the Allies,

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.260
making the UK's situation even worse.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.660
Next, instead of just occupying all of France,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.800
Hitler occupied the coastal areas for defense,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.900
but allowed France to continue its existence as a German puppet state.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.200
This way, it looked like the UK's old ally had decided to switch sides.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.980
Hitler also hoped that the UK wouldn't attack

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.620
any of her old ally's navy bases or colonies in Africa,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.780
giving Hitler an extra line of defense to the south.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.580
But the UK made sure to respond to this by sailing down to France's navy base in Algeria

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.740
and wrecking a bunch of ships.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.880
So, have at it.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.040
Hitler then began laying down plans for an invasion of Great Britain.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.980
Before German troops could land on British soil, he would first need air and naval superiority

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.780
across the Channel.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.200
Waves of German bombers came,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.020
while the completely outnumbered RAF worked bravely around the clock

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.860
in an attempt to quell the German attacks.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.280
At first, the Luftwaffe targeted British ports and coastal facilities,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.640
then it attacked RAF bases,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.760
crippling the RAF's ability to defend the nation.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.320
And it looked like Hitler's great British invasion was coming.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.720
But then, Churchill ordered a small, pretty insignificant bombing raid over Berlin.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.820
It didn't do much damage,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.200
but Hitler was furious,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.980
and he immediately ordered the Luftwaffe

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.700
to refocus its attacks on civilian targets in London.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.220
Children were sent off to the countryside,

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.180
away from their parents,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.900
to avoid danger.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.620
And frequent trips to air-raid shelters became a daily occurrence.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.020
But British morale held firm.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.160
Smiling, knitting, lounging casually,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.680
these people have balls of steel.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.900
This refocusing on London also gave the RAF

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.140
breathing space to reorganise.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.960
So Hitler kind of shot himself in the foot there.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.240
Just the foot for now.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.440
Finally, the Luftwaffe sent one massive all-out attack on London,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.280
and the RAF successfully repelled it,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.900
destroying many of the German aircraft,
