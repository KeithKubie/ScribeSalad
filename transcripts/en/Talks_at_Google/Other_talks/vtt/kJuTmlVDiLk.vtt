00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.740
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Hey, everybody.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.109
I'm super excited to do the intro here today.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.680
As you know, we have Cirque doing a performance
for us.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.540
We're going to have, apparently, the Balance
Goddess.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.470
I'm tempted to try my stab at it first here.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.380
I was told very explicitly that I'm not to
touch any of the -- back here, but it's very

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.699
tempting, I have to confess.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.560
I'm going to have to resist as best I can.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.619
So we have Lili Chao.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.170
She is the Balance Goddess.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.399
And we have Jamie Reilly, the manager of Cirque,
here who will come up and talk afterward.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:02:09.539
So without further ado, please welcome the
Balance Goddess up to the stage.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:13:29.910
[ Cheers and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: You don't have to take those

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.910
away.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.170
I'll put it up again.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:37.149
[ Laughter ]
Sorry about that slip-up at the end.

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:46.779
Anyway, how about another big round of applause
for the Balance Goddess.

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:55.879
[ Applause ]
And Jamie Reilly is going to come up and tell

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.079
us more about Cirque.

00:13:57.079 --> 00:13:59.589
Come on up.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:04.579
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Thank you very much.

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:08.170
Wow, so how about that, huh?

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.430
The Balance Goddess of Amaluna.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.290
It's really a phenomenal act, really.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.079
I've been with the show since its creation,
so I've had the chance and the opportunity

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:25.399
to see the Balance Goddess, as we like to
call her in our world, hundreds of times,

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:26.399
really.

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:31.170
And I can tell you, I never get tired of seeing
it, and I am enthralled every single time

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.350
I watch it.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.899
When people come to the show or when I talk
about Amaluna -- which ironically, enough,

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:41.209
I'm not going to do a lot of today, but just
a side note, when people come and ask me what

00:14:41.209 --> 00:14:45.529
we have in the show and so on, I usually try
not to talk too much about the Balance Goddess

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:50.730
because I like to try to keep the "wow" factor
and the surprise effect that comes with this

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.260
amazing act.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.899
And I always make one promise, and the promise
that I make is that at the end of the act,

00:14:57.899 --> 00:15:03.199
in the Big Top which holds 2600 people, nobody
will be breathing.

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:06.860
And I can make that promise because I'm sure
none of you were breathing by the time she

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.959
finished.

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:11.490
And I know that I'll be right and I'm very
confident when I make that promise.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:17.649
And to be able to have one artist on stage
that can capture 2600 people night after night,

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:22.100
we do 300-some-odd shows a year, is phenomenal
in itself.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.290
So, well, a few notes on Lili Chao and the
Balance Goddess.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.649
To start off, I guess I'm just going to come
out and say it.

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:38.610
I was very excited to be working on a presentation
that I was going to come and talk to you about.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:43.370
I'm also a bit nervous, to be very honest
with you, because I admire a lot what you

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.370
guys do.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.100
So I'm going to come out and say it.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.189
I love Google.

00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:50.550
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.730
Yes.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.939
I'm a very frequent user of Google.

00:15:54.939 --> 00:15:59.950
Google plays as much of a role in my life
as does a fork and a knife, a pencil or a

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.950
toothbrush.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.220
For me, Google is really a tool for life.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:09.490
I believe that your site is the best, and
really the only place to access information

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.189
of whatever kind I need.

00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:17.499
No matter what I'm looking for, you will make
it easy for me to locate, you will make it

00:16:17.499 --> 00:16:22.029
relevant for me -- you will ensure that it's
relevant for me; sorry.

00:16:22.029 --> 00:16:24.720
You are my one-stop-info-shop.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.000
You have changed the way I live, the way I
work, the way I learn, converse, even the

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.079
way I think.

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:35.399
But when I recently visited your campus a
few weeks ago, I began to learn that there

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.740
are other sides of Google which I find profoundly
exciting.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:44.509
Your ever-increasing interest in the latest
technologies, robotics, neural networking,

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:46.939
social prediction, wearable technology.

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:51.209
Which by the way, I got the opportunity of
wearing the Google Glass at lunch today.

00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:52.970
Very, very cool.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.200
Self-driving car, gene sequencing and so on.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.160
You guys know the list much better than I
do.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.960
You could say if it's weird and out there,
Google wants a piece.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.750
I, too, have the great fortune to work for
a company which I believe to be the most innovative

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.960
in its field, Cirque du Soleil.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.510
Perhaps we could say that Cirque du Soleil
does for the circus arts what Google does

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.110
for the search engine.

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:20.800
Both companies started from a simple idea
and grew to define the parameters of their

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:27.260
industry, carving an indelible place for themselves,
becoming the companies that are often imitated,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.620
but never equaled.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.270
Google is most definitely a courageous company.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:37.580
You are not at all afraid to take a leap into
the unknown, to risk and sometimes to fail.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.890
In fact, it seems to me that you are not at
all afraid of failure; that you simply see

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.930
it as a necessary step on the road to success.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.540
This fact really stuck with me and really
got me to thinking.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:56.180
In the circus world, nothing is achieved without
first failing time and time again.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.300
No juggler ever juggled with six balls without
dropping them thousands of times.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:07.150
No flying acrobat ever did a triple back somersault
without missing his catcher over and over

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.150
again.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:13.450
And I can tell you that even with a net, it
really sucks to fall from 30 meters.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.640
[ Laughter ]
It's true.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.490
So I began to see that Google and the circus
world have a lot in common.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:25.130
In fact, I would go as far as to say that
Google and the performing arts not only share

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.810
a fair bit of DNA but are also deeply connected.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.940
At first glance our two industries could not
seem further apart.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.630
The performing arts and technology.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:41.190
The performing arts are all about human expression,
the mapping and communication of emotion,

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.760
story-telling, the planting of a seed in the
audience evoking the desired response from

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.110
them.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.340
When the curtain comes down on "Romeo and
Juliet," the director hopes that there are

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.960
tears in the eyes of the audience.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:59.030
When the symphony fades, the composer hopes
to have touched the audience in some way.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:05.950
When the ballet ends, the dancer hopes that
his or her story -- or dance, body, sorry,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.720
has told a story that will stay with the audience
forever.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.770
So what is technology?

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:18.430
This was a tough question for me so I turned
to my friend Google and I began my research.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:24.720
The Oxford English Dictionary defines technology
as the use of science to solve problems.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:31.240
Now, when I look at what you guys do, I found
this definition to be very narrow, too utilitarian.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.250
I think we need to look further afield to
have a better grasp of understanding of the

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.450
phenomenon of technology.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.560
So I thought of looking at what the philosophers
thought.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.280
Aristotle described technology as completing
or enhancing what nature was unable to finish.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.280
Wow!

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.300
He really thought of you guys; right?

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.590
Technology takes on a noble purpose, enhancing
and completing the work of Mother Nature.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:01.500
Suddenly, writing computer code begins to
take on an almost God-like dimension.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.710
The philosopher John Dewey said that technology
looks for solutions to problems by questioning

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.140
the nature of the problem itself.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.020
Now, I like this definition.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.460
This different understanding of technology
brings us closer to the ancient Greek root

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.500
of the world.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:23.330
The -logy part comes from the Greek word logia,
meaning study, such as psychology is the study

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.710
of the psyche.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:31.560
The tech part of the word also comes from
the Greek, technia, meaning art or skill.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.040
It can also be understood to mean the way
something is done.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.821
So this brings us to a whole different understanding
and definition of technology and one that

00:20:40.821 --> 00:20:48.080
I find a lot more interesting: The study of
the art, the skill, the way something is done.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.490
I like this definition.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:55.950
Instead of looking at it purely from a scientific
point of view, we can begin to see technology

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:02.970
as having a seat at the table of the humanities,
alongside language, literature, philosophy,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.220
and of course our old friend, the performing
arts.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.900
It is no longer simply a branch of science
at the disposal of industry to find ways to

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.210
make things more quickly and more cheaply.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:21.190
We begin to see technology as a human expression
born from our curiosity and the wish to improve

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.200
ourselves, addressing that burning desire
to understand -- to advance our understanding,

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.390
creating something that never existed simplicity
because we can.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.910
However you choose to describe them, the arts
and technology have always gone hand in hand.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:41.570
The oldest art form so far discovered is a
painting of a disk and a hand on the wall

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.720
of a cave in Castillo, Spain.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.860
It is at least 40,800 years old and this very
work was made possible by a technological

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.280
advancement, the discovery of paint.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.020
The chisel was the most advanced technology
of its time and allowed sculptors to sculpt,

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.440
Da Vinci to create his David.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:07.720
Munch's "Scream" would never have been painted
if the paintbrush hadn't been invented.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.470
It goes without saying that film and technology
have long gone hand in hand.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:17.410
The earliest special effects -- stop motion,
time lapse, dissolve -- were all technological

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.670
advances.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.880
From there to Avatar, film and technology
have been inseparable.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.720
In our industry, in the circus world, technology
also plays a key role.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.250
This is in obvious ways like advances in lighting,
sound, projection and set design.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.370
But there are less obvious ways in which Cirque
du Soleil and the world of technology are

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.660
deeply connected.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:47.380
In order to make hats and wigs for our artists,
we need to have a model of their head.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.840
In the past, this has involved long and strenuous
process for our artists because we did a plaster

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.710
model of their head, basically.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.870
They had Vaseline in their eyes and straws
up their nose.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:04.710
The advent and the arrival of 3D printing
technology made our artists' lives a lot easier

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.670
and Cirque's processes a lot more efficient.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.960
We use the latest medical technology to ensure
our artists get the best possible medical

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.760
care and treatment for their injuries.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:22.360
We also tap into the latest trends in athletic
performance assessment to optimize our artists'

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.300
physical conditioning.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.730
Each year, we develop new acrobatic figures
and acts as advances in technology allow the

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.720
human body to go further, to do more, and
to reach higher.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:42.150
30 years ago, a group of young street artists
in a small town near Quebec had a simple idea.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.860
They wanted to reinvent the circus.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.400
30 years later, I think we can all agree that
that's exactly what they did.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.390
To understand the contemporary circus, it's
important to have an understanding of the

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.010
history of the traditional circus.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:02.860
Circus as we know it today, performed in the
round, in a tent or an reason in a, displays

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:09.540
feats of human and animal skills, amazement
of the audience through defying the laws of

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:15.950
gravity, jugglers, acrobats, clowns and so
on, has been around since the 1700s.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:20.260
The heyday of the circus industry lasted from
the end of the 19th century well into the

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.980
middle of the 20th century.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.750
The traveling circus brought entertainment
to the cities and towns of the world.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.360
It showcased wild and exotic animals.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.080
It left audiences in wonder with its incredible
acts it presented.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.040
For many decades, the circus was the only
form of entertainment to which people had

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.040
access.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.590
The arrival of film and then television was
a death sentence to the circus world.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.740
Suddenly, amazement was available every Saturday
afternoon for the price of a movie ticket.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:56.920
By the 1960s, circus audiences were falling,
and the once great circuses of North America

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.080
and Europe were slipping into decay.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.010
Only few would survive.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:07.020
In the 1980s, a new kind of circus began to
take shape in a few places around the world.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.960
It was no longer in tents but on street corners.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.080
Young jugglers, fire breathers and stilt walkers
were taking over the cities.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.300
Montreal was no exception.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.870
A group of young street artists called themselves
Le Club des Talons Hauts, which means the

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.640
High Heels Club, because they were all stilt-walkers.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.580
They were dedicated to the circus arts and
believed that circus could live again and

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.850
gain a new place among the performing arts.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:36.410
All that was needed was a new way of looking
at it.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:41.950
Two members of the group, Guy Laliberte and
Daniel Gauthier, decided to take a next scary

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:42.950
step.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.890
They decided to put together a full circus
show.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:52.800
And in 1984, the first production of Cirque
du Soleil was born.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.840
To show you a little bit of the evolution
of Cirque du Soleil in the past 30 years,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:24.250
I brought a little video to share with you.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:27:15.620
[ Video playing ]

00:27:15.620 --> 00:29:24.950
[ Video ends ]
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: "Impossible is just a word."

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:30.300
I'm sure this speaks to you guys a lot as
well; right?

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.990
[ Applause ]
I've seen this video a gazillion times and

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.930
I never get tired of watching it myself.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.610
I get goose bumps every single time.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:44.960
Today, Cirque du Soleil has 19 shows performing
worldwide to an audience of 15 million people

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.080
a year.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.610
We employ 4,000 technicians and professionals.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.730
We have 1300 artists in our companies.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.060
We have made movies and television shows.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.770
We have designed nightclubs.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.110
We have performed at the Oscars.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.460
Actually, we did that twice.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.590
We have won countless awards and critical
acclaim.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:10.140
In fact, it seems like the only accolade we're
missing a Google doodle in our honor.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.920
[ Laughter ]
Hint, hint.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.170
Despite all of this achievement, despite the
company's size and complexity, Cirque du Soleil

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.120
has not lost a sense of its roots.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.990
In some way, each of us still feels like a
street performer.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.500
We have never forgotten that our audience
is at the heart of our company and that we

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.540
have a mission that goes beyond the simple
"business of show;" the mission being to invoke

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:43.560
the imagination, provoke the senses, and evoke
the emotions of people around the world.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.360
I wonder if this story rings true to you because
I think it should.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.720
As I researched your company, by Googling
Google, I learned that Cirque and Google is

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.310
some things in common.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.470
Both were born from the simple idea of two
friends.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.710
Both companies revolutionized their industry.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.010
Both have a very strong sense of mission and
purpose.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:08.500
Both believe in doing business without doing
evil.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.840
Both keep their customer at the core of their
activities.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.240
Both believe in doing more than great in reaching
excellence.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.160
Someone asked me recently why 15 million people
a year take the time and spend the money to

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.860
see a Cirque du Soleil show, and I really
had to think about that question for a while.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.070
Is it the beautiful, evocative music?

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.850
Is it the stories we tell?

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:34.020
Or the stunning aesthetics of our shows, the
sets, the lights, the costumes?

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.450
Or could it be the magical dream-like quality
of our productions?

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:43.310
Now, I think all of these ring true and play
a key role in our connectedness with our audience,

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:48.200
but I don't believe any of them reaches the
core of what we do and why we have been embraced

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.990
by audiences worldwide.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:55.130
The first time I saw a Cirque du Soleil show
was more than 20 years ago in Montreal.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:32:01.710
I sat and watched Alegria, a show that celebrated
the energy, the passion, the grace, and power

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.710
of youth.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.000
I was transfixed.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.560
On that night, I began an emotional relationship
with the company that has not ended to this

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.610
day.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:15.820
That unique emotional relationship is what
I believe brings our audiences back time after

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.780
time to see our shows.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.770
They are drawn into our world.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:25.110
They allow us to touch their imagination,
their senses, and their emotion.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:29.410
This is a great responsibility, shared by
most artists.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:36.330
Having such access to people's innermost stuff
is a great privilege and a great responsibility.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.350
We must not take our art lightly.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:44.620
We must be committed and serious in our pursuit
of the beautiful, the aesthetic.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.660
But Google, too, has developed a unique relationship
with the world, one which makes ours pale

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.880
in comparison.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.270
You have become an integral part of the lives
of billions of people.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:59.180
You are as important to them as the knife
and fork, the pencil, or the toothbrush.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.590
You have caused a new verb to be born.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.510
We no longer look something up.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.820
We Googled it.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:12.470
In 2013, the human race ran -- and I'm going
to read this -- 2 trillion, 161 billion, 531

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.280
million Google searches.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.630
When I saw that number, I couldn't even say
it.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:21.390
I had to Google "how to say big numbers,"
and that's a true story.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.630
I don't have a good sense of the sheer size
of that number but I can tell you one thing

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.300
for sure without the slightest doubt.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.820
That number means that no matter what your
job here is at Google, what you do every day

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.690
is not trivial.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.480
What you do is more than important.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.580
It is fundamental, society-forming.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.720
You are changing the world around you.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.250
You are changing the human race.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.770
You are challenging how things are by exploring
how things can be.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.030
You are information jugglers.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.510
You are contortionists of the possible.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.280
You are acrobats of invention.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.070
You are magicians.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.090
You are technological artists.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:05.430
A recent Time magazine article described Google
-- therefore, all of you -- as increasingly

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.430
strange.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.179
Well, as --
[ Laughter ]

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:14.040
As a circus person, I don't mind telling you
that I like the look of strange.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.080
In my world, strange meaning so bendy that
you can sit on your own head!

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.530
It means being able to balance on a high-wire,
to fly through the air with millimetric precisions

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.760
into the hands of a catcher.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.060
It means being a clown, evoking laughter from
tears.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:35.620
It means being a nomad, rootless, homeless,
wandering the roads of the world.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.620
If in the Google world being strange means
being courageous and edgy, pushing the limits

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:46.100
of the human condition, striving to find ways
to make the human experience better, then

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.340
go for it.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.240
Be strange.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.680
Celebrate your strangeness, your Googlyness.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.470
Thank you very much.

00:34:54.470 --> 00:35:02.940
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Thank you.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.180
And I think we have a little time for questions.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.950
So if people want to come up to mics here.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.360
I don't know, do we have a Dory thing going?

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.360
No.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.360
Just questions at the mics.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.460
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Any questions?

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.440
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Come on up.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.440
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.830
Bonjour, Jamie.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.830
From one French Canadian, it always makes
me happy to see Cirque du Soleil whenever

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.890
they perform.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:30.740
My question to you Google is a company that's
built by the people that work here.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:36.390
And for Cirque du Soleil, as someone who did
gymnastics, my mother is a gymnast from Montreal,

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:40.390
it never occurred to me that, like, Cirque
du Soleil is something you can join or do.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.620
So I'm kind of curious how you recruit all
the coaches, all the technicians, all the

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.640
artists that you find.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.400
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Very good question.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:53.200
There are various ways in which one can join
Cirque du Soleil.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.970
Because we have a very good brand name, we're
lucky because we receive a lot of resumés,

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.690
videos, proposals of all kinds, really.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.770
[ Laughter ]
We also work very similarly to professional

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:10.990
sport, so we do have scouting teams that will
go around the world from the Olympics to gymnastic

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:16.290
competitions and so on to recruit talent from
a very young age, of course.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:21.270
We will hold casting calls, so very similar
to the movie world, in various strategic places

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:26.670
around the world where people will come and
present what they can do.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.930
And those, I would say, are the main ways
that we recruit people at Cirque.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.110
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Do you want to try something
up here right now?

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.270
It's a great chance.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.090
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would need a waiver or something to

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.530
do that I think, so no.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.450
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.450
Anybody got an act?

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.860
This is your big chance to join the Cirque.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.980
All right.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.980
A question.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.360
&gt;&gt;Cliff Redeker: A question but no act.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.070
Could you describe the origins of Amaluna
and how the piece actually became created?

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.970
Did people search for an act first or a plot
first?

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.530
How is the genesis of the show?

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:01.920
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Absolutely.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.281
So first and foremost, Amaluna is a show that
celebrates or showcases women, which is a

00:37:08.281 --> 00:37:10.490
first in the history of Cirque du Soleil.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.740
It's the 32nd production of Cirque.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.620
We're just about to be two years old so we're
still a very young show.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.720
We have a cast of 70% women, which includes
an all-female band, which is also a first

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.720
for us at Cirque.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.990
So we're certainly very proud of that.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.950
Amaluna was directed by Diane Paulus, who
was actually here a few months ago, I believe,

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.860
doing a Google Talk, if memory serves me right.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:37.220
Diane is a very famous female on Broadway,
so I like to say that Diane brought the theater

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.890
to the circus.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:44.670
She was very much inspired by "The Tempest"
from Shakespeare, Greek mythology, "The Magic

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:48.670
Flute" from Shakespeare, and has done a mashup
of those elements.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:54.100
And of course because we showcase women, instead
of having a Prospero we have a Prospera, who

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.040
is the queen of the island.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.450
Once we do a creation, it's a very organic
process, so it's not defined by saying we

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:06.810
look for acts that fit in the story or vice
versa.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.270
Creation is something that's very organic
as I'm sure you can all understand.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:16.450
So there are certain acts or certain elements
that we knew we wanted going into this production

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:21.600
and others that came about in the evolution
of the creative process.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.960
We stumble on things, make new discoveries,
and creating a Cirque du Soleil show or a

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:31.720
big-top show, I should say, at Cirque starts
four years before a world premier.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:36.220
So it takes a long time, and it's -- there's
a lot of evolution, of course, that will happen

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.760
throughout that four-year time period.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.020
&gt;&gt;Sammie Baime: Hi there.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.470
Thanks so much for attending today.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.470
This is amazing.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:52.420
I wanted to just ask how long on average do
shows stay on tour for?

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.340
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Another very good question.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:59.230
One of the very unique elements of Cirque
du Soleil in the entertainment world is that

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:05.560
we do not reproduce our shows, contrary to
Broadway or other theatrical productions.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:12.490
So our shows -- we retired Alegria a few months
ago, and Alegria was almost 20 years old.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:17.310
Mystere is still going strong in Vegas, and
they're already 20 years old.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:23.190
So because we don't reproduce our shows, it
allows us to keep them alive and performing

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.610
for many, many years.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:30.940
So I would say between 15 and 20 years is
more or less the life span of a show with

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.380
Cirque.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.820
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.680
I always wondered about the ideation process
that you use at Cirque.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:44.360
Like the beginning of "O," when I first saw
"O" almost 20 years ago, the entire curtain

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.670
gets pulled up into the balloon, and I just
wondered how on Earth would you come up with

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.890
that idea and how do you make sure that you
can come up with ideas that are impossible

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.250
and pursue them?

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.531
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: That's a very good question,
and it's one that's very hard to answer, because

00:39:58.531 --> 00:40:02.060
again of how organic everything is.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.330
To talk about "O" specifically, I remember
when Guy came to the office one day, and they

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.860
were in the creation process Dralion, which
was another one of our big-top shows.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.390
When we were in the full creation process,
he showed up at the office one morning and

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.820
he said, "I want to do a show with water."

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.860
And everybody around the table looked at him
and said, well, that's never going to happen.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.860
How are we going to do that?

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.130
And he said, "I don't care.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:23.790
We're going to create a show with water."

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:27.880
But I think it's really more about looking
at all these elements and we could talk about

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.650
this for hours but it's about coming back
again to the core values of the company and

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.810
saying that there are no bad ideas.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.540
Everything is explored.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.100
And impossible is just a word.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.990
We live by that every single day.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.530
Just with Amaluna as well, we have a water
bowl on stage that sits on the traveling stage

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.900
and when it's full of water it weighs 7,000
pounds to give you an idea.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:55.440
When we call an engineer and say hey, we need
a traveling stage and it needs to hold 7,000

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.140
pounds, everybody said that's impossible.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.140
It's never going to happen.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.140
And we said no?

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.370
Well we'll call the next Guy if you don't
want to did this because we're not taking

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.900
no for an answer.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:09.380
So having that at the core of our values am
allows us to explore the impossible.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.380
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.670
Thanks for coming.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:18.180
So you have been involved with it for 20 years,
so I'd love to hear how the audiences have

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.490
changed and how your shows have changed accordingly.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.390
So what you're launching now versus 20 years
ago.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.580
Is there more action?

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.070
Are you expecting people like here to take
a bunch of photos during it?

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.830
I would love to hear.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:30.330
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Another very good question.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.130
You ask very good questions.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:37.360
I think we're actually now in a place at Cirque
where we're starting to explore all of that.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.290
We're starting to understand the world is
pushing the boundaries around us and that

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:45.850
we need to find ways to adapt to that, might
it be with taking pictures during our shows,

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:51.290
while, of course, keeping our artists safe
because that is our number one priority.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:57.800
Amaluna, which is a very recent production,
when we were in the process and we had a composer

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.970
for the music, the first time Guy listened
to it, we all thought the music was fabulous;

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:03.970
right?

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.350
And Guy said, "I don't like this music," and
we were all a bit surprised because we were

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.400
like, "Well, we all like it.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.190
We were sure you were going to like it, Guy."

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.300
And he said, "No.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:16.040
We've done this a gazillion times in all of
our shows," the more new-world, new-age type

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.040
of music.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.771
So he says, "I want something completely different."

00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:23.750
And from then and on, we went into a completely
different direction, and for those of you

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:29.330
who have seen, or those who haven't, certainly
hope you will get the opportunity to see it,

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.340
the music is rock with a techno edge.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.750
We've gone completely in a different direction,
and you certainly do feel that freshness,

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.750
and so on.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:42.400
But one of the greatest challenges in a company
that is now 30 years old and has the size

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.780
of Cirque is to keep pushing those boundaries
within the parameters that we have and to

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.780
make sure that we are continuously reinventing
ourselves.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.220
And as the years go, the more difficult that's
becoming.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:59.820
So recently we've announced that we're starting
a new theater division within the company,

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.390
and we're relooking a little bit at how the
company is structured.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:08.700
And the reason we're doing that is to be able
to address all of those burning questions

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:18.140
and to be able to ensure that we remain innovative
in 2014.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.330
&gt;&gt;&gt; How many mistakes are made, on average?

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.850
Like has the Balance Goddess ever sneezed?

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.090
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yes, absolutely.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:29.280
I don't think she's ever sneezed but she has
dropped the sticks, yes.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280
Not often.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280
Not often.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.950
But let's not forget something very important.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.140
It is live entertainment.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.869
It's live entertainment done by human beings.

00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:41.120
Little mistakes happen probably every single
night.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.930
There's never one show that's exactly the
same.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.050
That's the beauty of our art; right?

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:51.280
We'll have injuries, people out, people in
modified queues because of injuries, and so

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.060
on and so forth, that we have to deal with
on a daily basis.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:00.869
But because we hire the best in the industry,
people who come and see us usually never notice

00:44:00.869 --> 00:44:05.490
these mistakes or barely notice these mistakes
because we're very good at fixing them or

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:11.160
working around them but it remains live entertainment
at the end of the day.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.990
&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you encourage artists to continue
pushing the edge of human potential?

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.610
Do you have, like, a 20% time?

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.941
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: When you're on the road, that's

00:44:21.941 --> 00:44:27.260
very difficult to do because sometimes we'll
do up to ten shows a week and we do have limited

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.020
space in our little village.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.510
It is 65 trucks of equipment.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:37.110
But when it houses 115 people, there is so
much space you have to play with.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:42.320
But that's essential and vital to ensure that
we put on the best shows every single night.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.790
So we do encourage and support artists, and
we do -- and they're also very interested

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.690
in learning different disciplines.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.480
We have teeterboard artists currently working
and learning the husille (phonetic), which

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.980
is a completely different discipline.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:00.220
So this keeps them motivated, it keeps them
creative, it keeps them interested and dedicated

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.220
to what we do.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:06.420
So I wouldn't say it's a specific guideline
of 20% but each week we make an effort to

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.010
make sure that we have time to allow our artists
to do that.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:14.020
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Actually, I have a question
for you related to that.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.020
You mentioned the village.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:20.050
So where do all the performers and other staff
live when you're traveling for a couple months?

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.480
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Many, many years ago, in the
1990s at Cirque we lived on-site --

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.650
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: In the tent?

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.650
In the big tent?

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:30.240
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: We had trailers on-site and
that's where we stayed but we stopped doing

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.240
that.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.790
I like to say what we do is camping deluxe
at Cirque.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:38.360
We all live in corporate apartments, hotels
or extended stays.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.760
So we're very well looked after.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.260
&gt;&gt;&gt; This kind of goes back to how long your
shows will run for.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.530
If you have a show like Mystere that's been
going on for more than 20 years, how do your

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:56.060
artists and performers sustain that?

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.210
Do some come and go?

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:02.170
Does the show change a little bit because
new artists have to be brought in to kind

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:06.460
of accommodate the ones who may retire or
get injured and can't come back for some reason?

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.020
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.380
Artists will come and go.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.590
It's like anything in life.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:12.780
Some will stay for a year.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.230
Some will stay for 15 years.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:19.180
It all depends on what their wishes and desires
are or their physical ability to sustain what

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.270
it is they are doing within the show.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:27.770
One of the great things at Cirque is we're
always very adamant in not touching the integrity

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:28.770
of the show.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.000
So the main story line.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.500
However, compared to a phantom of the opera,
for example, where it's exactly the same thing

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:40.170
because it's based on a book, we do allow
room for growth.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:45.700
So we will, in some cases, bring in new acts
or different acts, and the show will continuously

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.700
evolve.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:51.370
Even Amaluna, in the last two years, we've
just recently gone over to a changeover in

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:55.410
artists, and the acts themselves are the same
but what they do is different.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:01.060
So this is an effort and a growing, living
organism, if you wish, that we work on every

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.060
day to sustain.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.060
So they do evolve quite a bit.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.600
You can see it in a year and think, oh, my
God, that was very different from what I saw

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.600
last time.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.369
But the core of it will be the same.

00:47:11.369 --> 00:47:12.369
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:17.610
Before Cirque, it seems to me like a lot of
Big Top circuses used to rely heavily on animal

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:18.750
acts.

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:22.060
Can you speak to, I guess, why Cirque doesn't
use animals?

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.280
I think it's an amazing decision, by the way.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:30.550
But maybe was that some conscious decision
that you guys decided on in the beginning?

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.160
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yes, absolutely.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.350
We respect other circuses and the use of animals
and we respect what they do tremendously,

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:44.140
but back in 1984, when Guy and Daniel had
this vision and this idea of creating a different

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:50.530
type of circus, it was very important to Guy
and his whole idea was based on the premise

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.800
of showcasing the human body.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:59.190
In his mind, why would we use animals when
human beings can do phenomenal things?

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:02.520
And what we do at Cirque du Soleil is really
to showcase that.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.630
We're showcasing the human abilities, and
that's what we've done and that's what we

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:10.880
choose to do, which is why we'll never have
animals in our shows.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.130
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:18.590
Traditionally, the only way to watch a Cirque
show has been to go to, like, a production

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:22.900
show in Vegas or something, or be in a city
where Cirque tours.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.090
But last year, a couple of years ago you came
up with the movie.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:29.600
I'm just curious how that impacted?

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:34.200
Did it get more people interested in Cirque
du Soleil or....

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.930
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yeah, that's a good question.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:40.810
I haven't seen specific numbers on it, but
I certainly hope it has.

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:45.080
Because what's important to understand as
well, especially with our Big-Top shows, we

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.970
can't go to every city in the world.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:52.050
Our arena shows have enabled us to explore
new territories and cities, but when you're

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:57.750
traveling with 65 trucks of equipment, you
can't go to Alaska, for example, or Hawaii,

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:03.109
because it would make no financial sense whatsoever,
even though I would love to go to Hawaii,

00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:04.670
but it wouldn't work.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:09.040
So being able to do movies or television shows,
we certainly hope that this allows to reach

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.790
more people around the world in showing the
beauty of what we do at Cirque.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.050
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Wait, wait.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:15.050
Dumb question.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.050
There's a movie?

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:17.050
Does everybody know this?

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.050
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yes, there's two.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:19.710
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And they play in theaters?

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:24.900
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yes, the latest one, which
I believe was around a year ago, was at the

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.900
movies.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.900
Yes.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.280
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And was it just like a video
of a performance or does it have, like, a

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.280
movie plot?

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:35.100
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: It's really -- we brought
acts from various shows and David Cameron

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:40.810
put together and directed the latest movie
that we've put out a while ago.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:41.850
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:46.680
My question is do you also try to collect
some data to probably analyze and improve

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.680
the shows?

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.400
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yes, we do.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.140
We do that on a marketing perspective, on
a conditioning perspective.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:00.960
Our coaches and our experts continuously look
at ways and injuries and statistics so that

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.160
we gain a good understanding of what they
mean.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.620
Because in the circus world, even circuses
look to us to get that information.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:14.340
So we're sort of leading the charge in being
able to have a better understanding of what

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:19.260
doing 300 shows means on the physical body
and various disciplines and so on and so forth.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.670
We do it in marketing.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:26.960
15 million people, as I was mentioning, come
to see Cirque du Soleil every year so I think

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.280
we're the biggest entertainment company in
the world so we're trying to grasp what that

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:38.340
means and try to use the data to its full
potential, as much as we can.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.970
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit -- sorry.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.920
Can you talk a little bit about how iteration
works during the choreography process?

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.390
Do artists have very much input into what
goes on?

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.890
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yes.

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:52.070
Again, the creation process is something that's
very organic.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:58.160
So Diane Paulus had a vision, of course, when
she came along and created Amaluna.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.520
It was her first time ever working with Cirque
du Soleil and working in a Big Top, which

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.320
is a very unique venue to be in.

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:10.370
So she needed, obviously, to gain the perspective
of our artists, because even she'll have ideas

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.050
and say, "I want you to do that," and the
artist will say, "I can't" because it's not

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:18.410
possible to do a quadruple somersault or whatever
that might be.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:22.970
So the communication between the group of
artists, the choreographers and the director

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:27.900
are essential in ensuring that we build and
create the best shows possible.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:32.540
So again, it's something that's very organic,
but having that open mindedness is fundamental

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.010
in what we do.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:35.020
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:39.980
Can you speak a little bit to the different
challenges of the arena shows versus the Big

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.880
Top versus the Vegas permanent?

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.510
I've enjoyed several different kinds.

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:47.130
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Yes, you're well aware.

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:49.740
That's actually the three different types
of shows we have at Cirque.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:54.260
So we have the Big Top show in which Amaluna
is performing, which is very unique when you

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:59.530
think about it because we travel with our
own venue, with our own little village.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:05.359
We have arena format, and by this what we
mean is that we only travel with the show

00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:09.440
itself, and we go into fixed venues around
the world.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:14.160
What's interesting with the arena shows -- and
we've only started doing that around 2006

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.160
at Cirque.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:19.090
And what was interesting and what has been
amazing for us in doing that is that it really

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:24.950
has allowed us to explore new territories
that we had not been able to with big tops,

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:26.070
as I was mentioning.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:31.870
Arena shows have gone to Hawaii and to Alaska,
Eastern Europe, to the Middle East, and so

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:32.870
on and so forth.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:38.230
So it's really an amazing opportunity where
we focus more the Big Top shows in the bigger

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:44.680
markets such as here in San Francisco or San
Jose, we're off to New York after this and

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.210
Washington and Miami and all of those bigger
cities.

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:55.460
And then we have the permanent or resident
shows, which we currently have eight of in

00:52:55.460 --> 00:53:00.200
Las Vegas on the strip and one in Orlando.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.350
So obviously these are built on a much different
scale.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:11.540
And to give you an idea, Amaluna, which started
building obviously in 2011, 2010, is a $30

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.800
million production.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:20.930
Ka, in Vegas, which was created in 2004, if
memory serves me right, so almost ten years

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.910
ago, was a $65 million production.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.330
Just to give you an idea on the scale.

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:29.900
And here we're talking about shows where the
theater was built for the show.

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.470
So they are shows that will never move.

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:37.710
If you want to see occurs or Ka, you will
need to go to Vegas to see them.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:42.590
&gt;&gt;&gt; Since your performers have very physically
demanding acts, it seems like a lot of them

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:47.190
might kind of retire from Cirque early than
they might -- sort of early.

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:52.760
So I'm just wondering like what -- they spend
a lot of time developing a specific skill

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:56.110
set and it relies on physical dexterity.

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:57.501
What does it look like for them, like, when
they retire?

00:53:57.501 --> 00:54:02.240
If you were to try to generalize, what does
life after Cirque look like for a performer?

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.350
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: Absolutely.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:09.690
Well, we do have a program which we call the
Crossroad Program at Cirque which allows artists

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.109
-- where we fund artists to learn other skills.

00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:17.240
A lot of them do become coaches, obviously,
because they know their disciplines so well,

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.980
and they have done that for the majority of
them since they have been very, very young.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:25.050
A lot of them will become pilates instructors,
yoga instructors.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:31.119
And yet like anything else in life, I've worked
with artists who have done master's degrees

00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:33.550
in business while they were artists at Cirque.

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:39.700
Nowadays, again, with technology, they're
able to do all of those courses online, and

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:44.740
if they are willing, the possibilities are
endless, really.

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:48.690
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:49.690
And the last question.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:50.790
&gt;&gt;Cliff Redeker: All right.

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:55.750
I want to wrap it up and ask what's the relationship
between a touring show on the road and the

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:56.750
home headquarters in Montreal?

00:54:56.750 --> 00:55:01.260
Is there a lot of regular communication, iteration?

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:04.280
Is there a mockup of each show out in Montreal?

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.120
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: There probably -- No, I don't
think there's a mockup of each show.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.490
A lot of communication, which means that for
me, being on the West Coast, I do get up often

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:15.520
at 5:00 a.m. or 6:00 a.m. for conference calls.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:20.540
And I'm sure it's a very similar relationship
as to what you guys live here at Google, with

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:24.230
either working with satellite offices around
the world.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:29.990
Montreal, the headquarters really plays a
role in establishing the parameters, the guidelines,

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:36.410
all of the corporate services from legal to
corporate taxation and so on, sit in Montreal

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:41.420
to allow us on tour to be able to operate
and to focus on the shows.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:49.130
So they'll also support us with managing our
infrastructure, finding sites in future cities,

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:54.000
starting the permitting process as we focus
on more our day-to-day activities.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.010
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:59.470
And thank you so much for presenting here
for us today.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.470
&gt;&gt;Jamie Reilly: My pleasure.

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.160
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And for the Balance Goddess.

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:07.200
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Thank you all for coming.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.720
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And I'll see you all Thursday

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.040
afternoon.
