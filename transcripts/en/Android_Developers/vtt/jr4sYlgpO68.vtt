Hi, my name is Daniel Pham,
and welcome to "This Week In

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.350
Android Development,"
Monday, December 9, 2013.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.270
Last week my ethnic doppelganger
made his debut on camera

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.110
to provide you with
the week's updates.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.470
Our first episode of
"UXD" aired starring

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.450
Nazmul and his guest of
the week, Izabel Idris.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.385
They introduced you all to UX.

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:29.760
Stay tuned for more episodes
in this series in the coming

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.720
weeks.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.350
Lastly, Neto gave us
a translated edition

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.740
of app indexing in Portuguese.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.010
This week, Todd and Wolff
will host an episode

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.020
of "Game On" where they'll talk
about stuff that I can't really

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.540
talk to you about yet.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.519
Look for this episode
to air tomorrow.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.560
That's it for "This Week
in Android Development."
