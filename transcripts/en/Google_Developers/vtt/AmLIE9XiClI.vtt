[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.380
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Hello, my
name is Jarek Wilkiewciz.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.440
Welcome to "YouTube Developers
Live." We have an exciting

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.580
Halloween episode
for you today.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.980
In the studio, I have
Owly with me.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.790
How you doing, Owly?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.450
MARK HOLDER: [HOOTING NOISES].

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.440
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: OK.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.230
We have Greg Schechter.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.440
GREG SCHECHTER: It's good to be
here as a Civil War Union

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.770
general today.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.380
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ:
Thank you, Greg.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.990
On the Hangout, we have David
joining us from Vancouver.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.565
How are things in Vancouver,
David?

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:51.240
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: They
are very rainy.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.870
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: OK, and then
in addition to Owly, we

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.050
actually have one more person,
Mark Holder from HootSuite.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.640
Mark, you can be official now.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.140
MARK HOLDER: Official.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.820
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: All right.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.840
How you doing, Mark?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.110
MARK HOLDER: Doing very
well, doing very well.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.150
Thanks for having me.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.980
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Good, thank
you for coming down from

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.600
Vancouver, right?

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.540
MARK HOLDER: Yeah.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.720
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Cool.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.890
How long are you staying
in the Valley?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.900
MARK HOLDER: I'm going
home tonight.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.300
I came down yesterday, was in SF
over the weekend and early

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.600
this week, so it's been
a great trip.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.000
Sunshine, as opposed to rain
like David's experiencing.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.713
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Enjoying
the summer?

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:23.830
MARK HOLDER: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.290
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: All right.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.300
So we'll talk about HootSuite
and social

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.550
media management space.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.365
So for those of you that are not
familiar with the space, I

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:33.940
was thinking that perhaps we
could start with a little bit

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.830
of an introduction to what
problem you're trying to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.930
solve, what the company does,
and then talk a little bit

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.710
about your functionality as it
relates to managing YouTube.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.760
And then I know Greg wanted to
talk to David about some of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.820
the technical challenges with
integration between the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.790
HootSuite product
and YouTube API.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.020
MARK HOLDER: Sure.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.640
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Does
that sound OK to you?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.150
MARK HOLDER: Sounds great.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.140
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Cool,
so let's get started.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.590
MARK HOLDER: Sure.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.420
So for those that aren't aware
of HootSuite, HootSuite is a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.030
social media management system
largely focused to companies

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.970
and brands to help them monitor
and engage with their

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.590
communities, build campaigns
around their social media

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.690
activities.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.630
Very much heavily focused
on team collaboration.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.500
As I mentioned, it is for brands
and large companies,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.400
and so it really is based around
team collaboration and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.000
enabling teams to execute on
marketing campaigns and their

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.710
social media activities.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.330
The company was founded
back in 2008 and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.030
launched back then.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.220
I joined the team approximately
two years ago,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.380
just towards the tail
end of 2010.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.800
At that time, we were 20 to 30
employees or so, and now we're

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.760
upwards of 200, probably up
around 230, 240, so we've

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.810
experienced a lot of growth.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.150
As far as from a user-based
standpoint, we're really close

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.030
to crossing 5 million users.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.670
We've seen some really rapid
growth over the last couple

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.820
years especially.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.740
We passed 1 million just about
a month after I joined the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.380
team, so we've really
experienced some pretty quick

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.120
and rapid growth
since joining.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.340
And essentially, it is the
leading social media

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.660
management system and platform
for enterprises out there in

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.960
existence today.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.830
We're very much focused on,
as I mentioned, team

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.730
collaboration, but
also engagement.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.470
Engagement is foundational to
what we do, allowing folks to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.290
publish to multiple social
networks and social profiles,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.940
scheduling, geotargeting,
and in addition to that,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.220
monitoring as well, so the
ability to monitor all of the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.500
social profiles and channels
that you're involved with.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.310
We currently have 80% of the
Fortune 100 companies

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.990
essentially using HootSuite.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.330
And so we've had a lot of
traction there in that space,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.030
in the enterprise space, in
addition to our fro- and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.920
pre-offer--

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.300
I'm sorry-- our free
and pro offering.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.390
Our free users, we have a ton of
those and we listen to them

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.880
very closely.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.840
We also have our pro user base,
which is primarily SMBs,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.430
agencies, consultants, and that
sort of thing, and then

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.460
obviously, enterprises targeted
to large enterprises.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.450
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So how
does Owl fit into that?

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.500
MARK HOLDER: Owly
is our mascot.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.730
I'll bring him back in here.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.980
Owly is our mascot.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.550
The company name is HootSuite,
so what do owls do?

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.310
They hoot, so naturally an
owl became our mascot.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.720
And here's Owly here.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.585
jAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Is there
some sort of a Vancouver

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:30.940
connection or a Canadian
connection?

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.500
MARK HOLDER: Not that I'm
so much aware of.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.740
I mean, obviously, there's
lots of owls up there.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.130
You see them from
time to time.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.090
I don't know the full background
story on why owls

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.170
and why HootSuite, or Hoot, but
yeah, he makes a lot of

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.620
trips with us down to South by
Southwest, events such as

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.550
this, and all over the place.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.300
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Now one
question that I always have

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.280
about these types of
applications is from a user

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.870
standpoint, like how do you
manage all the different

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.860
platforms since they're
actually the very

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.730
different art forms?

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.570
You have Twitter with the short
message versus G+, where

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.520
you can have extensive posts.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.570
Like what is it that you do to
make it a little simpler?

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.440
MARK HOLDER: Yes, so on the back
end in our development

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.420
team, essentially we'll build
in the infrastructure and

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.550
support to the core product
for each of

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.330
those social networks.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.680
So whether you're publishing
a tweet to Twitter, whether

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.670
you're posting a post to
Google+, essentially it's

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.540
going to allow you to do many of
the things that you can do

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.470
from those applications
specifically, those web

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.830
applications.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.370
So with Twitter it's limited
to 140 characters.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.620
Obviously, with G+ that limit
doesn't exist, so you're able

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.640
to compose and do longer
messages as well as upload

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.460
images and that sort of thing.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.980
From a monitoring standpoint,
so HootSuite is very much

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.200
stream based--

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.490
and we'll get to that in
a little bit here--

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.510
very much a stream-based
product.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.110
And so much of what you see in
the streams is essentially

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.020
stream based and looks
very similar.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.370
But you will see some
differences

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.840
from network to network.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.160
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Do you find
that people re-target posts to

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.670
multiple social media
networks?

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.530
Or do they create separate posts
to take advantage of the

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.440
capabilities of the individual
different products?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.890
I mean, I totally get the
analytics part, where you can

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.380
do things across different
platforms.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.070
But as far as the creation of
the content, obviously, video

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.250
will be very different
than a tweet.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.450
So to what extent can people
actually simplify their

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.790
management experience?

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.330
MARK HOLDER: I think it really
depends on what they're

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.220
targeting, what audience
or what community

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.590
that they're targeting.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.670
A lot of times, if you're really
just posting to your

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.590
community on Twitter, those
messages are going to go

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.420
directly out to Twitter.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.560
If you're really looking into
developing Facebook campaigns

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.230
or campaigns around Google+,
obviously you're going to post

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.360
directly to those specific
monitors or those networks.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.050
So it really depends on what the
campaigns and the nature

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.632
of those campaigns.

00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:54.050
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: I see.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.990
Cool, cool.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.180
MARK HOLDER: Yeah, so
continuing, we have had a lot

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.610
of success.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.480
As I mentioned, we're close
to 5 million users.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.950
We've have 1.5 million messages
being sent out daily,

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.660
and that's over our web
dashboard in addition to our

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.400
mobile products.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.380
We've had more than a billion
messages sent to date.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.110
So obviously, our APIs are
functioning a lot of our

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.940
mobile products in the dash.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.190
And so there's a ton of activity
and traction and

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.290
messaging going out through
those channels, all the social

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.640
profiles that we support.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.570
You can see a list of them
here on this slide to the

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.630
right, most of the major guys
we're partnered with, as well

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.610
as our app directory, which I'll
get to, which basically

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.480
enables us to create a lot
of these partnerships and

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.760
integrations beyond the ones
that we support natively.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.190
We're also very much focused on
localization and supporting

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.750
the different markets
and regions and

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.520
languages out there.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.320
So we're very much
focused on being

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.970
localized to multiple languages.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:00.410
And I think our community team,
led by Dave Olson, he is

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.250
very much focused on this, and
it's a big key priority for

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.810
him to really focus on
translating the dash into

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.210
multiple languages.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.950
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Do you support
any of the regional

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.460
social media networks in
the different geos?

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.590
Or is the set pretty much
represented here on this deck?

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.580
MARK HOLDER: We do.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.430
No, there's many.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.065
We have to date 35
app integrations

00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:22.300
into our app directory.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.100
And then we have probably 10 to
15 other integrations that

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.460
are across our native
integrations, our analytics

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.490
products, and so forth.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.710
Regarding internationally, we
have an app integration with

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.480
Orkut, that's the popular
Brazilian social network.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.520
We also have Viadeo,
Xing from Germany.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.049
Viadeo's from France.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.720
We actually just released a Sina
Weibo app-- and I know

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.430
I'm pronouncing the
Weibo word wrong.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.770
But that's a Chinese-speaking
social network, so we've

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.880
integrated with them recently.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.690
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Cool, cool.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.850
So how did you get into social
media management?

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.840
I know that you're
originally from

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.990
Southern California, right?

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.760
MARK HOLDER: Yes, I am from
Southern California.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.930
I've always been very much
focused and interested in

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.430
social media ever since it
came into existence, very

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.720
interested in tech in general,
and gadgets, and

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.370
that sort of thing.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.290
So I moved up to Vancouver
about five years ago from

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.820
Southern California,
met Ryan through--

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.000
Ryan Holmes, our CEO--

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.810
through a mutual friend.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.460
And this was back a couple years
ago, when things were

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.260
really starting to ramp
up for HootSuite.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.250
And he had this vision and this
idea of an app directory,

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.920
and becoming more and more a
platform, essentially, a

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.980
social media management
system.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.460
And so at that time, that was
about a year before we

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.800
actually launched our app
directory, which YouTube was

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.960
one of our launch partners
and launch integrations.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.560
So much of my time was really
spent reaching out to

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.360
developers, potential partners,
and just really

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.050
creating interest in the
developer communities and

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.090
ecosystem, and getting
people interested in

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.580
working with HootSuite.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.030
We had an SDK at that time,
which we do now, and we've got

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.390
a lot of new really cool things
you can do with the SDK

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.580
since that date.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.700
It's been two years, but we
added a lot of cool things

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.390
based on feedback we received
from developers and partners

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.740
and our users as well.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.050
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So this is a
good segue about the product

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:16.580
architectures.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.030
So you mentioned that
you have an SDK.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.120
So the actual individual
integrations can be done by

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.100
third-party developers, or are
they all done in-house?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.680
Like how does the split work?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.130
MARK HOLDER: That's right.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.220
So we originally developed the
whole app directory idea and

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.680
framework and SDK to make
it relatively easy and

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.000
straightforward for third-party
developers and

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.390
partners to build into the
HootSuite system, to actually

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:46.360
build custom integrations that
can be integrated into

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.060
HootSuite as streams, and
available and provide

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.920
additional value to
our user base.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.990
Our internal Dev team is very
much focused on the core

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.620
product and some of the other
integrations that we have.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.430
And so they can't build out 35
individual integrations and

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.960
have those available
to our user base.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.620
So that's what the idea was
behind the app directory,

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.070
behind the SDK that supports
the app directory, is to

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.700
really get access to those
developers to have them create

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.880
some really exciting and unique
applications that can

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.940
be added to the dash.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.950
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So was that
something that you guys

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.000
thought about from the start?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.640
Or was it the accessibility was
added later on in the life

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.810
cycle of the product?

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.710
MARK HOLDER: I think probably
a bit later.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.590
For me, having joined two years
ago, that was really the

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.380
first thing that I was focused
on ion working at HootSuite,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.960
so it was new to me.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.190
But certainly, Ryan I'm sure had
had that vision, that this

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.590
is the direction he wanted
to go, is to build, and

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.230
integrate, and get a lot of
really cool tools available

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.430
for HootSuite users.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.010
On all of our plans-- free, pro,
and enterprise, they're

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.120
readily available to everybody,
but really to

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.930
become more of a platform and
to bring in developers and

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.220
partners and have them
building some

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.520
cool, unique things.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.130
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So on the
integration front, if someone

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.860
is using your product, they
can basically use your

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.420
web-based interface, which is
something that hopefully we're

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.960
going to see in a little bit.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.300
MARK HOLDER: Yes.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.810
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: And then, from
a user standpoint, are

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.790
there any APIs to, say, pool
some of the analytics

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.130
information as well?

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.570
Or is it all done through
your front end?

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.540
MARK HOLDER: So it's all
pretty much done

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.730
through the front end.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.710
Just to kind of clarify things
here, our SDK is all about

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.555
integrations into hootsuite.com,
into the

00:12:28.555 --> 00:12:32.200
HootSuite dashboard, and it's
entirely about that.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.530
Our API program, which we do
have our Engagement API that's

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.370
out there and available and you
can apply for access to

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.690
that, that's all about outbound
integrations to

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.380
third-party applications and
extending a lot of the core

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.230
HootSuite engagement
functionality to those

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.970
third-party applications.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.580
Right now, those are the only
APIs essentially that we have

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.460
out there in the wild, and I'll
provide you a link that

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.060
you can go and look into
that documentation

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.440
here in a little bit.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.100
But yeah, that's the difference
between our API

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.300
program and SDKs.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.270
So right now, it's our
engagement API

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.620
that currently exists.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.590
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Cool, cool.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.100
So should we take a look
at the product?

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.920
Is there anything else that you
wanted to cover before we

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.840
get into the demo?

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.910
MARK HOLDER: Let's
jump into it.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.300
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: All right.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:10.690
Let's do it.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.460
MARK HOLDER: How does
that sound?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.140
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Yeah.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:12.820
Let's look at the--

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.400
MARK HOLDER: Cool.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.910
So just before we get there,
some developer resources here.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.100
So we have our Dev Site, and I
encourage you all to go and

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.180
take a look at that at
hootsuite.com/developers.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:31.130
Also, documentation for our
SDK is basically at

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.250
hootsuite.com/de
velopers/app-directory, and

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.720
you can go there and learn more
about our SDK, and the

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.570
different kind of functions and
events that we provide and

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.300
access to basically tap into
some of the core HootSuite

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.180
functionality.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.937
I also encourage you to take
a look a lot of the app

00:13:45.937 --> 00:13:48.110
integrations that we have, and
obviously, the YouTube

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.490
integration, which I'll show
you here in a second.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.470
But there's some really great
stuff there, and you can get

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.130
some great ideas for
what's possible.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.030
And then for our engagement
API, it's

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.460
hootsuite.com/apis/engagement,
and you can learn a little bit

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.710
more about that there.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.900
With the actual YouTube
integration, obviously, as I

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.220
mentioned, it's available
in our app directory.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.050
You can learn more about that at
hootsuite.com/appdirectory.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.800
And so some of the
key features--

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.685
in working with the developer,
David, on this, it

00:14:17.685 --> 00:14:18.880
was a lot of fun.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.340
We spent spend several months
and weeks just thinking

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.460
through what we wanted to do and
what would be some of the

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.140
key features.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.100
We got a lot of feedback
from our users.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.380
We had a ton of requests from
our user base on exactly what

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.990
a YouTube integration
would look like.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.740
And so what we thought would
be valuable was the ability

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.730
obviously to search for and
view videos in the dash.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.960
Everybody's looking to monitor
videos that are being made

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.460
about their brand or their
company, or maybe they're just

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.400
interested in owls and
they want to at owls,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.310
cool videos of owls.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.640
So we definitely wanted to
give users the ability to

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.450
search for and view videos
on the dash.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.230
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ:
Not cat videos?

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.190
You think owls?

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.910
MARK HOLDER: Cat videos for
sure, for sure cat videos.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.770
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Owls
are the new cats?

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.540
MARK HOLDER: We like owls.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.070
We like owls, but we
like cats, too.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.790
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: I think
Greg is going to

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.960
disagree with that.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.350
GREG SCHECHTER: Well, I just
really like cat videos.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.200
They're just so much fun.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.260
MARK HOLDER: Cat videos
are amazing.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:08.840
Cat videos are amazing.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.870
But there's some really cute
owl videos out there, too.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.640
So maybe we'll take a
look at those later.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.370
So the other thing that a lot of
our users wanted to do, and

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.600
especially a lot of our brands
and companies that are

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.790
managing their YouTube profiles
on the dash, is to

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.040
view and add video comments.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.720
There's obviously videos
that they're

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.230
publishing to their channels.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.970
They want to be able to see what
people are saying about

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.890
those comments.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.770
So they can view those comments,
they can address

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.330
those comments directly from
a stream, a YouTube stream

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.070
within the HootSuite dash.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.280
Third is the ability to view
video and user details.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.960
And that's basically just
getting insight into the

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.210
number of views, number of
comments, number of favorites

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.370
and so forth for both videos
and YouTube users.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.820
In addition, you can
upload videos.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.580
And this is a really
cool feature.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.470
Obviously, it's not at the
extent that you can at

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.270
YouTube.com.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.970
But it's really about adding a
title, adding a description,

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.510
adding whether it's public
or private, and obviously

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.300
uploading the file.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.340
So that's another cool feature
that we added.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.470
And in a social engagement
dashboard management system,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.590
you certainly want the ability
to share stuff out to your

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.200
social networks to further
amplify the videos that you're

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.870
creating for your communities
and for your brand.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.010
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So the
use case here is

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.300
you upload a video.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.160
This is already integrated
with the API so you don't

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.020
actually have to go through
Youtube.com.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.290
You send it over through
HootSuite.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.590
You guys push it up to YouTube
and then to all the social

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.250
channels, so theoretically,
like 34 or whatever number

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.910
that you have.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.910
MARK HOLDER: Yeah, 200 to 300.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.450
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: OK.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:36.840
MARK HOLDER: Yeah, sure.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.890
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Great.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.050
MARK HOLDER: And I'll show
you how that works here.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.120
But obviously, it needs to
make sense from a social

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.440
engagement standpoint, and I
think that's really one of the

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.150
key pieces to this
integration.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.960
So I'm going to go ahead and
hop over to the dashboard.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.800
And I'm going to wake
Owly up there.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.540
There's our mascot right
there in the dash.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.600
So I'm going to wake him up.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.220
And here you have HootSuite.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.069
This is the HootSuite dashboard
at hootsuite.com.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.050
You have a number of tabs
and streams that you can

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.790
essentially manage a lot
of your activities.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.810
And once you get the app
installed, which is available

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.720
in our app directory here, which
you see on the left side

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.260
of the dash here.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.200
You can see here it's right
there at the top.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.290
And once you've installed it and
added the streams, this is

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.410
what you're going to
see in your dash.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.180
So obviously you're going
to authenticate.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.599
You have your My Video stream,
a search stream, and your My

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.010
Subscription stream.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.760
So once you go ahead and go
through the workflow of

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.810
actually connecting here.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.580
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So the flow
is, you install the app into

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.740
dashboard, and then you
authorize your channel.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.430
MARK HOLDER: That's exactly
right, yeah, your account.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.690
And so, here's some videos
that I've created.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.960
These are essentially test
videos, but you can see these

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.500
are videos that I've uploaded
to HootSuite.com--

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.020
or sorry, to Youtube.com.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.420
I'm going to go ahead and
authenticate with the search

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.590
stream, and I will do the same
with My Subscriptions.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.650
I'm going to let that stream
just load real quick.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.890
So I've authenticated.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.140
Let me refresh.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.350
And for some reason that guy
is not being friendly.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.040
And so what you have here is,
again, you have My Videos, you

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.090
have My Subscriptions.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.530
And Search is being funny with
me right now, but she should

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.110
come back here in a second.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:37.020
And so essentially, in terms of
your videos, this is where

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.190
you're able to see videos that
you have in the dash.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.160
If I wanted to go ahead and play
this video, I can simply

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.130
and easily click the video and
play it from within the dash.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.660
So that video's private, and
it's my video, so that's not

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.130
going to play.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.260
And really this comes
into play when you

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.470
have the search stream.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.740
And let me just do a little
refresh here to

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.990
get this guy going.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.090
There we go.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.150
So this search stream here, by
default, is bringing in the

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.950
videos with the most views.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.680
And so you can see that if I
wanted to watch this, I think

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.890
it's pronounced "gang-yum." Is
that how you pronounce it?

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.450
I can play that directly
from the dash.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.870
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: I'm not
Korean, but I've heard that

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.580
pronunciation before.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.390
Greg, any opinions about that?

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.630
GREG SCHECHTER: That sounded
good enough to me.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.810
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: All right.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.500
MARK HOLDER: So you can see
this video here playing

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.810
directly within the dash.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.580
You can obviously, as
I mentioned, view

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.770
some comments here.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.200
So if I click this, it's going
to pop down to comments.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.510
Now these are paginated.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.420
As you saw there, there was,
I think, two million-plus

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.890
comments, so obviously
that's a lot of

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:40.840
comments to scroll through.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.060
But you can look at the comments
for your videos.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.450
You can add comments here.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.920
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So
typically this is--

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.780
what's use case here?

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.070
Are you looking at
your own content?

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.690
Are you looking at competition's
content?

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.860
Like why do you care how many
comments are there on the side

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.370
video if you're a small
business or something?

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.980
MARK HOLDER: Yeah, so you have
the ability to search, and

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.750
I'll show you that in
a quick second.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.490
But I just wanted to walk
through some the key features

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.850
with this video here.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.730
So as I mentioned, you can view
bio information here.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.890
So that's the number of channel
views, the number of

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.390
upload views, number of
subscribers, and so forth, in

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.340
addition to viewing the
actual video info.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:17.940
So you can get--

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.090
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So this is all
basically obtained through

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.980
the YouTube API.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.450
MARK HOLDER: That's right.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.650
All this data is coming through
the YouTube API and

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.290
being presented here within
the HootSuite dash.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.210
Another thing that, as I
mentioned, you can share

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.320
videos out to social networks.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.190
So if you simply click this
link here, that's going to

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.100
give you auto-populate, your
main compose box in HootSuite,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.380
shrink an Owly link that's going
to go directly to that

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.080
particular YouTube video,
and I'll just

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.440
quickly show you that.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.020
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So we have
another Owly connection.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.250
MARK HOLDER: Another Owly.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.220
There's lots of Owlies.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.230
And you can see the video
here in the dash.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.730
And then you have the ability
to publish out to all the

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.750
social networks that you have
in your HootSuite account.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.000
So simply and easily, a few
simple clicks further amplify

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.544
those videos.

00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:08.540
So let's click out of that.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.090
So if I'm HootSuite, obviously
I would have

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.810
my videos here listed.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.635
But let's just search
for username.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.060
Let's bring in a stream of
videos for HootSuite.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.950
So these are the videos
that I've uploaded.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.940
If I was interested in a
competitor of ours, I could

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.050
obviously enter in a competitive
keyword and

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.870
monitor the comments and that
sort of thing there.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.590
So here, if I'm HootSuite and
I uploaded this video, I can

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.020
go in here, and I can look at
the comments, see what people

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.550
are saying. "So cute," "Thanks
for loving Android," "So cute,

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.790
so true." Maybe there's going to
be some people in here that

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.690
have some negative comments,
and I can go in and address

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:45.810
those comments directly
from the dash.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.150
So that's--

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.810
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Do you do any
kind of sentiment analysis

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:48.420
on these comments?

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.630
Or is it right now up to the
user to actually decide

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:52.320
whether which ones
are positive,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.930
which ones are negative?

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.560
MARK HOLDER: It's up to the
user right now, yeah.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.260
I mean, we'd love to tap into
some more of those analytics

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.890
options and look at some
sentiment there, in really

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.030
determining what's being said
across these, especially as

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.780
you have more and more
videos that have

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.050
more and more comments.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.980
So right now, you see a 21, 3,
41, but if your brand is

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.230
publishing videos that has
100, 200, 1000, 10,000

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.540
comments, obviously you're
going to want to get some

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.000
analysis done on those comments
so you can dive in.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.450
So you can favorite videos
as well, right from

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.070
the dash, and share.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.480
And then you have a My
Subscription stream, and

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.490
that's kind of more maybe some
of our more consumer users are

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.440
using that, where they're
looking at their various

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.960
subscriptions, and the videos
that are coming through for

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.590
their subscriptions.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.580
So all the channels that they're
subscribed to, videos

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.470
are going to come through
from there.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.860
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: It could be
good for sharing also, because

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.380
they could discover a new video
that came through their

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.230
subscription and then share it
through social media, right?

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.580
MARK HOLDER: Yep.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.590
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: It's more of
a curation type of use case.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.350
MARK HOLDER: Yes,
most definitely.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.450
The search capabilities--

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.360
and this is great, the
stuff that YouTube

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.460
provides via the API.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.590
Obviously, you can search by
keyword, location, and

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.590
username, but category.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.130
So obviously we support
category.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.470
You can search across different
categories, whether

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.960
they were added today, this
week, this month, or any time.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.200
You can sort by relevance,
publish date, number of views,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.090
rating, and language.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.730
As I mentioned, we're very much
focused on supporting

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.500
different languages throughout
the world, and localization.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.180
Obviously, you guys
have supported

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.890
probably all of them.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.620
But you're able to tap in and
search by language as well,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.840
and you can see that there's
a long list of languages

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.770
supported here.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.210
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: I don't think
we have them all, but

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.200
the list is growing
pretty fast.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.270
MARK HOLDER: The list
is growing, yeah.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.500
So it's a great feature for
people around the world.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.620
And then the ability to upload,
as I mentioned, you

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.860
can add a title, you can add a
description, you can add tags,

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.110
select which category is
appropriate for that video,

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.960
and then set whether it's
public or private.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.310
And obviously select the file to
upload, upload that video,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.310
and that will be added to your
Youtube account, and you can

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.020
manage it within HootSuite,
and share them out to your

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.440
social networks also
in HootSuite.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.790
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Cool.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.870
That's really nice.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.450
So I know Greg wanted to chat
a little bit more about the

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.330
technical aspects of
integration, and I know David

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.060
is still on the line.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.750
Yes, here's David.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.630
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: Hello.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.220
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: So Greg, do
you have any questions about

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.160
how they did it?

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.270
GREG SCHECHTER: Yeah, so I
tried the app out myself.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.840
And I was really impressed.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.080
It worked really smooth, and it
was all very quick, and a

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.440
lot of features.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.370
I'm wondering how you went about
building it, and what

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.400
languages did you
use and stuff?

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.980
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: We used PHP.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:48.620
We used the client library
that's in the Zend framework.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.150
PHP, we just use it because it's
easy, and if I need to

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.472
get somebody to fix something,
you can always find a PHP

00:24:54.472 --> 00:24:55.722
program somewhere.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.630
So it's just on a typical
LAMP-type setup, MySQL with

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.270
Apache and PHP.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.790
It's like a million other
websites, I think.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.730
It's an app, but it's like a
little mini website, really.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.730
GREG SCHECHTER: And now, which
APIs did you end up using?

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.130
I can recognize some of them,
but I don't know if there were

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.000
more than what I just saw.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.230
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: Oh, there's
a the main ones, the YouTube

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.370
one, and the HootSuite one, and
then we're using Google

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.970
Maps as well.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.630
GREG SCHECHTER: Great, great.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.820
So as far as the YouTube ones
go, assuming you're using the

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.120
data APIs, now are
those Version 2?

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.835
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: Version
2, yes, yes.

00:25:41.835 --> 00:25:44.395
Started this a long time ago.

00:25:44.395 --> 00:25:46.520
GREG SCHECHTER: Oh,
right, right.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.000
Did you have any challenges
when you were doing this

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.670
integration, either with YouTube
or with HootSuite?

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.800
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: I think the
biggest challenge for me was

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:00.920
the rate at which the YouTube
website changed is faster than

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.960
the API changes.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.570
So I think the big one was, it
used to be videos on YouTube

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.730
were like--

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.800
you could rate them
with stars.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.740
And then that got switched
to like/not like.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:18.380
And there was no API
points to do that.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.620
There was no way to do it.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.140
So it's like there's a feature
in the website that people are

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.070
wanting, but then I can't
reproduce it in the app.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.410
There's lots of those things.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:33.350
That's even more now that the
YouTube website's been

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.470
revamped again.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.650
There's so many new things in
there that I can't support

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.210
unless I go to Version
3 of the API.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.860
So to me, that's the biggest
challenge, is trying to--

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.040
users want certain things that
I can't do, because the API

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.610
doesn't support them yet.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.850
GREG SCHECHTER: Sure, sure.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.520
Yeah, that's a common
challenge.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.540
And we try our best to make our
APIs as rich as we can,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.430
but it's just a lot of
work, a lot for us

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.310
to accomplish there.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.900
But overall, when you were doing
this integration, using

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.180
stuff, did you have
good experience?

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.840
Like were the parts that you
could actually get from the

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.890
API, were they easy to use,
easy to understand?

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.060
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: Especially
when using the Zend framework,

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:19.120
once you install it, I think
anybody could use the API.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.710
Not anybody, but if you gave
them little bit of

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.110
instruction, it was so easy.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.360
GREG SCHECHTER: Oh, great.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.490
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: Since we've
done the YouTube app, the

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.270
YouTube app was one
of the first

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.665
apps we did for HootSuite.

00:27:31.665 --> 00:27:33.110
We've done a whole bunch
of other ones.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.740
We've done Flickr, Storify,
a whole bunch of things.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.940
And you keep coming back to the
fact that the YouTube one

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.630
was definitely the richest of
all of the APIs we've used.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.140
GREG SCHECHTER: That's
always great to hear.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.180
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: Pretty
much everything was

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.730
there that you needed.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.630
Like I said, it's that lag in
between when the website is

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.160
updated and the API
is updated.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.050
That's the only major issue.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.340
But everybody has the
exact same issue.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.390
But then some other people,
their APIs, they're kind of

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.470
flaky with it.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.450
Whereas with the YouTube one,
I know I can wake up in the

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.700
morning, and it's going
to be working.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.990
It's not going to be down
or something like that.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.000
I think some people, some other
companies, they don't

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.420
put a priority on the
APIs very much.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.713
It's the orphan or whatever.

00:28:18.713 --> 00:28:21.070
It doesn't get enough
attention.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.030
GREG SCHECHTER: Cool.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.140
So what's next for the app?

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.890
Are you going to keep working on
it, maybe try the new APIs

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.140
in the future?

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.775
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: What's next is
definitely we want to do a

00:28:35.775 --> 00:28:38.640
2.0 of the app, and we're going
to use the Version 3

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.330
API, because when you look
through what YouTube website

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:45.330
looks like now and what our
app looks like, there's

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.880
definitely a bit of a
disconnect in there.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.410
The app looks Version 2 API, but
the YouTube website looks

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.820
Version 3 API.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:03.760
So my challenges now is the
Version 3 is experimental.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.320
Do I start using it now and
start coding around with

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.975
Version 3 API or do I wait?

00:29:08.975 --> 00:29:11.170
That's my big question
for you guys.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.740
When does Version 3 go from
experimental to something that

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.670
I can really use
in production?

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.510
GREG SCHECHTER: So we just
launched it very recently.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.830
So it'll take awhile for it to
move out of experimental.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.530
But it's a great opportunity for
you to give us feedback on

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.390
new things that we can
add to it before we

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.586
take it out of there.

00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:33.660
Are there any things that you
have in mind that you would

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.110
like to see in the API
in the future?

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.970
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: As much
analytics as you can put in.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.140
It's nice to have views, and
number of people who have

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.320
liked and disliked, and
stuff like that.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.330
But when you go to the analytics
on the current

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:56.050
YouTube website, there's
geographic stuff.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.580
There's just so much information
in there that I

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.460
don't think I have access to.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.160
Maybe I do, I'm not
quite sure.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.550
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: In fact, we
will have our analytics

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.700
engineers on this show.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.630
We're trying to schedule a time
slot with them, but it

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.440
will happen in the
next few weeks.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.940
And we'll be talking about the
new analytics API that we have

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.090
also released.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.700
It is built on the same
infrastructure as the YouTube

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.200
API V3, so they work
well together.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.140
But in V2, analytics was
confined to the inside API,

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.860
which was a small subset
of the YouTube API V2.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.620
Whereas, in V3, analytics is a
first-class citizen with its

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.360
own set of APIs and its
own set of metrics.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.520
So definitely you're right that
on the website if you go

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.430
to Youtube.com, there are still
metrics that you can see

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.180
there, but they are not exposed
through the API.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.040
But this is something
that we'll discuss.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.070
The team is actively working on
including more and more of

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.630
these metrics into the
analytics API.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.010
Another thing that is nice
about that one is it's

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.780
somewhat modeled upon
the YouTube--

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.520
sorry, the Google Analytics API,
so if you work with the

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.930
analytics APIs, you will
find it very familiar.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.310
So it's more of a data cube
model, and you can issue

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.740
various queries against it.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.280
So it's quite powerful.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.200
So definitely we will cover
that in more detail in the

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.860
next few weeks.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.172
So David, I hope that
you'll be watching.

00:31:23.172 --> 00:31:23.995
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: I'm
definitely going

00:31:23.995 --> 00:31:25.070
to watch that one.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.395
Everybody wants to
analyze things.

00:31:27.395 --> 00:31:27.860
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Yeah.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.325
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:28.325 --> 00:31:29.720
Cool.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.040
GREG SCHECHTER: That's all
the questions I had.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.565
Did you have anything else
you wanted to add, Jarek?

00:31:32.565 --> 00:31:34.090
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: No, I think
you guys covered it.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.610
So I was hoping maybe before we
wrap up for today, we could

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:37.720
look through our Moderator
queue--

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.020
GREG SCHECHTER: Sure, sure.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.070
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: --see if
there's anything in there that

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.820
we should address.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.520
GREG SCHECHTER: Let
me see if there's

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.040
anything for our guests.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.450
So the first question I see is,
they're asking if you guys

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.860
will be adding any new features
to the YouTube app

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.800
for HootSuite any time soon.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.530
I know you just to addressed
that a little bit.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.100
I wasn't sure if there's
anything else you wanted to

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.020
comment on.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.250
MARK HOLDER: Yeah, we're
working through it.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.480
As David mentioned, he's working
through and will be

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:07.220
looking at the V3 API and really
determining exactly

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.460
what we want to add and what
additional functionality we

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.050
want to add for the V2 of
the app integration.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.860
We listen very closely to our
user feedback across the

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.000
board, across all
of our channels.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.760
So we take that feedback very
seriously, and want to kind of

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.240
iterate and create a V2 based
on that feedback, and really

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.640
give the value that our users
are looking for in the V2.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.600
So we put out the V1
about a year ago.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.100
And we really want to get
something that's a lot more

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.330
than what you have now and
fuller and richer and deeper.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.910
GREG SCHECHTER: Let's see
what else do we have?

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.870
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: There is one
about the implementation of

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.120
the actual app, whether it's
HTML5 or Flash, so I think

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.370
that's a question for David.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.170
DAVID DMYTRYSHYN: It's HTML5.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.752
It's Ajax, it's JavaScript, it's
PHP, it's HTML5, but it's

00:32:58.752 --> 00:33:00.692
basically it's that.

00:33:00.692 --> 00:33:03.398
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Cool.

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:03.850
Anything else?

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.970
GREG SCHECHTER: And then, of
course, there's the one that I

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.570
always see--

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.100
"Is YouTube and Google Developer
Relations hiring?"

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.540
The answer is, of course, yes,
and you can find job postings

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.240
on developer.google.com/jobs.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.220
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: Great.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.390
All right, so I think this is
all the time we have today.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.650
Thank you very much
for coming.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.330
MARK HOLDER: Of course, thank
you guys for hosting.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.550
JAREK WILKIEWCIZ: And have a
safe trip back to Vancouver.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.450
And we are excited to see
this integration.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.560
I think it's very interesting,
an interesting space.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.470
I know it's very hot.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.680
And again, I'll check
out API V3.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.740
And we will send more
information about the

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.070
analytics API overview that
we'll be giving on this show

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.100
pretty soon.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.620
Till then, I'll see you all
next week, same time,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.780
Wednesday, 10:00 AM Pacific.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.870
Thank you, bye.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.120
MARK HOLDER: Thanks, bye-bye.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:16.132
