00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830
developer advocate at Google today I'll
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.349
developer advocate at Google today I'll
show you how to implement sliding tabs

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
show you how to implement sliding tabs
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.760
show you how to implement sliding tabs
like the ones you may have seen in the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770
like the ones you may have seen in the
 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.480

up with you can see the tab indicator

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
up with you can see the tab indicator
 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.499
up with you can see the tab indicator
moves smoothly from tab to tab providing

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
moves smoothly from tab to tab providing
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.060
moves smoothly from tab to tab providing
continuous touch feedback as the user

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
continuous touch feedback as the user
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.540

Scrolls the first step is the layout you

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
Scrolls the first step is the layout you
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.910
Scrolls the first step is the layout you
need two things tabs on the top and a

view pager on the bottom make sure to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
view pager on the bottom make sure to
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.120
view pager on the bottom make sure to
use the full package name for the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
use the full package name for the
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.890
use the full package name for the
sliding tab layout because the custom

find your view pager and set its adapter

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
find your view pager and set its adapter
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.560
find your view pager and set its adapter
and then second set the view pager on

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
and then second set the view pager on
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.369
and then second set the view pager on
the sliding tab layout the last thing to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
the sliding tab layout the last thing to
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.900
the sliding tab layout the last thing to
do is to implement the adapter for your

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
do is to implement the adapter for your
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.729
do is to implement the adapter for your
view pager you can do whatever you want

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
view pager you can do whatever you want
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.529

here just make sure to override get page

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
here just make sure to override get page
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540
here just make sure to override get page
title the view pager calls this method

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
title the view pager calls this method
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.310
title the view pager calls this method
in the adapter to get the title that's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
in the adapter to get the title that's
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.500
in the adapter to get the title that's
shown for each tab here I'm generating

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
shown for each tab here I'm generating
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.119
shown for each tab here I'm generating
it based on item position let's look at

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
it based on item position let's look at
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.560
it based on item position let's look at
another example where each tab is a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
another example where each tab is a
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.450
another example where each tab is a
different color the tabs take care of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
different color the tabs take care of
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.069
different color the tabs take care of
blending the colors together for you as

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
blending the colors together for you as
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380
blending the colors together for you as
you transition from each tab as you can

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
you transition from each tab as you can
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450
you transition from each tab as you can
see the messages tab is red and the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
see the messages tab is red and the
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190
see the messages tab is red and the
photos tab is yellow but the indicator

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
photos tab is yellow but the indicator
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.890
photos tab is yellow but the indicator
when it's halfway between them is orange

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900
when it's halfway between them is orange
 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.210
when it's halfway between them is orange
to start this example first I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
to start this example first I'm
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.710
to start this example first I'm
initializing some simple data for my

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
initializing some simple data for my
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539
initializing some simple data for my
pager this is just a list of simple

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
pager this is just a list of simple
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.070
pager this is just a list of simple
objects that hold a string title and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
objects that hold a string title and
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.850
objects that hold a string title and
indicator color and a divider color next

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
indicator color and a divider color next
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.380
indicator color and a divider color next
I'll set up the views this time I'm

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
I'll set up the views this time I'm
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630
I'll set up the views this time I'm
using a fragment state pager adapter you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
using a fragment state pager adapter you
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.070
using a fragment state pager adapter you
can use any adapter you'd normally use

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
can use any adapter you'd normally use
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350
can use any adapter you'd normally use
with a view pager again remember to set

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
with a view pager again remember to set
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030
with a view pager again remember to set
the adapter first before you set the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
the adapter first before you set the
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.730
the adapter first before you set the
view pager on the sliding tab layout now

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
view pager on the sliding tab layout now
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289
view pager on the sliding tab layout now
I'm going to set a tab colorizer

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
I'm going to set a tab colorizer
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330
I'm going to set a tab colorizer
on the sliding tab layout it's going to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
on the sliding tab layout it's going to
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.590
on the sliding tab layout it's going to
use the stored color in the list of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
use the stored color in the list of
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240
use the stored color in the list of
items I created and make that the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
items I created and make that the
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249
items I created and make that the
indicator color for the tab it does the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
indicator color for the tab it does the
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.109
indicator color for the tab it does the
same thing for the divider color the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
same thing for the divider color the
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.789
same thing for the divider color the
divider color applies to divider on the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
divider color applies to divider on the
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.039
divider color applies to divider on the
right side of the tab in our example the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
right side of the tab in our example the
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.539
right side of the tab in our example the
dividers are all gray but they could

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
dividers are all gray but they could
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.859
dividers are all gray but they could
even be different colors if you need a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
even be different colors if you need a
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.280
even be different colors if you need a
very colorful tab layout be sure to
