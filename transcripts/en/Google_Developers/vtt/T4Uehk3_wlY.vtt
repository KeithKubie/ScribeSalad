SPEAKER: Most Flutter
widgets are boxes.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.090
You can lay them out,
stack them, even nest them

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.570
inside each other.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.725
But what happens when that one
box doesn't fit in the other?

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.980
To help with that,
there's FittedBox.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.770
Just give it a child
widget and a BoxFit that

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.340
describes how it should
make its child fit,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.070
and it will scale or clip
its child automatically.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.470
The BoxFit enum offers a
bunch of different fit types,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.872
like fitWidth,
fill, and even none.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.330
There is also an
alignment property

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.820
that tells FittedBox how to
align the child if there's

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.230
extra space.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.350
For more info on FittedBox and
all the other Flutter widgets,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.510
head to Flutter.io.
