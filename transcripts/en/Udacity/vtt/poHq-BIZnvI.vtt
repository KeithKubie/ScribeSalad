00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
My question for you is--if we should think that this argument

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.020
is actually practically relevant meaning okay.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.330
On an infinite machine, you might not be able to solve the halting problem,

00:00:09.330 --> 99:59:59.000
but on any real computer, it's actually possible to solve the halting problem.
