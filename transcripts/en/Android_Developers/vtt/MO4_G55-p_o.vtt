NICK BUTCHER: A little later
than advertised, you are

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.130
joining an Android Developers
Office Hours.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.320
So we're coming to you
live from London.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.680
And my name is the Nick Butcher,
and I'm joined by--

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.880
MATT GAUNT: Matt Gaunt.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.140
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Hey, and I'm
Richard Hyndman, also from the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.990
Android Developer
Relations team.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.560
NICK BUTCHER: So this your
opportunity to talk to us

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.520
about all things Android dev.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.130
And as always, this is not an
opportunity to talk about

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.490
unreleased products, when is
x feature going to launch?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.710
Why is Rich and Matt sharing
headphones like they're

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.110
teenagers on the bus?

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.750
MATT GAUNT: Are you giggling?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.250
NICK BUTCHER: Those topics
will not be discussed.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.020
But otherwise, yeah.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.820
Come along and ask us
all things Android.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.380
Yeah, so it looks like we're
joined by a couple of regular

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.240
watchers, who we've got
in the Hangout live.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.920
Say hello.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.910
AL SUTTON: Hey guys, it's Al.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.616
MATT GAUNT: Hey Al,
how's it going?

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.240
Mr. Sutton.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.130
NICK BUTCHER: Who
else do we have?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.596
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:57.490
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Peter?

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.280
Peter Brooks there, I think,
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.256
Nice to see you all.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:03.564
Thanks for joining.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.310
All right, then.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.384
I'd better go and mute
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.350
NICK BUTCHER: So is
there any news?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.580
Anything in the news at
the moment that we

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.870
want to talk about?

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.195
Exciting Android developments?

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:19.750
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Something
since Maps [INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.300
AL SUTTON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.830
API.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.070
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'm still just,
like, up here on the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.853
fact that Android apps
can have awesome maps

00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:24.760
in them right now.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.430
NICK BUTCHER: So yeah, Billing
V2 has launched.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.940
Has anyone had a chance to look
at the new, streamlined,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.870
easier way to make
in-app payments?

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.810
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I have.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.260
MATT GAUNT: Yep.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.200
I've been playing with it.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.180
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Matt's been
playing with it, as well.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.270
NICK BUTCHER: What do
you think of it?

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.140
Much improved?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.550
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.310
NICK BUTCHER: Many, many fewer
lines of code to implement.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.810
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.620
Much, much simpler,
much, much easier.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.260
Training's really
good as well.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.500
Yeah.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.757
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You can do the
whole thing in 50 lines of

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:52.080
code now, which isn't too bad.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.852
NICK BUTCHER: There's been a
lot of the feedback I've

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:55.850
heard, that the developers love
the kind of monetization

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.760
opportunities it affords them
but find it hard to implement.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.300
RICHARD HYNDMAN: In
the old version.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.910
NICK BUTCHER: In the old
version-- the old version.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.800
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And you can
finally request the pricing

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.810
information from
the Play store.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.260
So inline inside your
application, you can say, buy

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.139
a sword for $0.99.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.140
And when you put sales on in the
Play store, it just comes

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.400
down to your application.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.830
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.520
You don't have to synchronize
a change to your SKU price

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.090
list with an update to
your app and hope the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.657
user gets the update.

00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:19.060
So the app can see
the right price.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.415
It's much simpler.

00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:22.000
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Hopefully that
reduces the number of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.980
cancellations as well, because
they can see the price in your

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.730
app before going through to the
Play store and finding out

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.370
the cost of the in-app item.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.830
OK.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.432
I haven't checked today's
moderator out, but I'm sure we

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:36.730
have some questions on it.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.305
NICK BUTCHER: Are there any
questions from people in the

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:40.740
Hangout, before we jump
into the moderator?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.530
AL SUTTON: I've got one, but I
don't know whether you guys

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.801
can actually answer it.

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:48.170
It's based on the new
Android tools.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.800
There's a new license term.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.240
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.420
AL SUTTON: They can't
be used for doing

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.500
fragmentation of Android.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.490
Is there any guidance on what
would be considered

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.130
fragmentation?

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.840
NICK BUTCHER: Say that again.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.680
There was a lot of noise during
the middle of that.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.160
Would you mind repeating?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.690
AL SUTTON: Sure.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.090
The new Android toolkit for,
I think it's for 4.2, has a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.280
clause in the license that
says it can't be used for

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.360
anything that would contribute
to fragmentation.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.550
Is there anywhere that we can
get guidance on what would be

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.425
considered fragmentation
and what's not?

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:23.390
NICK BUTCHER: So you're talking
about the Terms Of

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.045
Service, which sounds like it's
a lot like a voyage into

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:30.560
lawyer land, which I am not
qualified to make any kind of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.190
a judgment upon.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.370
It's a good question, though.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.972
So that was the change in the
Terms of Service you agreed to

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:36.970
when you updated ADT, right?

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.060
AL SUTTON: Yeah, those ones.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.732
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know.

00:03:40.732 --> 00:03:44.560
Have you posted this in the
tools development forum?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.520
AL SUTTON: I have, and there was
a discussion in the tools

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.970
development.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.820
Because if you build the tools
from the Open Source Project

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.120
you're, of course, not bound
by the same license.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.430
So there was a lot of to-ing
and fro-ing on that.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550
But it's just, basically,
looking for a definition of

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.050
what fragmentation means
in that context.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.980
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.642
Yeah, that's a good question,
which unfortunately, I don't

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:05.460
think, any of us even know or
are qualified to weigh in on,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.750
unfortunately.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.460
How could we get an
answer to that?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.867
I guess maybe we email the
PM for that project and

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:11.490
try and find out?

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.210
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We could try.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.500
Yeah.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.090
NICK BUTCHER: Leave
it with us.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.625
We'll try and follow
up on that for you.

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.260
AL SUTTON: Cool, thanks.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.250
NICK BUTCHER: No problem.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.709
Any other live questions
in the room?

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.210
PETER BROOKS: A very
quick one.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.080
Well, I think very quick.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.730
In terms of Google Play error
codes, do you guys know, or

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.300
does anyone else know, these
kind of 914 error codes which

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.000
we had yesterday throughout
the entire market or 948?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.470
They seem really kind of random,
and we would love to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.090
tell our users what's
wrong with them

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.340
buying our apps, really.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.700
NICK BUTCHER: All I know is that
there was an outage at

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.297
some point, and it
got resolved.

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:50.730
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] some payment--

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.970
PETER BROOKS: OK.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.300
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --had
been declined for

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.980
some reason or other.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.710
It was showing the 914 error.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.540
We had quite a lot of partners
reporting it.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.790
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.120
PETER BROOKS: Right.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.460
OK.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.610
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, as to is
there anything, actually, you

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.050
can do in your app?

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.900
No, I don't think there's any.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.230
We don't publish these error
codes and advise any kind of

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.330
response to put to the user.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.920
I'd say just catch them
gracefully and say,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.860
there was an error.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.260
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We update the
known issues page, as well.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.650
If you do a Google search of
Google Play developer known

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.742
issues, we work pretty hard
making sure that page is

00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:24.023
updated so at least you can show
your users that it's our

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.710
problem, not yours.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.890
PETER BROOKS: Right, OK.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.440
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Cheers.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.220
Thanks, Peter.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.810
NICK BUTCHER: Is this
the first Hangout

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.520
you're doing, Peter?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.010
Have you been a lurker for a
while, or first time joining?

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.890
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Don't
ask people that.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.180
PETER BROOKS: I lurked last week
and only just found out

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.470
about it recently.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.475
So I'll join you guys
in the future.

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:45.760
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Cool.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.870
NICK BUTCHER: Yep,
spread the word.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.940
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You're
more than welcome.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.540
AL SUTTON: We can post it in
the Android developer's

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.660
community on Google+.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.910
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, we should.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.395
We've got some more people
seem to have

00:05:57.395 --> 00:05:58.330
joined us, as well.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.920
Who else have we got there?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.060
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.850
Hugo's joined in.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.124
NICK BUTCHER: Ah.

00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:01.920
Mr. Visser.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.080
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And
Giuseppe of course.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.420
HUGO VISSER: Hi guys.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.580
NICK BUTCHER: Hi.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.360
MATT GAUNT: Hi there.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.710
NICK BUTCHER: Hugo, I think
you had a question in the

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.710
moderator, right?

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.760
HUGO VISSER: I actually
had two.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.690
But the most important one was
the one that I already posted

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.280
on Google+ a while ago.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.150
And it was a question about
the voice recognition, the

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.650
streaming stuff.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.680
I couldn't find any
documentation on it, but what

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.770
I would like to do is what the
Google Now app is doing is,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.960
like, listen for a certain
kind of word.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.510
So I think the voice recognition
could be useful

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.770
for that, but I'm not sure if
I can start it in a sort of

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.430
streaming background
way in my app.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.580
NICK BUTCHER: There's no
way to do it, really.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.210
The only way you can do
it is by throwing up

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.660
the recognition dialogue.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.080
There's no kind of background
recognition.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.950
HUGO VISSER: AUDIENCE: OK, so it
would also require a custom

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.340
IME or something like that?

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.250
NICK BUTCHER: Quite possibly.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.485
I don't even know if you'd
be successful that way.

00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:06.430
I think the custom IME froze
up the standard UI, right?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.356
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It does.

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:08.553
Yep.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:13.426
So you can either do
fixed-length detection and

00:07:13.426 --> 00:07:16.125
then process that and then go
back [INAUDIBLE], procedures,

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.872
like check every 30 seconds and
then cancel it and start

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:20.610
again, which is not ideal.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.250
Or go with [INAUDIBLE], but then
you're not going to know

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.080
when [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.760
HUGO VISSER: Yeah.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.010
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.310
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [? Predrag's ?]
just come in.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.630
[? MATT GAUNT: Predrag? ?]

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.800
RICHARD HYNDMAN: He's just come
in from the Hangout post.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.070
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.110
Excellent.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.050
And you had a second
question, Hugo?

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.470
HUGO VISSER: Yeah.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.360
But that's regarding the
new billing API.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.340
Just a confirmation.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.200
I assume that in the new
billing API, your old

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.720
purchases will also
pop up, right?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.860
Like if you have managed
purchases.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.190
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
was compatible.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.850
But new items that you should
create now should be managed.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.310
HUGO VISSER: Right.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.310
Because I read some comments
on Twitter

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.420
that something broke.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.070
But I'm not sure
what to think.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.050
I thought, let's ask.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.320
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I saw that
as well, [? by Raoul. ?]

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.910
He said something broke.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.270
HUGO VISSER: Yeah,
he said that.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.820
So I'm not sure what's
going on there.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.140
But from what I understand
later, that he's still using

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.320
the older API, and that
broke for him.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.440
But I haven't noticed
that in my app yet.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:20.875
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
So we shouldn't

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:21.950
have changed anything.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.780
If you're still saying V1 or V2,
it should still have V1 or

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.720
V2 functionality.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.815
It's only as soon as you specify
V3 that you'll get the

00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:29.120
new functionality.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.510
HUGO VISSER: Yeah.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.760
OK, cool.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.590
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Cool.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.179
NICK BUTCHER: So are there any
more live questions in the

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.490
room, or should we jump
into the moderator?

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:46.992
AUDIENCE: I want to ask
you why the Android is

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:48.242
the best over iOS?

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.260
NICK BUTCHER: So why should
you develop for

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.882
Android rather than iOS?

00:08:53.882 --> 00:08:55.132
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.680
NICK BUTCHER: I guess it's the
world's largest software and

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.460
mobile operating system, is a
pretty compelling reason.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.647
I would say, if reach is
important to you, then, that's

00:09:03.647 --> 00:09:03.850
a good reason.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.160
AUDIENCE: I have a good article
if he wants to read.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.770
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, stick
it into the chat window.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, still getting
the hang of this.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.375
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's OK.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:16.710
Top-left corner, you should have
a little Chat button, and

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.460
you can press it.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.855
And the window will open up.

00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:24.358
AUDIENCE: It's an article from
three years ago, but it's

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:24.825
still pretty good.

00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:25.360
RICHARD HYNDMAN: No, no.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.580
It's exponentially
more important.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.680
NICK BUTCHER: What
is it they say?

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.860
75% of all smart phones
shipping run Android?

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.410
That's a pretty strong
reason, I think.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.620
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There's
a lot of good reasons.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the biggest
reason for me is that you

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.660
don't need wait two,
three weeks to

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.820
get your app in store.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.846
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, but
that's [? not for ?]

00:09:44.846 --> 00:09:47.180
publication.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.990
AUDIENCE: It's especially crazy
if you want to publish

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.400
up the existing app.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.050
You know, like Apple's App
Store, there are people that

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.860
abandoned their app, because
Apple [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.260
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, you're in
control of your own software

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.030
release cycles, which
is awesome.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.000
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And it's a
whole ecosystem, as well.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.595
It's not just controlled
by one company.

00:10:04.595 --> 00:10:06.881
We have all the OEMs, the
operators, the handset

00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:09.790
manufacturers, the developers,
people with their own music

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.246
stores, their own app stores.

00:10:11.246 --> 00:10:11.860
Everything [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.130
Android to create this
massive ecosystem.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.390
People working together
to create something.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.640
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.380
NICK BUTCHER: Whoa,
massive feedback.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.630
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Thanks.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:27.820
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.370
I think this is a pretty
open-ended

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.130
question, which really--

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.777
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, it's
been a long time since

00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:33.440
someone has asked why.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.370
It's more the how, now.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.370
How do I do x?

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.490
But thanks for the question.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.030
Hopefully there was some
convincing arguments for you.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.740
Any more live questions,
or should we go

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.550
back into the moderator?

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.400
MARIJN OOSTERVELD: I have
a question, which

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.610
is also in the moderator.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.840
It's about a three-pane view
which I would like to

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.890
implement, just like
Gmail has.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.270
So one on the left side and
one on the right side.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.466
And if you choose any content
on the right side, you get

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:11.230
this slider, which just slides
over one of those fragments.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.890
And then there's some
other content.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.650
Without using any external
library.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.950
NICK BUTCHER: So you want
to build it yourself.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.450
Yeah, so basically these will
just be fragment animations.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.360
MARIJN OOSTERVELD: OK.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.600
NICK BUTCHER: So every time
you kind of-- you know in

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.340
Gmail, so when you select an
individual message, it'll

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.750
queue up a set of animations
where it'll slide out the

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.420
label view and slide
in the detail view.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.980
MARIJN OOSTERVELD: OK, is there
an example or any code

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.310
available to try something
like that out?

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.460
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.530
Sure there is.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.450
One that was really good is
the Romain Guy published

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.510
something called xlarge-demos.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.750
If you Google for Romain
Guy, xlarge-demos--

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.430
this was launched a while back
now when Honeycomb just

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.670
launched, but it was a really
nice demonstration of how to

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.910
use fragments and how to
animate them around.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.230
Since then, the animation API
has only got better and

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.893
stronger and faster and so on.

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:12.780
So there's a few improvements
that you can use, things like

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.228
adapters and so on.

00:12:15.228 --> 00:12:16.478
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.170
MARIJN OOSTERVELD: OK.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.430
So that was x super?

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.600
NICK BUTCHER: Sorry, I think
the demo is something like

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.457
xlarge-demos, you know,
like the screen

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.380
size modifier, xlarge.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:32.650
MARIJN OOSTERVELD: OK.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.150
Thank you so much.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.654
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
you're welcome.

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.900
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Android 3
animation demos, maybe.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.352
NICK BUTCHER: Hello,
Mr. Banes.

00:12:44.352 --> 00:12:45.730
CHRIS BANES: Hey guys.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.288
NICK BUTCHER: You have a
time shifted version

00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:50.040
of us in your window.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.370
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.960
NICK BUTCHER: Any other
questions live from the

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.810
Hangout, or should we crack
on with the moderator?

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.060
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.090
No?

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.960
OK, cool.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.990
So Timothy Kist in Swansea says,
how can I show that the

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.840
user can't swipe a certain
way in a view

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.840
page by over scrolling?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.020
How do I force over scrolling
when the view page

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.950
is not at the end?

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:16.980
RICHARD HYNDMAN: What
would you use?

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.490
You'd use the [? force field ?]

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.960
for this, right?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.939
NICK BUTCHER: I don't understand
what do you mean

00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:21.810
when the view page is
not at the end.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.830
So you want to kind of
arbitrarily cut them off

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.520
before they can get to the end,
the last views, perhaps?

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.170
MATT GAUNT: It kind of sounds
like if you had a wizard, you

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.650
might not want to enable them to
go to the third pane until

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.520
they completed certain criteria
on the second pane.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.930
So my guess would be to just
do this in the adapter, do

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.810
some tricky stuff just to say
there's only two view pages.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.687
And then once they've completed
it, then fire off

00:13:43.687 --> 00:13:45.610
and change the adapter,
let's say, OK, now

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.990
the third one's available.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.492
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Do you know how
[? Raoul ?] did it in the

00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:49.436
wizard template view?

00:13:49.436 --> 00:13:52.270
NICK BUTCHER: You can
always [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.210
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.060
Yeah, you could override
the on touch as well--

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.720
the on-touch events-- and just
decide whether or not you're

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.110
going to pass them through
to the ViewPager.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.210
So if they have not completed
the requisite, whatever item's

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.230
on the form, just
hold onto them.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.910
NICK BUTCHER: That's a good
argument, actually.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.480
If you haven't done it, it's
really, really worth taking a

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.010
look at the ViewPager sources.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.490
Incredibly readable, and you'll
learn a lot about how

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.840
to create custom views.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.730
But, yeah if you look at the
section where it's just a

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.705
touch drag, and it decides
whether to tell the data to

00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:22.800
give you a new view or not.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.320
You could do it then.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.890
Just invoke the edge effect
stuff instead to get the

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.940
[? force field ?] clear
At that point.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.470
Hopefully that's the answer
to your question.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.000
Yeah, the AdapterView sounds
like the right way to go so.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.500
Al seems to be going through
and adding timed YouTube

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.060
responses to each of
the questions.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.308
That's very [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:45.724
Thank you.

00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:49.398
[STATEMENT REPEATS]

00:14:49.398 --> 00:14:51.780
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The
Chris Banes delay.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.270
AL SUTTON: Just in
case I missed it

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.520
the first time round.

00:14:56.504 --> 00:14:58.700
CHRIS BANES: Rich, you seem to
be in the Hangout twice.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.420
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I am, yes.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.884
Hey, hey.

00:15:00.884 --> 00:15:03.119
NICK BUTCHER: Double
Rich this week.

00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:04.522
RICHARD HYNDMAN: That's what
happens when we're unprepared

00:15:04.522 --> 00:15:07.220
and we get to campus late.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.030
NICK BUTCHER: So there's a
question here from Giuseppe.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.100
Do you want to unmute and
ask us live, Giuseppe?

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.416
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:16.210
Hello.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.880
NICK BUTCHER: How do I send
a file over Bluetooth?

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.280
GIUSEPPE: Hello?

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.280
NICK BUTCHER: Little joke for
the [INAUDIBLE] watching.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We can hear
you fine, Giuseppe.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.850
Hi.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.650
GIUSEPPE: Good, good, good.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.870
I just put my [INAUDIBLE]
question to

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.670
the moderator's panel.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.600
If you want, I can ask here.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:42.580
I would like to know in the case
of a situation, where LVL

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:50.780
license failed, I mean that,
actually, we have about 20,000

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.840
real users that paid
the application.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.240
But because we have a back-end
server, we know that there are

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:06.280
about 300,000 users that they
just downloaded the

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.720
application from Aptoide.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.070
Is Aptoide just a center
of crackers?

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:18.600
They remove they LVL license
from the application, and they

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.300
make downloadable the
application from everybody.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.226
The bad situation at the moment
is that the Play Store

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:33.330
is making possible this Aptoide
exist, as there is the

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.650
client on the Play Store.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.230
And this is not very good.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.440
What is your point of view?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.690
I would like to know.

00:16:43.374 --> 00:16:43.846
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:16:43.846 --> 00:16:45.990
Well, first of all, there's the
pirates and vampires talk

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.470
from Google I/O, which explains
how to secure your

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.560
LVL past the standard
documentation that we have.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.550
Securing LVL is a long
and in-depth topic.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.170
If you put more effort into it,
but it's worth cracking

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.010
your application--

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.970
especially in your case where
you have quite a valuable

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.230
application--

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.585
hackers are going to spend more
time trying to break it

00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:09.560
and get that valuable app
back out into the wild.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.142
But as Hugo says, you've got
your own servers that each of

00:17:13.142 --> 00:17:14.719
the applications
are porting to.

00:17:14.719 --> 00:17:17.400
I would definitely try and
maintain the list of

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.475
authorized users on
those servers.

00:17:20.475 --> 00:17:22.672
And whenever you get a pirated
app, you can just disable it

00:17:22.672 --> 00:17:23.922
from the server.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.710
AL SUTTON: Another thing that
I'd recommend is looking at

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.980
ProGuard or even going for
Eric Lafortune's more

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.880
commercial offering, DexGuard,
which is focused on Android.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.990
That makes it more difficult to
extract out things like LVL

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.440
and other routines, and bits
and bobs like that.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.500
So if the app hasn't been fed
through at least ProGuard,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.950
then it's definitely worth
giving that a shot.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:46.620
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.400
Yeah, that's mentioned in
pirates and vampires.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.480
Have you obfuscated your
app, Giuseppe?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:51.980
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.280
Has it been obfuscated
with the ProGuard?

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.190
I have a mike on--

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.230
probably someone has the
microphone open.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.810
I think, this guy.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.506
NICK BUTCHER: We'll
try and find it.

00:18:03.506 --> 00:18:04.160
GIUSEPPE: Uh, [? Patrick? ?]

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.410
[? Patrick? ?]

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.090
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.620
GIUSEPPE: OK, let's continue.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:16.260
Well, the main solution, as
everybody knows here, is just

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.300
to use a back-end server.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.580
I would like to use the back-end
server just to get to

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:27.150
each purchase, store the
purchase in our back-end

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.300
server, and through the account
manager, compare if

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.320
the user has been booked.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.050
But in my special case, as you
remember, we can't use the API

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.440
of Checkout, because they're
available only

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.850
in UK and the USA.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.810
And so this solution is
not applicable for us.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.840
The code has been obfuscated.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.170
Everything has been done.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.660
The check license--

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.070
it's not always in any
update in the same

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.600
position of the code.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.720
I used to change the position
of the license checking,

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.160
sometimes in some activity,
sometimes in some fragments,

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.100
sometimes somewhere else--

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.070
or some preference,
everywhere.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:19.470
I tried all that my small mind
can suggest, but I didn't find

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.790
how to save it.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.150
Well, someone told me, Giuseppe,
never mind about

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.847
these people, because the people
that crack it up will

00:19:29.847 --> 00:19:31.850
never pay you for
the application.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.480
Yes, that is a good
suggestion.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.170
But the technical problem is
very important, because

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:43.490
actually, my back-end server,
it's giving, like downloading,

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.960
serving the information about.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.310
So I have the 97% of the
users that are using my

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.810
[? artworks, ?]

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.250
my resource for zero,
for nothing.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.500
That is the situation.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.550
I believe that it's the
time to find some

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.690
solution for this problem.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:05.550
That's all.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.390
Probably mine could be not
the right question.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.490
Seems to be not a question but
is a way, here, to open the

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.310
discussion between us.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.550
That's it.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.540
NICK BUTCHER: Hey, have
you tried verifying?

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.790
AUDIENCE: What is the name
of your application?

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.690
GIUSEPPE: Sorry,
[? Patrick? ?]

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.979
AUDIENCE: What is the name of
application, like, that you're

00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:27.180
talking about?

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.530
GIUSEPPE: I believe that here is
not the right place to say

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.950
the names of our application.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.780
We are not here for
advertising.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.996
If you want later, I
would let you know.

00:20:37.996 --> 00:20:39.465
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, I was just
curious, what [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:39.465 --> 00:20:42.060
and the problem.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.420
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, if you go on
Aptoide website, then in the

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.990
music category, my application
is the first one.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.160
So you cannot [? wrong. ?]

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:51.585
OK?

00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:52.835
Simple.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.220
NICK BUTCHER: So have
you tried the--

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.670
GIUSEPPE: I would like to say
that my application is the

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.810
first on the Play store, not
on the Aptoide store.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.220
NICK BUTCHER: Have you tried all
the recommendations in the

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.100
talk Rich talked about, the talk
from Google I/O, "Evading

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.130
Pirates and Vampires,"
which talked about

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.132
exactly this problem?

00:21:14.132 --> 00:21:15.440
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.650
NICK BUTCHER: So you tried
verifying the signatures of

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.400
the device on your server
and all this?

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.930
GIUSEPPE: Change this
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:27.420
Change the numbers that, any
version I change the numbers?

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:27.730
No.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:28.230
No way.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.710
No way.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.760
I tried to encrypt
the device ID.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.660
I tried to encrypt the--

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.952
everything.

00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:37.990
Everything I tried.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.100
They just remove.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.760
They just remove the check.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.350
They find, where is my
do check, and they

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.200
then move the do check.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.690
And then they return
through anytime.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.570
It's very simple.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.620
I have already downloaded
from Aptoide my APK.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.580
And I understood very well,
how they do that.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.050
So I can try to follow any
guidelines but I will not find

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.330
the solution if we continue
to use LVL as a system.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.320
That's it.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.030
AL SUTTON: Do you have a free
version of your application

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.470
and then allow people to
purchase while in app?

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.630
GIUSEPPE: No.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.090
We haven't the free version.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.450
AL SUTTON: Because that
might be a solution.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.030
Because a lot of the times,
you'll find people are trying

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.900
the application out to
see if they like it.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.860
Just taking it from another
perspective, it might be worth

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.090
switching to in-app payments
and offering a small free

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.410
trial to get people hooked in.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.990
And then get them to buy once
they're happy that they like

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.630
the application, rather than
giving them the only choice of

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.615
pay up beforehand, or go and
get it from a pirate site.

00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:47.096
GIUSEPPE: Yes, but Al, you must
agree with me that this

00:22:47.096 --> 00:22:48.330
is just a workaround.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.970
It's not the real solution
to the problem, right?

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.250
AL SUTTON: It's not a technical

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.410
solution to the problem.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:59.160
But from the statistics I've
seen, there's a lot more

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.610
conversion to customers, a lot
more purchases, when you

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.080
switch to something like in-app
billing with the free

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.330
bit up the front.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.690
Which could be a way to--

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.690
yeah, it won't cure the problem,
but you'll certainly

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.070
find that you're getting
a lot more paid

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.140
users on your server.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.330
And so you may get to the stage
where you're talking

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.508
50-50 or even 80-20 paid
versus unpaid.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.960
GIUSEPPE: Yes, that's
true, that's true.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.210
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think
that's a great point.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.880
GIUSEPPE: It's a good
suggestion, but frankly, I

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.820
hope that someday we can get
also the technical solution.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.570
NICK BUTCHER: Do you have any
way of verifying which users

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.090
contacting your servers have
paid and which haven't?

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.740
Can you, for example,
look at a test on--

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.200
GIUSEPPE: Yes, I do that.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.550
I do that.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.120
I do that.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.370
I check each customer.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.320
I know from where they
downloaded the application And

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.040
if they downloaded the APK
from the Google Market,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.940
because they're a constant
inside the application.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:10.230
But the only that I can do is,
when I upgrade to new version,

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.330
just to block the old version.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.810
This is actually what
I am doing now.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:23.080
But because the users demand
to use it to upgrade to the

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.140
new version very fast, sometime
I'm [INAUDIBLE] in

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.350
the problem to block users
that have paid for, too.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:35.370
AL SUTTON: Have you looked at
check reporting the signature,

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.280
the APK file, to your server
and only responding to

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.360
requests from an APK
that's been signed

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.430
with the right signature?

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.830
GIUSEPPE: I lost you.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.430
Can you repeat again please?

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.270
AL SUTTON: Sure.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.880
Using the Package Manager, you
can get the signature for your

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.150
APK, or the APK that's
running.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.500
Now, you should be able to
report that to your server,

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.730
and it will only report your
signature for application

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.600
versions which don't have your
check removed, ie, you've

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.260
authored and you've
distributed.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.880
So if people are removing it
and re-signing the APK in

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.600
order to get it installed,
you'll probably find that the

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.300
signatures that get reported
to your server are not the

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.230
ones who are expected.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.930
And so you could just block
those users straight off.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.700
CHRIS BANES: The trouble with
that is that they can easily

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.355
replace that code and just
return what the proper

00:25:20.355 --> 00:25:22.080
signature should be.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.030
GIUSEPPE: Correct, Chris.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.870
Correct.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.330
CHRIS BANES: I don't think
you're ever going to fix it,

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.353
because it's always going
to be code, which

00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:30.400
is out of your control.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.550
It's always going to
be on their device.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.230
They can always [INAUDIBLE]
to change it.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.520
So you're never going to
completely fix it.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.320
I think you just have to bite
the bullet and just accept it.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.160
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:50.680
Can I just put here one of my
idea, and each of us try to

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.120
see if it's correct?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.450
When the device downloaded the
APK from the Play Store, the

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.760
Play Store knows the device
ID in that moment, OK?

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.320
What is the problem for Google
to give us in the back end

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.370
information--

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.230
the device ID?

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.500
Then we can collect this
device ID, we can store

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.810
somewhere in our server, and
to compare with the buyer?

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:20.770
I don't know if my question
is clear.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.576
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The problem is,
I think, [INAUDIBLE] for

00:26:22.576 --> 00:26:23.320
the buyer, though,
you might have--

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.240
especially now with multiple
users on a single tablet,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.120
multiple accounts on a single
tablet, it's the Gmail account

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.610
that's purchased it,
not the device.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.590
NICK BUTCHER: And then how
would you use that?

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.140
You mean, you're proposing to
send the device ID with each

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.050
request to your server?

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.285
Because then you just get in the
same situation that Chris

00:26:41.285 --> 00:26:43.450
talked about, where they'll
find a valid device ID and

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.700
just always send that.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.360
GIUSEPPE: You mean they can
change the device ID too?

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.000
HUGO VISSER: No, they can
send the device ID,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.025
which is not good.

00:26:55.025 --> 00:26:56.680
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Have you gone
as far-- because I know you've

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.660
used the NDK a lot in
your application.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.940
But have you gone as far as
doing the APK signature checks

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.515
in the NDK, in the native
library that you compile off?

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.590
Because we would much rather
decompile than reconstruct

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.885
that part of the application.

00:27:17.885 --> 00:27:19.890
And then just disable the
whole application if the

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.271
native library check fails.

00:27:22.271 --> 00:27:25.480
Then you can check which
signature the app was signed

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.630
with, the hash of the
entire APK file, or

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.360
other things like that.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.350
It's explained in the video.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:38.060
GIUSEPPE: Richard, is there any
of the suggested solution

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.995
already working and guaranteed
that there would be not crack?

00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:43.740
No.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.040
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Never, ever.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.380
There's nothing in the
world that's not

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.360
been cracked, right?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.880
Or has a secure system
for anything.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.465
NICK BUTCHER: It's not a secure
computing platform.

00:27:51.465 --> 00:27:52.920
You're not in control of
the hardware, right?

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.460
AL SUTTON: Nothing's
uncrackable.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:59.230
GIUSEPPE: So we just make harder
for them to make this--

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.800
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You need to
make it harder to crack it

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.910
than your application
is worth.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.700
AL SUTTON: All of security
is just about an

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.030
effort-reward ratio.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.160
And it's making the effort so
high and the reward so low

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.340
that people don't think
it's worth doing.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.820
NICK BUTCHER: I really think
that the idea of going free

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.940
with in-app purchase is a
really, really good idea,

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.710
actually, as well.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:18.130
I think, yeah, when you make
it so easy to get access to

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.320
the application and very
easy to pay to--

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.210
if you've proven that you like
it, then I think that removes

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.710
some of the curiosity-type
pirating.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.710
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, it's
just hard to figure out,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.560
especially in this kind of
application, how much of the

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.070
functionality you give
away for free.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.143
Because users will install it
expecting it to do a certain

00:28:36.143 --> 00:28:36.746
amount of things.

00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:37.830
And then you're like,
oh, to do that, you

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:38.310
need the pro upgrade.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.190
Please buy it here for $0.99
or whatever it is.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.195
So you've got to still get the
balance right, because you

00:28:43.195 --> 00:28:44.423
could lose a lot of
ratings on it.

00:28:44.423 --> 00:28:45.900
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, it's
not trivial, but

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.150
it's worth it, I think.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.770
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK?

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.430
GIUSEPPE: OK, thank
you very much.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.400
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Since then,
there's been a big

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.487
conversation going on in the
chat window that I haven't

00:28:55.487 --> 00:28:56.190
been reading.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.300
NICK BUTCHER: There is?

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.330
What's been going on, Rich?

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.230
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I just don't
have an idea how they manage

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.580
to change obfuscated code.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.820
Whenever I decompile an
obfuscated app, it's a mess.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.910
[INAUDIBLE] says it's easy.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.820
NICK BUTCHER: It's because
they're [? leet. ?]

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.560
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Hackers
just rip out the

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.250
Android Java checks.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.683
Check out the Droidcon
UK videos, for

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:15.460
example, for Apkudo.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.280
HUGO VISSER: Yeah, there was a
presentation on hacking, Words

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.080
With Friends or something
like that?

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.030
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, "Reverse
Engineering for Fun and

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.600
Profit" or something,
I think it's called.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.290
HUGO VISSER: Yeah, it was a very
cool thing, but it also

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.310
shows how easy it is.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.754
It's just the matter of time
that you put in it.

00:29:32.754 --> 00:29:35.120
NICK BUTCHER: I think you need
a lot of this stuff, these

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.880
checks and NDKs Rich
suggested, also.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.145
HUGO VISSER: And I'm not sure
how LVL works, but couldn't

00:29:42.145 --> 00:29:44.390
you just send the response
[INAUDIBLE] to your server and

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.150
then do something with
that to verify it?

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.430
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that's what
I was suggesting, because

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.580
it is signed with your
public key, right?

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.150
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
but that bit in the

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.920
middle, where the app--

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.840
because it goes from our servers
to your application

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.800
and then your servers.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.266
The bit in the middle where your
application gets hold of

00:29:57.266 --> 00:29:59.900
it can just say, true.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.590
HUGO VISSER: Yeah, but you could
also just check if it

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.740
phoned home at all.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.290
If somebody removes that check,
and it doesn't phone

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:11.350
home, or it phones home with the
same value all the time,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.352
that could make it
a bit harder.

00:30:13.352 --> 00:30:14.800
It will never be perfect.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.070
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There's
always going to be--

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.480
just make it a bit harder,
a bit harder.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.760
Eventually, at some point,
it's hard enough.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.890
Other people leave the stock
LVL implementation inside

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.220
their application, as well,
so people think

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.160
they've cracked it.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.650
But then they have a more
secure [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:32.025 --> 00:30:35.050
HUGO VISSER: And one other thing
that I do on forms, if

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.690
you try to spam, for example for
the spammer, it looks like

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.240
everything works.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.630
But in reality, stuff
doesn't work.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.670
So I can imagine, for this
particular application, that

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.150
maybe some things work, and some
things just don't work if

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.090
it detects that you have
a cracked app.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.620
NICK BUTCHER: One of my favorite
ones is a partner I

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.710
work with who, when they detect
someone's a pirate,

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.230
they don't tell or
do anything.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.300
They just make it possible
to finish that level.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.270
The baddies are suddenly
like a bit rock hard.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.220
AL SUTTON: There's one I saw
that enabled the game.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.330
But after playing for an hour
or two, you actually got a

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.400
pop-up that took you to the
Play Store and said if you

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.133
want to continue, you're going
to have to buy it.

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:17.360
Which is quite a nice
way of doing things.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.510
NICK BUTCHER: Fair
enough, I say.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.490
That's a good strategy.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.650
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
get them addicted.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.360
Push that on them.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.200
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.400
If you pop up a thing saying,
you're a filthy pirate, people

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.760
are going to get all defensive
and not going to be

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.500
inclined to buy it.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.105
But if you say, hey look, you've
been playing for two

00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:30.840
and a half hours, now.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.150
You've got this much progress,
which we'll keep for you.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.510
Just freaking pay the 99p.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.052
AL SUTTON: And don't forget the
picture of you with the

00:31:38.052 --> 00:31:39.348
begging bowl.

00:31:39.348 --> 00:31:40.980
NICK BUTCHER: Something
like that, I guess.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.450
Anyway, we've been on piracy
for a long time.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.130
Let's move on.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:45.030
GIUSEPPE: Sorry, sorry again.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.010
It's Giuseppe again.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.140
I like the question
of Peter Brooks.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.530
Has the Google service API got
the Play Store transaction?

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.480
This is something that seems
to be interesting.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.180
NICK BUTCHER: I missed that.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:31:59.960
Is that in the sidebar?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.010
Has the what?

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.560
GIUSEPPE: Has the Google service
API got Play Store

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.810
transactions?

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:10.810
NICK BUTCHER: Google
Pay services?

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:11.090
Yeah.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.720
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.870
If the Google Play services
could return back to us in the

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:20.950
API the transactions, probably
we can double check if the

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:25.520
application has been paid or is
using something different.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.780
NICK BUTCHER: No, I
don't think it is.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.591
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Certainly not
for a paid application, no.

00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:31.790
You can't use the Play
Store [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.450
Play Store for an outside
application.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.640
MATT GAUNT: If it's an in-app
purchase, you could get the

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.110
list of purchase of
that account.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.290
GIUSEPPE: Yes, correct.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.600
MATT GAUNT: That way, again,
you're still going to then go

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.420
on to the root of them stepping
in the middle and

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.400
just saying, yep,
he's paid, so--

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.862
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, but the
new Play Services API doesn't

00:32:52.862 --> 00:32:55.720
have anything for paid
applications-- or the new V3--

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.510
CHRIS BANES: If you're
externally, trying to check--

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.760
is there a Checkout API?

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.560
GIUSEPPE: Checkout API, it's
not usable for our

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.974
countries, you know.

00:33:09.974 --> 00:33:11.910
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, I believe
Checkout merchant's

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.930
port is only in US and UK.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.134
And they're the only countries
[INAUDIBLE] the API.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.250
GIUSEPPE: Well, one must ask to
the Google service API team

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.720
to implement something for
transaction checking.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.560
So please, do that.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.540
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.000
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Wow.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.640
The topic in my moderator
right now

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.700
is a Windows 8 question.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.062
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, really?

00:33:42.062 --> 00:33:43.470
Going to go for it, Rich?

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.210
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Well, I
don't know the answer.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.460
I don't have Windows 8, I've
never tried Windows 8.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.275
I saw it in an airport once.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.430
Is it possible to connect an
Android 4 phone with Wi-Fi

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:58.470
Direct to a Windows 8 PC using
Windows networking proximity?

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.540
Same question for Windows
7 PC and Namespace API.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.170
I have no idea.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.960
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know,
well, Wi-Fi Direct is a

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.160
standard, right?

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.400
I just don't know of anything
else that implements it.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.810
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I don't know
what you'd want to run over

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.770
the Wi-Fi Direct, necessarily,
once you'd connected your

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.325
device to your PC using
Wi-Fi Direct.

00:34:16.325 --> 00:34:18.148
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe again,
maybe, yeah, you can send

00:34:18.148 --> 00:34:21.320
files or something.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.690
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We clearly
have no idea.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:27.040
All we've used Wi-Fi Direct
for is hooking phones up

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.954
directly to play games
and things like that.

00:34:28.954 --> 00:34:30.115
NICK BUTCHER: And doing
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:30.115 --> 00:34:31.429
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And doing
Wi-Fi Direct discoveries.

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:34.562
I've never connected to a PC.

00:34:34.562 --> 00:34:36.370
I've connected to a TV, I guess,
because Miracast comes

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.620
over Wi-Fi Direct, right?

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.670
If anybody has any information
on Windows 8 and Wi-Fi Direct,

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.710
send it to Cedric
in Switzerland.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.650
There's only one.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.350
NICK BUTCHER: OK, [? Zerdis ?]
in the moderator asks another

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.104
favorite question of
the office hours.

00:34:53.104 --> 00:34:55.690
He wants to do a horizontal
list, basically.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.140
He wants to replace gallery,
and horizontal scroll view

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.060
isn't an adaptive view.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.660
And he can't use ViewPager to
show multiple views unless he

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.240
uses an external [INAUDIBLE],
apparently?

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.030
Can you point me to
a good tutorial?

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:12.220
So there are a huge number
of horizontal list view

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.030
implementations out there on
GitHub, and code.google.com,

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:19.920
and so forth, each with their
own various implementations

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.010
and drawbacks and so forth.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.268
Has anyone used a good one?

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.980
CHRIS BANES: You're talking
about lists, well,

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.570
I haven't got that.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.626
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Speaking
of horizontal lists.

00:35:33.626 --> 00:35:35.260
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
horizontal lists.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.633
No, I was going to make a
horizontal bridge view.

00:35:36.633 --> 00:35:38.998
But you could do a one--

00:35:38.998 --> 00:35:39.950
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.070
NICK BUTCHER: One at
a time, please.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.320
CHRIS BANES: He's on the list.

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.510
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
OK, [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.460
just dropped out.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.676
We'll go to webcam view.

00:35:57.676 --> 00:35:59.380
We'll officially be
back in a second.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.340
Hopefully you can
still hear us.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.560
Somebody nod if you
can hear us.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.400
AL SUTTON: We can hear you.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.850
The second session in the
Hangout now becomes obvious.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.736
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It was only
so I could see the chat

00:36:09.736 --> 00:36:11.780
window, as well.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.450
One way or another.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:18.872
MATT GAUNT: So my approach I've
taken with horizontal

00:36:18.872 --> 00:36:23.010
scroll view in the past, has
been, I've done it myself with

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.900
taking the gallery
source code.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.800
Someone had actually taken
that and wanted to add in

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.840
recycling of views.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.190
So there's an example somewhere
on Stack Overflow

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.630
where they've posted
a load of code.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.600
If you really want to get your
hands dirty, that might be one

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.370
way of doing it.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.770
But it's a lot of extra work.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.180
If you can find the library
on GitHub, then

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.430
I'd stick with that.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.289
That would be kind of only
my input on that.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.720
GIUSEPPE: Yossi, Yossi it is
too strange to see you too

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.562
late today.

00:39:11.562 --> 00:39:13.570
What happened?

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.230
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, l was waiting
for the Hangout.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:21.320
And the Hangout was late, so
I went to do other stuff.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.470
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
Yeah, we were.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.250
Sorry about that.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.200
We were seven minutes late today
because we were setting

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.450
up in the studio.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.260
I have no other excuse.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.970
Let's go to the next question
in the moderator.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.940
MATT GAUNT: So next question
is, what is the reasoning

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.720
behind making the method setText
in TextView final?

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.660
And Chris has responded with,
I question why you need to

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.910
override the method.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.970
Fair enough.

00:39:52.555 --> 00:39:56.100
Yeah, why would it be
defined as final?

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.760
And yeah, why would you
need to override it?

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.322
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know.

00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:00.080
Might check the source to see
if there are any comments.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.020
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I would check
the source, as well.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.110
I was thinking that.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.740
MATT GAUNT: Use the source.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.210
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I might
check it now.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.460
NICK BUTCHER: That'll
make for good TV.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.790
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You can just
hold the thought for a second.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.360
NICK BUTCHER: I hope the is,
clearly, we don't know.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.120
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Unless it's
a comment in the source.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.970
NICK BUTCHER: There is another
question in the moderator.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.270
It's Etienne.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.570
It says, I have been able
to implement a custom

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.350
MultiAutoCompleteTextView
backed by a

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:30.160
SimpleCursorAdapter with
a custom tokenizer.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.420
I was just wondering, is it
possible to implement this

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.670
using the CursorLoader
instead?

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.460
I have not done
MultiAutoCompleteTextView.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.400
Has anyone done that before?

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.410
I've done a regular one.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.930
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.180
NICK BUTCHER: Has anyone got
any experience with that?

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.290
I guess it sounds like it could
be possible, instead.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:58.165
I mean, when you're doing an
AutoCompleteTextView, it's

00:40:58.165 --> 00:41:00.175
best if you have a way to
asynchronously fire off a

00:41:00.175 --> 00:41:01.801
query against your data
source and return back

00:41:01.801 --> 00:41:03.532
a data set to be--

00:41:03.532 --> 00:41:06.520
to provide the autocomplete
suggestions.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.175
So you could use the
load infrastructure

00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:09.390
for doing that stuff.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.850
But if you've got it working
using, probably, the

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:16.590
AsyncQueryHandler, I imagine,
at the moment, then probably

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.220
stick with that.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.752
But I don't see any innate
advantages to moving.

00:41:20.752 --> 00:41:24.910
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, she's just
posted a Stack Overflow link.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.330
So maybe we can add it to the
comments to see if anyone else

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:34.260
can add another.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.780
NICK BUTCHER: A bit later.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.130
What are you doing Rich?

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.750
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It looks like
setText is final because it's

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.560
the helper method.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.930
There is setText which takes
text and a buffer type, which

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:46.170
isn't final.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.747
So it just fixes the buffer type
on the text that you're

00:41:48.747 --> 00:41:48.931
passing in.

00:41:48.931 --> 00:41:50.450
NICK BUTCHER: And what
is it passing?

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.930
What's the buffer type?

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:56.600
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [? M ?]
buffer type.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.850
It's a long file.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.825
NICK BUTCHER: Who is that with
the crazy Android cake?

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:02.610
MATT GAUNT: My guess
would be Yossi.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.736
YOSSI ELKRIEF: It's
me, it's me.

00:42:04.736 --> 00:42:07.410
Yeah, guessed it right.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:07.930
NICK BUTCHER: 10M?

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:08.990
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.580
10 million downloads.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.040
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.710
NICK BUTCHER: 10 million
downloads, for who?

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:14.846
CHRIS BANES: Well done.

00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:16.250
GIUSEPPE: Bravo, bravo, bravo.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.718
Bravo.

00:42:16.718 --> 00:42:19.625
Bravo.

00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:21.485
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Passes
in buffer type normal.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.710
So setText is final because
it passes in a

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.460
buffer type of normal.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.090
But if you want to override
setText, you setText, which

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.340
takes the string and
the buffer type.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.700
CHRIS BANES: Rich, is it because
setText is remotable?

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.120
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Nope.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.166
It's not, is it?

00:42:41.166 --> 00:42:41.582
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:42:41.582 --> 00:42:43.930
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE],
as well?

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.556
CHRIS BANES: Well, I hope so.

00:42:46.556 --> 00:42:46.960
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Or
do you just know

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.290
that setText is remotable?

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:49.540
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, it
must be, right?

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:53.730
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It might
be you're right.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.650
Could be.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:57.610
CHRIS BANES: There might be
some reflection and stuff

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:58.860
going on in the background,
isn't there?

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:06.600
NICK BUTCHER: Are
there any other

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.130
questions that we've missed?

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.570
Have they all come in?

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.490
MATT GAUNT: I think so.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.230
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Finished
up the moderator.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.410
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think
we flied through it today.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:16.460
PETER BROOKS: I've got
some question here.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.690
NICK BUTCHER: Please.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.970
PETER BROOKS: It's a bit about
the security discussion you

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.270
had earlier.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:25.840
I was wondering, because I'm at
the moment developing some

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.350
framework, where the developer
that uses this framework needs

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.830
to make some configuration
files.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:36.280
So we need to give the framework
some key value

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.340
pairs, somehow.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.850
And I've wondered, where
would I let the

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.200
developer store this?

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.990
Since if I understood it right,
if he put it to the

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.740
resources, every other app
code accesses via code,

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.180
because they are not
private to that.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.120
And of course, that's also what
you mentioned earlier.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.120
I know that anywhere where I
store it on the device, it

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:56.460
won't be safe.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.510
It just obfuscated somehow.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:03.270
But where could I let him put
it so that it's at least so

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.280
much obfuscated that another
app couldn't

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.850
access it via code?

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.430
RICHARD HYNDMAN: So I'm not
quite sure what you mean by if

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.670
it's in the resources, another
app would be able to

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.380
access it via code.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.830
PETER BROOKS: Yeah. perhaps
that's the first question.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:21.940
If I got [INAUDIBLE], another
app can have access to the

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.150
resources of another app via
the Package Manager Class?

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.800
So another app could just--

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:35.030
I thought about some XML file
that stores the configuration.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.850
But that way, another app could
just load it via Package

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.251
Manager Class?

00:44:40.251 --> 00:44:42.730
Did I got that right, or--

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:44.590
NICK BUTCHER: There are some
areas of your resources which

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:45.120
are accessible.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.700
I mean, that's how you can write
a third-party launcher,

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.070
for example, because you can
access each APK's icon,

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:53.680
resource, and things
like this.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.090
I forget-- do you
guys remember?

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.410
There's some areas of your
resources which aren't public,

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.420
aren't more readable,
and some which are.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:02.800
And I can't, offhand, remember
which is which.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.060
Has anyone got any--

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.710
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'm just
looking it up at the moment.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:08.470
NICK BUTCHER: Everyone's
rapidly Googling.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.876
Beyond that, I mean, any code
resources are obviously going

00:45:13.876 --> 00:45:15.490
to be private to the
application.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.130
Could you force them to
implement an interface or

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.030
something like this instead?

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.550
PETER BROOKS: Yeah, I could,
but I thought it might be a

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:28.980
bit more handy for them, since
I only need key value pairs,

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.340
if they could place it in some
XML file or property file.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.026
NICK BUTCHER: What
was that, Chris?

00:45:33.026 --> 00:45:35.860
CHRIS BANES: You can
put it in assets.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.650
NICK BUTCHER: So assets
isn't readable,

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.630
whereas resources is?

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.890
PETER BROOKS: Isn't it?

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:40.290
OK.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.960
Because as I looked, you can get
from the Package Manager

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.590
the resource.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.985
And from the resource
class you can also

00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:48.740
access the asset directory.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.626
But I might have
got that wrong.

00:45:50.626 --> 00:45:52.275
CHRIS BANES: I don't remember
why you can access assets.

00:45:55.666 --> 00:45:57.430
NICK BUTCHER: Or is it even
in res.raw, maybe?

00:46:03.842 --> 00:46:05.910
CHRIS BANES: I can't remember,
but I thought before there was

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.625
one area which is public and
one area that isn't.

00:46:07.625 --> 00:46:10.130
But I can't remember, offhand,
which is which.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.380
Don't know if you guys
know, either.

00:46:13.787 --> 00:46:15.950
NICK BUTCHER: So is this some
kind of client secret or

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.760
something like this that they
need to have in their

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.440
application?

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.000
Or an identifier of some sort?

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.840
PETER BROOKS: Sorry?

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.430
NICK BUTCHER: So, what is
the key value pair,

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:26.120
you're trying to--

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.350
PETER BROOKS: It's first some
server address that I need to

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.360
install, that shouldn't be so
sensitive, and some kind of

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:39.260
application ID to authenticate
against the server.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.684
CHRIS BANES: Can't they just
define it in code?

00:46:41.684 --> 00:46:44.580
Can't you just have a hash
mark, and just--

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:44.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.420
PETER BROOKS: Yeah, it could,
but I thought it might be a

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.470
bit more handy for the
developers if they use the

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.230
framework and they don't
need to write--

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.040
because at the moment,
they don't need to

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.370
write any other code.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:00.310
And so this would be just for
configuration, implementing

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:01.860
interfaces, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.310
Yeah, it would work.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.435
CHRIS BANES: So if you write the
framework, and they don't

00:47:06.435 --> 00:47:08.790
have to write any code, what
does your framework do?

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.090
PETER BROOKS: Synchronizing.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:12.680
It's for--

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:21.350
should synchronize Java
objects to a server

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:22.170
transparently.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:27.360
So actually, there should be
only less code, as less code

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.560
as possible needed from
the developer.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.020
HUGO VISSER: I wouldn't mind
passing something through code

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.860
for configuration, since it
would also [? time ?]

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.630
check stuff.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.850
NICK BUTCHER: The standard way
most apps seems to be doing

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.840
it-- like Maps API and Backup
Server and stuff--is a

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.510
metadata tag in your
manifest, right?

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:49.470
PETER BROOKS: Yeah, that's also
what I thought about in

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.170
the first place.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.900
Then I read that you can access
via the Package Manager

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.350
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:59.490
So I thought it might be nice
if at least other apps can't

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.185
access the key via code.

00:48:01.185 --> 00:48:05.180
So of course, as long as it's on
the device, you can get it

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.910
out there, but perhaps
not via another

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:11.180
application on your device.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.450
NICK BUTCHER: It comes down
to, I guess that's the

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:15.130
convention, so I think that
would be the conventional way

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:16.660
most people will
be used to it.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.520
But yeah, if you would make it
much harder for apps to read

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.990
them, then yeah, you could
put it in code.

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:24.650
PETER BROOKS: Thanks, guys.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:25.900
NICK BUTCHER: You're welcome.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.810
All righty.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:31.900
Any other questions?

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.820
I've seen there's a few in
the G+ thread as well.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.020
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'm starting
to look at them now.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.510
Mostly, it's about the privacy
issues, protecting your

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.760
application.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.790
NICK BUTCHER: Is there an
example on how to style the

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:52.170
preference widgets from
PreferenceActivity?

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.430
I find it difficult to style the
list of radio buttons from

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:58.510
a ListPrefence, for example.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:59.880
Has anyone done this?

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.040
MATT GAUNT: No, I was
always [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.100
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
Absolutely not.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.580
I always just make my own.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.060
MATT GAUNT: I thought that
that was the point of

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.540
PreferenceActivity, just kind
of does everything for you,

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.396
and you kind of--

00:49:10.396 --> 00:49:12.110
NICK BUTCHER: It's
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:12.900
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You can
choose your theme.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.750
MATT GAUNT: There's a light
theme and a dark theme.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.710
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Why would
you want deviate?

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.520
MATT GAUNT: I mean, Chris, is
this something you might be

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.740
able to do where you could
insert a theme at run time?

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:24.300
CHRIS BANES: I don't know.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.340
I don't know if the preference
styles are

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.090
actually public there.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.900
They might be internal.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.800
So I don't think you
can override them.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:31.950
I don't know.

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:34.870
I've never done it, so
I've never looked.

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.440
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I'd verge
on the side of not

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.120
wanting to do that.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.160
I think there's some utility
to preferences looking the

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.190
same and operating the same.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:46.127
Yeah, you've got the choice of
light or dark, but that's

00:49:46.127 --> 00:49:47.377
about it, really.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.460
There is something like unified
preferences, as well,

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.590
if you look at the library.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.602
Unified preferences, that's
quite a nice little library

00:49:54.602 --> 00:49:56.880
which helps you to do this
kind of thing and produce

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.600
fragment-based preferences,
which work across phones and

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.120
tablets, as well.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.760
So I think there's some utility
in not doing this,

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.970
unless there's a specific thing

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.220
you're trying to achieve.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.000
Cool.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:11.580
I feel like we're running out
of questions, unless there's

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.560
anything live.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.030
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.400
Anyone have any last
questions?

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.860
I think someone just put
something in the chat window.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.820
NICK BUTCHER: Oh yeah?

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.220
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I guess,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:23.460
No.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:23.735
OK.

00:50:23.735 --> 00:50:24.985
It's just him saying OK.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.090
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, here's one.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.530
In Java, I can start an
application with my custom

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.210
class loader.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:33.215
Is there a way to do
it in Android?

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.480
You can, can't you, right?

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.760
Didn't Fred write an article on
the Android Developer blog

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.380
about this?

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.480
RICHARD HYNDMAN: That was for
loading class files off the

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.878
internet and then loading inside
your application with

00:50:44.878 --> 00:50:46.740
the class loader, but not
a custom class loader.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.530
I'm not quite sure
what he means.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.820
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, you can't
do a custom class loader?

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.570
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I don't know
what he means by a custom

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:52.820
class loader.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.300
CHRIS BANES: I didn't
think you could

00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:58.870
change a class loader.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.550
NICK BUTCHER: No, I don't
think so either.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.800
Think this might be
a Dalvik thing.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.360
Ah, there's a next page of the
moderator questions as well.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.270
Perhaps we hadn't answered
them all.

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:19.800
Answered that one.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.445
Is there any way to accept
some parts of a software

00:51:23.445 --> 00:51:28.330
update and reject others,
asks Bob of BBB.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:30.580
No.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.430
Not unless you're coding your
own kind of update mechanism.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:34.680
But not through the
Play Store.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:38.710
Last question.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:41.010
Cy from Southend says, now
that the protection level

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:43.990
definition of change
configuration has been changed

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.213
in Jellybean, breaking apps like
MoreLocale2, is there a

00:51:48.213 --> 00:51:50.125
way to change a device
language to a custom

00:51:50.125 --> 00:51:51.375
one, such as Welsh?

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.082
Anyone know that?

00:51:58.082 --> 00:51:59.530
RICHARD HYNDMAN: No, I'm
just looking it up now.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:00.650
NICK BUTCHER: So is this one
of the settings that I

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.270
wasn't aware of?

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.976
Is this one of the settings that
moved from local settings

00:52:03.976 --> 00:52:06.430
to global settings and had
their protection changed?

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:07.900
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Allows an
application to modify their

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:14.800
current configuration, such as
Locale since API level one.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.620
What's changed about it?

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:18.480
NICK BUTCHER: The protection
level, it says.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.105
I'm guessing it had gone
to system signature.

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:24.250
CHRIS BANES: Is it the
secure setting stuff?

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:25.686
NICK BUTCHER: That's what I
thought, yeah, with the

00:52:25.686 --> 00:52:28.150
multi-user stuff.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:29.170
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It may be
because of the multi-user--

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:31.280
NICK BUTCHER: That's my gut
feeling of what the answer is,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.400
in which case it's the same
answer as we gave before, that

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.610
many of these things, it's not
that we've changed it, because

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.965
there wasn't ever a very
well-defined API for it.

00:52:39.965 --> 00:52:40.840
You weren't supposed
to be able do this.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.955
It's just that you were able to
poke certain settings into

00:52:42.955 --> 00:52:45.340
the thing, and behavior
would change.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.260
But it wasn't like it was a
well-defined API that we

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.510
guaranteed not to break.

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.350
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Changing device
language in Locale from

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.120
inside an app doesn't sound
like something--

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.395
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I would
just send the users to the

00:52:57.395 --> 00:52:59.080
appropriate screen in
settings, really.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.210
Fire off an intent.

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.320
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.240
NICK BUTCHER: I mean, I know for
apps like Locale, that's

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.450
not going to be exactly the
behavior you want, but that's

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.700
what the platform supports.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.300
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.200
In which case, it's going
on 3 o'clock.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.475
We'ver run out of
questions in the

00:53:16.475 --> 00:53:17.990
moderator and the G+ string.

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:20.985
I can finally get this
echo out of my ear.

00:53:20.985 --> 00:53:22.125
That feels good.

00:53:22.125 --> 00:53:23.680
And thank you for joining
us today.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.716
We'll be back at the normal
time for next

00:53:25.716 --> 00:53:26.565
week's office hours.

00:53:26.565 --> 00:53:29.722
But then I'm guessing there'll
be a hiatus for Christmas, for

00:53:29.722 --> 00:53:31.930
the holiday break for
a couple of weeks.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:34.933
And we'll be back-- well, we'll
decide by next week when

00:53:34.933 --> 00:53:36.066
we'll be back after Christmas.

00:53:36.066 --> 00:53:38.730
But thanks, you all, for joining
us again, and we'll

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:40.020
catch you next week.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.530
NICK BUTCHER: Cheers, guys.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.780
GIUSEPPE: Thank you.
