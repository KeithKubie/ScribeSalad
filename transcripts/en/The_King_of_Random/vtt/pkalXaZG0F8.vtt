What's up guys? We are back. And in this video today, we're modifying an idea we tried out in a previous project video.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.399
It's called the car hero key box. You might remember from that video,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.020
we took a child's vitamin container and modified it to become a secret hiding place for car keys.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.639
Which is extremely strong and could be hidden out of sight and with three young kids running around,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.730
I can't tell you how many times that actually saved me for being locked out of the vehicle.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.069
When I released that video, I noticed the comments filled up with concerns from people mentioning that today's cars use

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.529
transponders instead of keys. And that is a legitimate concern, so the purpose of this video today is to put the

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.049
transponder to the test. Now for anyone who is unfamiliar,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.500
let's talk about what a transponder is.  The technology in these things allows your car to recognize when you are actually inside it. So rather

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.770
than having to start your car with the car keys, now it's just a simple push of a button

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.329
Now you might remember I did a video for Castro motor oil, which required me to buy a new vehicle.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.419
When I bought this new vehicle here, it came with the transponder,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.980
so it's a perfect opportunity to put this to the test. This right here is my new car hero key box,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.289
you can see there's one small modification from the original version. The container is a lot smaller. The reason is that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.159
children's vitamins were the cheapest thing I could find before, and they still cost four or five dollars.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.840
But seasonings like this, only cost about a buck. And the mouth of the container is just wide enough to accept the key fob.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.170
Now the main concern I saw raised from people in the comments, was if you had a transponder stuck to the bottom of your vehicle,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.960
would it be in close enough range that a stranger could hop in, start your car and drive away?

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.780
The purpose of this video is to find out. Okay guys, we're ready for the test. And for this I want to try two

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.029
experiments. For the first experiment we're going to take this inside the car with us and see if we can get the vehicle to start.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.130
For test number two, we're going to mount this up underneath the vehicle in the hiding place we intended to go. And we'll see if

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.369
that makes any difference

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.459
So I'm back in my car right now, and I do not have my transponder with me. So theoretically my car should not start.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.049
Yeah, and you can see right there,

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.949
it says the key is not detected. Now if this transponder is anywhere in the car,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.850
it will be picked up.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.780
But you can see just holding it two feet out,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.879
the key is not detected by the vehicle here. If I bring it within about a foot,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.879
then the car recognizes it. So inside the vehicle, apparently it will work.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.428
Now, these neodymium magnets aren't extremely strong. And the underside of your vehicle is mostly made of steel.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.059
So you can virtually pick any nook and cranny underneath your vehicle to stick this to,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640
and it's not coming off.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.440
Beautiful. All right guys, here's the moment of truth. Our key box has been hidden underneath the vehicle,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.740
so if we press the button, what's going to happen?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.860
It says the key is still not detected. Which means the vehicle doesn't recognize the transponder anywhere.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.800
This is good news, because it means you can carry a spare transponder underneath your vehicle, and your vehicle won't even know it's there.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.359
I tried putting my car hero key box on the windshield and the roof of the vehicle, and the car still started.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.699
But in the wheel wells, and underneath the vehicle, it was not recognized. So based on these experiments here today guys,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.600
I would say that a spare transponder hidden in the car hero key box underneath your vehicle,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.379
is a pretty safe way to go. But just remember that every car is a little bit different,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.539
so go ahead and double check that this works with yours as well.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.379
Thanks for joining me for this experiment guys. I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.800
I am today.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.750
Is that right? (Doctor: Not every day but close) No kidding really?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.830
(Doctor: I recognized you from there, that's pretty good.) For real? Check this out! Right here! Just got recognized! Doctor's in the house!

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.330
*Chuckle* Doctor: Random happens.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.249
