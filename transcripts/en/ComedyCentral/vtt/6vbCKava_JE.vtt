00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:04.137
SO PEOPLE
WOULDN'T REDEEM THE REBATE.

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:06.907
BUT REALLY IN THE END,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.643
WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OF THIS

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.445
IS FRIENDSHIP.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.647
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.217
- AND DOING THIS
I MADE SOME VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.953
RAY PREMUS
WAS ONE OF THEM.

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:21.421
- WHO?

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.991 line:0%
 
- RAY PREMUS.
- OH.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.426 line:0%
 
- HE WAS WILLING
TO DRINK PEE.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.929
- PEE?
- YEAH.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:29.930
- WHOSE PEE?

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.498
- NO, JUST ANYONE'S PEE.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.133
- ANYONE'S PEE?
- HE SAYS THERE'S NO GERMS.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.636
- MAYBE THEY CAN DRINK
MY GRANDSON'S PEE.

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:38.105
IT'S VERY CLEAN.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.140
YEAH?

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.410
- WHY--
- BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.945
WHY DRINK MY PEE
OR YOUR PEE?

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.813
- YOU'RE PROMOTING
YOUR GRANDSON'S PEE.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.583
- I AM PROMOTING BECAUSE
GRANDSON'S PEE SOMETIMES HELPS.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.451
IT REALLY HELPS.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.754
- HAVE YOU DRANK
YOUR GRANDSON'S PEE?

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.155
- YEAH.
- WHY?

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.423
- I WAS SCARED.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.025
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU WERE SCARED?

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.594
- YEAH, SOMETIMES
YOU'RE SCARED FOR SOMETHING.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.162
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:03.530
- ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING,

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.098
YOU DRINK
THE GRANDSON'S PEE,

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.800
AND IT'S GONNA HELP YOU.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.602
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.104
WHY DOES IT HELP YOU IF
YOU DRINK YOUR GRANDSON'S PEE?

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:12.673
- THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY,
YEAH.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.675
- WHO SAYS THAT?
- MY GRANDMA.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.211
- YOUR GRANDMA SAID--
- LONG TIME AGO, YEAH.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.613
- YOU DRINK YOUR GRANDSON'S
PEE IF YOU GET SCARED?

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.883
- NOT GRANDSON'S.
ANY LITTLE KID.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.084
- YOU DRINK ANY--

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.319
- NOT OVER AGE OF FIVE,

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.454
BECAUSE BEFORE
OVER AGE OF FIVE,

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.523
IT'S TERRIBLE.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:32.426
- I HAVE NEVER--
- I AM SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.560
- BUT WHY--

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:34.895
- YEAH, IF YOU'RE SCARED,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.797
YOU DRINK
THE SMALL CHILD'S PEE.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.534
IT HELPS.
I HEARD FROM MY GRANDMA.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.370
YOU CAN ASK YOUR PARENTS
OR GRANDPARENTS.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.405
MAYBE THEY TELL YOU TOO.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.008
- I WILL ASK, I GUESS.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.844
- THANK YOU
FOR GIVING THIS IDEA.
