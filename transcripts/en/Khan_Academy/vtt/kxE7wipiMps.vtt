00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.576
- [Voiceover] Now we're
gonna take the ideas

00:00:02.576 --> 00:00:04.927
from the last video and
learn how to sketch in

00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:08.240
these exponentials really rapidly.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.407
Now I gonna move this up and
we'll do a couple of examples.

00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:18.172
Here's an example circuit
I have already set up.

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:20.766
It's an RC circuit, this is 1000 ohms,

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.561
and this is two microfarad capacitor.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.527
And this voltage source
provides a step voltage to us.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:30.474
It's gonna start out at one
volt, and then step rapidly

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:34.510
down to zero volts at times equals zero.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.668
And then again at ten milliseconds,

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:41.193
it'll step up again

00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:42.925
to one volt and continue that way.

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:46.383
This can be a clock in a
circuit, in a digital circuit,

00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:49.762
or it can be any kind of a digital signal.

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:51.285
What we want to know, is we want

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.135
to find this voltage right here.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:54.251
What does that look like?

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:57.181
We're gonna use what we
know about RC waveforms

00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:00.234
to tell us what's gonna
happen here, really quickly.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:03.110
We don't need to use a
computer to simulate this.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.121
So, first thing I need to know,

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:06.976
is what's the RC time constants?

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:11.143
RC equals one thousand, one K,

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:17.362
times two microfarads,

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:21.237
and that equals two K times,

00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:24.705
K is plus three, micro is minus six,

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:28.004
so this is two times
ten to the minus three

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.549
or two milliseconds.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.447
So I can actually go over here to my chart

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:37.614
and I can put a spot right
here at two milliseconds.

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:41.570
Right there, there's five milliseconds,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.650
there's five, there's about
two and rapidly what I know,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.825
is that that line is gonna look roughly,

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:50.938
like this.

00:01:50.938 --> 00:01:54.076
It's gonna start, of course,
it's gonna start right here

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.059
and that line's gonna
go right through here.

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:59.226
So, let's see if I can sketch that in.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.938
That's about what that's gonna look like.

00:02:02.938 --> 00:02:04.710
Now, on the other side, when it goes up,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.576
it's gonna start here

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:09.496
and it's gonna go up to where?

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.647
It's gonna go two more milliseconds.

00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:14.205
One, two.

00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:16.838
It's about two more milliseconds.

00:02:16.838 --> 00:02:19.312
That's the final value of that voltage.

00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:20.876
And I can draw another
line here like this,

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:22.626
I can sketch that in.

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.025
And the same thing's
gonna happen over here.

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.836
As soon as that goes down,
I go two milliseconds over.

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:30.222
It's gonna go right through about there.

00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:32.855
Start here.

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.715
And down I go.

00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:37.616
Now, let me get a little more exact.

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.797
What I want to do now is do a
little better job sketching in

00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:43.189
this exponential curve.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.353
And we know that it's about
37 percent, right about there.

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:50.605
Here's about 37 percent

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:54.127
of the starting voltage, right there.

00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:56.479
So that now I just use my sketching skills

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.151
and I just smooth in some kind

00:02:59.151 --> 00:03:01.252
of curve that looks like that.

00:03:01.252 --> 00:03:03.932
And on the other side,
I come down 37 percent,

00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:07.516
which is roughly right about there.

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:11.599
And I can draw, again, I
can just sketch this in.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.615
And that'll come up to some
value there, finishing value.

00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:19.282
And the same thing here,
I go 37 percent up,

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:22.491
the exponential's gonna go through that.

00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:26.668
So it's gonna come down and
then curve off like this.

00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:28.539
And that's gonna be my estimate.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.972
Now, I didn't use a computer to do that.

00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:32.166
How do we know if we got it right?

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.570
Well, I did use a computer once,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.134
so here's what it's gonna look like.

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:38.226
Let me turn that on.

00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:41.059
And we'll move it up a little bit.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.063
And we can compare what we got.

00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:47.909
I simulated this in Excel,
just using the equations

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.462
to get a really precise answer.

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.557
And what you notice, is our
sketch looks pretty good,

00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:55.487
it looks pretty close to that.

00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:58.786
So what we're comparing,
is compare this, to that.

00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:01.299
And that's pretty similar, that's not bad.

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.775
And that tells me that our output signal,

00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:05.260
our voltage on the capacitor,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.318
is following the digital
signal, fairly well.

00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:10.458
And it's reaching its high level.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.767
And it's rapidly coming
down as fast as it can.

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:16.943
So, let me do one more,
let me do one more problem

00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:20.026
and we'll change the capacitor value.

00:04:25.275 --> 00:04:28.651
Now, the change here is four microferads.

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:30.166
This is still one K.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:31.984
This is four microferads.

00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:33.877
So, RC, let's do it again real fast.

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.977
RC equals one K

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:41.175
times four microfarads

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:44.008
and that equals four milliseconds.

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:49.078
So now I know that the time
constant is four milliseconds.

00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:51.540
That means that I know
that straight line sketch,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.701
here's five milliseconds, it
goes through right about here.

00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:57.204
I start up here.

00:04:57.204 --> 00:04:59.788
I can sketch in a
straight line, like that.

00:04:59.788 --> 00:05:02.343
It goes roughly like that.

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:03.488
Same thing over here.

00:05:03.488 --> 00:05:04.964
I can go over another four milliseconds.

00:05:04.964 --> 00:05:08.283
Up like that.

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:12.086
And sketch in my slope.

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:14.301
And we'll do the third one over here.

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:16.270
Here's four milliseconds after the change,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.956
is right about there.

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:19.802
And I sketch the line in.

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:23.909
And now we'll go back and
do our 37 percent trick.

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.368
Which is 37 percent, is right about there.

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:30.326
And we'll come up, it
goes through right there.

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:32.540
And if I sketch it in now,
what's gonna happen is,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.290
it's gonna go through that

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.240
and something over there's gonna happen.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.919
I don't know if it's gonna finish.

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.977
It might, it might not.

00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:44.351
This one's gonna go up, same way.

00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:46.076
Let's do 37 percent down.

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:48.128
It's about there.

00:05:48.128 --> 00:05:50.006
Accurate enough.

00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:52.506
And we'll sketch in this line.

00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.554
And then we'll do the
same thing over here,

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:57.972
up 37 percent.

00:05:57.972 --> 00:06:01.044
And down we go.

00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:04.454
Now, let me show you the
answer that I calculated

00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:05.805
with the computer.

00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:07.275
We'll see how that looks.

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:08.692
Let's move it up.

00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:13.871
And we did pretty well.

00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:17.927
Notice how down here, notice
how down in this area here,

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:20.797
we sort of got it, that's pretty accurate.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.846
I missed a little bit out here.

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:24.374
That's okay, that's okay.

00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:27.652
But with that time constant,
we can notice right away

00:06:27.652 --> 00:06:31.452
that this waveform is
at risk of not making it

00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:33.558
all the way down to the final value.

00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:37.704
Before it's asked to turn up
and go around the other way.

00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:40.460
So that kind of intuition,
that kind of understanding

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.670
of an exponential curve,
really makes you very quick.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.763
You can do this manually.

00:06:44.763 --> 00:06:46.976
And in your head, you can sketch out

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:49.967
what these exponentials look like.

00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:51.942
The time point here, this line right here,

00:06:51.942 --> 00:06:54.161
that's RC seconds after it drops.

00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:55.928
That's the basic thing.

00:06:55.928 --> 00:06:57.943
And the other one is
this point right here.

00:06:57.943 --> 00:07:00.928
That's about 37 percent

00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:04.410
of where it started from.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.679
Thirty seven percent to go.

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:09.466
So that's just a nice little skill to have

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:11.522
when you're looking at exponentials,

00:07:11.522 --> 00:07:13.659
which you do all the time if
you're designing computers.

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.949
Or any other kind of circuit that has

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.532
sudden changes in
voltage like we had here.
