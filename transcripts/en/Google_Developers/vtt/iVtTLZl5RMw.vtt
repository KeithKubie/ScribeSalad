At Genii Games, what
we do is develop

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.420
African coach or
teaching apps for kids.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.250
What I've had to
do in terms of this

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.760
is go back to even my
own secondary school

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.849
to pick out my teachers.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.640
I mean, the ones who
taught me [INAUDIBLE],

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.210
taught me [INAUDIBLE] back then.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.210
So I had to work with
these different people.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.793
What they've done
is they've helped me

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:23.670
in terms of structuring
this content.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.440
And to date, what I have with
them is a good relationship

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.480
that ensures that I
can go back to them

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.530
for vetting of this
content or even updating

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.770
of the present ones we have.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.640
Interestingly, times I've spent
with customers, specifically,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.500
it's been-- because
we build mechanisms

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.460
into our applications that
allow for these customers

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.090
to reach out to us with feedback
and things like that to better

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.860
our products going forward.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.930
I mean, I've had
situations where

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.370
we go from just them
sending feedback

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.662
to connecting via Skype.

00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:57.620
And most of these people,
the interesting thing

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.680
is I've never met them.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.350
And it's always interesting
when we're Skyping

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.600
and there's, oh, we love this.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840
Or they're sending
videos of their kids

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.490
using these applications.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.070
My team, we have a mantra
which we call push,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.520
and it's to continue pushing
until something happens.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.230
So that's how we keep
living every day.
