So for the second part of this quiz,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the question is what multiple of Romania's population

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is the population of China?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To solve this, you need to divide the population of China,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which you can extract from the countries variable,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by the population of Romania, which you can also extract from the countries variable.
