Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       Beautiful. Beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       we got snow flakes up in this motherfucker. Jamie.

Speaker 2:          00:00:25       We are live, we are live, have naf. Years ago today snowflakes were in the house so we figured Brian and I were talking the other day and I was thinking that like one of the things that we always, like we always said, oh we didn't talk about this. Oh we didn't talk about that. He's always episodes where whatever subject we get into with the guest, like it doesn't, we don't, sometimes we miss like crazy fucking stories that we, if we had more time we'd talked about, so we decided to do a show just dedicated only to crazy shit that we see online with no guests. Old School, old school, snowflake style. Sometimes you get away from what got you to the dance and there was like a thing that happened like that. We didn't talk about the Paris Hilton video where he, she was on a plane. It's like if we just brought that up, cause I knew I had this whole theory where that was not real.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       You know, like why was her face not blurred? And Brian is the best person I know about calling bullshit about videos online. Hands down. No one comes close. You've, you've nailed so many fucking people that are bullshitting online to hilarious. Like everybody buys into it. Me included. I buy into a lot of them and then you're like, I think it's bullshit in my car man. You're always fucking skeptical. It turns out to be bullshit. It sucks to be me though because I see it on Facebook and I see a post like things posted for years like and a half to go to each one like fig and hey, did you see the one recently where the guy, a cat runs out into traffic. So the guy runs after the cat and does flips over cars now, but I'm sure that it's so fake. If you seen a jammy no.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       Oh see if you can find it. Cause it's preposterous. The people were actually believing the guy jumps over a speeding car in the highway and then does a flip over another car. But it doesn't even look like he misses the car. It's like really shitty the way it's done. Cause like that's he fucked up with the flip. Like if he just did the jump, maybe people would have believed it because the jump luck looks almost real. That he actually might've jumped over the roof of a fucking car. Does any of these thumbnails, uh, well if I can do this, maybe it was it work? Any of these thumbnails? Nope. Nope. Nope. No, no, no, no, no, no. I okay. It usually gets run over by a car. No, just a lot of horrible videos we put [inaudible] it's a dude jumps over car. How about Jude jumps over car to save cat cat over car to that whole cat. Kitty car Joe. Yeah, that's right. The Lawful Kitty cat card jump. That's it. Top One. Watch this guy now watch this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Come on. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:03:14       dangerous look both ways. Probably cross the street. Yeah. This is the straight youtube video.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       I know exactly how they did. [inaudible] I can recreate that

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       dangerous look both ways before you cross the street. This is amazing that something like that, which would allow for that. Something that would have been like an insane movie special effect just 20 years ago now you could do it on your laptop and that's not even what you do. You can just, it's not like, it's not like you know you're, you're a special effects guy. Yeah. Crazy. The technology that's available to the average person today is just off the charts crazy. One of my first special effects I learned how to do is recording something. You could just record yourself sitting down like at a table and then you could just sit there and be like, act like you're talking to somebody to the right of you and then you get up and then you just sit on the other side of the table and go, oh thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       Awe. And they just split in the middle and then put the two together and it's about this being that there's like a moving camera. Well with this, what they probably do at this, they probably had two cameras, probably Gopros or something like that, sitting right next to each other and they recorded it at the same time. But also they put them on like a rack or something maybe. So they're both on the same plane or what they probably did is they filmed it as if a while the cars were going, the cars were just driving by and then they kind of like put him into it using, uh Oh, I see. Okay. So they film it. The cars are driving by and then when there's no cars, then he runs out and jumps. The camera never moves. Yeah. Yeah. So the camera does move while he's running.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       Shake, shake, camera shake. Yeah, we can add that. Yeah. That's so weird. It's, it's, I mean, I'm not doubting it at all, but I'm just saying it's so weird that you could do it so well. The only thing that really fucks it up is when he does the flip, because the flip is just, you're retarded. Yeah. That's just ridiculous. You're just peeing in my face. You know? It's just like before. Then when he jumps over the car, if he just did that and grabbed the cat and then was like holy shit and then stayed in the medium for a second, you might almost believe that he did that. Why wouldn't they just have it be something so amazing and simple instead of like, cause everyone's going to see that go. That's fake as fuck. You know? Not everyone, man. There's, there's some fucking people out there. Yeah, true. The guy jumping over the Lamborghini a couple of years ago and then Kobe Bryant did it and then everybody recreated it. Oh Coby Brian. But he'd do it for real. I don't think anybody really did it for real. So they have the car coming at those age jumping over and Aston Martin or something like that might come. Or the baby they got picked up by the bird. That's another fake one that a lot of people I see on Facebook all the time where it's like a some babies and this

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       huge like bird comes over and picks up the baby and drops it. Like, have you seen that? No, I haven't. That's, that's uh, well that's one that everyone's still thinks to today is real. But it ended up being a college and that was like one of their finals that to make that video, like making it viral, crazy thing to go to school for, make a viral video of bullshit viral video. Egal picks up

Speaker 4:          00:06:20       babies who the eagle swooping in and snatches is, yeah. Oh my God. Here's the thing though, Dude. An Eagle would definitely do that. I mean that just, it doesn't happen very often because eagles are probably scared of people and they stay clear. But it's not like we have some fucking secret friendship with the eagles. I had a f I feel fed a chicken this weekend. It's kind of a fucked up story. But my kids found a wounded hawk and so they, um, they found this wounded hawk in the yard and so they brought the hawk, the Hawk to this, uh, like wildlife rescue center. But before they did, they had to feed it and the heart couldn't fly. So what they fed it, mice and they got mice from the pet store and um, they got these little, the thing they call pinkies, it's really fucked up dude.

Speaker 4:          00:07:09       It's, it's a baby mouse. It was really, the whole thing was very creepy. A little pink ones. Yeah. And so I was like, okay. So they, they fed him a certain amount of them. They had one of them that was still alive. They had one of them that was left. This is like a terror movie, right. So I come home after this weekend on the road and to discover that they have this little baby mouse that they haven't fed the Hawk because they brought the hoc to a veterinarian. The veterinarian takes it to some, you know, place where they take care of wounded animals like that. But now we have this, uh, this baby pinky that will die. It will die of starvation. If you don't do anything, you can't feed it. I mean, it would have to milk you beating with, I don't know what the fuck you would do. It's so small. It needs its mother or you bring it back to the pet store where they're just going to feed it to a snake, right? So I said, I'll just give it to the chickens.

Speaker 3:          00:07:59       That's hard to watch, right? That's a baby feel,

Speaker 4:          00:08:02       dude. It's like life is fucked. It's crazy how ruthless life is, you know? And I didn't have like, my decision was is this, this thing's going to die or it's going to die. So I'm going to take the responsibility away from my hands and and to bring it to a place where it's going to die, it's probably already starving to death because they had it for like over a day with no food. I'm like, this is so crazy. But it's like we decide that there's like, I don't know if it's a meritocracy, what would you call that? There's like a hierarchy of animals. There's a hierarchy of value and we value the life of this wounded hawk more than this baby mouse. And when I fed it to the chickens had all came in to play in such a weird, obvious way that this is life. Like that little thing was huge and my chickens are not that cute. They're not that cute. I mean, they're beautiful. They're interesting animals, but they don't have a sense of like this little

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       tiny little thing did. But I fed that tiny little thing to those chickens and it was like, I don't think, I don't know if I did the right thing. Like I don't know if they, in first of all the chickens, that thing wasn't even on the ground for a second and I mean us second before they mauled it. It was, they are Goddamn Raptors. They're dinosaurs. There is chickens are Goddamn Jurassic Park. We're just really big. So chickens don't do anything but they've pecked at my daughter's before they'll, they'll check to see if they can eat you, you know, they see you might be vulnerable, you might be soft. Oh, she thought your foot was a warm nope. She probably was wondering whether or not shake it, eat you. That's really what the fuck was going on. She probably wasn't thinking you were a bug. Chickens are fucking monsters.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       They're just little monsters. So you can grab those little fuckers. And you know, I was hanging out with this finks cat all week and I was babysitting. My friends thinks and it's amazing how different that kind of breed of cat is to a normal cat. This cat is like a real cat. They, it's almost like a feral animal. Like it would come big come up to me, just grab a Bagel off my plate and go, this is mine. And they run away and, and this is just a kid and I'm like, what the fuck are you to like it just steal from you. Yeah. And it's theirs. They're hotter than a normal cat so they're like really hot. And so you will wake up in the morning and you'll think, oh my God, who am I sleeping up next to? And it's a cat. It's, Whoa, they're hotter.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       They're hotter and a half. They like to snuggle cause they have no first. So it's like if anyone's depressed by when he's catchy, you get, get a few of them, you can line them all up. You feel like that you're sleeping with the person. It's, it's a crazy cat though. It's, it's an interesting cat swing a cat without any hair and sing their wrinkles in their face, I guess. Yeah. It's almost like a little thing. It's not like a cat. Right? Like when you think of any mammal that you keep as a pet would have for when you have a pet that doesn't have further, that's when shit gets real. Yeah. You've got this weird ratcat thing that needs to cuddle with you. Ooh, look at his face or her face it cut. It'll go right up to my dog is bite in the ass and then run it away.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       It's a big animal, man. Yeah. You know what's really crazy is those serve walls. Let's see. We'll have those circles is that is what they have the, the bangles. What are the ones that people have as pets? Like I know Jon Jones as a couple of them. They'd tear shit up though. I don't believe in decline. Your cabinet. I think if you have one of those you have to write or, yeah, that's a real cat that lives in your house. Yeah, they're big. I don't know if it's a all it feels like that's too big. I think that might be one of those ones that they have in Africa, but you don't like get as pets here but there's ones you can get as pets in America that are just fucking, it might be called a survival. But there there's these Cheyenne ass fucking things man. And look at the size of that thing with that little girl. And by the way, like if you have food and you give them food, they growl and hiss while they're eating the food. Like if you give them like a chicken, like

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       some dude at a video of him online, um, feeding his, one of those kinds of cats. And I was like, wow. He was feeding it chicken wings and it was just, it's so like close. They're so close to like a wildcat, like are even a regular cat is pretty fucking wild. They can get pretty wild. You know, regular cats all kill every regular cat you have. You leave them outside with like a bird or something like that, they're going to fuck that bird up. They just kill

Speaker 5:          00:12:24       are cat fights in Hollywood all the time? Oh Dude. He's probably not even a cat fight. It's probably a girl getting our cat vagina ripped open by those fangs. Did you see this? This is a, a a guy, a couple of guys that have a tiger that just living at their house. I just thought it was funny because, uh,

Speaker 6:          00:12:43       wow.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       Whoa. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 6:          00:12:46       Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       Listen to what they're watching. They're watching some Joe Rogan shit on the TV. These guys just have a tiger for a pet. This is the most retarded shit ever. Look how cute it is. It's adorable.

Speaker 6:          00:13:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       Where is this APP? It doesn't say in the description. It's for folks who are watching or listening and not watching. This is a probably like a, it's not a huge cat, but it's probably like 300 pounds, right? Yeah. I would say it's about the size of a mastiff. Yeah. It would have to have really big mastiff. It's, it seems like, okay. Let's say at least 200 plus pounds, right? At two 50 yeah. Oh, more than that probably. Yeah. Okay. Let's call it whatever we were counting, what am I doing here? But just it's going to get bigger and if it decides to kill you, it just does. It's surprising. It's surprising how often people can have those cats and it'd be safe though. I'll tell you that. It is surprising. You think about how many knuckleheads have fucking pet tigers and lions and check. Gregor wants to get one supposedly. Oh Connor, please don't do that. Please don't make me talk about you in my act. If you get eaten, I will have to sir, I love and respect to you, but did you get eaten by a lion? I'm going to talk about you on a pug.

Speaker 5:          00:14:09       Just hanging out like bored as fuck. Wishing I could run outside and kill things. That's

Speaker 4:          00:14:15       the thing about those animals is they have these built in things like a man has or a woman has like a woman has a built in desire, at least most of them. I don't want to assume that you don't for wanting some sort of sexual contact. Almost everyone does. Right? And almost everyone has a, this, this desire to be a part of the same sort of social group. It's always existed, uh, with our species. You know, towns and groups, these animals have always hunted. That's been a part of their life for as long as there've been tigers. I don't know how long it's, I mean, Gee, I don't, I have no idea. It's got to be thousands and thousands of generations. Who knows how many fucking years tigers had been around the form. They're in the now and all that time they'd been killing, kill, kill, kill, kill, eat, eat.

Speaker 4:          00:15:04       It's so arrogant to think that you could just take them and turn them into golden labs. You just, that's so, that's crazy thinking. It's so silly and it's not healthy for the animal. That would be like taking a person who grew up in like rural Ohio and making them live as a Bushman in Africa. You know, just taking them to some place where guys have spears and they have to hunt lions to become a man. And you wouldn't be prepared for that kind of Shit. Neither of these people prepared to or neither is. There's this tiger rather prepared to live with people. It's hold its design. Its whole existence has been to kill up until this moment. This is big cat Derek. We've talked about him a few times on that. We need to get this dude on. He trains these things. Yeah, he lives in Texas and next time we go to Texas.

Speaker 4:          00:15:58       Do you know, I mean this is, I I've, there's, there's thousands of tigers in Texas. Tigers in Texas are like super common sit because of the weather is or I think it's because Texas has crazy wildlife laws. I have a whole bit about it. It's great. They have weird laws. I W I wouldn't mind having a Lama. Are you living on a lama? They get, see mama fine. Steve Rinell, his brother has lamas that he takes to a hunt with them and he packs the lamas out because llamas are like more durable than horses. They don't get cold. They just stand outside in the snow. They don't give a fuck. Like it doesn't even bother them. Like you're freaking out and shivering. The Lama doesn't give a shit. Have you ever thought about upgrading your a little pet farm? You know, you've got chickens like get a little baby goats.

Speaker 4:          00:16:41       Baby goats would be amazing. I have baby go to be cute. Yeah, I think, um, it's, it would be really hard to have a baby goat if you eight goats goat. You know, like if you have a baby sheep and the new ate lamb, you'd be like, okay, what are we doing here? You know, I tell you, man, I've been hunting, I've been fishing. Uh, I've seen animals killed that thing yesterday with that little pinky mouse disturbed me as much as anything I've ever seen. Well, maybe you were supposed to save it. Maybe that's the whole thing. And we're thinking he's going to raise it, eat it. No one had to bring it back to a pet store. And then that guy would have fed it to snakes. That's what they sell them for. They sell them t to feed snakes with snakes. First of all, I'm not saying you shouldn't have a snake.

Speaker 4:          00:17:25       Don't get me wrong. Have you love snakes? I'm not saying you're wrong. If you love whatever you love, you love, as long as you have a pet snake and that snake doesn't need a baby, you're allowed to love that pet snake, but the reality is that pet's neck, that fucking thing would eat a baby at any chance. If you left a baby alone with a giant Anaconda is going to eat that baby 100% of the time, a hundred percent one zero zero fucking evil. They don't give a fuck. They don't care. They don't have like a deep attachment to you because you feed them. There are snakes as it is a very insane animal to keep as a pet. I, but I understand it. I totally understand it. They're beautiful. They're amazing and fascinating and you do get like an electrical feeling when you watch snakes move around. You get this field because there's like this primal fear that you have of snakes and when you have a snake as a pet, it's like it ignites all these little primal triggers in your body. Your body's not your body. To him. Why we were we friends with is we make it an alliance with the enemy.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       Yeah. My friend, the snake and it wraps his arms or fucking body rather around your neck and your arms and you don't, you don't, you're not afraid. Why are you not afraid? You don't think there's that one vegetarian snake, the one snake that would try to be a good dewar or did you see this video today? I don't even talk. There are vegetarian snakes. You see this video of a dog trying to save a fish's life though it really made me go, how is this possible that this dog knows to try to save this fish is light. So he's sitting here like, uh, just putting water on on the fish and then he goes,

Speaker 4:          00:19:02       it really is, it's on live leak. Well, you've got it on Youtube. It's from lively. Yeah, but it says dog tries to save a fish. Yeah. He's literally trying to get water on it

Speaker 3:          00:19:10       and then he's fucking goes to another fish and actually saves this Fisk the fish that comes back to life a little and so crazy. How does he know to do it? He's fucking his nose up too. That's gotta suck. Yeah. Like he's checked to see if it's still alive. Is that giving CPR to a fish? Is that a golden lab? It looks like no, it looks like more of a point year title type of an animal. It's like one of those Japanese mixed with without cause she, you mixed with a retriever. Maybe

Speaker 4:          00:19:35       like maybe a Shiba Inu. Yeah. Yeah. That's weird man. There's, there's an intelligence that animals have a very bizarre, so I mean like we kind of think that the only way to know things is someone has to teach you them. That's kind of how human beings have, we, we've, we've sort of accepted that as just a fact. The only way to know something is if someone teaches you. But there's a lot of shit you know, that, you know, like are a lot of reactions that you have that are, that are built in like, um, Rupert Sheldrake. Cause the guy's been on the podcast before and he had this excellent analogy about, um, what children in, um, big cities are afraid of. And that they're afraid of scary monsters, even though they don't have a reference point. They didn't never really seen a monster, but they're afraid of scary monsters. And I believe I might be butchering this, but I think his supposition was that what's going on is that they have this fear that's built in from back when they were little monkeys from when they were hiding from like leopards and Jaguars. These, these beasts set would have dark teeth or you know, bright white teeth and they would be dark and he would hide the night and try to get you,

Speaker 7:          00:20:48       you know, cause that probably really happened at one point. There was probably this animal that hunted in the darkness, right? And it killed a lot of the ancestors of all the people and somehow or another that's in our system, somehow or another, it's built in like when animals know that they should be breastfeeding. But that's all built in. Like there's all these reward systems and is, there's all these things built in to make sure that you continue the same behavior, the releasement of oxytocin or though the love feeling that you have with comrades and friends and family. Like why is all that stuff there? It's all that is built in to make sure that we keep moving forward. So we think that there's, that's all, that's where all our information comes from. All information comes from human knowledge. All our information comes from the things that we've written down, the things that we've learned about the way we behave.

Speaker 7:          00:21:36       I think some of it is in the bones. I think some of it is deepen the bones. Like it's almost like you're born with a certain amount of information. Cat, cat litter box. Yeah. I mean you're a baby, a cat litter box when you had cats pretty much know what a cat litter boxes from being a kitten. And it's like, wait, you're such a baby. But somehow we put a box down with some weird shit in it, you know, to go in that box and then cover it up and it's weird. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. That's a real good point there. It's built into them. Yeah. And there's this the case with a lot of different behavior that we see in nature. Right? Almost all of it. Instinctual. There's a few learned moments. Like one of the things that I saw that was fascinating was um, orcas trying to teach their young how to hunt.

Speaker 7:          00:22:23       They're teaching their young how to turn over ice islands so that they would make the seals slip down into their mouths and they would put these seals back up and they'd do it all over again. And I was like, Whoa, this is fucked. Was the seals are penguins, one of those. Um, but when they did it, it was so obvious that they were teaching their teaching their little babies. Like, Whoa, they're teaching them tactics. But that's just like people, you have to learn like hunting tactics. You have to learn to stay away though, you know, you can't have the wind in your face. That means the animals you're looking at or the wind behind you, I mean is animals you will, you're looking at, it's going to be in their face so they're going to smell you like there's all these things they have to learn.

Speaker 7:          00:23:02       Okay, got it. I teach you, but how much of an, how much do you have to tell them to actual hunt? Like how much is that as in like, uh, like some sort of a memory system that there's a reward for doing that. Like you ever go fishing? Yeah. You like that feeling. It's awesome. It's great. Except for taking the thing out of the fish. It's grass does not literally, but you know that feeling that you get when you catch a big fish, like a good fish that you can eat like a real one. You're like, well I'll ride to, we're the fucking eat this fish now. It's like this weird primal sort of response thing that we don't, for whatever reason, don't talk about it. But that's why it's fun to even catch and release fish. You know? Like Ari and I were in a Alaska and there, there was like a point in time while we were there where you could only catch and release because they had this, um, they have this like cutoff point where if you don't have a certain amount of salmon going through the weird, they worry that the numbers might be low right then, which is so crazy because they may, if you catch and release like the chances of you harming the animal is like pretty fucking high.

Speaker 7:          00:24:06       It's like the chances of the animal actually living is probably, people don't want to say it, but I researched it after we did the trip and there were thinking that probably should have researched it before we did the trip. But they were thinking that like maybe as many as 20% of all the fish that you catch and release wind up dying. Oh yeah. They get fucked up from those hooks, which totally makes sense. Right. But if you just make them see if they could keep one fish, which is like they usually do, and king salmon fishing, you would catch one and you would keep that one and that one would die and that's all you would be able to fish for it. You'd have to stop unless you keep, you can keep one and do catch and release, which is catch and release is kind of bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       Yeah, cause it's pretty much you're just getting a shotgun to the face and go. Hopefully you live, because I know Barb, a giant as Barb hooked into your face. Yeah, I catch and release is kind of bullshit and that's the only way I've actually fish. I've never actually fixed where I was allowed to eat the fish, these guys to saving a hammerhead shark. Hammerhead sharks. Okay. Here's another hierarchy. Example. Hammerhead sharks are cooler than regular sharks. I'd be way more likely to save a hammerhead shark than a great white because his face has already sat enough, was kind of cool. He's like an alien.

Speaker 7:          00:25:17       That's crazy. Why don't they turn it over and put it back in the water? Hook out. Oh, it's got a hook in it. Yeah. Oh, someone caught it? Yeah. Wow. So did they catch it accidentally? Mm, well that's just part of fishing. If you accidentally catch a shark like, well, but, but it's in a weird that we have this like response that we want this thing to live this murderous fucking feed machine. All it does is feed and we wanted to live. It's super bizarre. Super Bizarre that we want that thing to live. I had a fucking point. What was my point about fish? Oh that eve, there's this reward, this instinct thing that we have built in it. Even when you like catch and release, it's triggered even what it's like, there's a trigger that makes you want to do that and it's built. I think it's some information that people are born with or at least a response to a reality that you're born with.

Speaker 7:          00:26:12       You know, in a very weird way, because it used to be that x amount of years ago and for who knows how many thousands of generations. That's how you made sure he stayed alive when you caught a fish. So it gave you like this reward again. We got one, you know, some fucking Gollum type shit when he finds the ring, you know. And even though all these generations later, we're still getting our fish on styrofoam containers. When you catch a fish, there's this weird release. Maybe you man, maybe there's something wrong with you. Maybe you're just a fucking

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       asshole and you're like, oh fine, thanks.

Speaker 5:          00:26:48       I think it's amazing. In Ohio they have a fishing, but they have ponds like at the work, like the workplaces, uh, my mom used to work at this place and they had issue mungus ponds at lunch you could just go and fish and you know, and just chill out, not think about work. But you had to uh, you know, throw it back in and then go back to work in maybe you don't really see shit like that. Like these big corporations and stuff like that. Fishing pond, right. They stock up with interesting fish.

Speaker 4:          00:27:17       Well, they do that. I think in like when people have like a lot of money, like down south they'll have like a lake stocked with Bass and shit like that. And they'll take clients to it and stuff. I know they do that. Like people that have a lot of money that have um, a big corporations, a lot of times they'll, they'll have like a box at like say like staples center. So anything that's playing there they get to go see, which is kind of cool man. Imagine if you owned like some network or something like that and you could just go take your friends to a button, whatever it is. Lakers game, UFC fight, uh, Kevin Hart's playing. There you go see it. That's fucking baller. That might be like ultimate baller shit to have like a box. Is that okay?

Speaker 5:          00:28:00       Boxworks am I misrepresenting it? Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a corporate, that's how they sell the stadium stuff. You have to buy that. They sell all those pretty much the tickets as well. In some cases you do, but depending on who you are and how big and how much money you spend on your box. So what if you like one of those dudes from like Microsoft? Like if you, one of those, uh, Bruce bomber guys, like the guy who goes crazy. Walmart owns the, Steve Balmer owns the clippers. Yeah. So he owns part of the arena two or something like that. That's, that's high level shit. Yeah. My owns a gun. My friend's dad used to have out box in Columbus, but it was Columbus clippers, but it's Columbus clippers box and a AAA baseball team. Really? But you'd go there. It was really cool. It was like this really nice little they had, it was catered. They had waiters that just came in and everything was free. You'd just had a stocked fridge, uh, all the hotdogs you wanted and it was

Speaker 4:          00:28:48       wow. That's cool. Yeah. Eddie Bravo went to the UFC at one of those. He has a friend who has one of those at the staples center and I was like, what is that? Like? He's like, dude, it's crazy. It's all upholstered. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:28:58       Leather and hors d'oeuvres and fucking the best beer on ice and wine and one for Monday night. Raw event one night. [inaudible] we've got free tickets because my boss at the time is his, one of his good friend has managers, uh, or he's the manager of John Sienna. So we got access to the event, but there was a cavs basketball game going on the same night. Some of my friends stayed in the box, watch the TV of the basketball game, listen to the raw going on outside, and then when something cool came out, we just like took two steps and then washed it, came back and watch the basketball game.

Speaker 4:          00:29:34       I need to go. I don't give a shit enough about sports to, to like a local follow him,

Speaker 7:          00:29:41       but I need to go to an event. I need to go to like one, like real good basketball games. Maybe. Maybe I'll get it. I was hoping to, calves are going to play the clippers and talk in the sea and Lebron play this year, but it didn't happen. God dammit. If you want to go see Lebron play, let's pick a spot and we'll find out where they're going to be and we'll book a show in that town and we'll go see Lebron. And Cleveland is he like, is he like the guy like the Jordan of our generation's space jam too, right? I can't believe I said that because this is a running joke in the UFC because Mike Goldberg one time asked me if Travis looter was the Michael Jordan of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. And I was like, okay, this is a, yeah, no, but you want to see Lebron if you could say, but just to finish my sentence, Travis Luder is like this bad ass American Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

Speaker 7:          00:30:26       He's like, like look super, super high level. Like when he was in the UFC, I was super excited because I was like, this guy's gonna submit a lot of fucking people that you haven't seen submitted before. His left, his level of Jujitsu, super high level. But when Goldberg was saying like the Michael Jordan of it, I was like, that's like so cliche that people do that. They always have to say like his, he the tiger woods of pool as he, the Michael Jordan number zillion just to like, no, he's fucking Travis. Looter like, that's he's Badass. That's who he is. You know? I said the Michael Jordan of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is Marcello Garcia, but that was just cause he's at the time, at least for sure the best and most spectacular guy. But he's not the Michael Jordan. He's Mike, he's Marcello Garcia. He's his own dude. He doesn't have to be the Michael Jordan of something.

Speaker 7:          00:31:09       You Fox. It's like when, when anybody tries to say it's like our version of nigger, like, no, it's not. No, you got your own fucking insult. You can say it's your version of the n word. You just, you're not allowed to know. It means something bad to you. Okay. I get it. I get it. See, I've, um, I've fucking no tolerance for that. What do you think about this hall? Cogan shakes that tired. It makes me sad. Makes me sad that he talks like that. That's what it makes me sad. Hulk Hogan said a bunch of shit about his daughter dating black guys. Like, man, come on in 2015 or whatever the fuck this video was years ago. Wasn't in that sex tape. Whatever. It's from man. It's sad to me that he thinks like that. It's sad. That shit's sad. It's just sad. It's just, it's just people, man, that guy didn't ask to be born black.

Speaker 7:          00:32:02       You didn't ask to be born white. There's cool people, cool fucking people that are black. Um, some of my favorite people I've met of all time have been black. The idea that you would be upset that your daughter would date someone just because they're black. To me it makes me sad. It made me mad at him. Maybe I'd be mad if I was black. It makes me sad. Makes me sad that he thinks that way. You know? And it wasn't even funny. It wasn't like you were saying something funny, you know, if he was saying something funny, man, I'll cut him a break. You know, maybe we try to be funny. He, he's like, well, I, I could do some bad news. The good news is, you know, your, your daughter's dating a strapping six foot four super athlete. The bad news. His name is Tyrone white.

Speaker 7:          00:32:44       And what color do you think Tyrone? Is He a white, he's a giant. He's black and he was always shiny. He's like oily. He's oily. His whole body is like slippery and muscular and oily and he's got addicted. It looks like an eel like an evil eel and, and your daughter loves it. She loves it. She's super happy about it. Right. Okay. I just don't, I don't, you know, it just makes me feel sad. I don't think he's racist though. I think maybe this, yes. No, what he said was racist. Anybody that says he's not a racist. Maybe he says things in private and he thinks of them as being in private and he wants some sort of escape from the PC world that he finds himself in where he is public, where he's public. He has to have these cans, statements. You never hear them swear.

Speaker 7:          00:33:35       You never hear him talk about anything like controversial. He's a businessman. He's selling whole Kogan. It's not even his name. It's his brand. Okay. Maybe when you live a life like that or you're this fucking American superhero years old, years old, you're always doing an act. You know, he's always whole Cogan oh, commanders running rod bro. And I interviewed him. I interviewed him with UFC. It was one of my all time favorite interviews man. Put pull that shit up. Yeah, he was awesome cause spike TV. Ha. It was an honor. It really was an honor. There's two people that I've interviewed where I felt like, well there's a bunch. Obviously Neil degrasse Tyson and uh, Brian Cox. There's a lot of people that I met where it was an honor, but hulk Hogan, I was like, this guy is, this is fucking Hulk Hogan man. This is, I'm can't believe that I've somehow or another have a job. No wrestlers.

Speaker 8:          00:34:23       Oh, time, sports and entertainment. Huge personality. The one and only Hulk Hogan. Welcome aboard sir. How are you? Thank you my brother Joe.

I'm partners with TNA and we just got the green right brother onto my, maybe I should watch myself more because I'm annoying. I'm annoying me right now.

That's the good question. Thank you very much sir.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       Call me brother. At least a dozen times. Yeah, that's a lot of brothers. I'll die happy. I sat behind him that I was there that, that that day. And I sat behind him and I remember the whole time he had this little comb anyways, just combing his hair slowly while watching the UFC. He's put on a show man. He's smart. Look Hulk. Here's the deal. Hoke Hogan is still talked about today. It's 2015 when I was in high school, I was in high school in the 80s. The Hawk was the fucking man. Okay. He was a fucking man back then. He was in rocky. Three man or four? Three, four, three, three, three. Which ones? The Russian. What's four? Then four is Russia. Russia, who's in four? No, three was mr t and hulk Hogan. Right. And it wasn't for, was the Russian all you're right, you're right. You're right. It was three, five of us and shitty way.

Speaker 2:          00:36:58       So those three, I was totally in high school cause I went with this, uh, this chick that I was dating and I remember it very well. Shit, the best popes all time. All time. So I remember, I remember that movie based on the check that I want with not hilarious. He do that you have like those highschool moments we just like, oh yeah, that's like pimps are great. So Hulk Hogan said some racist shit. You don't have to. Par Part of me is like, yeah, it's sad that he thinks that way. I don't know. Again, if if you are black and you're angry at it, I understand. I don't get mad. I get sad book with that one especially. But I, I just, it makes me wonder how many people talk like that when no one's around. How many people say like racist Shit, whether you're holding me every day.

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       I've talked about this all the time. It's my favorite thing to do to animals. Like, but no one could be around unless I'm dating them and I just, I use, I mean I used the f word, the n word, like I, I just f for Gay. The gay slur. Yeah. Cause I think saying it till dog as well. It's, but you're doing it for amusement. It's funny because you don't get to say it anymore. You're silly guy though. See, this is the thing, you're silly. And one of the things about you haven't, excuse me. Pardon me. One of the things about you is, which is funny, is where you automatically like gravitate towards the inappropriate shit to say like racially, sexually, you automatically do it. Like you can't help yourself. So, but you're not a mean person. You certainly aren't racist. Like I know you, you're never ever racist. I'm never racist. I'm just mildly joking. It's just hilarious. It's fun. Wrong Shit. Yeah. That's why I'm

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       a comic. Yeah, right. But that's different.

Speaker 7:          00:38:38       Like if someone somehow or no, they're like stuck a microphone. Your cat's ass. Like one of those jewels that you have in there

Speaker 3:          00:38:43       put on Instagram catchall but yours. I can't believe those are real. First of all. Is that real? I don't think so. You can't be kind of, we get mad Catz not just going to walk around with a diamond and it's as if it's a sticker. I was thinking that sticker might work, but anything to cover the butthole would be great. They can clean their ass with their tongue. They would feel it and clean it. Right. Uh, not if it's like really strong sticker and they wouldn't give a shit, then they would die from impact.

Speaker 7:          00:39:09       Did Shit. Yeah. That's, I don't know. I had a point before all this got started. What was the beginning of it all

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       taught racism saying racist shit cause we don't get to, you know, it's, it's fun to say Shit Racist, not racist shit. My Shit, we're not supposed to a Voodoo shit.

Speaker 7:          00:39:26       Yeah. The differences are that they think that like if you were saying anything that was racist, it would be in jest and in just doesn't bother people. Cause they know they don't, they, you might have to apologize, like, look, I didn't mean for this to get public, but I certainly said it in jest. I was just fucking around with my friends. I love everybody. Then you probably could, you know, people would accept your apology, they'd be mad at you, but they'd accept your apology. But what he was sale is not really in chest, you know, at least it didn't seem like it. It was just, it was just an uncomfortable thing that, you know, and I don't think that the guy at work, however old he is, 60 something years old. I don't think he, he's done learning. You know, it's not like you should just write them off. He should just talk about why he said it and what he, what he you felt and you know, and then he, sorry. I think people can accept that. I don't think I'll glove into the bad guy. I think sometimes people do things like that and everybody all of a sudden is like super mad at him. They hate him forever.

Speaker 7:          00:40:21       He fucked up. You know? That's what I think. I think you fucked up and he fucked up thinking like that and he probably realizes he fucked up when he feels it.

Speaker 3:          00:40:28       I think it's also something though that a lot of people have to like take their own. Like everyone's, it's so easy to blame or say, hey, that guy said that. But if you were to take your whole life and not knowing it, your parts were recorded. Oh, you're fucked. Everyone's fucked. We're fucked. But it's really easy to point like, Oh, this guy is racist, blah, blah, blah. He's a horrible person. But like any of us, you can take it, like you said, put a microphone in my cats by hole like that and, and, and record me and take 10 seconds off of my life and air and put it online and I'm fucked.

Speaker 7:          00:40:59       Yeah. Well that's everything man. Everything. I mean, anything you do, if you're doing an all the time, you're gonna make mistakes. Whether it's walking, if someone just wanted to take clips, are you walking into shit and they followed you around all day? How many times do you walk into things? I walk into things not paying attention. I'm talking, I accidentally bump into a wall or I hit a door when I didn't mean to hit a door. It happens, right? But if someone just followed you all the time and took those snippets and splice them together and go, here's Jamie Vernon, look at this. Fuck. Just walking into walls everywhere he goes. But most of the time, the vast majority of the time, you elegantly navigate your way through the universe. But the Times where you bounce your car door off the look, I understand if you get upset, if somebody dings your car door, but who the fuck hasn't Dang someone's car door.

Speaker 7:          00:41:52       Please step up and raise your hand cause I've never met this person. I have dang people's car doors. Okay. And I've think people's car doors and left a note and told them email, email me or whatever and I'll give you money. It's been a long time since I did that, but I did that. Okay, that's not true. Wait a minute, I didn't ding their car door accidentally hit her bumper and I left a small mark. Okay. I have pinged at guy's door. Not like definitely dinged guides or not. Now that I'm thinking about it, the only times I've ever left a a note of left a note at least once that I can remember. That's not foggy. And that was cause I think a ding there. Pumper. Yeah, I've dinged but it didn't leave a mark door dinner. I'm trying to think, man, it's been a long time. I'm super careful of it now. But back before I was a car nut especially I know of Dang a few doors. I'm, I'm guilty as charged a hundred percent. That's a fucking bad feeling. You don't think about it. You're like, you're in your own head. I gotta get this done. I gotta pay that Bill. Fuck. And then dunk.

Speaker 7:          00:42:55       Can't always be responsible for paying attention. You're gonna make mistakes. You all responsible. I don't mean that. What I mean is you can't be held accountable forever. You got to let it go at a certain point in time. So I think even with this hulk Hogan Guy, he fucked up. Yeah, he fucked up. He shouldn't. Yeah, you're right. He definitely shouldn't think like that. But if we had to follow you around stupid and make a fucking clip of all your life, all the blunders you do in the creepy shit you say in the weird fucking stuff, you Google, guess what? You're a mess to your, oh, you're way more of a mess. If I splice it all together and some sort of a crazy hit real, you know, and that's, it's easy to do for a guy like a whole Cogan, you know, it's easy to do.

Speaker 7:          00:43:36       He's public, he's so public. He's there all the time and that's what pretty much what TMZ does and what they make money for it. They're like, Hey, you know what? We're going to go after Lindsay Lohan. Every single thing Lindsay Lohan or Justin Bieber does, where we're going to make sure everyone knows about it. Here's my feeling about TMC and I'm being completely honest about it. Most of what they're doing as far as like doing this stuff and this guy got arrested for drunk driving and the mostly what they're doing is making fun of preposterous shit that we actually probably would make fun of to like, let's be honest, like every time something happens like Lake Lindsay Lohan, we can say like, oh, they report on Lindsay Lohan, but meanwhile we fucking talk about it. We will talk about on this podcast if something comes up on this podcast. It's crazy in the news that someone has done, you're like shook night runs over somebody with his truck.

Speaker 7:          00:44:24       We're gonna fucking talk about it and where are we going to get our video from? We're going to get a video from TMZ. Everybody wants to that what they're doing is inherently evil and I him, man, I'm not sure cause it seems like they only care about stuff that's happening. They don't have to go after people and peer into their lives and find out who likes strap ons and he, you know, who's into watching weird shit. You know, they don't have to do that because there's so much content just by people being ridiculous that I don't necessarily see them as evil. I see them as just, it's a, it's a new segment of entertainment. I mean there's a lot of in and stand in front of Kanye West House taking pictures of them and shit. There's a lot of that stuff that goes on. But that's just, that's happening.

Speaker 7:          00:45:12       He's crazy. The whole thing is crazy. It's just crazy circus they put on, you know, they, they did a reality show. She did a crazy sex tape. It's like all this stuff is generating all this attention and someone comes in and looks at all the attention. He goes, look at this crazy shit. It's pretty much what we do. Right? Yeah. I mean, you know, we, we might not like break the news. We might not when we're not journalists, but we are, I mean, what does reporting, what does that mean? What do, what do, what do you mean? Are you talking about stuff or are you just simply reporting the facts? Cause most of those shows lay a heavy bit of editing and the editorial review and ideas into their pieces. You know, even like TMZ, when they're, they're making fun of something, it's pretty obvious or making fun of it.

Speaker 7:          00:45:58       They're not reporters, you know, what are they doing? They're doing like some new form of entertainment. It's not that bad. Like everybody pretends that stuff pad. What's just as bad as all the people. Like when you, especially when you're covering reality stars and, and, and like real housewives type shit, like none of it's bad, but if anything's bad, it's like, what are you, who's putting that on TV? Like what are you doing? Like what's that? And if they do something crazy and someone follows them, the people that follow them are bad. But you're not bad for putting these wacky fuckers on TV and feeding him Tequila all day and putting cameras in their face and getting them in a position where they hope that maybe there'll be able to chew through their $50,000 in fucking student debt by being an asshole on TV and generating a following.

Speaker 7:          00:46:40       Right. And becoming some fucking crazy fan favorite on the show because he's the one who likes to throw drinks in people's face and fucking get gangster. You know what, who's forcing them to do that? Well, who is it? But it's not, the whole thing is, is do the whole thing's a circus soda to pick on anybody who's like looking at the circus and commenting on the circus as being the problem. That seems to me to be, that's a little disingenuous. I could see the circus is fine. There's nothing wrong with like a real housewives show. It's nothing wrong with it. And for the people that that can make money by being observed, there's nothing wrong with them either. If they're providing entertainment, whether we want to think of it as traditional entertainment, like a guy who writes a book of cartoons or art or music or anything like that, it's still entertainment. It might not be good in your sense, but neither is burger king. We don't want to put Burger King on trial cause their cheeseburgers suck compared to in and out. You know

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       it's, we should, we should. But I find it fascinating and Co and it's weird that people who focus on the circus or the people that are somehow low lives, it's weird. Isn't that weird? Oh yeah. Oh you're talking to Jamie. All of you talk about it all morning. He's been talking about Rob Schneider getting burglarized all morning. He got burglarized. Yeah. It's $175,000 Willie Mays baseball card was stolen. So what they did is they, they knew he was in Montreal. Whoever did it, you know, for the comedy festival, he's down. They just robbed him blind. That sucks. That's Ugh. That's a big baseball card. Like in baseball card world, that's like almost, you know, so they, they specifically targeted that baseball card. Huh? Prop that. Or they just targeted him because they knew he was in Montreal. Wow. Drop Cam people. Everyone needs job fucking baseball card thing is weird that a piece of paper from the 1950s could be worth so much.

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       It's so strange to me because I understand save you a big Willie Mays fan. I understand that you'll have like some youtube clips that you like to watch or you know, you watch a documentary on him or something and it's amazing for you cause you're a fan. But I can't imagine giving a fuck about his baseball card. I mean, I really can't imagine. I can't imagine buying a baseball card for a guy who alive. Forget about a guy who I get to the beach ball. Here's true bro. But the videos or the baseball history, you fucking idiot. Like you don't have to have baseball cards anymore. The baseball cards were only cool when people didn't have movies. Okay. That's a baseball card. Printers. Yeah, they did. It was like hard to get one. You couldn't just scan the image and make your own baseball card. You asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       No, you don't understand a piece of history. If I go over to someone's house and they point to a comic book and go, this was the original of Spiderman one is just spreading written one of one, it's worth $50,000 I'm like, well you're retarded because if you ever open that magazine up, it looks like shit. Cause the car to the drawings look like shit. The artwork sucks. It's not that good. Like you know you can get it online. You know you can get online, you can watch it on your iPad. You fucking idiot get a second print like well you have to have it in your hand. It has to be old as fuck. Right. It's the, it's a better version of it and you can get it on your, I think you can get it on your iPad. I'm sure he can probably get it on your iPhone and it doesn't smell like an antique bookstore.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       Grandmother's closet. A smell. That's actually better than smell like your grandma's closet. Oh look, it's in that fucking plastic back. Meanwhile, I do miss my comic book collection. I do too. That's one of the things I sold when I was poor that I do regret and I could never get it back if I just hung in there. If I was just a little bit more ambitious early on and made enough money so I didn't have to roll pennies for food, I fucking didn't have to sell that because I didn't make much. I saved those comic books. I sold them when I was 21 and I saved them from the time I was. I think I started when I was like seven or eight maybe too made me sad. Dude. Threw him though. Like you would know it. Read them. No, no I wouldn't. Why would you want them? I don't know. I don't know. Me just pulling

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       out and like, that's like memories, like I'll go back, oh, I forgot about new moon. It's really a waste of time pulled up on your iPad.

Speaker 7:          00:50:34       Yup, you're right. It's really kind of a waste of time and a lot of ways. You know what really made me super happy, creepy. First of all, this is how cool David Cho is. Okay. David Show, when he did the podcast the first time, um, you know, I'd heard about him from Bordain. Bordain told me gotta have mom's catch crazy and I said, I would love to. I meet him on right away. I just, this warmth, I'm like this, I love this guy. Like Bing right away. I, come on, let's talk. And he gave me, he, we talked about like, uh, like horror comics and hard illustrations and Werewolf's and stuff and he gave me a series of the, that I had, I didn't have of these old school like 1950s and sixties and seventies comic books from like that era that they had printed, they'd recreated and printed in book four and hardback book form is amazing.

Speaker 7:          00:51:24       And he drew that picture that's outside in the front. I'm like, who's, who's that cool? Who does that for you? Who gives you a gift and a piece of art, you know, I mean David Cho is the coolest motherfucker ever, but the fact that this book was printed, I love cars. I love that I could go through this hard back book and look at these comic books that I used to. I used to love those when I was a kid, like a creepy and ereader and all those uh, black and white illustrated horror comic books. They were awesome. I couldn't wait for the new ones to come out, man. They, they were everything when I was a kid. Those things were amazing. So the fact that you can get those today on your Ipad, I don't know if he can get those,

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       but you know, you're not getting the advertisements. You're not getting like that. The Spanish fly advertisements in the comic books they used to have, where are they? A X ray x Ray classes. Cosby specials. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:52:17       You couldn't get anything. Yeah. You could only get, you couldn't get the, the knowledge that the thing was actually from that time, like that corvette that I have. One thing I love about that car is it that car that's a 1965 car of cars from 1965 you know, it's been a bunch of stuff's been done to it to make it like handled better. But that's a 1965 is for car is two years older than me is weird. It's weird. It's weird to have this time capsule something and to think that this thing was designed and implemented and created and sold before you were even a thought in your dad's Dick

Speaker 3:          00:52:54       that's been fucked in by other people in the past. Ghost fuckers, man. You don't 37 mini p 37 million people used. Ashley Madison and I heard about that and it got hacked. They tried to advertise for the podcast and I was like, Ooh, I think you're on your own. I was like, I don't think this is the way to go. And what's interesting about the whole, the whole thing is that people are freaking out already. You know, people that have used the site, so they're having fake lists go out of like, uh, like reddit had a fake list the other day of supposedly that the list has been released. And so what, which is a great idea because then you don't really know which is the real list, which is the fake list. It just storing credit cards from target or is it just information, just information that you brought that up because I watched it,

Speaker 4:          00:53:42       commander were on the plane the other day and I tweeted about it. It was fucking amazing. And it was a documentary that everybody that believes in like really wacky shit about the Ufo world and you know art bell type Shit. Yeah. Mirage man. You got to watch that. You have to watch that. And it doesn't conclusively prove in any way that you, fos aren't real, but it's, it sheds a lot of light on a lot of ridiculous ideas that people have about Ufo is that they have accepted as fact and documents that they point to as fact. It's amazing. It's a good documentary man. I watched it twice already. I watched it. And it may, it literally made me watch it again so I could get a better gist of exactly what was going on in the documentary. But it's about this guy named Richard Doty and this guy, but you Doty was a, uh, he was a dis information agent for the, for the government.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       So when someone would take a photo of some experimental craft that they're working on, this guy would find out about it and he would contact them from the government and provide and tell them that he wanted to see the photos and that because that they were aware, he would introduce them to some other information, but on the grounds that they keep their mouth shut about this. And so he would tell them like that human beings are engineered from monkeys and aliens came down and we have the evidence and they're the reason why we created the transistor and all this different crazy shit. And he would talk about Roswell and the airplanes that crashed and show them fake pictures of autopsies and say, I will show you this data. But under two for two, there's going to be two rules. One, you can't tell anyone. And two, you can't record any of this.

Speaker 4:          00:55:29       So he would give them this stuff and show them and say, you, we need you to fight against this incoming invasion of aliens and whatever. Just information he felt like doing at the time. Whatever wacky shit this dude felt like making up. And it was totally into his, his discretion. So this guy would do this and then one of the things he would do is go to these Ufo conferences where they would repeat the shit that he made up and he's in the back room like this during the video and he's in the back room, this Ufo conference at the Flamingo in Vegas like this. And he's clapping while these people, these poor fucks who have dedicated their entire lives to proving they know. Do you understand that? They know they have been in contact with an official United States government agent who is told them there was an imminent invasion and these people fucking believe it.

Speaker 4:          00:56:20       So they're traveling all over the country. They live in, in the backseat of their, and they're, they're basically these people that are pushed to the brink of suicide that believe without a doubt that they are in contact with a fucking government agent. And one of the guys winds up doing that winds up. I think he killed himself. I got to go, what the fuck? I can't remember. Cause he was a guy that was, they were bringing him to um, they were bringing them to psychiatric clinics. They thought he was completely losing his mind and he was the guy fucking African. I fucking died. He was a guy that was absolutely convinced that the United States government was providing him with real information and that no one was aware of this thing that he had to tell them about that we are being monitored there. They're coming, they're going to take us back.

Speaker 4:          00:57:04       We are androids like, oh, it's wacky shit. This dude was telling him and this guy would sit in the back of the room. The guy who told them was just the ultimate puppet master. It's amazing man. The Da. The documentary is amazing because the guy has a smirk on his face the entire time he's talking about it and you realize this crazy fucker just created the like a giant percentage of the whole UFO folklore. It all came from this one crazy fucker and this one organization and there's another guy on it too as a younger guy. Seems like he's got his shit together and he's talking about, you know, there's alien beings from, you know, thousand light years away or whatever the fuck he's talking about it and he's another admitted government agent and he's talking about, I'm like, well you're doing it now. You're doing it now.

Speaker 4:          00:57:52       You're doing it now cause you must be doing it now. If you're not doing it now. You'd have some pictures and videos and some stuff to show us like you sang that there's, how do you know that there's some, you don't just say there's a fucking planet. I know because I have access to very secretive government information that lets me know you can't just do that. No, you have to. That's how the whole science thing works. As far as it's been explained to me. You have to exactly show, you have to bring data. You have to have, there's has to be something before you say that. Otherwise people aren't going to listen to you. Well, who told you, oh, that guy told you his name is Richard Doty. Oh, that guy. I'm going to show you a video about that guy, that guy talking about what he did.

Speaker 4:          00:58:31       You goofy fuck. What's it called again? It's called Mirage. Men Mirage, man. It's, it's, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's, it's, it's really almost a psychological documentary than it is a documentary about Ufos. Cause it's the thing that I, I'm recognized in myself when I had wacky beliefs. I still have a bunch of wacky beliefs. I'm not saying I'm immune to them, but one of the things that I recognized in myself and why I, you know, believed in like, um, uh, you remember those things that were a raw, right. Remember those rods things. Oh my God, I watched a video. Any Pravo. He and I, we that you know, the man that remember that Alien Fish Bong I had, I still have it. Um, but we, we filled that alien fish bong up with a God's creation and we watched this stupid fucking VHS tape of an artifact. The artifact is when bugs fly really close to a camera, their wings move so fast.

Speaker 4:          00:59:33       The video camera's Lens can't quite capture it correctly. And Jamie, you're a professional photographer. He could explain what's going on with that aperture. F like the frames per second with the video faster moving too fast to capture the light. So what it does in the images, CV pull video up cause it's glorious what it does. And the image that I was fucking convinced, okay, I was convinced to the DNA. I knew these things were around us. We just couldn't perceive them and say that's the lane. What was the other thing? That lens flare one where like do you take a picture and there's like, oh my God, there's a ghost and these orbs, orbs, orbs. But no one ever captured until they figured out digital cameras and he's still, Eddie still believes that right orbit. He's got some proof. He's gets improved. That backs up his, cause.

Speaker 4:          01:00:20       I remember Eddie was the one that was really into the orbs. Eddie, he loves everything. Well like, like Eddie, I didn't have the best childhood but mine, I think it was better than his until I, uh, I want to believe in mystical bullshit, magic things. I think there's a big part of us. I think the reason why people like thinking about bigfoot over killer whales is only because we don't know for sure if big foot existed at big foot definitely existed. He's way closer to us than a killer whale is. Killer whales would be amazing if they didn't exist. We, if someone told you that there was some intelligent life form that was like a fish, but it was also, it was also a, a mammal in some way. This is those stupid things. The Sky, they're calling it sky fish flying rods. And it's just the, um, it's an artifact of these cameras not being able to pick up on the bug correctly.

Speaker 4:          01:01:10       So as the bug moves across the screen, it looks like an elongated rod. What's really stupid about it, and I didn't think about it at the time, is that if it really was moving that fast, like as you see it in this video, you'd be able to see it like I see it. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I mean, when they do it in high speed, some of them you can see and when they slow it down and they become these rods, that's the only time where they look like a Rod. It's when it slowed down and you speed it up. It looks like a bug because it is a fucking bug. God dammit. Like you could almost figured it out watching him, but one dude got really nutty and attached to the idea and produce these documentaries about an artifact. And then see, look at that one flying across the fucking, this is a hole in the ground in Mexico.

Speaker 4:          01:01:58       And as these guys or sky diving into this whole, it's whole goes like a mile into the ground. It's like an underground cave. This dude filmed, these people dive in into this hole and these rods all around them. But there's, if you put it on a high speed camera camera that captures many, many frames per second, like those red cameras or any of those like digital, um, prod cast quality cameras, then you don't see it. You just see bugs. So they figured it out on that show. Monster Quest, like they showed back to back footage. They have two cameras over a firehouse, a, um, a, a campfire, and the two f the f campfire attracted bugs. So as the two cameras filmed at, one of them was high speed, one of was standard. The standard ones showed all these fucking process. The high speed one showed bugs.

Speaker 4:          01:02:46       So they're funny. I fucking believed it, man. Dude, I believe different months, I don't know, it might've been a year. It might've been a year and a half. You see the video, that giant squid that the Russian sailor's found like this ray Eric. Yeah. But that's real. I know. I didn't know they got that big dog get newsman. No, they get absolutely enormous. Well, here's a fascinating thing about the giant squid is that until like a decade ago, it was just a legend. Like no one had any idea that I don't think they'll be dick and stuff was about right. Like, well, not exactly, but it's about a version of it. And matter of fact, they found these fossil remains, um, not remains, but these fossils of imprints from a, a dead being suction cups and they believe it's evidence of something that would have been referred to as the cracking. She, the thing about the ocean, okay.

Speaker 4:          01:03:42       One of the things about these ocean animals as far as it's been as it's been explained to me, is that, uh, the issue with trying to figure out how long things have been around this, first of all, it's too big to explore. You're dealing with this enormous, enormous, enormous, enormous, see several bodies of water, but all of them are just way too big for you to call him 100% of the water. Then you've got to think about the fact that all these beings look at this crazy giant squid you sings are so big. Do you see the one pull the one up? Ah, that was taken by, um, I believe it was an Exxon oil rig and it was a crab alien looking thing. But my point being, all these beings they're made at their bodies are made out of flesh and their bones are made out of like a Cartlidge except for their skulls and their spines.

Speaker 4:          01:04:29       But all they have is like this, these, you know these, you've eaten fish bones before. We've all gotten like fish. No, we've all gotten like fish. Like give it a salmon filet. You get a rib in your mouth. It's like a delicate little thing. It's not like you're eating a bone. I mean he'd call it a bone, but it's like a different thing. Everything at the bottom of the ocean eats that shit out of that. That's gone. So like to know how, yeah, that's the thing. That's the a this is that. Um, they didn't know. They have never seen this thing before until 2007 they had, they had even know this thing existed. It's got like these bendy crab arms that come off the back of a giant squid. It's like a Dali painting, right? [inaudible] it's so great. Pull it to the beginning again and just pause it when they, when they zoom it out, you're like, what?

Speaker 4:          01:05:13       This is c'mon man. Pause that. Pause that. If they found that flying space, you'd be shitting your pants. If they took the space shuttle up into the atmosphere and they found that hovering above the earth, we would be shitting our fucking pants. But the fact that this creepy thing, this creepy bat wing looking spider crab thing as living in the ocean, we don't care. It's so weird. Isn't this bizarre? People go on the ocean, they go in the ocean, the alien movie, right? That's an alien movie. 100% things crazy, but the point is that those things are all there. They're all flesh. It's almost all flesh except for a beak like octopuses. They're all flesh except for their beak. So when you get down to it, when they die, they just, they're gone. They just get eaten by the, it's really an efficient way. You don't need bones.

Speaker 4:          01:06:04       Like we need bones in the water. You need to be strong and pliable and to be able to regenerate your limbs like that seems to be a way better idea than bones. So octa can octopus regenerate their limbs? Am I talking shit? Can they have no idea? Hmm. I need to find that out. But the point is that we don't know how big they used to get. And so they found this fossil that indicates that there's this huge fucking suction cups. Enormous. So they think it was this crazy fucking octopus. They might've been a hundred feet long. How octopus arms regenerate? Bam. See with ease, pitch, trust in your thoughts, not the weed. We just submit it to your memory. Yeah, they do grow back. Pull up that thing. It could exist. They don't know. Pull up that thing. Real life cracking. Discovered. Pull up the, uh, the images that they've found of this, uh, these enormous suction cups that were fossil suction cups.

Speaker 4:          01:06:59       And they were thinking about there. Okay. This cause they, they figured out, I forget what year it was. I don't think it was much earlier than like 2000 where they found out that giant squids were real. I matter of fact, I'm being conservative I think, but I think that um, up until then it was just a mystery, like a myth, like the, the idea of a giant squid. And then once they found them they went, oh shit, these are real. Okay. So this is super recent. Well this fossil, see that fossil up there above the top, the top on there, that's tentacles and they're fucking enormous. They're enormous.

Speaker 4:          01:07:37       Okay. This shitty formatted website and it gets too big. Your Facebook stupid buttons and Pinterest and Twitter. I'll get in the way of the images, the new discovery of fossils, including the shell, like fossil belief to belong to an ancient octopus type creature, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It supported the 2011 theory about the existence of the cracking. Can imagine if they did send one of those fucking little James Cameron type, individual billionaire dudes, sub remains down there. And he discovered a fucking 900 foot long had just decided to eat that stupid Tylenol capsule sized personal watercraft that Mr. Cameron floats around in 85 and eight did he find anything? Now he's the fucking guy who has gone deeper than any human that's ever lived. Do you understand this? That's how, what a bad mother fucker James Cameron is. He's the guy.

Speaker 5:          01:08:38       Yeah. Why isn't there a NASA for our own earth? You know like why don't we just go down there like probably cheaper than like zillions of dollars go in this space and we'll probably figure out that like there's something that's down there that's like, okay, you guys want to know? Like they could communicate with us and tell us everything we want to know and like, oh no. Some underwater door. See that's, that's getting pushed it too far.

Speaker 4:          01:09:04       Here's my terrifying fear. Here's my terrifying fear about all that shit. My terrifying fear is that human beings are the smartest things in the universe. You think? Yeah, for sure. I'm, no, no, definitely not for sure. I don't even know for sure if I'm real. I don't even know for sure if this isn't some crazy dream or a video game where all we're all planning. I'm not sure. I'm not sure 100%, but I'm not sure. I just think that if you look at life, Eh, from, from an outside perspective, you try to pay attention to what this is, what this is for you. What is life did define to me? What is life to you Brian? Red Band, what's his life to me? What is life?

Speaker 5:          01:09:44       Ah, ah, I think it's something that uh, we're all programmed to do and it's not gonna make sense until it's over, but I think it's definitely something that that's, that's that word doing because based off of something else, like I saw something like I think like I was born to, you know, like, like you said earlier we were talking about earlier, like a cat finding the cat litter box. If for some reason it knows, I think every single person is born to do, like they're already born in programmed in a way to make it sound like something we can relate to like a, like a, a phone or something like that or an operating system. We are programmed also to do, to live a certain way, to do a certain way to think a certain way to uh, have a certain talent or something that you're drawn to.

Speaker 5:          01:10:34       But I think we're all, it's already been mapped out for the most part too, to a point. Jamie, do you agree with that? Uh, yeah, to a certain extent. I mean, I think you're drawn places for sure. Um, but I, I don't know that, I don't know, cause I've had certain things pop up my, my life where I've, like, I thought I still, I'm going to do forever. I'm playing sports forever, you know? But that isn't that just something that's cool that comes into your life and interests, maybe a hobby, I don't know. Something that gives you like a new buzz. Uh, yeah. I guess if I look at it, the kind of all similar though, creating stuff, there's been, yeah, you're, you're more drawn towards the arts and creating

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       where other people, you know, John Towards numbers, other people are drawn to dancing. You know, I, I, I think it's, well, I think I, when you die, it's definitely going to be like, ah, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:11:27       kind of thing. Double. That's what psychedelics feel like, right? When you have like a crazy breakthrough psychedelic moment where, you know, write the fucking universe fades on you. [inaudible] one of the things that you think is like, oh, this is always been here. Yeah, I remember this. Yeah. Yeah. This is here. This is always here.

Speaker 3:          01:11:43       I think that's going to happen again. And then, uh, our soul's going to under the ocean. We're all going to become

Speaker 4:          01:11:50       dolphins or something. I just find it amazing how little we know about shit that just happened. I find it amazing that they're always finding is these new pieces of information that change things like this crack him thing or about like this, uh, they found some new evidence of agriculture this 23,000 years old, 23,000 years old wheat growing, and then that pushes civilization back like some insane number. I don't know what the original number was, but I don't think it was less than 10 or more than 10,000 years ago. So it went 13,000 years further, at least. At least where they found evidence of it, you know, who knows how much evidence there is of shit. It's just gone. It doesn't exist. How does that battery from Iran or Iraq? That's so cool. Like you're saying. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:37       Do you think there's anything in the future that's controlling us

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       now? Anything? Right. What I was saying earlier is that I think that my fear is, and it's not really a fear because I think we're pretty awesome. I'm a, I'm an unabashed, um, enthusiast of human beings. I think human beings are pretty fucking cool. I think for sure there's some ones that are a mess and those ones that are a mass they can get, they can get into some positions where they can cause trouble for everybody else. And part of it's our fault because we allowed them to have the responsibility of managing certain areas. Like if you look at the human race as a whole and then you look at some insane pollution like you go to, you ever been to Detroit? Oh yeah. Nice there this year. Did you go to the river area? Yeah, I do. Dude, it's depressing is it? Oh my God, we, we filmed there for that Psi Phi show that I did and when while me and my friend Todd, we're driving around this river, we were like, fuck dude, this is awful like that, that God damn river has been poisoned, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:13:38       And everybody kind of knows that it's one of the most polluted areas in the world. I mean, collectively, I think we all know that, right? As a, as a, as a race, but we don't feel, we're not responsible. We didn't do it. I didn't do it. You didn't do it. So somebody did it. Well, what percentage of the people that did it did it at a 350 million people? What percentage of that population polluted the Detroit river? It's small. It's super small, but a small percentage can start a nuclear war. A small percentage can cause the genocide is small. It's small. But if you let them get away with it, they can do some fucked up shit.

Speaker 7:          01:14:12       It's small. But I think overall, and this is, and I understand people that say, oh, people suck. I get it. I know what you're trying to say. I know you're trying to say we can definitely suck in comparison to the potential that we show as well. But here's the thing about the people that tell me that people suck. They usually don't suck. I like them like, like they say, people suck, man. People fucking suck. I fucking hate people. And then I go, but I like you and you're a person. I like you. And you're telling me that people suck. Like you're nice, you're nice. And I'm nice. So how are people, how do people suck? How is that possible? Some people suck, some people. Oh, okay. So that's what percentage is that? Could you imagine if like food, if like one 1000000th of a percent of food would give you fucking ridiculous diarrhea, but you were like, fuck food man foods, bullshit food causes diarrhea.

Speaker 7:          01:15:11       Food Causes Cholera and be like, but no, no, no, no. Most food nourishes you. Most food takes care of you without most food. You had died dude, foods bullshit, bro. You know in Bangladesh, four year old boy died from bad food and you're like, well, what about the 7 billion people that ate food and that they stayed alive? That's to me the same sort of philosophy. When people say that people suck. I don't think people suck. I think people can suck. I think I've sucked. I think you suck. You suck all the time. God dammit. Jamie. Hey, these mean, I mean this what I mean like as a potential, like as a, as a potential. I think the human race is insane. I think it's the most amazing thing ever. We might be the tip of the spear. We might be. It might be that it takes some weird collection of carbon based life and a, a constant environment and biological entities that need the stun to stay warm.

Speaker 7:          01:16:06       It takes a lot of fucking weird shit to create a person. They navigate Siberia. Come across the Bering Strait, make it in America, make fucking edges with stones and attached to the mystics and shoot him with bows and arrows at Buffalo. I mean, you're, you're dealing with a mad, creative little weird animal. It's not that easy to get to that point. Why not just stay a squid? Why not? Squids had been squids for 250 million years. Why not just stay a stupid fucking hammerhead shark? Why not stay a fish that needs a dog to go up to it and splash water on it because it doesn't have legs like an asshole. Just walk away. You fucked. They can't, they can't walk away and you can't breathe underwater. Why does it create a human being? It might be a blip in the system. It might be the chimps are as good as it gets anywhere and that all of a sudden some weird thing happen and we came along and we're the fucking top of the intelligent ladder, but we suck. We don't always suck, but

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       we suck on some occasions. On a lot of occasions on memorable, memorable, measurable occasions we suck. You know, we're a species that'll drop bombs on countries indiscriminately to prove a point like we did in World War One and two. They, I mean worldwide. Sure. Whether they ended the war by dropping nuclear bombs just on a whole city boom. That sucks, right? Everybody would say, that sucks. We don't all suck. We don't all suck. I really think that we're in in the the very end of a strange process on this planet. I don't think we're more than a decade away from being something that's completely different than we are now. I really think that

Speaker 5:          01:17:49       it's falling apart fast, faster, and faster. Also, in a weird way, man, weird. Our heroes are now, you know bill Cosby, that cover of New York magazine where it has all the victims that's all lined up. It's, would you say five years ago you said that bill Cosby was all this was going to happen. You're like, you're crazy. Shut the fuck up. No,

Speaker 4:          01:18:07       I would've never believed it. And you know what? Here's the sad thing, and this is on me. I think probably five years ago, I'd probably heard something crazy that he did. Really? I don't, I don't remember. I don't remember. It was five years ago or, but there was a trial that it was in the news 10 years ago apparently. And that was the one that he settled out of court that they took the deposition from and they used it in this, uh, this new thing. It's a sad as fuck, man. It's sad as fuck it says, fuck that. A person has been doing that their whole life.

Speaker 5:          01:18:38       Trying to find a look at all the girls that are on that. They want to look at it. Man, I don't want to see the navy had to type, it doesn't really look like it just,

Speaker 4:          01:18:46       it's sad dude. It's waste solder for them than it is for him for sure. But it's still sad. It's sad all around. It's fucked up. It's wrong. It's just wrong. We all know it's wrong. There's no one defending that. You can't defend that. You know? And what's really interesting, man, I've been talking about this on stage about the animal house scene with the devil and the angel. I remember when the devil is like, fuck her. Fuck her brains out soccer debts ever. That you could never do that today. You could never do that today. You can never have a scene in a comedy where a little tiny, cute little miniature devil was telling you a rape. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:19:25       They're written. There's that other one though. Uh, what's, uh, happening? Hot stuff. Uh, what's that movie where she was passed out and uh, what's that movie called? Do you remember? Jamie? Hmm. Uh, there was a lot, there's a lot of movies that have weird drunk rape type scenes or where they're passed out or like feeling their tits up like hot dog. I probably has a few and meatballs and all those other eighties perv movies that involve Porky's Porky's hotdog skiing, no hot dogs. Porky's on skis is a real movie. There was a gang of those movies. Maybe this was another one, right? Who did, I totally forgot about those movies. I forgot about Porky's until right now until you just brought that up. I probably haven't

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       thought about Porky's in 10 years. 10 solid shower scene where they're looking through the shower and just Porky's was hot. You should never do that today. That was total creeper rapist shit. That's what's, well that's pretty much what the Seth Rogen movies are now. You know, that's their version of like the, the uh, super bads. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:20:26       They can get away with some stuff. They can get away with some stuff as far as like, um, like, like the drawing of the Dicks I remember so close to home. It's so ridiculous. They can get away with some stuff that they could have never gotten away with back then. But back then they could get away with the insensitive stuff. Like you could never have drawing dicks and animal house movie. We would show the guy drawing all the dicks. People weren't ready for that. Now that is like, to me in a strange way, some sort of evidence of evolution that's like imprinted in our media. Like that seems to me to be the biggest evidence that human beings are moving towards something better than we are now. Which is one of the reasons why I think that like why there's so much criticism and so much like there's so much anger and people mad at people today, like we're even when we were talking about like people mad at celebrities and people mad at Tmz for following celebrities and people mad at celebrity shows.

Speaker 4:          01:21:26       Like there's, I think there's got to be at least somewhere in that anger, ms misguided as it may be, this desire for all of us to do better. And I think it sort of manifests itself in some kind of a weird dystopia. It's weird, a vibration of anger that runs through our culture, but, but it's, it's not like an unsurmountable problem. And I think people look at it like it's an unsurmountable problem. But I think like human beings, like overall, I think, like I say the word light too much about that. I like, don't even like what the fuck I'm like talking about, I think human beings overall are getting way better. I think we're getting way better. So when something like the whole coke and things or something like that happens, people get super bummed out because like fuck not hulk Hogan. Not Whole Cogan Shit like that. Dude. Why does he believe silly shit like live? She does believe silly shit. Maybe he doesn't believe it anymore. What am I go Jackson things totally different. Cause it's not just a thought. It's an action allegedly. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:22:38       Well it's still theory. It's awesome to the point of, you know, we grew up Michael Jackson. How was the king now? He, that was the coolest person ever. And watch him deteriorate over the last years. And then all the, I, you know, with all this Cosby shit and all the kids stuff, if Michael Jackson was still alive, he would be the next Cosby. We would find out that all these kids, like even, you know, Corey Haim would come out and say, Oh yeah, he fucked me good. And you know, Shit like that, right? Damn. Don't you think so? I don't know. I mean

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       if they could take down cause speed, they can definitely get to Michael could be or it could be. He's still friends with all those kids. I still get it. Again, still tagging it. That's so wrong. He lets them in a Neverland, but like, uh, I don't remember who said this first. It does definitely isn't my idea. I just can't remember who said it. Someone was saying that like

Speaker 4:          01:23:28       all the, all, all the evidence was there.

Speaker 2:          01:23:31       Like what kind of a grown ass man has a goddamn amusement park at his house and 100% they were just saying like, this is like, this is the most ridiculous thing ever. That this guy is accused of pedophilia. Any has an amusement park for children in his house. And he talks like a child. Like, wait, what? No, no, he's fine. You don't leave your kids with them. He'll be fine. It's just,

Speaker 4:          01:23:59       it's a crazy, insane aberration that somehow or another, a child who grows up with this dominant father in this family of musicians and they're all singing and dancing and travel in the country. And he's loved by everybody from the time he was a little kid. Dude, if you've watched the Jackson five, think about this. Think about if you were Tito or Jermaine or any of these other people that were Jacksons. Think about who they are. Okay. These are grown ass men and and older children of this supernova. Your, your parents had a bunch of kids and they had one Super Nova. They had Janet Jackson, they had Tito, they had Jermaine, they had a Latoya that all these Jacksons and then they had Michael this nucleus, this fucking just white hot thing. So much that everybody goes, he's got a son, he's gonna say he's going to dance and he does it on TV and he hits it perfectly.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       He hits a perfectly t for anybody to ever try to figure out what it would like to be would it would be like to be Michael Jackson. You've got to watch Michael Jackson when he was on TV when he was a little kid, but it pull, pull some of that up Jamie, because I think we could all like, we can all agree. Let's just agree on some stuff before we talk about this. Okay? Pedophilia is one of the worst things you could ever do. For sure. We all agree, right? We all agree that anybody that harms a child is a terrible fucking person and we don't want that in our world. We all agree, right? But let's look at this, this life. Let's look at his life. Let's try to look at it outside of that judgment, which we all agree on and say, this is these, this life, this choice, this, this situation. A scenario that he was born into is not his idea. It is not his idea to be this little tiny person who is exposed to millions of people on television. It's not

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       his idea. And so you're looking at right now, play this man. What does this look it? Look how good he is to look at this. Turn this up.

Speaker 9:          01:26:21       Totally adorable. Oh my God. He was amazing. Look at his brother's in the background. How much they hate life. You got a bunch of dudes who are already getting laid. One of them doesn't do anything but dance is seems the Middle Guy. Yeah, and then there's another little guy who's like, Michael, do it now. I'm next round. Diamonds are, first of all, they're excellent musicians. Listen to this song. Crack this shit up, Jamie. God Damn, this is good. The sudden having music play this out afterwards. It's just when he's drunk. No Grammar, no drum. Jamie's right Jamie. Just spended my fucking love for this song. It's about the bill of goods though. Mass. We'll look at him.

Speaker 9:          01:27:22       Look at him. Go Man. He's got a leather vest on with tassels. Like he's the outlaw Josey Wales. Oh my God. This is incredible. Which ones? Tito, Tito guy. I don't know. I don't know who anybody is. I know Michael Jackson is, I'm the, I'm a casual fan and I feel bad for that right now. I is this great. God Damn, this is good. I got news for you, man. If this shit was on Conan O'brien tomorrow and these guys below up, they will blow up like Mount Saint Helens. They would blow up. This is just good. This is a, an entertaining, tight performance

Speaker 2:          01:28:27       of a Badass band. And they could dress the same way. They're dress right now. They could dress the exact same way, do this exact same show that's coming. We're all gonna have our virtual hologram. We get to go see them again, but in Hologram form at a place. I know, but I mean that place that, that whole that in Chicago, man, that looked real like they have a trunk. You Go. No, no. My friend produced it was one of the producers of it. And then this is the one that chief Keef that got this got shut down, right? Yeah, the mayor. Chef key for chief. Good. Thank you. I get a a squash butternut suit. I get really,

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       I'm very white. I get so confused. I'm so sorry. So he got shut down. He was doing, they did his hologram. Yeah. And it got shut down by the police, by the mayor. The mayor pretty much just came on and stepped in and said, hey, I don't like this guy because he had some warrants in Chicago. This is in Chicago, knows happening, Indiana. They had to move it to Indiana, but they, they pretty much told him to just pull the plug on it after the first song. So the first song, first song hall, Graham, chief Keef came out, everything was going fine. That mayor then told him to turn off all the electricity there and pulled it, which is, you know, freedom of speech thing for one. Uh, and there's also a lot of weird laws about, cause this was broadcast live and the mayor just came in and was like, Eh, I don't like this guy.

Speaker 3:          01:29:50       And like pulled it a live performance just because, uh, you know, has there been any sort of an examination of what the mayors allowed to do? Yeah. What he's legally allowed to do? I don't know, but it seems like, I mean, when I first heard about, I immediately was like, this does not seem legal. You know, what if this was, you know, the end on top of this, this was to raise money for, uh, you know, uh, the people that were affected by that huge, uh, all these people got shot in Chicago recently, like a ton of people. And ever a child that, and this was to raise money for them. And uh, listen to that. Hold on a second. [inaudible] I know nothing about chief Keef, Mayor Mcdermott, he's only 46. The mayor said, all I'd heard is that he has a lot of songs about gangs and shooting people at history.

Speaker 3:          01:30:38       That's anti-cop pro gang and pro drug use. He's been basically outlawed in Chicago. We're not going to let you circumvent mayor Emanuel by going next door. The Chicago Mayor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Isn't that hilarious? So he's a quote from that. They didn't comment who? The mayor, if the mayor is uh, uh, Indiana mayor where this manual? Chicago mayor. Oh, okay. Different Dude. Okay. So the Indiana mayor is only 46, but the Chicago mayor, so the Chicago mayor contacted the Indiana mayor and said, Hey, shut that shit down. Shut it down. Which could know they could just do that. It's a Hologram. And Hey guys, let's, let's talk about ice cube. Let's talk about jokster dre. Let's talk about any of these other fucking people that did the exact same thing. Nwa All talked about killing cops, shooting cops, fuck the police and all that stuff, and you guys are celebrating.

Speaker 3:          01:31:30       Why don't you pull all the beats headphones out of all the stores, mayor of Indiana for saying, you know, all this shit you've said in your past music that now we're all going to see in the new Nwa movie and it's uh, we're all going to be singing it again. So yeah, right at a time, right now having Nwa the movie come out is so strong and powerful, but this guy trying to raise some money, uh, not, not even him, a whole gram version of him trying to raise money and they shut it down after the first song. I just don't think, if no one's doing a crime, you should be to say that

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       saying words, unless you likes organizing some sort of attack on someone. But the idea that you're saying words mean, what does every movie that we go to see? I just, what is, what does every gangster movie, Oh, should we stop the creation of gangster movies? Bunny hat, fake bugs. Bunny had dynamite. Tons of explosions. We tried to kill a lot of violence in that Wiley, coyote and bugs bunny. But I'm sure bugs bunny was involved in an explosion or two. Yeah. Yeah. Every fucking movie we love has destruction, right? Everybody says that. Murder's bad. Everybody says that. But how many fucking movies of murder in it? Jesus Christ. Right? What percentage of them? Let's just Gambino's murder in it. We don't get, we don't know. Okay. This is a beautiful subject right here. Don't, don't even look at Jamie. I want you to guess what percentage of movies have murdering them? Guest Jamie. First murder.

Speaker 2:          01:33:00       Oh Wow. All movies. That's a big thing. So, I dunno. 40% 40% American, some sort of murder. Brian, what do you think? Well, I was going to go higher, but since he went so lower, lower, uh, all movies, I'd probably say murder or violence, right? Just murder. Uh, I'd probably say 32%. 32%. All right. Well, let's find out. Jamie, why don't you Google that? I'm trying to figure it out. It's too difficult. It's too difficult for me to do while I'm doing the show still because you're just too many statistics you'd have to go through. There's like a lot of it is surveys found 82% of Americans believe that movies have too much violence. Okay. That's not what I asked for. You fuck different people. How many times they've died in movies? If I had to guess, I'd say 10%. Wow. What did you say?

Speaker 2:          01:33:51       32% to would you say genuine? 40. 40. I think I said 10, right? 10. I don't think, uh, I think in real life, if 10% of people who got murdered, you'd be fucking terrified. There'll be a horrible world to live in. I mean, that's like Gingiss Khan days. 10% of the people die, right? You have a short lifespan. If he's like short cycles of human beings, just keep having babies and keep dying off quick and known, figured out anything. What percentage do you think, Jamie? I didn't hear all the questions. Sorry. No, what percent. I mean you're doing it right. We found out that I actually just found the same thing. You just found, oh, we'll figure it out. But I think that, uh, it's, I think the numbers thing is like very deceptive. They weighed a lot, a lot of deceptive numbers. How many deceptive numbers of people that are fucking up the world? What are the deceptive numbers of a dummies out there? I don't think there's nearly as many as everybody thinks hers. You know, I think a lot of the dummies are unhappy being dummies and we'll, we'll keep them dummies forever. We'll never allow them to not be dummies anymore. You know, they get

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       trapped and will dummy world some dummy friends.

Speaker 3:          01:35:03       I, I also, you know, I saw the house of blues the other day. They had this free concert on sunset and they originally went to the Roxy and there were like, uh, is this guy named justice? What's his name? Oh, future a future. That shouldn't be your name, sir. You can't have that as a name. Just like, I can't have math as a name. You can't call yourself future. That's just ridiculous. That's like a known word that's like I'm tripod. So using the hold will be channel slept dog. I'm tripod, tripod. I like that tripod. It's implied you have a large penis, but he shut down. He shut down the row. They, they had a free show at the Roxy. So many people showed up like a thousand people or something. Like they had to shut down sunset boulevard at the Roxy. So then they moved it to the House of Blues and the same shit happened.

Speaker 3:          01:35:52       Like it was like I had to go on stage and the whole, there was swat team guys with guns on the side of the comedy store. There was helicopters and then somebody, something happened where people were like spraying like uh, extinguishers or smoke bombs and he had to shut the whole thing down. But for, for a second there, it was amazing how fast that could have turned into a riot situation and stuff like that. So when the, this concert was shut down, you would think that they were trying to control a riot of some kind, or what would be the reason other than taking money out of a, uh, uh, event that was for a toddler that died, uh, due to violence, do you think that would be a place that would have violence? Is that a benefit show for a toddler? Well, because of violence,

Speaker 4:          01:36:39       here's the thing. It shouldn't be the mayor's arbitrary decision to decide to shut down a show like that. Especially to do it while you got to think he's probably grand standing, right? You know, that's what he's doing. He's making a big stand and he's going to stop gang violence. And we all agree that's, it's better to have less violence in the world's better to have less fun. But you can't just decide in the middle of a show to shut it down. That's stupid. And that's not thinking about the future because you're going to have a whole, how many people are at a show, like 10,000 fucking people or something crazy. It's a huge festival or some kind of festival. Right? So let's, let's just say it's 10,000 people. How many people were there to see them? They're all there to see him. You shut it down.

Speaker 4:          01:37:17       They're mad. So now you've got a group of people that aren't just going to get entertained. They're mad if criminals are criminals all the fucking time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, what kind of a world would it be? Would be crazy. It would be like criminals would be like zombies. They would just be just running around, grabbing things. They're not. So they gotta be in a situation where crime could erupt. Most of the time, criminals aren't committing crimes. Even the most hardened criminals out of their waking day. What percentage is actually dedicated to crime? It's probably pretty fucking small, right? But now if you set them up in this situation where you take away

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       their money and you sh you stopped their show and you stop it because you don't like what this person is saying on stage and now they're in a position where they feel wronged, they feel like you owe them. You have to you, you've created a feeling of that. Yeah. You've created a feeling of anger and parked. I had to call off work, I had to do this. I like now you've just created a mob of people against the system. The good man. Yeah, it's not smart and there's a lot of cool videos of that night where you know the show was going on, everything was going great and you just see in the background for like a one 80 just these lights coming closer and closer of all the cop cars just coming from the distance because Indiana is flat is fuck. So you can see just not so true. I didn't even think of, yeah, it's a, that's a weird thing about getting away with crime in Indiana. You fucking look around. All you need is like a, yeah, a tower.

Speaker 2:          01:38:55       Like you've got about 30 seconds that covered about six miles away getting the fucking car. Let's do this drive. Slow drive sob. I saw. It's really great though. Like these apps like periscope and things like that that are really using it as for the news and for kind of like crime checking, you know, like I got a video of you. What do you think about these drones? Like the, the fact that they're able to use, when I was, um, uh, up in Canada a couple months ago, it was one of those guys who's a friend of a friend had a drone and it was hooked up to his iPhone and I was like, this is crazy. What is this? He's showing me video from his iPhone on his iPhone of this fucking robot that's just flying around. I'm like, that is insane. I can't believe you can actually do this.

Speaker 2:          01:39:40       Have you heard of Lilly? No, I can't wait. It comes out very soon. Lily, is this like, it's like the, it looks like it's going to be the, like the first iPhone of drones. Like it's going to be one of the ones, it's like your own personal drone check. Check this video. It's pretty sweet. All this shit it can do well, here's a commercial. So I think, I don't know, maybe Jamie, you can pull it up. Probably be better. Uh, so what is the idea that it's a better drone? It's, it's just like here you're, you're holding it. You can just throw it in the air and it turns on automatically. You could have it either fall you at directly behind you side, sideways. And it's adorable looking at turn up the volume. It's got eyes. She looks kind of like a blue little, see how he just threw it up and then I followed, yeah, look, come on.

Speaker 2:          01:40:31       And so it's going to track your, this is just showing if you were going to be a snowboarder and my God, we have HD, we have robot falcons. Yeah. This is a robot Falcon Falcon that follows you around and he comes to you and it comes shipped to the fuzzy landing, 20 minute flight time. All my throat over a bridge. God, this is the craziest Shit I've ever seen in my life. Uh Oh my God. It's just walk like grand theft auto style. Just walk behind you. Oh my God. One of the coolest things is going to Kayak. You can just go as fast. How fast can it go? It goes, I don't know what, how fast they usually go, but it's pretty much if, oh, you were tracking Weist. Oh my God. Oh my God. Look at that. You wear a tracking device around your wrists. Yeah, dude, we're live and love future could either go in front of you and lead or follow. Oh my God. And we're talking 60 frames a second full HD. Oh, fixing your backpack. Oh my God. This is crazy. Grandma could use it to make sure follows her. Oh my God, Dude. How long before people give up their bodies for that just blew my head to the top of that thing.

Speaker 2:          01:41:47       You know, there's gonna come a point in time where human beings have like a biological meeting and we decided now that we have genetic engineering, should we decide to continue with

Speaker 4:          01:41:56       shape? Should we decide to continue with this shape? What is love? What is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Could we all be better off if we were flying? Jellyfish are nice. They come up with this proposition to be able to replace a, with a simple prescription, uh, any feelings of love or sex or affection that people need or want. It's all satiated. You, you never have to worry about reclaiming that again and that the most harmonious shape for the universe, the most harmonious shaped to coexist forever with a, an infinite lifespan is flying jellyfish. How long before we'd all be flying jellyfish, seven years, the way that thing just flew. I want it to be that thing. I know it's good to just fight through it off a bridge, right? Wish someone gets throw, just throw you off a bridge and you just won't shred this.

Speaker 4:          01:42:49       And this is, imagine that technology in 20 years where that thing's falling around all day long, all night long. I imagine that in the shape of Dicks, imagine what's the figure out that the shape of a dick is really not perfect. You know, just like there's other shit that's wrong with people like the fact that so easy to knock us out. Yeah, that's a big flaw. Punch somebody in the chin, they go unconscious is a stupid flaw. What if they realized like dicks are good but have a seat. I'm going to show you the new, we're going to show you the next level, the next level, some sort of new thing, and it gets inside you and just expands, expands like a fist, but soon a few little dicks all around a tube like this or the the main dick tube and it's spreads out like corn, you know, and it's all a little Dick's inside. Imagine if your Dick was, uh, this might be the dumbest thing I've ever said. Imagine if your deck was like an ear of corn and each one of those little kernels was another

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       dick. And once your Dick got in there and we'd, Dick was hard, you dick got in there, then all those little dicks would pop out and move it all. Like they would all play music inside the girl's vagina, downtown, downtown, downtown tome. And that would be the thing. Like the girls could come the hardest. You've made the best music inside their vagina. Oh, Joe. That's what I'm saying. Right? Good. Listen. That's a very important point. We just assuming that the Dick shape that we have currently is the best, but if you had the dick shape we had currently and the ability to make music with your deck, right? Yeah. Jamie. Jamie, don't look at me like what kind of music you, donk, Donk, donk, downtown, some Beethoven Shit. Piano or a violin or mostly like drums. I guess it depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Yeah. I'm more of like a you a Bongo player or a bass drum. I can see Jamie playing upon. Guys had a party, play a gym day. Uh, if you were a sex act, would you be

Speaker 7:          01:44:57       V if you are a sex act and also a musical instrument,

Speaker 2:          01:45:03       what is sex act? And I was asking him who's the bongos or if he was the bass drum would definitely be the band. Would you be the trumpet? Yeah. Oh, would you be the trombone trumpet? It's a phone. Every man wants, let's

Speaker 7:          01:45:18       be the electric guitar, right? Yeah. Good. All right. What's the plate first? If you had a big buck, the best sound, best sound, the best sound. And all of music to me, I think like the sound that makes me go the most gold fuck is like awesome guitar. Like someone who really nails it like that. I'm the solo in um, uh, Leonard skittered the solo and Freebird you know, you know that solo when they get there there's like a two and a half minute long solo or something like that. My personal opinion, I think it's the greatest solo and all of music. I think it's the greatest guitar solo ever. I, I listened to that fucking thing like once a month it's like, like a little like, uh, like an equinox or something like that or a a full moon once a month. I have to hear that guitar solo cause it's so good.

Speaker 7:          01:46:08       It's just this is, I don't think I've ever thought that way about drums. He's never one time that I had to listen to a drum solo over and over and over again. It doesn't, it's not that I don't appreciate drums. I love drums and if it wasn't for the drums, the whole song wouldn't be the same. Like no song will be the same. But if I had to pick like one sound, like what's the one sound that I enjoy most for whatever reason is to the guitar and I don't, I don't think it's the electric guitar or the Acoustic Guitar because some of my favorite guitar moments, it'd been like people we've had in the studio like Everlast Everlast playing guitar or like a Ben and Suzanne from honey, honey playing guitar, like in studio or Banjo. There's something about someone touching something, their fingers,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       whether it's a banjo or whether it's a guitar. I know you're creating with your fingers and it's got this crazy metal sound is wire in this fucking echoey sound and that's my favorite sound. I've, I've come to that conclusion. Those are my, that's my favorite musical sound. I like drums alive there. There's a few songs like you're right though. For the most part it's guitar, but there's a few drum solos that, I mean piggy by nine inch nails. Back in the day, Chris Farina used to have one of my favorite. This guy's plan a guitar, dropped his iPhone inside his guitar and put the camera out. And you're seeing like each of the wave forms on each string that he's playing and like it's a visual visit. Camera can't keep up with the vibrations. Correct lists. I do not believe this at all. No, that's, that's what it looks like.

Speaker 2:          01:47:36       No, but this has been reading done. This is not try it with your cameraman attains an iPhone four it's a shitty camera. So I think it's a similar to what we were talking about with the rods. It's just an artifact where the lens of the camera can't keep up with it. But it has this con, this changing image at the front of it like that. When you look at it with your eyes, you can see if I'm doing this when I get home. Yeah, you got to do this. Please do. Please do. Ah, alright. He swiped your knee. If there's one thing that I wish that I did that I don't really wish that I did, but I, I think it would be cool to know you can still do it. It's not that hard. Nope. Nope. Time you learn how to not interested with Bose real quick.

Speaker 2:          01:48:16       Nope. You could learn to [inaudible] pool game needs work. I'm trying to write jokes. I want to be social only hang out with my family and play those songs. You know, you already said here at Aera sang songs. He jumped bears on my songs to be, especially if I get drunk for a Roto and stuck with them. Uh, but if he did kid songs, how cool would that be? Like how many do like, oh we'll do this down. Oh yeah, I want to do that with my kids. They always gravitate towards the same ridiculous stuff. It always becomes about like buttholes anuses cause they know it's hilarious. Kids figured out early. You don't even have to try to tell them to say penis and butthole is hilarious and they just go to it and then when you laugh they go, oh I figured out what's funny.

Speaker 2:          01:49:03       Little cute people saying ridiculous shit. It is adorable. I think I knew it but I wasn't allowed to say it. If I were to say it, I would, would've gotten a ton of trouble. Isn't it weird though that we try to prevent kids from San Ridiculous Shit like penis and butthole like that is your butt hole. This is a penis. Like what are we doing? We're gonna have to raise robots. Do you let your kids cuss like, dude, no. This is what I tell kids and I cuss. Very rarely. I swear to God because very rarely around my kids, but I do occasionally slips out and my wife goes, you know, you know like you should probably shouldn't say that around the kids. I go, I guess you're right. But all my favorite people swear like, why do we have to wait until they're old enough? They swear because we're worried about how they're going to appear to other people. We'll look if everybody talked away, the three of us talk.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       Is that a bad thing? If kids talk like that, is that a bad thing? And what are we doing? We're not mean. We're not. We're, we're, we're not cussing about ridiculous shit. You know, you drive outside in, your tire's flat, you go, fuck, is that so bad?

Speaker 5:          01:50:02       I feel like kids know, they just know. They learn quick who you don't say it in front of like you don't say anything. They do,

Speaker 4:          01:50:08       they they it slips out. It's a part of your vernacular. If you live 30 years of your life and then you have a kid 30 years of saying fuck. Most of us have said Fox since we figured it out. As soon as you realize what an impact fuck has, well you'll actually like seven or something like that so and says fuck around your kit. Get children just being nice. The children are right here. As soon as you realize that this is like some Voodoo word, right, you start using it. I just think that the most important thing is like it's not language, it's intent. Like what are you trying to project by what you're saying? Cause all we're saying when when we get upset about language and were being ridiculous about it. When you're saying that there's no way a person should ever be able to say these noises with their mouth, what are those noises to you? What are those noises to you and what are those noises to me? Because what it really is about is about intent. And as soon as you pretend that it's not about intent, then you create this weird world of like switches. It's on and off. It's yes and no. And that's not, that's not how people operate. You know, people are weird. They're fucking pliable. You know, people are strange.

Speaker 5:          01:51:23       Jamie has trained, you see this drone shooting a gun. That's what we have to look forward to. I saw that too. That's real. I wanted to ask you, it looks fake as fuck, but why wouldn't it be rail? It's one of those things, you know, why wouldn't it be really get something to go backwards and forwards. What you can't get it to pull a switch. Oh my God. And if you had a cross hairs on it somehow.

Speaker 10:         01:51:49       Yeah. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          01:51:54       So this guy has a gun that's flying around us. The same guy, same guy, made this video there showing yet. Remember that guy? Oh, the guy that showed him being a taf or recording video from a drone over a beach. Yeah. Well, I don't believe that. Is it the same guy? No, I think this is all bullshit. Why do you think it's bullshit? I think that might be real and I think I know. I just don't think they're connected. If that's connected. That's crazy because so what's the deal with drones? Anybody can have one. You can do whatever you right. There's no laws. You can't put a gun on. One. Made some real weird laws at fas. Had to make some regulations on where you can and can't fly him and whatnot and how high they can can't do in a rover police departments. You can't do it over planned parenthoods. Is this like the fucking Trojan horse? Is the drone the Trojan horse? Look, it was created by the government for military

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       reasons and now they are selling it where we can keep it in our book bagging. Mom and dad can have their own drone falling around the whole entire time. In 10 years we'll all have a German, they follows us around and records as an HD 60 frames a second. Everyday we, they found a way to put a drone in her hand with periscope and all these other things. They're going to have best babysitting skills ever in our government.

Speaker 4:          01:53:06       What about this? What about the craziest idea of all time? What about they figure out a way to have cameras and we're recording devices that are so small that they're literally invisible and they put them everywhere and they work as a matrix. So as you're walking down a hall, this thing can recapture the images that it sees in front of it and record it all in real time and broadcast it to anybody. Anyone, anywhere. That's the future. There flies. Well that's, that's the future man. It's not just flies. I think it's molecules. I think the cameras become a part of the air. I think the idea of having wireless Internet to a fucking cave man is so ridiculous. I don't think it's ridiculous to think of some sort of a device other than a lens and a glass thing in the front and the, the aperture and all the words that I don't really understand that involve making a photograph. Those. Those words are all alien to me. Like if you, if you, if I didn't know there was a camera, I'm way too fucking stupid to have ever thought of a camera. I would have to live a billion lives by myself on an island to figure out a fucking camera and I probably still would never figured out a good camera. Somebody figured out that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:54:24       Think about that man.

Speaker 3:          01:54:26       When there's need, it will be created in the future. We're going to need to create force fields to get these drugs out of our faces and there microchips. I think

Speaker 4:          01:54:33       there's, I think there's a, a crazy possibility for technological innovation I think is it keeps getting more and more sophisticated. I think it's going to reach a level that we could not imagine right now. Just like a cave person could never imagine wireless video. I think it's going to reach some bizarre molecule, some, some, some, some such a significantly small thing that it would be like mist and then instead of cameras it would like transmit a three dimensional image of all the air around it all the time. And then you could live inside that three dimensional image. Like people could live in your life and you wouldn't even know they were there and they would be there all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:55:20       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:55:21       I think we're going to get to some super fucking bizarre shit and about 200 years, I'm thinking about 200 fucking years of this keeping up. We're going to get to some strange place that's remarkably similar to what happens when you take too much mushrooms, some bizarre intertwining lot electronically created psychedelic dimension that we'll be able to share information with each other all the time, everywhere. See each other and it's just a few fucking decades away. It's going to start a little creeps and pops and we're just going to get double. The world's gonna get weirder and weirder and weirder, weirder and more of these fucking weird fucking smiley face drones. What's that thing called,

Speaker 2:          01:56:09       lily? They're going to get smaller. They're going to be, bugs are going to be, birds are going to be little tiny things that fly everywhere and everyone's just going to have to concede to going to have to concede that there's no privacy. Every time you get a scratch ticket, they give you five drones. You walk outside, you fucking throw him in the air. It's ridiculous. The whole thing's ridiculous. We only eat gluten. I don't think that's what you want a drone to follow you around. Fuck No. Why would like, why would, why I didn't. I'm, I'm, it's hard enough to process the information I'm getting by

Speaker 4:          01:56:42       walking around. Right? Yeah. It's hard enough to process that with all the things that you do in your life. How hard is it to process the information that you get while you're walking around?

Speaker 2:          01:56:54       It's fucking hard. Right? That's why we can watch it in replay from our drone video. That's ridiculous. Cause you watch that too and you're like, oh my God, this is what it looked like. That's why people start fucking with their face, man. You know when people started doing crazy shit and plastic surgery, they're trying to look

Speaker 4:          01:57:14       glass at themselves. As bizarre as that seems, you know it's the, the the, the, the idea of look, looking at yourself like rationally you want to look less at yourself, you want to get more wrapped up in some crazy little tiny aspect of who you are. Fixed that and everything will be good. You don't want to look at yourself like as a whole, as an entity and you're just doing crazy Mickey Rourke,

Speaker 2:          01:57:41       your style. You can make a drone follow you how long until they can, you can make it fall to someone else and like someone, you just have a thousand [inaudible] TMZ guys phone. We can get to some point man. It's not that far away. Far

Speaker 4:          01:57:53       Way where the, the, the idea of privacy is going to be preposterous. It's we, I think it's not that far away. I don't know how many decades. It is a way. What it seems to me that if I looked at what a cell phone looks like in 2015 and it with what it looked like in 1989 or whatever it was, when people first started getting car phones, remember they used to call them car phones. That is not that long, man. That's not that long in the world. Just not in terms of like Tara doctorals and snails and zebras and shit. This is not that long as a little tiny moment of time and something changed radically. It's like everything is worked slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly slow over a genetic and biological level until this one crazy fucking monkey figured out how to make its own life and decided to make its own technological life and his technological life changes rapidly, rapidly, just changes all the time constantly and it has no regard whatsoever for little tiny mice that you have to feed your chickens.

Speaker 4:          01:59:06       It doesn't give a fuck about them. It's just trying to change and get faster and quicker and better all the time and that's what the Internet is and that's what AI is and that's what these fucking flying things toss off a cliff are. And what we are is the apes clinging to the vines, the shit slinking jungle worried. Oh my God, it's fucking robots are going to take over. How horrible would it be if we didn't take over from the monkeys? Could you imagine? Could you imagine if every time you wanted to go out to west Hollywood you had to deal with gorillas kicking your ass. Fucking your girl in front of you. Gorilla racist. Yeah. Cute. Magically. Gorillas hated people and people hitting gorillas. They were everywhere and there's some sort of a protection thing. We're trying to figure out how to work this out. Come on son. We got lucky. Lucky we got lucky. We got to this point, right? I don't know. My original point was sure it had one.

Speaker 3:          02:00:10       Do you see, did you get one of these yet? Have you seen those in person yet? The smart scooters. These aren't like songs,

Speaker 4:          02:00:17       those, I saw a guy walking on the street with one of those yet.

Speaker 3:          02:00:19       Yeah, I think I might get one but it's, it's, it's pretty much a very inexpensive scooter that works like a segue to the point where if you don't it just balances and you use

Speaker 4:          02:00:31       a um, uh, a remote control

Speaker 3:          02:00:34       look. See, here it is right here is an action. Uh, it pretty much just point

Speaker 5:          02:00:40       this thing. Charges fast only takes a couple hours to fully charge. So learning to ride the scooter is actually really easy. You just hit the power button, gently step on the platform, one foot at a time. These black rubber pads or like touch sensitive buttons turning on the motors when enough pressures applied using a wall or person for support and practice standing up straight. The key is to just stay relaxed. Pro Tip, push your feet to the edges against the rent, which seems to help me balance. Then you can start leaning forwards or backwards to move around. And that's really it. It's so quick and easy to learn. It's very intuitive. You just let your brain kind of think about moving around and I'll automatically do it for you. I even had my little nine year old niece learning to ride it and just a few minutes and about 20 minutes in my first time practicing, I felt very comfortable. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:01:28       I don't know why it's going up and down. It can go up hills. You can feel the genre working underneath your feet is very good and precise. A lot of people in Hollywood are, are riding around on these and it looks so goofy when you first see it and it, cause people are like going in stores with, I saw somebody the other day at Panera bread, just ordering was standing on one. It's amazing. It looks a little Porsche wheels. I got Fukes and it will Fukes wheels. Yeah. But it's cool. It's like reverse Fukes. There seems to be one manufacturer or a generic manufacturer. It and there all of these people are rebranding it and selling under different names, but there's also a few that have better wheels and go faster, uh, on it. Wow. But, uh, it's, it's, I can see us all having these very soon. Like what that kind of, how we all thought that, that the segway was going to take off kind of, uh, you know, they made sidewalks for segways. This seemed a little bit more doable as you can get one of these for $340 on Amazon. Yeah. It's a skateboard, skateboard size segway that balances brilliant. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:02:26       That's a perfect example of like the difference between a cell phone from 88 and what we're putting in our pocket today. Everybody. Did you see that thing where there's some hack that they can do on android phones? Well, you just have to send you a text.

Speaker 3:          02:02:40       What did you, yeah. Did you see the hack that the jeep had to recall all their cars because people could, can control the breaks, the sound, troll the fucking car and shut it off. Like we used to always talk about, now it's actually happening. Whoa, here's the article. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:02:57       Porque see for Real, how long does it take before unrecognizable? How long does it take before human beings become some super bizarre robot hybrid that drives cars with his brain? How long is it a week? Is it a year into the, is it a decade?

Speaker 3:          02:03:18       Yeah. Here it is. Uh, this is the, the hack that led to the huge jeep.

Speaker 4:          02:03:24       All right. [inaudible] um, well all these cars, every car that has antilock brakes and every car that has all this traction control, a lot of that stuff is electronically managed. Traction control is a, a big issue with cars. They want to make cars safer and easier to handle. If one of the wheels start skidding, they, it comes in and uh, motor enthusiasts like guys who are like race car drivers, like a Chris Harris or something like that. They, they, they would call it like nanny devices. Like, like, like nanny controls. They don't want that because they know how to drive really good. But the most of us, me included, don't drive so fucking good and your wheels start skidding out from back behind you. I don't know exactly what to do. I know a little bit from driving in snow, but not like a matte fairer one of these fucking dudes who drives cars like professionally. That's where that kind of electronic shit comes in. That's what this thing is.

Speaker 3:          02:04:19       One and 1.4 million fiats uh, they that during the test hackers were able to exploit to kill the engine, disabled the brakes and track the location of it so they could track. You know, when you're going around a corner on a bridge and take off your brain,

Speaker 4:          02:04:35       it only makes sense because if you have a, and that car has like satellite gps and all that jazz, you, you have to understand that, that that car is being somehow or another connected from a computer with an Internet connection or some sort of a gps connection that goes up to a satellite and it's following you. That's how it knows where you are when your, you know, it's, it's telling you turn right in 200 yards. It's telling you that because it's connected to something, it's something knows where it is. Right? It's figuring this out. It's getting it from the GPS. There's a satellite this tracking you. It's so strange when you think about what that is,

Speaker 3:          02:05:17       is that he's like, I was driving 70 miles per hour out. What the fuck just happened here? I was driving 70 miles per hour on the edge of downtown St Louis though I didn't touch the dashboard. The vents in the jeep Cherokee started blasting cold air at maximum, showing a sweat on my back through the seat climate control. Next switched the radio station to the local hip hop station and blaring skee Lo at full volume. He didn't touch anything. So some hackers were taking over his car while he's in it and then, uh, killed it on the middle of the highway going 70 miles an hour. I, I read a little bit this just like a test. It's like a special test they had. They installed something special inside of it so that they could connect to it also, it wasn't, oh, it was like a random of, oh wait a minute. So this couldn't happen with a jeep. That's a regular GFE off a lot unless someone went to that jeep, installed this extra thing here. Well, what does that extra thing? Thumb drive probably that you can just plug into the USB.

Speaker 4:          02:06:11       You know I have thumb drives him all my stuff that know what the fuck does off to the thumb drives are in that console. You don't see them stick in there and it probably is just uploading it to it. So the thumb drive but, but it's, see I don't know anything. And I was going to say enough about computers. I don't know anything about computers. But if you stuck a thumb drive into a car, he couldn't. Could it automatically access to

Speaker 3:          02:06:35       you drove your car? Here's my what mine does in my f my edge. I plug it in and then it goes, would you like to a software update? And I'm like, yes. And it just hit yes. Then updates my software in it using something I downloaded off the internet onto a thumb drive. Oh Wow. So this is, these are the guys and this is actually them showing them how it's done. Uh, the audio is up. I don't know why it's not playing any audio, but Charlie's house miles away. They wouldn't tell me what they had plans, but they assured me that it wouldn't be anything life threatening. Remember Andy, no matter what happens, don't panic.

Speaker 11:         02:07:08       It's not the first time I'd driven a car while it's being attacked by these two hackers. But in 2013 they were in the back seat and the laptops were wired into the vehicle to report. In fact, oh my. Now they're sending the same sort of attacks remotely and I have no idea what they might do

Speaker 3:          02:07:25       going as fast as I've seen him. So. So first we're going to turn the fan on them. Yeah, let's turn the fan on. TV even notices.

Speaker 11:         02:07:33       All right. All the something just turned on. All the fans and AC and stuff. I didn't do that. The trick is started small. Oh my God. That was a picture of Charlie and Chris and tracksuits. But as I drove down the interstate, things started getting unpleasant and very loud.

Speaker 9:          02:07:57       Oh my God. Videos. Leann shinny slash brain is windshield washer fluid and I can't see any need to get to the windshield wiper fluid. I mean, I do it.

Speaker 5:          02:08:17       Do it, kill the engine. It was killing the engine right now.

Speaker 9:          02:08:22       That part that says, oh my God, they killed it on the highway. The calories.

Speaker 5:          02:08:28       I stomped on the gas, but the jeep slowed to a crawl. What if the car behind them just in rear those tower, but I turned on my hazard lights, but I was still stuck in the right lane with no shoulder to escape on

Speaker 9:          02:08:39       two guys. Thug on the highway.

Speaker 5:          02:08:43       Oh, I think he's panicking. He's not going to hear us with that radio so loud.

Speaker 9:          02:08:49       He's a big guy. Big salary to go work again.

Speaker 5:          02:08:53       The accelerator. We'll work. It won't work. You're doing

Speaker 9:          02:08:58       seriously dangerous. I need to do

Speaker 5:          02:09:01       you gotta turn the car off. Okay. Now you should be good to go,

Speaker 9:          02:09:08       Sam. I drove by.

Speaker 5:          02:09:10       Okay, but that man, what if you were behind them when that happened? Oh, I know what if that's what I was going to say. That seemed very dangerous for them to do that real [inaudible] front of wired.com.

Speaker 4:          02:09:21       Yeah, but you're the best at figuring out that. That's totally real. Yeah. Jamie, Jamie's. Kevin,

Speaker 5:          02:09:26       you're going to be, I mean it could be a, we wired would not put it on there wired. They can let you get duped. Yeah, wired legit went to hear him talk my route.

Speaker 4:          02:09:35       No, no, that's cool. I get it. I believe it. It's just how the fuck. Yeah, it's scary. They shouldn't do that. No, definitely shouldn't do that. If you're going to do that, you should do that on a track. You shouldn't do that. If you want to prove it, prove it on a track. Donald don't prove it like that. That's crazy. Yeah. I don't know if they really did that. If they really did that, that seems to me to be unnecessary. All you'd have to do is take people on a track and have them drive around in a controlled environment and do the same thing and everybody would freak out. You wouldn't have to do this.

Speaker 5:          02:10:05       Yeah. Not on the highway where there's no shorter. I think it was the people not knowing that there wasn't a shoulder and so you know well

Speaker 4:          02:10:11       also like, like what if it was in the left lane. I mean, maybe they made an agreement to only stay in the right lane, but if you were stuck out there and someone didn't pay attention, they were coming up behind you fast. They couldn't hit the brakes. [inaudible] Fuck Jenner. Fuck yeah. Yeah. Back when Caitlin was, Bruce sounds like a novel, but a back when was still a identified as Bruce. She, uh, slammed into a car and pushed that car into oncoming traffic. Apparently. Fuck. It's too easy to get in car accidents. The idea that any person just not paying attention for a brief moment, Katie accidentally hit something. You know, it's like what we're talking about. If you just took your whole life, have you accidentally bumping into shit and you added it all up to give anybody the ability to drive at whatever speed they would like based on how hard they push the right pedal and make sure they hit the breaks on time. It is remarkable how few crashes there are. It's fucking remarkable. It's remarkable how well people keep it together. If we see one accident on the highway at a 20 million people in la, we go fucking idiot.

Speaker 2:          02:11:20       The one on one should be accidents all day long, every day, all day. Be Cons to meet explosions or fire. If we were really the ogres that we would like to perceive ourselves as being, I just fucking smashed into each other while jerking off. I don't think it's that bad. Yeah man. I'm fucking, I'm positive she hear that Twitter's or racing stolen jokes. Yeah. I thought that was interesting because, um, how do they determine, is it publishing who published it first or who put it on Twitter, Twitter doing it on its own system. Here's the Twitter is erasing store and jokes and they're putting up actual like, you know, this uh, tweet has been copywritten or, hmm. Uh, well here's the thing, man. I, I totally support it if it was accurate all the time as far as like who was the original creator of it. But sometimes it seems like the history of that stuff was too hard to track down.

Speaker 2:          02:12:21       The article says they have a team of people inside their acts inside Twitter looking at each case. Okay. So they look at it and then they make a determination. It matter. I guess I'll go what happened on youtube or anywhere else? You might have copyright issues. Does that make sense? Have you ever thought of something and you thought, ah man, this is awesome, but you realize that somebody else had already thought of it a hundred times like that. The thing is that, that what makes me mad is this, this one person who's saying that she writes jokes for a living. She feel Tess's jokes on Twitter and stuff, but you know that, so she says a joke that she thinks that she wrote, but you know, you see like lethal weapon two and they use the same joke and then lethal weapon two and you're like, oh fuck. But she, oh, you know who says is who? I mean, that seems like, I dunno, but it is Twitter. Who gives a fuck, you know? Oh No, they deleted. It is annoying. Like if you wrote something that was really hilarious about something, it was like a particular red band asked take on something and it was hilarious and you put it on Twitter or anything and it

Speaker 4:          02:13:20       got like all these retweets and people are lol, lol, lol, lol, lol, lol. Yeah. And with any saw, a bunch of other people read like just took it. They didn't retweet, they just took it and put

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       it on their Twitter feed. He'd been like, ah, why did you do that? But sometimes you both think of the same shit.

Speaker 5:          02:13:38       Yeah, that's possible too. It happens more and more. It's, it's weird, especially watching old movies they grew up with, you know, and and going, Oh my God, that joke that I thought of the other day was just because there was this one part and this one obscure Steve Martin movie from the 70s that I liked and it was just a weird variation of that and I didn't even realize it. I was like, Holy Shit, I'm looking at their act, the form on their website. It's very similar to how it happens on Youtube. Really. All they're saying is like, if you're willing to say that this is a copyright infringement, you have to be willing to go to court for it. So, and then Twitter's getting their hands out of the, out of the horny. So they're just saying like here's, so if someone's willing to go to court for it, then they pull it. It says by like when you fill out the thing, you have to, I understand that under 17 USC section five, 12, I am liable for any damages including costs and attorney fees if I had knowingly materially misrepresent that I reported material or activity that is infringing. See the problem is

Speaker 7:          02:14:35       parallel thinking is so common amongst, especially amongst like current events subjects. Like there was a funny story that are used to tell cause at the time this was like 19, it was either 1990, 1999 or 2000 when that Chinese aircraft with a, there was like a uh, a collision or something between an American and Chinese aircraft and the Chinese aircraft was flown by guy named Wong Way. Oh yeah, that's right. I remember that. I was like five years ago probably. No, no, no, no, no, it was, it was, it was 2000 because it was when I did my, uh, belly from the beast DVD from Texas. And I remember like I talked about it like I might've been, it might've, I might've had it on that bit or my on that special if it not, it was in that time, it was around that time. But Ari was working in the cover booth at the time and Ari was like the audience after like five hours of Comedians, it's like, what is this a fucking joke? Like you just all did the same joke over and over and over again. And the guy's name was Wong way, you know. So we would all show up like five or six guys, Dave and you know how the store works. Nobody pays attention to anybody that's on before him. You're in the back hanging out having laughs and the guys on stage and he's saying the same fucking joke. She just said to him [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          02:15:58       as you can figure it out also because you'll be on stage, like I know that usually at least gets a reaction and then you find out that Oh yeah. To, you know, to other people talked about boner pills or at least,

Speaker 7:          02:16:10       yeah, there's certain subjects. Yeah. Well that was what we were talking about before about stepping on stuff. What are you going in there for? Yeah, Coca Cola, Coca Cola, golf. Hello. Stepping on something. One of our friends had a, an issue with that recently, or actually two friends, two different friends in two different occasions. Worked at comedy clubs and um,

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       they work with these local guys and like say they did Thursday, Friday, Saturday or something like that. They do the Thursday with the local guy and then on, on Friday when they would come in, they would do all the local guy would do all their jokes, but a version of them. So like I said, if you had a joke about Burrito's I fucking love burritos. That was like a big part of your act. Well, I'll tell you what, I'm Jamie Verdun. I fucking love Burritos and he just kept going on about that. Right. They would just circumvent that and they would, they would make it so that they would do some sort of a weak ass joke about burritos. So then when you would go up and do your joke about Burritos, 20% of the air would be left out of the sales. This is a shitty example cause burritos is very rare for her.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       I just had to happen to me, Joe, I just had to have, I had it where the guy was even said, I'm just turned 41 man. I like eating ass now I tell you. And I'm like, I'm about to go on stage. And that's the first thing I'm saying, it's about gym. I'm telling you, just cock blocked her own self. Jesus Christ. Listen, put your headphones on so you listen to what you said. It doesn't matter. We'll Diaz had it happened to two. It happens man. It's fucking stupid. Yo. The young guys that do it, I know what they're doing. They're just trying to get ahead. They're trying to do well, but it's a, it's one of the worst ways you could ever work with somebody. So it's such a short sighted way of thinking about things too. You gotta circumvent and sabotage their act. That's why you do it.

Speaker 2:          02:17:55       Right. You know, you always bring everybody you know on the road and so you don't have to deal with that shit ever. Well, do it right there too, because also, I know that's going to be an awesome show. Like we've got a show in Austin, Texas on August 29th Ian Edwards, Joey Diaz in me. Wow. Bet The house. Even if I suck in Edwards and Joey Diaz are two motherfuckers. That is insane show. Those guys are good man. Ian Is fucking funny. I love and it's great. I just watched him the other day. He's like, I never watched comedy, but I really sat down and watched his set the other day. I laughed harder than I've laughed in awhile. He's a good dude too, man. Thing about Ian. He's a really good dude. He's just like calm and smooth and friendly, you know, great stage presence. Oh my God. Dude, he murders it. I don't want to do any of his bits because I don't want to ruin it for you. But some of his bits are so smooth. He just like halfway into the bit, you close your eyes like,

Speaker 12:         02:18:51       ah,

Speaker 4:          02:18:54       as a punchline hits you like a wave of Oh shit. Oh Shit. Oh no, he didn't. Uh, he's so different. I love, well, I've known him forever. I've been friends with Ian's. It's like, um, I, uh, I started in the 88, I think I came to New York in [inaudible] 91, somewhere around there and that's, I met Ian somewhere around them. He's always been the same dude, always been super cool. It's just like somewhere along the line, I know he figured out how to just become so funny. He just started nailing it. And like, especially

Speaker 7:          02:19:28       in La, uh, he's one of those dudes, like if he's onstage, I make a point to go see him. I'm always make a point to go see Ian. He's always got some new shit and halfway into his new shit. You going, ah, ah, ah, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh No, you didn't. He's funny. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:19:45       Do you know a, a guy named Dan Saint Germain? Have you ever heard of him? No, I think so. Where's it from? Uh, I think he's from here. He lives here. I am. I know him by face. I might not know his name. I had on my secret or a comedy show the other day and he destroyed like, I've never seen somebody destroy. He seems like one of those guys, it was hot and he had a jacket on and he has a full beard and he just, and he destroyed like, and he, he felt like he was closing the whole time. And this dude before I definitely slipped high. We should get them on the [inaudible]. He's hilarious guys.

Speaker 7:          02:20:20       Listen man, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. Love that guy. We're always going to have these guys. They're always going to, they're not going to stop. They're going to be more now. There's going to be more than, I think there's more to that. Like I was having this conversation with Diaz and with, uh, Adam from the comedy store and we were like, I go when I look around guys like [inaudible] and Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle and Louis C K and I just, and Diaz and uh, Dunkin and Ari and Jim Jeffries. And I am like, fuck man, this is my favorite comedy era ever. This is my favorite as far as like the shit that I like. Like this is my favorite. I could listen to these guys forever as a comic. Um, you know, we're a part of this weird new sort of next level of comedy. There's a lot of like amazing artists that are popping up now.

Speaker 7:          02:21:15       Man, there's a lot of really fucking funny people that are popping up now. Thompson Gora is funny as fuck dude. I had him on the Ice House show two weeks ago and he was discharged Roy Yang in the back of the room at one point in time. I was like, I remember meeting Tom on that. Eddie, uh, excuse me, Charlie Murphy, uh, John Heffron Gig that I did in Phoenix and he was so composed and it's so smooth. Yeah. The real minute comedy tour. So smooth. And I remember thinking, Holy Shit, this guy is fucking funny. But that was like 2005 or something like that or whatever the hell it was. Or six when you look at this like w who he is now, God damn dude, he's, he's a machine. He's up there killing the other night I was like, Holy Fuck Thompson girls on another level, man.

Speaker 3:          02:22:08       What, what is it? Cause it seems like he really found, he really found his voice quick. Like I, it seems like, uh, I've known him, you know, maybe eight years, nine years or whatever, and I met him in San Francisco or I actually had met him on the tour also. But it seems like recently he's just in a whole different

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       level. It's, it's so interesting seeing comics go like up a level in front of your eyes. Like Ari did that Ari, I saw Ari special and it's probably one of the I, I, I was amazed. I was like, I can't believe you did that. Like that was perfect. I hadn't seen him in two years ago. He, he got that different in two years, you just kept working and kept pushing. It's amazing. It's amazing to watch, you know, even though you know it's going to happen again every time it happens. It's like if you were watching a flower and you watched it every day and you slowly got used to the fact that it's slowly opening up at at a certain point in time, you walk by that same spot and you see that flower and you go, Oh shit. Meanwhile, am I calling Aria Flower? Yes. My beautiful chew flower.

Speaker 2:          02:23:12       He, I'm just figured it out, man. He's a smart dude. You know, always got this way of looking at the criticism and the praise and figuring out which ones are right and just fucking plowing ahead. They just figured it out. He's figured out how to get better and figured out how to be stronger. I figured out how to write better. I figured out how to kill on stage and he just got this crazy point where he's at now. Do you know about the men? Most of producer Paradiso, I think it's called. It's called the sensitive plant. It's this really trippy plant that when you touch it, it like moves and opens up. Kind of like, like if you're scratching the back of a cat or something like that, it's really trippy. Uh, it's very sensitive. Like, look, he just, you know, touching it moves. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:23:56       Whoa. And then there's even parts where like, it will curl up. Ooh, this is bizarre. So he's touching it and these, these leaves are actually retracting, like they're sad. Closing up. Yeah. And then you can also rub it and it will kind of move towards the way of your hand and like, isn't that neat? God Damn Dude, it's a, in Brazil, Brazil's got all the crazy shit. They've got that spider that gives you a boner till you die. Brazilian wandering spider. Yeah. You know that one. That's the one that gives you a boner and it makes it, if you survive the poison, which you probably won't, it'll destroy your deck. So Dick's blown out. That's ridiculous. Like a hotdog. I wonder if they can dilute it. Have we already talked about this? I wonder if we could download it. Well, they're trying to, they're certainly working on it, but believe me, they thought about it too. Like I'm an idiot if I know that. It makes you get harder on women by scientists know to, it's a thing now, a woman, if I, Agora is a thing now. Well I thought regular Viagara they use on women, didn't they? Don't they use that on women? I don't know. I don't want it enough. This one vibrates flag palsy. It gives you some sort of epilepsy.

Speaker 2:          02:25:13       Yeah, I think that uh, there's going be a lot of different drugs they get from stuff like that. I just can't wait to have something where women take to get more horny. I think that's going to change it. I think it's a game changer. Drying solution. He's like, I'm not getting more attractive. So listen, we're going to figure out how to work at the other way. Feel cause we could have just waited. He fucked her. I was, I didn't do it to themselves. Yeah. It would have been free and clear. No, no hard feelings at all. I mean, um, did you see the snoop dog shit? Yeah, it's fucked up. He's never going to go to Sweden again. Does that, does that worry you? Cause you could have Sweden her life. No, I've only been there once. I think you went there, but I enjoyed it and I was sober.

Speaker 2:          02:25:48       Um, Jesus. But he was driving though. That's kind of weird that he was actually driving in Sweden. Yeah. I don't know the story. Is that what happened? He's driving Jamie. He's accusing the Swedish police of racially profiling him after he was detained in the town of Uppsala racially. I think there are a little bit different with a race. I wonder how much so in Sweden than they are in America. Somebody I'd known it was snoop to like Florida or Texas. They pullover tour buses. Knowing who wiz Khalifa, Willie Nelson, people involved in arrests in the same area. Right? Huh. Huh?

Speaker 2:          02:26:29       I have no idea. Maybe it's like his Negro, a bad word still. Is that where he's like still on the fence? That's a good question. It may be, I just fucked up by saying it. So I don't think it's bad, but it's just tasteful, tasteful. You know what's weird is that like the difference between colored and people of color, it's like it's such a small difference between those two phrases. Colored is offensive, right? You say colored people it's offensive. But if you say people of color not offensive, it's colored people really offensive that if you call it two Mexicans, Asians, US, anyone. Yeah, because they don't, they don't like it. It doesn't, you know, it's like the idea is there's regular people and then there's colored people. Right. So it may, it's like a distinction. I like how Mexicans own the word Brown now they're like, yeah, I'm Brown and like we'll, they're allowed to get away with Brown pride.

Speaker 2:          02:27:25       That's like a big source of contention in the mixed martial arts community. Cause Cain Velasquez who was the UFC heavyweight champion until he just lost to uh, uh, for ratio for doom. He has brown pride tattooed on his chest and he's widely recognized. It's not if not the all time great. One of the all time great heavyweight fighters ever. And he has brown pride and someone had said, you know, a bunch of people said what would happen if a guy was the heavyweight champion like Brock Lesnar and he had white pride on his chest. Like Whoa, you're not allowed to have white pride. Like that's, you have to have only like it has to be minorities. If it's, it's weird. It's like I get it because it's like the dominant white pride has been sort of like automatically attached in our, our idea with like the KKK or like some crazy fucks that hate black people. Whereas like with Brown part Brown pride, we sort of have this idea like automatically they just are happy

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       and proud. They're proud people. They're proud to be Mexican. It's okay. It's weird. Right? It's very weird. It's weird, but it's understandable. I mean, totally makes sense to me. I'm not. I just want to be really clear about that. I'm not arguing against that at all. I get it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to think that someone with a white pride tattoo on the chest might be racist. I would. I would. I would immediately go, oh Jesus. If I was walking down the beach and some dude was coming towards me and he had white pride tattooed on his chest, I'd be like, oh, confederate flag. Same thing. Only difference between the confederate flag is that the confederate flag for a lot of people, as ridiculous as it is represented their love of the south. I think that the idea of having this rebel flag that also represented people that wanted to keep slavery regardless of all the economic arguments, and I'm too fucking stupid to understand, but you know, and I know everybody knows you taught.

Speaker 4:          02:29:21       You start talking about the, the, the generally and the dukes of hazard and that fucking, that rebel flag on the roof of it. Everybody connects that with the south in the civil war, the war against the north that they lost. And that's what created all of us. We're all Americans now. Okay. This idea that you're still the south and you have to have this fucking different flag and I get that. It would be fascinating, but the idea that it's cool to just fly that fucking thing in the State House. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's bananas. And even though I joked around about it on Instagram, about a, I did a whole post about it, about the, uh, the idea is ridiculous because the real flag on that show was the daisy Duke cause I was like, daisy Duke represented a flat, it was like the first time there was a, an a, a piece of clothing that let the world know that you're hungry for Dick, whether your slots are gay men, if you wearing those cutoff shorts.

Speaker 4:          02:30:20       But that was my only reason for doing it. I don't want, I don't really have a political statement and defensive keeping the flag in the general Lee. I think if you could have a fucking dude with a laptop that can pretend that he's jumping over cars in the middle of the street, turn that stupid flagging to into an American flag. Let's joke around about it. You know, one point in time that flag used to be the rebel flag of the rebel army that fought in the civil war against the north and loss. Can you believe that shit, but now look at it. Oh, glory. Hold

Speaker 5:          02:30:48       Gloria. I never ever thought anything about racism growing up with that flag. I thought it was a cool looking for lag. I thought it was the flag from the Dukes of Hazzard. I went to Williamsburg. You would see that flag everywhere. As a kid. You were taught that flag like whatever. It's the flag north south flag you'd set by at the souvenir shop, but I don't think it was ever taught to us. It has any connections to racism. I think that's just cause we were too young and stupid. Stupid. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:31:13       But you're right, man. I used to love the fucking dukes of Hazzard. Everybody I know love the Dukes of hazard. That show was the shit. Yeah, just the Google home born and you know that we'll be back there. It's just going to take them to a couple of months to track the American flag on it. You know, repaint it. CGI style. I hope they do. I mean, I don't know man. Obviously I have a point of view of a white guy, point of view of a white guy when it comes to shit like slavery. So I always like, it's a, you know, say hi. Say what you feel, but recognize it's not about your people and it wasn't really that fucking long ago. 1865 what does that, yeah, that ain't shit. You know, when you know, you know you're having a birthday show August 5th right? How old are you going to be?

Speaker 4:          02:31:57       41 think about that shit. I think about 1865 it ain't shit. It ain't shit. It ain't shit. That shit was yesterday. They had slaves, dude, I'm 47 I'm going to be 48 in August. The slaves were like a day before I was born. They had slaves. That's fucking stupid, man. It was to literally 200 years before I was born. That is nothing. That's nothing. That's not that much time. I remember a hundred years before I was born is crazy. Had fucking slavery two years before that. That's real, right? 1865 I was born in 1967 so literally a hundred years. 200 years. A hundred years ago. 200 years ago. There was slavery everywhere, right? It was commonplace 300 years ago. 400 years ago. What is 400 years? If you live to be 100 that's that's, you know, that's awesome. That's like the best you get, so your life and his life back to back is slavery everywhere. If you live the full potential of Jamie and the full potential of red band back to back, birth to death, and that's slavery everywhere. Not even an argument against it. It's just fucking a part of doing business. That's not that long ago at all. Think about the idea of 1865

Speaker 1:          02:33:14       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:33:15       That's bananas. The Beatles were less than a hundred years later. Less than a hundred years after the Beatles, or excuse me, before the Beatles, there was slavery less than a hundred years after slavery. You have the Beatles. How? How not is that 1865 think about that, right? Was it 70 65 what year was it? What? What years of civil war? What do you do that as you forget we hear was forward. What year was that guy? 1921 no, for that. Is it like sixties sixties or seventies when you were at Gerald Ford. Gerald Ford? No, not the cars. The Ford. Gerald. Well, it's a Nixon. Nixon was a seventies right? Yeah. Thinking about that guy, sixties in the 70s what was the year a Kennedy died in [inaudible] 63 correct? Is that right? Somewhere around then Johnson. Okay. Kennedy, then Johnson and then Nixon after him. Yeah. Is that what happened? And then Carter? Yeah, dairy again. That's not that long.

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       Q magic. Richard Nixon ran for president today. TV show 30 something. I used to think that those people are old. Oh my God are dead. They were dead. I was in high school. I was like, this poor folks are dead. That was, now I'm 40 41 and a couple of weeks. 30 something that's so depressing. Um, Sandra Bullock, it's signaling insane. 45 older. 51 what? That crazy. Wow. What happened there? Life. It waits for no man. Brian Red Ban waits for no man. How bizarre is that? It's weird. A year is in our eyes. A long time. They used to be, I don't think of it anymore. Listen on that long man. I mean, I checked my mail four times a year, so it's, it's just for male sessions for me, the idea of 10 years, it used to be so big. It's an it happens quick. I would do, I would definitely, she's beautiful. Beautiful. Don't say that. What you would do to her sexually because that's gross. She say she's beautiful. She's hiding her man, so she's hiding. Your hands are hands. That might change. It might be she might've been in the middle of some sort of a dance when she spreads her hands out. Why? But they start from behind her. Women get weird hands.

Speaker 2:          02:35:47       It goes to the first to go is their hands. You didn't need to get checks to work gloves now fetishists weird checks like harnesses and shit. She's still beautiful. But it is weird that you realize as you get older, how quick a year is then how quick 10 years is and 10 20, 30 40 ch ch, ch the differences, we're able to access more information than any generation before us. So I think because of that overload, we're looking at all this different shit like people that we knew and loved growing up that are dying and we go, oh, this is a weird little fucking crazy ride that everybody's on here that nobody really seems to be paying attention to exactly how this thing works. And no one's even really totally, completely aware of it until like fairly recently, like within the last few hundred years of life. Have you, did you see it?

Speaker 2:          02:36:39       I saw this thing, uh, yesterday when I was looking online. It's a visualization of why time seems to be faster as you get older and it's based just on math, like as when you're to your reference of a year. Right. As long as you get older, I'll show it to you. No, it totally makes sense. I've seen that before, but yeah, put that up right here. Oh, and whole life in a timeline. Oh, okay. That makes sense. Like when you're all the way at 17 there was a small Saul fractal. Yeah. Scariest shit. Yeah. I mean, I guess it is, but if you said earlier, like you said earlier, you know that you think that when you die it's going to be like, Oh yeah, I'm okay. Oh, here I am again. If that's the case, what are we worried about? But we are, we don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:37:31       We definitely don't know. But the interesting thing is it's, for some people it's just like not knowing, so is too much. It's too fucked up. You know? That's where I think things like that Mirage men show that we were talking about earlier. I think what that is is the same thing that's like some ridiculous hardcore cult kind of religion. The need to believe in something that's bigger and better. The need to believe in something that's above all of this that you see in front of you. Something bigger and crazier. It's Sorta like legitimizes existence, you know? But if there really are aliens, right? If there really were aliens are coming here from another planet and they weren't even talking to us, like how needy our way we keep reaching out to these fuckers that don't even want to talk.

Speaker 4:          02:38:11       Tours were probably super annoying. It won't stop calling me. They're like, listen, I picked up one of them in 1950 to this day. It's a fucking industry. Okay? Everywhere you look, there's websites dedicated. They make documentaries and books and it's all lies. Except one guy told one fucking guy, keep his mouth shut. He couldn't do it. I touched his butt. So whatever. Now it's a part of the fucking folklore. They always touch your butt and they're always doing things to your asshole, right? That's the whole thing. They say they do anal probes. That's the whole thing. I was drunk. One Dude who flew here from another planet and found out where, oh fucking country filled with rats were a guy or a civilization that kinky bomb mouse. Shucked it was an experience. We shared together a magic wand, a cold steal table, a bright light, a wad in your ass hole. All right, this is what we're doing. We're checking you out. I want to see what you're made out of. What do you like and what happened became a whole thing.

Speaker 5:          02:39:16       Do you think it's weird when birds do this kind of shit where they all sit like flock together in these huge crazy like it's like crop circle in the sky. This seems like to me something that's like, I don't know, like a, a mistake, like a glitch in our universe where birds can do these weird, it's like they're all falling the same program. Like I think their power went out and they're resetting or something like that. Well the crazy thing is that exists and all in nature. Yeah, fish do it. Beautiful Way. Fish do it just like this. And the difference between the birds and the fish. Obviously he's the birds can land, the fish have to kind of keep moving. But some of the fish videos of these giant schools of fish, they look exactly like this. Right? Yeah. Don't though, for the audio listeners, we're what we're actually watching where you see a humongous amount of birds. This case, it's, I think starlets I think they're called. What's the name of this video? Jamie? Brian's planet is called watch starlings, a spectacular murmur. They're called Mermaid Moravians when murmuring creations. Murmuration if you Google that, you can see a lot of cool photos and stuff like that. Murmuration numerations yeah. And uh, it's just weird that it seems like the birds are all doing it. Like, like almost like a program like that. It doesn't seem like, it's like, like they're just kind of following a pattern that they're supposed to follow.

Speaker 4:          02:40:38       The ants do that too. And a with ants when one of their members dies, I think it's the queen. Yeah. Pretty sure it's the queen. They have an ant death spiral where they don't know where to go. Yes, it is. Ants. Yeah. Pull up ant death spiral, Jamie. That is the most bizarre shit ever because there's somehow or another file following each other. There's a scent or something that they're looking for and they can't find, and when they can't find it, they all just keep walking in a circle until they fucking shit the bed. Oh, there's just explained. Is it an explanation? There is another video where, can we play the explanation or would it be like copper up? Give him a credit for whatever it is. What is the discovery channel or discovery channel? It says aunt death circles explained this. James Williams discovery news in a spiral. It's bizarre and we wanted to find out exactly what's going on. We should talk Usta Research, Hurricane Sandy, that different than a hurricane going on

Speaker 13:         02:41:41       in this video is we have an

Speaker 5:          02:41:43       look at that. That's a hurricane. Yeah. Yeah. Have you [inaudible] it's Tony went to check it. Hurricane that's crazy.

Speaker 13:         02:41:49       Amp is following the trail pheromone that trail chemicals.

Speaker 5:          02:41:54       Wow. So it's a smart and they've got, yeah,

Speaker 13:         02:41:57       during rounds so that they're following endlessly their neighbors. Now, the problem we have is that army answer blind and

Speaker 5:          02:42:05       these are,

Speaker 13:         02:42:06       and they are very dependent on following trails,

Speaker 5:          02:42:11       also ready to spin around so they starve to death. Why do we believe these people though? He does. What a fucking hands thinking this thing, you can't even see it so small. But this guy's like, no, I got it. He knows the smell. It's the smell. Well, they've done a lot of studies on ants. Don't make any mistake about it. I'm sitting there with doing a questionnaire. Yes, no, you know what I just said that they did a lot of studies on the answer and I'm assuming they've done a lot of studies on it or just believing these guys that smoke a lot of weed that Ha, let's make it a smell thing. No, I have a, you know, it's like all these studies, you look at some of these studies and you're like, oh, that must be the truth. And you find out, oh they forgot to do this. So now that makes that study 100% fake in a, you know, like, uh, there's a lot of studies where they just didn't test the right thing and uh, you know, later in life they find like, oh, we should have tested for this other chemical and that makes that whole study vat a void, you know? Uh, definitely does happen all the time. I

Speaker 4:          02:43:11       don't know of any examples.

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       Well, I could do, I don't want to even bring it up. I, I don't want to break it up by that teaches college.

Speaker 4:          02:43:21       Yeah. The way of explaining things just yeah. No, you've got a good point though. Never know they, they learn new shit all the time. Right. There's always some new stuff that invalidates all the stuff they used to think for. There's a lot of wacky shit they used to believe in not that long ago. We find out about medicine and all the weird shit that people used to do. Just not that.

Speaker 5:          02:43:39       I think vitamin C, like I think, didn't they say something recently where they thought vitamin C was the, the the number one go to like if you to build up your immune system and, and stuff like that for you. Yeah, but I thought there was also studies. I go, nope, we, we thought that's not completely right. Or like drinking wine every day. I think there's, there's like so many like these studies that are like that where like, no, a glass of wine, it's really good for your heart. And then they find out like, like two years, Larry. Oh No, we ever wrong. My are bad. We, it's actually really thought it was, the resveratrol from the glass of wine was actually proven to work. I'm just using that as an eight January. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:44:11       Maple and making one up. Yeah. Yeah. Well they, they definitely learned shit all the time. It wouldn't obviously, I mean, when you look at all the medical breakthroughs they're making at a Dale, you've seen the new penis thing. They're going to be a little to build you a new penis within five years. I'm good. But could you imagine that? Get my penis taken out? Well, okay. Five years they start with regular size decks. How long before they start getting crazy, if they can actually make you a dick, like, and the idea is that you have injured your Dick and some sort of a mechanical accident mouth. So sort of a industry job here, working on machines and whatever. But if you hang in there for five years, they can actually make you a new deck, right. Printed deck. I'm sure. I don't know what they're going to do, how they're going to do it, but they think within five years you'll be able to make you a deck. So there will be no more micro penises. So all those poor fuckers that got just the, you know, it's a really got to be a giant bummer man to be born with this like tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny deck. And a lot of people are not any mom bench. Not Anymore. Now they got a dick like Thor. How big do you think Thoratec has to do plays? Thor thick, thick, thick, like a fucking 10 year old weightlifters leg.

Speaker 5:          02:45:26       Oh yeah, I'm surprised. People with small dicks aren't more child molesters. Right? Write that down. Like child molesters should 10 year old weight lifters, leg child molesters you think would be all about like, uh, the small Dick people would all be about child molesters,

Speaker 4:          02:45:48       I guess. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          02:45:50       Right? Like if you had a really small Dick and, and that you're, your only thing would be Asian girls and children or something. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Yeah, please. I'm trying to get you to hold the ball while I write this thing down. Don't throw it in the fucking ocean. Uh, the, uh, AP added 550,000 old knee newsreel clips to youtube. So all these, uh, old school news clips, I've just been added to youtube, like old school stuff. Uh, which is Kinda cool. They have a video right now showing all the different stuff and we're talking like, like, uh, that you're allowed to use and post up on, uh, things. Can you guys open? Yeah, it's open now. They have video archive at Apa. So you have all these old school, raw, uncut videos that are now just all thrown on youtube now. So that's kind of cool. You get to see some, some old shit. That's incredible. Yeah. Elvis stuff. Uh, well you can embed into your website. That's insane.

Speaker 14:         02:46:55       Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:46:57       What's insane really is when you think about how much access to visual history we have compared to any, any race ever or any civilization ever. The difference being the difference between writing stuff down on parchment. Would that, do you ever see that Marco Polo show from a Netflix now Marco Polo. It's good. Fuck on show dude. It's one of those Netflix originals. Does that take place in a pool?

Speaker 15:         02:47:20       Huh?

Speaker 4:          02:47:26       No, no. It takes place. Uh, and the, the uh, the Gingiss con days king, his cons. I think his grandson cooler con, I think it was his son or his grandson, but it's all about the Mongols and Marco Polo too. It's crazy. It's wild. It's amazing. It's really fucking good show. It's fun. It's fun to watch what we talking about that maybe bring that up. Photos, video, visual history, like think about like their, when they would read their history and they read their history, they have these fucking scrolls, they pull out. It says the pawn, the seventh day of the ninth month, you know, Cesar walk towards the water, drank upon it and found the fish that contain the disease that killed the city. I mean the, you had a fucking sit around the campfire and guess what the fuck happened? You had to guess what the fuck happened just two, three generations ago. We could look back at video from World War One. We can watch film footage from World War fucking one. We can watch world war two Vietnam. We can watch guys smoke pot out of shotguns. We can watch shit from Iraq. We could see night vision footage from Iraq and Afghanistan to, we've seen more shit visually than any race that's ever existed ever than any, any civilization ever. And not by a small amount. By an enormous amount. Yes.

Speaker 5:          02:48:44       This is a little kid. This is a nine year old smoking tobacco and going off on cursing and stuff like that and not Iraq. Really. Yeah. Can we know what she's saying? This is on live like right now. And I think they had some translate it

Speaker 2:          02:49:07       in the comments. She might be just talking about how Mickey Mouse and his weight cuter than Daffy Duck. We don't even know what it says. Nine year old Arab smokes and curses nonstop. So uh, in the people in the comments that some people have actually uh, translate it so I don't want to read it. Get us killed. Right. Be careful. She seemed like she was a fervent believer of something. These photos, those are these birds making different shapes and stuff like that there. It's beautiful. It's almost like an art piece and it's insane. It makes me wonder what if there's something more to that. Well, it, it also looks like certain wavelengths I feel like capture like radio wavelengths you ever see like, like images or interpretations of wavelength? Yes. Wavelengths and fish. Schools of fish and schools of birds. It's kind of like crop circles at school.

Speaker 2:          02:49:59       Birds, no. Oh Fuck, fuck Jesus Christ. It's kind tired of natural crop circles and not the fake one. You know what I mean? Like it's like, here's the thing, why? Who the fuck is making crop circles and look, stop being a dick. Just come out and let all these dummies know that you made all these designs and do it again. I think they have, I think we just haven't caught up. So they have some, right? They have some, they definitely have some, but there's some of them that they don't want to give up how they made them. That's my interpretation. I mean there's some fucking people that have dedicated their life towards the mystery of the crop circle. Have you ever seen it? Secrets in the field is a documentary on it. Mysteries in the field that he did it. What if we find out big foot did it all even even if they do do it.

Speaker 2:          02:50:44       You imagine if like that's the coolest shit you could show us. Oh, we knew it was still on grows. If you come from another planet, you fucking step on our food. You Dick. You know they don't do tree circles. You know we can't eat trees. All right, fuck you. See if sue, we have enough houses do a tree circle, but don't be fucking step in our food, right? It'll crush our wheat. You douchebag those. Turn our corn and some fucking picture of you. Who Dick. Right, right. Build a, build a house for a homeless person tonight that instead come on asshole. Help the community out. Yeah. Why do you, why do you have to show me some cryptic fucking stupid message? Too dumb to send me a text. Hey Dude. Hey red band. It's popped the alien. Hey listen man. Have you ever thought about moving to Alaska?

Speaker 2:          02:51:34       You might take it easy. It's a little messages like that. Don't fucking talk about impending doom. Write it down inside wheat. What will send me a text message to find out that that we had been talking to aliens for the whole time and they're just like the evil people on Youtube. Like the bad commenters and the negative people. They're actually the alien. It's like fuck you. Like they're just trolling. This could be, and that's why we think like how dumb is this person? Why is this person so mean? Why is that person so, yeah, it's a fucking alien somewhere.

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       How about this in might not even be the trolling us. It might be that they were created by the aliens, [inaudible] fathers, their components in a mathematical equation to sort of push life along and the components are really fucking annoying stupid people and they would just keep you moving forward to try to get out of the way these retards. And that's why you push further. And that's why we have like those Honda Atvs and shit like that. That's why people have chainsaws. You want to be able to push further into the woods away from these fuckheads could be possible. Right. To them and thinking, man, doing a lot of thinking lately come up with shit like that. That's right. Like sense. Right. Totally makes sense.

Speaker 16:         02:52:46       MMM.

Speaker 3:          02:52:48       What else? What else we got here that I wanted to talk about? Uh, the android phone thing. Oh, seaworld has oracle week to see seaworld needs to just

Speaker 4:          02:52:56       stop, just stop talking. You know, like if every time they open their mouth about stuff like that, every time they say something like, you know, wherever an oracle week or something like that, you're just opening yourself up for this wave of negative publicity.

Speaker 3:          02:53:08       Have you seen the commercials lately where they're like, well, you have not captured a way all in 28 years. We talked about it, man, it's, we talked about one of the shows and I was like, wow,

Speaker 4:          02:53:18       imagine if that was slavery. Yeah. Imagine if you said that we haven't slaved a black van and over 35 years of slaves we have here are all old fucked up slaves that we won and a card game and wild bill Hickok saloon. Yeah, it's rude. It's rude and it's fucked up. It's just, we just don't understand them, but it's just amazing that they don't realize that like they, they should be trying to get out. Like this is a toxic business you're in. If you figured out how to be the, the head of seaworld, you could figure out a better way to handle it. There's another way to do it. There's another way to help those things and conserve and, and make it so that it's some sort of a wildlife attraction. Maybe perhaps work to engineer an ecosphere where these animals are very comfortable and you can do trips out there to them and make it like a bigger deal. Like a Jurassic Park type.

Speaker 3:          02:54:09       Yeah. When did they create the formula of c road? How long? I see road Benanna women are allowed to work yet. Like what? How like the SEC 60 where they ran out of people slavery. So they went right to sea world.

Speaker 4:          02:54:23       I don't know. What if there was a connection, it's a, it's going to be, you know, like Amber Lyon says they're gonna end up on the wrong side of history. That's a great expression. She loves to use the wrong side of history is a perfect way to describe this. Like I, you know, just abandoning all guilt and blame and all that. Let's just forget it. Just forget it. Let those fucking things go. Just figuring out a way to let them go. Figure out a way to engineer an enormous bay where you can sort of keep them nearby. Figure out a way to supply them with food on a regular basis. Figure out a way to communicate with that with them. Figuring out a way how to educate them to get strong enough so they can start hunting on their own. Figure out a way how make it work because the idea that you can take this super intelligent being that might be as smart as a person and the only way we could ever enjoy that they're here is to put them in a fucking swimming pool or the fact that the people that enslave them also love the ones that are free.

Speaker 4:          02:55:16       All right, you can't do it. I get it. You're stuck. I get you're stuck. You're backed into a corner by the arguments you've made before. You can't keep doing it. You can't keep doing it. It's too fucked up. Those things are smart as shit. They just don't have fingers. They don't have pens. They don't. They don't print newspapers. They don't leave behind a record, but they're smart as shit. We know they are. The idea that we're more important than them to the point that we could put them in a fucking fish tank or a swimming pool or whatever the hell you want to call those things. It's crazy. It just doesn't make any sense. They got to stop the idea that they can keep doing this and that we don't, you know, we don't get completely outraged on a regular basis that people are still willing to go there. Stop going there, can't put dolphins in jail for no fucking reason. Says wrong.

Speaker 2:          02:56:05       I think they're, it's, it's coming to the point where now it's going to be illegal. I mean, look, we started with transgenders and then we went, you know, dolphins in like 10 years. We're going to fire and transgender people to dolphins. I'm just saying that there's, in 10 years it's going to think you make some awesome points to, hey, have you checked out Paulie? Tune a on he, he's the one that always makes all the cartoons based on the show. He just released a new one, the ranch one, Jesus Christ. Talented as fuck, man. You want to show a little bit of that? Yeah. Well let's end with do we have enough time to, and with that it's about just enough time to enlist. All right. Goodnight everybody. A red band. Uh, thanks for doing this. There's a lot of fun. We went to old school tonight, San Jose, it might be there Thursday.

Speaker 2:          02:56:46       So as Dean and Dean del Rey and Christian Spicer at the San Jose Improv. So come out to do, we haven't done these in forever. I know. It's fun holds. Cool. All right, we're gonna play this Paulie tune and then go fuck yourself. I'll be back tomorrow with uh, Chris and Carrick from mixed martial arts.com the guys who created it and run mixed martial arts.com. Exciting Shit. Pitch Reebok and a, how dare you.
