00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
- What up?

00:00:00.893 --> 00:00:03.020
Today we're gonna talk about waves.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.950
This is a circle, you probably knew that.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.930
If we were to turn this circle on

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.860
and watch it go up and
down and up and down

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.680
and trace that motion out,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.680
you get what's called a
sine wave, which you know

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.710
to be important in things
like pendulum motion,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.540
particle physics, things of that nature.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.050
Sine waves are important but for my money,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.390
the coolest thing about 'em
is you can add them together

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.780
to do other things, which
sounds simple until you realize

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.140
this is how the 2018 Nobel
Prize in physics was won.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.840
My buddy, Brady Haron,
has a really good video

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.580
about that overall on Sixty Symbols.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.080
There's some fancy math I learned

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.950
at the university called
the Fourier Series.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.610
These are my old notebooks
and check this out.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.230
The teacher challenged
us to create this graph

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.430
by doing nothing but
adding together curves.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.420
And I found where I did
it, it's right here.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.470
And it took me, it looks like
four or five pages, yeah.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.750
It took a lot of pages
and I ended up with this.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.690
I was able to make the graph

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.410
by adding together a bunch of waves

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.990
and to demonstrate that, I created this.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.630
I had to get a tripod,
here's my flip book.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.720
So it starts with one sine wave

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.960
and then we add another
one and you can see,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.040
the more waves you add together,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.670
the closer the function gets

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.860
to what you're supposed to make,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.910
because you can see that
and that look very similar.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.410
That's 50 waves added together.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.920
So it's cool and it's one thing to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.820
know how to do the Fourier Series by hand,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.290
it's quite another to
understand how it works.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.290
And I didn't really have that moment

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.220
of it clicking in my brain until I saw

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.580
this awesome blog by a guy named Doga

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.330
from Turkey, he's a
student at Georgia Tech.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.320
I want to show you this,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.000
this made it click in
my mind unlike anything,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
this transcends language.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.450
So let's go check out Doga

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.180
and let him teach you how
a Fourier Series works.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.038
I'm in Georgia Tech, this is Doga.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:45.871
- Hello.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:50.530
- You have visualized, via
animation, a Fourier Series

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.290
in the most beautiful way I
have ever seen in my life.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.123
- Thank you.

00:01:54.123 --> 00:01:56.670
- Sine waves are probably the
simplest kind of wave, right?

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.600
The second most simple kind
of wave is a square wave.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.230
But the difference is you have
sharp edges in a square wave.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.380
The first thing Doga did to impress me

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.570
is he used curvy waves to
make sharp-edged square waves.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.740
We have to add up different
oscillations or simple

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530
harmonic motion here.
- Harmonic, harmonics, yes.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.730
- [Destin] Yeah, and so,
the first harmonic, n=1,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.030
gives you this.
- Yes.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.620
- [Destin] Which looks nothing like it.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.560
- Not to me interesting,
just boring sine wave

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.911
and I add one more, it's actually like it.

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:31.320
I'm adding one harmonic and another one,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.150
well one third of that harmonic.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.070
- So you're adding a basic

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.860
well what are we going
to call these, wipers?

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.180
- Yeah let's call them wipers.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.810
- Okay so we're going to
add a wiper on a wiper

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.400
and by doing that and
we graft the function.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.890
- [Doga] And then follow
the tip of these wipers.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.723
- [Destin] Yeah?

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:50.180
- [Doga] And then draw
that with respect to time.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.430
- That's awesome man!

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.370
Like this is really really beautiful

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.000
and really really simple.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.823
- [Doga] So, I can add more wipers.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.053
Making us more harmonics.

00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:05.260
And I add.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.713
Fifteen harmonics is
something really cool.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.210
- [Destin] Oh wow that looks like a whip.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.060
- [Doga] Yes.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.980
- So you're saying

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.450
so basically, here's the up-shot

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.530
a Fourier series you
can create any function

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.010
as a function, or an addition

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.950
of multiple simple harmonic
motion components, right?

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.783
- Yes.

00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:28.940
- All Doga is doing is he's
taking these sine waves

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.330
that we explained earlier and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.470
he's stacking one on another sine wave.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.890
He's stacking the circles,
to add together these waves

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.950
to create a Fourier series.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.180
These visualization
techniques that Doga developed

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.790
worked on any version of any function.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.730
For example on a sawtooth wave,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.070
you can see at n=8,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.360
how the Fourier series starts to play out.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.890
It looks really cool.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.870
How did you do this?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.250
Like what program did you
use to visualize this?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.588
- [Doga] I used Mathematica.

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:56.160
- [Destin] Mathematica?
- [Doga] Mathematica, yes.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.260
- [Destin] Really?
- [Doga] Yes.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.220
- [Destin] So if I give you any
function can you create this

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.280
but you had to flip it
into video format somehow,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280
how did you do that?

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.010
- I exported in like, gif.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.290
I created a table of the different times

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.183
of this animation.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.490
And then I just exported
those tables into gif.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.280
That's all that I did.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.500
- Okay, here's an interesting
question, are people

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.000
It's actually "jif" I don't
know if you know that.

00:04:26.228 --> 00:04:27.360
(laughing)

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.720
So if I were to give you a function,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.553
like if I were to give you

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.023
a super, super complicated function.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.770
Like a really weird curve,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.020
you could make a graphic like this?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.020
- I can, yes.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.320
- [Destin] So I can challenge you?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.153
- Yep

00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:43.130
- Let me explain what's happening here,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.320
amongst academics there's this

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.380
thing that I just now made up,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.180
called "mathswagger" and basically,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.830
it's when a person is good at math

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.570
they like think they
can do anything with it.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.390
It's not like a prideful thing,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.020
I mean Doga is a very humble person.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.860
But you could tell he was very confident

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.500
in what his abilities with math were.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.560
So I can challenge you?
- Yep.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.300
- Which is why I'm challenging him

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.540
to draw this with the Fourier series.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.440
It is that Smarter Every Day thing

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.500
that you see all over the internet.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.090
I totally am geeking out
right now, I love this.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.610
It's a hard image to draw using math,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.940
it's got like curves right.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.420
It's got little sharp
points and switch backs.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.820
It's self-serving for me,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.060
so this is an appropriate challenge

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.090
for somebody that's
demonstrating "mathswagger".

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.910
The problem is, he actually can do it.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.710
He can model this using nothing but

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.880
circles and the Fourier series.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.700
Which is completely impressive.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.550
Check this out.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.940
The first thing that he has to do

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.590
in order to draw this image

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.800
is to extract the x and y
positions that he would need

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.370
to make functions for in
order to make this thing work.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.570
He then needs to create a Fourier series

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.240
for each one of those functions

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.040
so that he can add them together.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.750
And as you can see, these
first few were not winners.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.060
I mean like no stretch of the imagination

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.040
could make your brain
think this looks like

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.670
the side profile of a human head.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.950
Everything's a bit derpy.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.550
But as he starts to refine it,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.210
and he adds more and more
waves to the functions,

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.410
things start to hone-in and
it starts to look really good.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.420
At about 40 circles in
this whole function,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.030
things start to look really good,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.750
and your brain would totally think

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.270
that you're looking at a drawn image

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.720
instead of a mathematically
drawn function.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.830
If you look closer at
just one of these arms,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.610
you would think that it's chaos.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.870
But it's not, it's complete order

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.730
backed up by a mathematical function.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.580
In fact, this is why I love math,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.790
it's the language that describes
the entire physical world.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.580
We can approximate anything,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.500
as long as you have enough terms.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.710
This is the beauty of the Fourier series,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.620
you take simple things you understand

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.580
like oscillators, sine waves, circles,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.860
and you can add them together

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.530
to do something much more complex.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.363
And if you think about it,

00:06:41.363 --> 00:06:43.170
that's all of science and technology.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.460
You take these simple things,
and you build upon them,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.570
and you can make a complex system,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.200
that can do incredible things.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.900
A simple thing can lead to
something incredibly powerful.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.740
Speaking of the power of simple things,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.610
I want to say thanks to
the sponsor, Kiwi Co.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.660
I reached out to Kiwi Co and asked them to

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.410
sponsor Smarter Every Day a long time ago

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.630
because this can change the world.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.110
They send a box to your
house for a kid to open

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.330
and build a project with their hands.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.030
They're not on a phone,
they're not on a tablet,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.330
they're building something
with their hands,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.970
and that's going to change
how they look at things.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.210
You might like to work on
the kit with your child,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.220
or it might be important to
have a hands-off approach

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.410
and let them build something on their own

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.800
and see it through to completion.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.130
The kit comes to your house,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.050
there's really good instructions in there.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.390
The kid gets to work on
a project themselves,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.740
and at the end of the project

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.760
they have something they
built with their own hands.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.570
Ultimately, I just want you
to do this for your children.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.610
Or a child you love.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.940
And I want more of this in the world.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.000
Go to kiwico.com/smarter and select

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.370
whatever kit makes the most
sense for the kid in your life.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.930
Get the first kit for free,
you just pay shipping,

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.950
you can cancel the
subscription at any time.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.666
It makes a great gift, I
really believe in Kiwi Co.

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:53.810
