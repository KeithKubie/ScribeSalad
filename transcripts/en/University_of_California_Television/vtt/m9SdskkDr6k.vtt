00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:31.531
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked, large brained, long the

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.530
the master of fire, tools, and
language but still trying to understand

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:46.611
ourselves. Aware that death is inevitable,
yet, filled with optimism. We grow up

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:52.871
slowly. We hand down knowledge.
We  empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:57.941
We shape the future from our shared
understanding of the past.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:04.951
CARTA brings together experts from diverse
disciplines to exchange insights

00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.141
on who we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:14.071
An exploration made possible by the
generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.350
- [Elizabeth] I particularly appreciate
being invited because I'm not a

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.840
paleoanthropologist, and I don't really
study climate specifically. Instead, what

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.640
I'm going to do is give you the
perspective of the other animals that

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.430
occupy the earth, these small animals,
large animals. And I'm going to definitely

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.740
delve us into the future and ask some
tough questions about our population. So I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.710
title my talk somewhat provocatively about
tipping points. And tipping points are-

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.420
they're situations of a state where you
have a non-linear kind of system. And when

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.010
you move beyond some particular point in
that non-linear system, you can't go back

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.270
to where you started. Now I'm going to
advocate that we're poised on the edge of

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.270
a tipping point for planet Earth. So, when
some threshold is crossed, and the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.770
question is are we about ready to cross it
or have we already? This system is going

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.290
to move into a new state. And the example
I put up here is an egg about ready to go

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.710
off the edge. Ice melting in the Arctic
might be another one to think about. So,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.640
mass extinctions. I've been asked before
whether or not the Earth has shown tipping

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.940
points. We know they happen in ponds. They
happen in small ecosystems. But mass

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.490
extinctions, in fact, can happen on a
planetary scale. We already saw this mass

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.290
extinction graphic. They're labeled there,
the Ordovician-Silurian, the Late

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.570
Devonian, the Permo-Triassic where we lost
95% of all the species on the planet. The

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.611
Triassic-Jurassic in the KT where we lost
dinosaurs and a lot of marine reptiles.

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:57.660
The point is, is that these are mass
extinctions, and you'll see in every case

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.351
there's a drop in diversity. This is
generic marine diversity.

00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:07.940
So this is a marine record, not a
terrestrial one. But the point is, is that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.341
when it recovers, and it takes
between 5 and 10 million years

00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:15.141
for life to recover after
these mass extinctions,

00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:18.941
life is completely different.
We've lost those organisms that

00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:23.890
founded the diversity on the planet prior
to the extinction, and they don't come

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.630
back. So it reassembles. It is, in fact, a
new state. So the earth is warming

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.770
rapidly. You've seen many versions of
this. But I'm providing here a little bit

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.470
of a perspective about- from our
perspective. So, we're here on this

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.650
graphic. All of those different colored
squiggles show different scenarios.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.510
Depending on what models are used by IPCC,
we will be here. Now, you've heard a lot

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.170
about the evolution of humans, modern
humans. By the time we get to that point,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:01.760
in 2050, we will have global planetary
temperatures warmer than our species has

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.880
ever experienced on its time on earth. And
if we happen to make it to 2100, and to

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.060
temperatures somewhat above 4 degrees,
Earth has not been as hot as that

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.280
projected temperature in 14 million years.
Now the perspective is, and this is one

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.190
I'm giving you, mammal species don't live
that long. We don't have mammal species on

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.680
the planet that are 14 million years old.
So the memory of this climate, in the

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.210
genome of these species, is gone. World
population is still growing. Now, there

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.080
will be 9 billion people on the planet by
2045. So, 2045 here, there will be 9

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.280
billion people. And if we continue at-
these are current fertility rates shown

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.000
in the upper blue, current fertility
rates. You can imagine.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.860
I mean, 15 million people on the planet.
Unbelievable. In fact, fertility rates are

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.400
slowing but not fast enough. Instead of
replacing ourselves, a male and a female,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.660
with two children. We would have to go
down to just .5 children per person to

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.380
follow the lower blue curve. So human
population growth is the elephant in the

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.860
room. It is tremendously terrifying. So,
even though the Late Quaternary,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.500
transition from a Pleistocene, the cold,
arid Pleistocene to the warmer more

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.040
wetter, Holocene is not exactly analogous
and, in fact, very different in many ways

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.300
to the kinds of climate we're experiencing
today. In fact, there are two similar

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.210
features. One, we are warming the
environment as we move from the

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.390
Pleistocene to the Holocene. And we're
also expanding. As humans, we're

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.730
colonizing the globe. So those two
features are, in fact, something we share

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.660
with what's happening today. So you heard
a little bit about these dramatic warming

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.720
and cooling events. Here's the
Bolling-Allerod and then followed by an

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.110
abrupt Younger Dryas. It's a cooling event
that saw the extinction, for example, of

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.000
Irish elk in Ireland as that environment
cooled rapidly. And then we end up into

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.030
what's called the Holocene or really about
the last 10,000 or so years of relatively

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:28.470
constant temperatures. However, we
expanded in this latter part of a

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.890
Quaternary. You know, we left Africa
around 200,000 years ago. We colonized

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:41.020
Europe and Asia. We colonized Australia
somewhere between 40 and 60,000 years ago.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.690
And then we made it to the Americas last,
somewhere between 13 and 35,000 years ago.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:54.250
Now, with our colonization of these
isolated areas, we caused extinctions.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.670
This is a photo. This beautiful image is
the menagerie of animals that used to roam

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.290
in North America and are now
no longer here. There are

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:09.020
[[inaudible 00:08:04]] giant ground
sloths, glyptodons. There's the giant

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:15.310
bison. Camels which basically evolved in
North America left colonized Asia,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.790
colonized South America and went extinct
in North America. And then horses which,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.460
again, have millions of years of history
in North America and went extinct only to

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.630
be recolonized by Spanish explorers.
Historically, about half the world's large

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:37.380
animals, animals larger than 44 kilograms
or about 100 pounds, went extinct at this

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:44.070
time. Incidentally, humans are about that
size. So it's not just our impact that

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:50.170
cause change in animal distributions and
abundance. In fact, there are some small

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:56.640
mammals, like this bog leming that
went extinct at this Pleistocene, Holocene

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:06.080
transition. So we know that ice covered
much of Canada, and there was no place for

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.450
these bog lemings to live. Every one of
those black dots you see in North America

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.810
were occupied by bog lemings during the
Pleistocene. They're no longer found

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.420
really in the lower 48. In fact, what they
are- they're occupying this orange

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:27.380
range up here. They are really an
circumarctic species. So they responded as

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.640
you'd expect a species that likes a
relatively cold environment. As the ice

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.660
left, they tracked that environment
northwards. But not all species responded

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.520
that way. These are two images of two
species that are found in a cave called

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.130
Samwell Cave that excavated several years
ago in northern California, shown by the

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:52.660
black dot there. These two species didn't
really respond north. In fact, they

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.570
contracted their ranges to higher
elevation but also much wetter

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:03.480
environments that's currently found
in Samwell Cave today, which is located on

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.200
the shores of Lake Shasta. So these
animals- the mountain beaver, it's not

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:15.620
confined to mountains nor is it a beaver.
It is the last species of what was a very

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.790
large group of species in the family
aplodontiidae which is a very ancient,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.400
North American family of rodents. And it
is the only species left in the family

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:33.200
today. It's very primitive, and it cannot
concentrate its urine. And so it has to be

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.260
by running fresh water all day, all the
time. And so you find them confined into

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:45.130
very dense old-growth Douglas fir forests
along the coast and the pacific northwest,

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:51.450
a very ancient lineage that is threatened
by warming temperatures and dry

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.740
conditions. The other animal you see is
the white-footed vole. Very little is

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:02.020
known about this animal accept the fact
that it's somewhat arboreal, and it's

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.880
found in deciduous trees and probably up
in these old-growth Doug fir forests.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.320
This animal contracted with the Doug fir
forest of a wetter condition, not so much

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.850
higher up in elevation. Animals today are
moving pole-ward just like they did in the

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:27.090
Pleistocene. This is a range map of the
current distribution in 2013. The black

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.000
line is the current distribution of the
armadillo. The armadillo is related to

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.320
that glyptodon, that giant thing I showed
you in the previous slide. It's a South

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.670
American animal, and it is expanding. It
made it across the Rio Grande in 1850, and

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:49.120
it's expanding northward. It's limited by
winter temperatures. So if there are 24

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.990
freeze days or more, this animal can't
survive, it's young can't survive. And

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.100
what's happening is, as our North American
climates are warming, this animal is

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.490
progressively colonizing
further and further north. So what you

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.830
see, not the Xs but every other symbol on
this are instances where armadillos have

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:14.660
advanced beyond their 2013 static range.
Be interesting to know where they are

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.210
after this winter. However, the thing
about this that I want to point out, it's

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.850
not just that animals respond the way you
predict they would based on what we know

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.440
from fossils. But the other thing is, this
particular animal, the armadillo, is the

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.720
only mammal we know about in the world
that carries leprosy. And so this is an

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:39.040
example of these unexpected synergistic
things that can, in fact, impact humans in

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:45.250
ways we don't anticipate. Actually, they
got leprosy from us. Leprosy evolved in

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:52.130
Asia, most likely India. And they
contracted leprosy from us probably

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.780
somewhere around Louisiana. But this
animal can transmit leprosy to humans as

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:04.030
well. So, similarly to what I explained to
you about the mountain beaver and the

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.100
white-footed vole, animals will find their
proper environments. And so it's not just

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.900
that they move further north, they, as
warming conditions prevail and as drying

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.970
conditions prevail, they'll also move up
in elevation. So many of you might have

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.660
hear about the pikas. This is one of the
Asian species. There are, in fact, 28

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:30.750
Asian species of pikas. They're related to
rabbits and heirs. They're just the most

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.160
wonderful thing to work with. They have
this enormously interesting physiology.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.770
They have a resting body temperature of
about 104 degrees, and they live really

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:48.930
high. In the Himalayas, they live above
15,000 feet. Now, the problem with- so

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.900
we've been studying these particular
animals all along the Himalayan front in

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.980
India and Nepal. And it turns out that
only some of these species can tolerate

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.630
the hypoxic conditions
that are characteristic of that high

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.170
elevation. So these particular animals
and, in fact, they've shown to be moving

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:13.510
up much more rapidly than American pikas
of which have moved up around 150 meters.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:19.640
In the Himalayas, they've moved up, at
least, 1,000 meters. And they're pinched,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.080
right, from above, because of those
hypoxic conditions and from below

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.260
from warming and also human
alteration of their environment. Now,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:34.380
another kind of unexpected example, and,
again, to demonstrate just what ecosystems

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.580
mean in terms of how species are
connected. The map you see on the left is

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:45.200
a map of the distribution, on present, the
whitebark pine distribution in North

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:52.420
America. Whitebark pine is high elevation
pine. It's the last conifer until you get

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.720
to tree lines, so it's the thing that you
often see. It's krumholtz in the Rocky

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.580
Mountains. It's a five-needle pine, and it
has these really, really calorically rich

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.920
nuts in the cone. If we just look at
climate models for the distribution of the

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.411
whitebark pine and you can go to 2030,
2060, and 2090. You can see by 2090,

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:19.941
there's barely any whitebark pine left in
the lower 48. Now that projection was made

00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:24.551
before we saw what happened with the
mountain pine beetle. For those of you

00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:27.770
that have traveled anywhere in the Rocky
Mountains, you know that in the last

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:33.760
decade, conifer forests, all the way up to
tree line, have been desonated. In the

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.600
Yellow Stone region, in some of these
areas, whitebark pine are down 80%. This

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.810
is a photo from one of the high elevation
areas that I work in, in Yellow Stone. And

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:50.860
you can see a lot of standing dead trees.
Because the beetle is allowed to survive

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:56.330
over the winter. It's not killed off, it's
a native beetle. The climate is definitely

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.940
implicated in the expansion of this
beetle. It now goes all the way up to tree

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.370
line. It's not killed off. And it probably

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:08.490
reproduces several times per year instead
of having to recolonize every year. Well,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.320
why is that? Why do I have a picture of a
grizzly bear? It turns out that the number

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.930
of whitebark pine cones in a tree is
directly correlated with over winter

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:24.860
survival of adult bears and their cubs.
And it's indirectly correlated with

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:30.300
problem bears the following summer. So
when there's not a lot, in some cases they

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:36.720
may it 40 to 50% of their fat as a result
of eating these middens of cones. They're

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.870
mostly, again, another player in this are
the Clark nutcrackers and the red

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.710
squirrels here. But these grizzly bears
need this to pack on the fat. And what

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.170
happens is they come out of hibernation
earlier, and they start getting into

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:54.960
trouble, looking for food in human
dwellings. So, again, an unanticipated and

00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:01.760
kind of surprising but very major impact
from climate change. The other thing that

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.180
happens and these are data, I'm not
showing you the actual data. But during

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.360
the Pleistocene, Holocene transition,
there were lots of different small mammals

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.260
in the Samwell Cave site in northern
California I talked about. But the animal

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:21.170
that just took over that site is the deer
mouse, peromyscus maniculatus. And, in

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:27.130
fact, this animal has dominated the entire
Holocene assemblage. So the community

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:33.750
structure of small mammals changed. And
this is not due to human hunting, this is

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.390
due to the fact there are many more
disturbed environments in the Holocene.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:44.210
This animal has very high intrinsic rates
of growth. They don't care what the

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.680
environment it. They don't mind if it's
just been burned. They don't mind if it's

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.980
the edge of a field or if it's an
old-growth forest. They like disturbance.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.920
This animal is the most commonly trapped
small mammal in North America. So if you

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.870
lay a trap anywhere
outside of human habitation, you're likely

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:06.570
to catch this guy. It also tends to carry
a lot of diseases. So this is a witty

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:12.400
species and it thrives with human
environments. And the specialist species

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.420
are the ones that take a nose dive. Now
I'm sure there are some of you that are

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.070
gardeners here, and they don't consider
the pocket gophers as a particularly

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:25.210
favorable friend in their garden. But, in
fact, these guys took a hit at the end of

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:31.100
the Pleistocene. This is a pocket gopher,
it has fur lined cheek pouches, and it

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:38.090
stores its seeds and digs. And, in fact,
this is a specialist species. It is so

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:43.460
energetically expensive to live under
ground. It takes between 360 and 3,400

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.770
times the energy to do this than to move
the same distance above ground. This is,

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.710
by any accounts, a very specialist
species. So they decline. Humans are

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:59.020
directly causing the extinction of
animals. We are threatened to lose almost

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.930
a quarter of our species. I just read an
article that said about a third of our

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.210
bird species in Europe are threatened.
Most of these are from hunting. We're

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:12.320
about ready to see the loss of elephants
in the next decade or two. One out of

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.160
every twelve elephants was killed in just
the last three years. This is a crisis.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.570
Fifty-one percent of humans of the
terrestrial land, has been co-opted for

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:28.010
human use. The only place that's left on
this map, that aren't show in purple, are

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:34.930
deserts and tropical forests. Those are
the least easily farmed land on the

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.510
planet, but they're also, in some ways,
especially the tropical forest, some of

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:44.140
the most important. Everywhere else, we
have made a mark. We have an extinction

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.811
debt, and we will lose a lot of
biodiversity in the near future.

00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:52.211
I get asked a lot, "Can speciation
rescue biodiversity?"

00:19:52.211 --> 00:19:56.471
Absolutely not. Species take between two
and five million years,

00:19:56.471 --> 00:19:58.540
this is mammal
species, to evolve.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.740
So, we can cause them to disappear in a

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.050
decade or two, but it takes millions of
years to accumulate the diversity we might

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:11.660
have lost. So how do we avoid this
planetary tipping point? We increased

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:17.470
energy conversion, obviously. We stole
habitat loss. We increase global

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:22.630
cooperation. This has got to be done
globally. And we stabilize population

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:27.470
growth. And, finally, how do you stabilize
population growth? I get asked what is the

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:33.090
most- in my opinion, the single most
important thing for us to do is to educate

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:39.810
women globally. And the reason is because
as education goes up, fertility rate goes

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:45.970
down. The more girls that are in school,
secondary school, the number of years is

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:52.120
really important, the more fertility rates
go down. And interestingly, GDP and

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:59.870
poverty rates also go up. Human innovation
is remarkable. We can see the origin of

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.100
the universe. I can't believe we can see
the origin of the universe. And we can see

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.871
ourselves in our beautiful planet from
space. Why can't we

00:21:06.871 --> 00:21:09.811
avoid the next tipping point? Thank you.
