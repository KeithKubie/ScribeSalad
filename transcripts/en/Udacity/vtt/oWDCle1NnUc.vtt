00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
How can you deal with an NP complete problem if you can't avoid it

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.570
and a simple algorithm doesn't work.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.880
Well, unless P=NP, you know there's not going to be a polynomial time algorithm for your problem.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.180
Now, that statement actually allows for some loopholes, which we'll investigate

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.380
in this unit and the following units.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.280
The first loophole is to try and find intelligent algorithms that allow you to search

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.300
through an exponential number of solutions still on exponential time, but so efficiently

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.470
that sometimes you actually get a perfect solution.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.330
The second case we'll be looking at is if you accept that your solution is not going to be

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.020
the best possible one but maybe within a certain range of the best possible one

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.770
if you can then find faster algorithms to solve your problem.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.640
For each of these approaches, we'll be discussing the main ideas.

00:00:48.640 --> 99:59:59.000
I'll give you some examples and of course, we'll also be discussing a bit of the theory behind them.
