00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:05.507
 Which pieces read 361 + 544? 

00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:09.149
 Let's face it, each of them begins with 361, 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.660
 then we add 544 on it. 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.804
 In this description, plus 400 plus 50 plus 4, 

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:20.181
 which means 544 instead of 454, 

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:25.186
 In this example, plus 500 plus 40 plus 4, 

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:28.852
 which is 544 plus 361, 

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:33.132
 resulting in 905. 

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:36.470
 This is logical, we add 500, we get 861. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.639
 then 40 plus is equal to 901, 4 more 

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.586
 so we get 905 that we choose this answer. 

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.442
 and another example shows 50 instead of 500, 

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:46.545
 this is not true. 

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:50.864
 because we are 5 hundred, 4 or 40, later 

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:54.919
 Adding 4 solitude, let's look at other examples. 

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.605
 The following numbers are for axes 

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.340
 Which phrase is appropriate? 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.844
 Let's see, 718 plus 200 

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:05.642
 then the plus 40 is equal to 958 

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:10.420
 This, in fact, means 718 + 240. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 so we choose this answer. 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.775
 It looks kind of fun. 

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:21.590
 The reading of the numbers explains the calculation of 585 - 368. 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.344
 Let's see these two pieces of arrows 

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:28.454
 Both begin with 585, and our calculation is related to this number. 

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.378
 It starts with 558, where the figures have changed. 

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.482
 This is not true. 

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:34.316
 But we are looking at these two options. 

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:38.379
 We want to go out to 3, 6, and 8 alone. 

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.600
 In both of these, we go up to three hundred, 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.662
 then we want to go out to six. 

00:01:45.662 --> 00:01:48.932
 When we get six decimal places and eight alone, we get this answer. 

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:52.612
 In this example instead of 6 decimal and 8 loneliness 

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.201
 8 decimal places and 6 singles, 

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:58.660
 Since there are 386 deductible here 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.155
 We choose the third answer. 

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:04.590
 Here's another example. 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.637
 The following numbers are for axes 

00:02:05.637 --> 00:02:07.135
 what the answer is correct. 

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:11.116
 Started at 935, then 400, 

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:13.890
 then we turn 20. 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.817
 This means 935 - 420. 

00:02:16.817 --> 00:02:21.318
 935 - 420. 

00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:24.800
 This answer is correct.
