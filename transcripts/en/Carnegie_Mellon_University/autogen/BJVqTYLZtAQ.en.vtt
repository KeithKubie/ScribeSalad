they're interested in that relates back
to architecture I think that's what we

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
to architecture I think that's what we
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.340
to architecture I think that's what we
really want to have happen here not only

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350
really want to have happen here not only

did this help me like decide whether or
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.910
did this help me like decide whether or
not I want to do architecture a lot of

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920
not I want to do architecture a lot of
