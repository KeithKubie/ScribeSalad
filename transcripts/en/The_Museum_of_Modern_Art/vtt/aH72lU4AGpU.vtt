00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.421
Woah...
Thunderdome.

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.136
It’s been a pretty intense
six weeks since we started this.

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:14.973
We were nervous but,
we’re okay now.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.728
Yeah, we went to a bar
next to here

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:20.730
to have a beer,
and now we are super chill.

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:21.856
Just one beer – don’t worry.

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:25.568
Also the storm made everything
that much more intense.

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:30.656
What we’re going to do is regress
according to our schedule,

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:35.203
for thirty minutes per team
to present and ask questions

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.246
from our jurors.

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.043
It’s really intimidating.
The camera is more intimidating

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.461
than the jurors.

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:46.171
Well, you’re going to get
both of us at the same time.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:48.758
Hi, I’m Frida.
Nice to meet you.

00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:50.260
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:51.635
This is 2 meters.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.763
And this is, again, something
that we can play with.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.723
-2 meters deep?
-Yeah.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.891
That’s quite the slide.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.228
So it’s almost as tall as a wall.

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:03.230
I am interested in this tension
between art and architecture.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.316
And this obviously pushes that
very hard.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.486
There is something really
universal about this shape

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:10.821
and the slope,

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.741
and it can relate to these other
very universal images –

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:15.535
a staircase, for example,

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:17.870
you know the plaza,
with the staircase?

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.163
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.623
-Thank you so much.

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:24.210
Over the years, we’re witnessing
changes in ideas

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.170
about what makes architecture.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.840
And this year is,
without a doubt,

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.343
one of the most diverse
in terms of responses.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:38.015
I don’t think we’re looking
to program exact activities,

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.016
but we’re trying
to leave it open

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.936
for different kinds of behaviors
to take place.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.025
I’m struck by the association of
two seemingly antithetical ideas –

00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.778
one is the artist’s residence,
which is about being alone,

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:53.865
and the other is Warm-Up,
which is about being together.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.533
-Those were good questions.
-Yeah.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.993
They were really,
really good questions.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:08.211
Are there new materials at all,
that you looked at?

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:11.173
Whether they’re synthetics

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.341
or something else
super lightweight...

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.511
We considered trying to do
something as fabric,

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.056
or the kind of metal netting
that you see.

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.183
Does the budget include
the de-install also?

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.351
Yeah.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.490
So we thought,
let’s establish a system.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.783
Let’s work with the walls,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.578
with their existence,
to generate new atmospheres

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.790
on each face of the courtyard.

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:47.293
How are you going to get the rope
through that thickness and pull it out?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.380
We plan to use an 8mm rope.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.466
And the mist is coming
from the water?

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.718
-Here’s the mist.
-Ah!

00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:58.930
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:01.473
We started
with a mutual interest

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.101
in looking at some
Druid-style monuments.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.270
These are dolmens,

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.940
and it really looks like something
has landed into this courtyard.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.403
Why is a dolmen
an appropriate element

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.323
for 2016 in New York City?

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:25.665
Thank you.
