00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.150
PHIL MORIARTY: We're talking
about something called tau,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.650
which is equal to 2 pi.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.930
So there's been a huge amount of
debate and discussion about

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.750
this right across
the internet.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.960
There's even a Tau Manifesto.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.460
So one of the real advocates
of tau versus pi is ViHart,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.740
and I really recommend you
go and visit her videos.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.900
Brady might put the link in
somewhere-- maybe down here or

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.180
up there or over there--
somewhere.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.510
For some people, it's
not an issue.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.910
And initially, my response
was what are people

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.690
arguing about this?

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.700
This is total nonsense, because
if you want to use

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.930
tau, then you just go tau--

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.120
I'll repeat it-- tau is equal
to 2 pi, and then proceed.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.720
It's more than that though,
because, with maths and with

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.750
physics, what you want to strive
for all the time is

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.350
clarity, particularly when
you're teaching this stuff.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.030
It's far too easy, if you've
been teaching this for 15

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.000
years like I have, not to be
able to put yourself in the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.400
mindset who's doing this
right from the start.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.650
And so if you're got
schoolchildren who are coming

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.950
to trigonometry, who are coming
to angles, who are

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.569
coming to pi and circles and
circumferences and radius for

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.310
the first time, you do not
want to confuse them.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.810
You want to minimize
the confusion.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.140
And moreover, in maths and in
physics, a really important

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.440
property is symmetry.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.120
And you want to try and have
the most elegant, concise

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.300
description of something.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.850
Here's my very wonky circle.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.600
And let's put our
center there.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.370
And that's our radius r.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.010
And from there to there,
you all know, I hope--

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.650
let's do it in a different
color--

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.535
is d.

00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:34.530
And we define pi, very simply,
as the ratio of the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.900
circumference to the diameter.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.850
And this holds true
for any circle,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.260
regardless of its size.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.940
Pi crops up in very many
different ways.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.510
And the first thing we've got
to think about is how we

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.680
define angle.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.220
So let's draw another
circle on this very

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.565
crumply brown paper.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:54.300
If we start here at this point
and we move around and come

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.160
back to the same point, that's
how many degrees, Brady?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.016
BRADY HARAN: 360.

00:01:59.016 --> 00:02:00.350
PHIL MORIARTY: 360 degrees.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.660
So there's a much more natural
way of defining an angle.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.530
Let's take a circle again.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.350
Here's our radius.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.870
We're going to call
that r again.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.290
And let's say that, instead of
walking all the way around, we

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.060
instead walk a distance
r along here.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
So that's r as well.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.885
And we call angles,
conventionally, in physics--

00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:26.510
you can call it whatever you
like, but conventionally, we

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.650
denote it by theta.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.490
That angle, when this arc length
is equal to the radius,

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.130
is equal to 1 radian.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.380
OK.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.280
So that's a much more natural
definition, because here,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.150
we're basing it on
just fundamental

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.160
properties of the circle.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.260
Instead of going, well, that's
360 degrees, we're saying that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.500
when we go around a certain arc
length which is equal to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.410
the radius, that's a radian.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.130
Now, the question is, how many
radians do we get if we go all

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.720
the way around the circle?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.100
How many radians does
that turn out to be?

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.140
Well, it turns out to
be 2 pi radians.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.470
And the reason is--

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.570
because you remember that
the circumference

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.775
length is 2 pi r.

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:07.610
All right?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.850
So 2 pi radians.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.660
Here's where the debate
kicks in.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.280
Some, particularly
Bob Palais--

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.690
I hope I've pronounced
that right.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.960
It all stems from
this wonderful

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.930
paper, "Pi is Wrong"--

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.940
Bob Palais.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.900
What he argued--

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.880
well, isn't this rather
confusing?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.750
So you go around one turn, and
instead of being pi radians,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.440
it's 2 pi radians.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.800
I have a daughter who's
nine and another

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.580
daughter who's six.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.790
And my daughter who's nine is
starting to look at shapes and

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.000
starting to look at angles,
doing basic geometry.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.090
And I can see how this is going
to be a big problem.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.290
I'm looking around
for the paper.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.590
And what we're going to do now
is we're going to look at a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.570
number of different angles.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.220
So we define angles
counterclockwise.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.820
So we go that way rather
than that way.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.280
Quite why we do that,
I have no idea.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.260
It's convention.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.090
Here's where it gets
interesting.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.990
0 radians--

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.420
exactly the same.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.380
We go around a quarter
of the circle.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.980
That angle is not pi over 4.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.670
It's pi over 2.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.100
That's already confusing.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.930
We go around the circle
a bit more.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.320
Instead at of being pi over 2,
because we've gone half way

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.950
around, it's pi.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.040
And here, it's 1 and 1/2 pi--

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.430
3 pi over 2--

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.230
and here, it's 2 pi.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.175
A natural unit is one turn.

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:22.580
A natural unit is you
go around once.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.420
And yet, when you go around
once, that's 2 pi.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.940
Now, I think that's confusing,
not just at a basic elementary

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.170
level, but that use of 2 pi
instead of pi or instead of

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.750
something which represents one
turn, which represents one

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.560
revolution--

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.550
well, let's just
redefine that.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.710
Let's say that tau
is equal to 2 pi.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.900
One turn is equal to 2 pi.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.590
And let's just put the
pi thing to one side.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.220
So that's one turn.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.560
So we start off with 0.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.510
How far have we gone?

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.830
Well, we've gone a quarter
way around.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.510
We've done a quarter
of a revolution.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.140
That's tau over 4--

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.490
much more natural.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.630
This is tau over 2.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.900
Because we've gone halfway
around, it's natural.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.474
What's this one, Brady?

00:05:05.474 --> 00:05:08.840
BRADY HARAN: That's going
to be 3/4 of tau.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.750
PHIL MORIARTY: Exactly.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.245
And this one's going to be tau,
and then 2 tau and 3 tau

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:15.010
and 4 tau and 5 tau.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.040
And that's much more natural.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.810
And of course, any professional
physicist or

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.780
mathematician or scientist is
going to go, well, it's

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.150
straightforward.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.910
If I want to use that, I just
write that and I continue my

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.220
equation, my analysis.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.700
I continue my derivation
using tau.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.080
But that's not the point.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.050
It's not about the professional
physicists.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.540
It's about teaching
this stuff.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.500
2 pi appears throughout physics,
all the way from the

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.520
very large scale, all
the way right

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.510
down to quantum mechanics.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.010
And I'll get on to quantum
mechanics in a sec.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.740
Let me show you a simple
demo, first of all.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.110
Mass on a spring--

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.350
we let that bob up and down, it
performs something which is

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.920
the bane of so many first year
undergraduates' lives in

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.645
physics, which is called
simple harmonic motion.

00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:01.750
It goes up and down.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.930
What describes that?

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.450
Oh, we call it circular
motion.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.640
And what describes that
is a sine wave.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.110
And the period of that motion,
again, is 2 pi.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.570
In terms of how atoms vibrate,
atoms vibrate

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.970
all the time in molecules.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.700
We describe that in terms
of an angular frequency.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.220
We describe in terms of a
frequency, but often, we use

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.170
something called omega, which is
an angular frequency, which

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.070
is 2 pi times f.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.710
And this is where it gets
really, really interesting,

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.130
because even as physicists, we
even extract out that factor

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.480
of 2 pi, because we
have something

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.760
called Planck's constant.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.240
It's a fundamental constant
that crops up throughout

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.370
quantum mechanics.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.500
And we actually redefine it.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.090
And we have got something
called h-bar.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.352
And h-bar is equal
to h over 2 pi.

00:06:49.352 --> 00:06:53.620
And one of the reasons this 2
pi factor crops up time and

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.600
time again throughout physics
is that when we get down to

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.060
the quantum level, matter
behaves like a wave.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.730
It's got oscillatory motion
associated with it.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.850
It moves back and forth
with a period.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.480
We can describe that in terms
of waves, which have

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.590
a period of 2 pi.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.700
It crops up absolutely
everywhere.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.950
Here's my favorite equation.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.290
That is called Fourier
transform.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.140
And as you'll see, you've
got 2 pi here.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.710
But, not only do you
have 2 pi there--

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.510
that's an omega, which is 2 pi
f-- you've got a 2 pi factor

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.420
and there's another
omega up here.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.660
What that does--

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.220
BRADY HARAN: That's got
2 pis everywhere.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.080
PHIL MORIARTY: That's got 2
pis absolutely everywhere.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.940
Now, what we could do--

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.865
and you can just replace this
instead of having 1 over root

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:44.150
2 pi, have 1 over tau here,
have 1 over root tau.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.020
That's not the point.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.750
I really don't think
that's the point.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.610
If you go to the various
websites--

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.270
where are they?

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.830
The tau manifesto and
the pi manifesto--

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.730
and they have this game
where they bat each

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.930
other back and forth.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.055
Look, this equation's more
simple if you put tau and this

00:07:59.055 --> 00:08:00.450
equation's more simple
if you put pi in.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.430
That's not the point.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.160
It's about the fundamental
teaching of this.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.530
For professionals physicists,
we're not

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.510
going to change this.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.540
I really do not think we are
going to change this.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.310
If you open up any textbook,
there's a 2 pi.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.130
2 pi there, actually.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.090
There's one already
earlier on.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.850
So open a book up at random.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.020
You're very, very likely in a
first-year physics textbook or

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.320
in any physics textbook
to come across a 2 pi.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.980
We are not going to change
these textbooks.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.400
That's not the point.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.770
The point is when you're
teaching this stuff, tau is a

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.030
better representation,
is a better concept.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.940
The idea that you do one turn
and that's tau, as opposed to

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.260
2 pi radians.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.330
That's just a much better
way of explaining it.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.696
BRADY HARAN: If no one's going
to change, why are we even

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:43.350
talking about it?

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.410
Are just we just saying this is
what we should have done?

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.850
PHIL MORIARTY: Yes, it is what
we should have done.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.120
Euler, I think, possibly had an
opportunity to change this

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.240
hundreds of years ago.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.940
We should have done it.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.030
We haven't done it.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.180
Perhaps we could, from this
point onwards, think about

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.310
writing textbooks and at
least mention tau.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.360
I think what we need
to do is you can--

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.450
perhaps in a textbook like this,
throughout it's going to

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.280
talk about 2 pi.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.380
But we could say right at the
start that there is this

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.580
concept of tau--

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.310
many students find
it very helpful--

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.350
and introduce it.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.170
And perhaps, then, there
will be a gradual

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.250
evolution towards tau.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:18.880
I doubt it.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.690
I really doubt it, but it might
be nice to think so.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.435
-You've got to keep in your
mind when you're doing

00:09:24.435 --> 00:09:25.080
calculations--

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.645
and actually, if you're a
seasoned mathematician--

00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:29.550
PHIL MORIARTY: --the sampling
and the effects and frequency

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.240
shifting to get it into
the right pitch.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.150
But I'll play you Vi's vocals
again, because they are really

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.360
quite neat, if I can
find the channel.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.535
-And also, that 1/2's here,
because the half tells you

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:39.610
something.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.110
-This works out just as nicely.
