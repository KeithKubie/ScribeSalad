00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.690
To say that someone has ‘daddy issues’
is a somewhat rude and humiliating way of

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.340
alluding to a very understandable longing:
for a father who is strong and wise, who is

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.319
judicious, kind, perhaps at points tough,
but always fair – and ultimately, always

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:24.409
on our side. It would be so understandable
if we were to feel we wanted someone like

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:30.789
this in our lives, especially at moments of
confusion and chaos. The longing for a strong

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.769
father has been a recurring theme in history.
Most religions have conceived of their central

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:43.390
divinities as male parents. In ancient Greece,
Zeus was described as the ‘father of men

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.370
and Gods’; in Christianity, God was the
heavenly father; in Germanic mythology, Odin

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.839
was the Allfather, the father of all other
gods. The longing has been no less present

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.059
in secular culture. In the US, the individuals
who led the war of independence and drew up

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.540
the constitution came to be known as the Founding
Fathers; Garibaldi, the dignified and authoritative

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.549
man who fought for the unification of Italy
in the 19th century, earned himself the title

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.270
of the ‘father of the fatherland’. In
early childhood, we are all immensely weak

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.219
and in need of protection. We can’t understand
the world, we are so fragile, we could be

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:29.680
killed by a moderately sized dog; so much
feels mysterious and outside of our control.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.990
A hunger for a ‘daddy’ is – in the circumstances
– wholly natural. A grown man inevitably

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.410
and rightly seems immensely impressive to
a small child. They appear to know everything:

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.020
the capital of New Zealand, how to drive a
car, how to say a few words in a foreign language,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.479
how to peel an avocado. They go to bed mysteriously
late. They’re up before you. In the swimming

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.620
pool, you can put your arms around their neck
and rest on their back; they once kicked a

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.850
football so high, you nearly couldn’t see
it; they take you on their shoulders and help

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.210
you touch the ceiling. It’s beyond astonishing
– when one is four.. The paradox of daddy

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.660
issues is that those who have them are – almost
always – people who didn’t have very good

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.940
fathers when they were small. Perhaps one’s
father was strong but ultimately cruel, bullying

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.831
or disinterested. Perhaps he was more interested
in another sibling or in his work. Perhaps

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:26.480
he wasn’t around much, left the house after
a divorce or died young. The adult longing

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.470
for a father is not the result of having had
a good father in childhood: it’s a consequence

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.271
of abandonment. The longing can incline to
us some tricky patterns of behaviour. However

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:44.290
mature and sceptical we may be in most areas,
in relation to the idea of male protection,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.370
we remain a little like the young child we
once were and haven’t been allowed to mature

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.600
away from. We secretly yearn for a man to
step in and fulfill an unquenched fantasy

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.160
role. They’ll take charge; they’ll make
the big decisions, they’ll be tough and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.840
certain and make our problems go away. They’ll
make sure the money side of things is sorted,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.260
they’ll get angry and aggressive with anyone
who hurts us; they will be proud of us and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.470
love us as we are. We’ll be looking out
for daddies in friendships, at work and, not

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.680
least, in politics. The danger is that these
‘daddies’ may in the end hugely damage

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.240
our trust, for it isn’t in anyone’s power
to assuage the sort of longings we bring to

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.660
bear on them. They may know very well what
we want, and naively or cynically promise

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.400
to provide it for us, but gradually – too
late – we stand to realise that they had

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.120
a thousand flaws, as we all do. We may realise
that they are bullying rather than noble;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.930
that our enemies haven’t gone away; that
they couldn’t help us; that there isn’t

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.950
in fact enough money in the world to do what
they promised; and that – in fact – they

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.930
didn’t really love us at all. The fantasy
‘Daddy’ figure of adulthood isn’t in

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.300
fact a good father for one big reason: truly
good humans know they aren’t that powerful

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.730
and are happy to admit to the fact cleanly
and honestly, just as soon as we are ready

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.790
to take the news, which is normally when we
are around twelve years old and conscious

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.780
of new powers and capacities. A good father
doesn’t – beyond that age – pretend

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.699
to be all powerful, they confess they can’t
solve all our problems and can’t magically

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.050
save us from a myriad of dangers, no matter
how much they wish they could. The good daddy

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.610
disappoints us just as soon as we are strong
enough to bear reality. Out of love they deflate

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.449
the idea that there could ever be a perfect,
ideal daddy. They try as best they can to

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.330
help us grow up. If we encounter someone who
has daddy issues, the temptation is to get

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.340
frustrated, tell them to mature, mock them
and – in particular – poke fun at the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.449
particular daddy figure they might have identified.
This isn’t either a very wise or ultimately

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.169
a very kind strategy. It simply tends to entrench
their devotion – because, whenever we are

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.099
attacked, we of course feel ever more intensely
than ever the need for the protection of an

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:15.740
idealised father. What we really need to help
us out of our daddy issues is something more

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.819
like the actions of a genuinely good father:
someone who truly acknowledges our suffering

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.000
and our fears, who deeply wants what is best
for us and isn’t reluctant to say so; but

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.310
who, at the same time – out of love – wants
to help us come to terms with a messy and

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.409
essentially disappointing world; a man who
– out of love – will encourage us to be

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.819
independent and, specifically, not to fantasise
that anyone, however outwardly imposing, can

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:48.800
ever do the impossible. Good daddies allow
us to bear the truth that there are, in the

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.760
end, no ‘daddies’. .
