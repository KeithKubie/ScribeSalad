&gt;&gt; My name is Orly Halpern. I'm a journalist
based in Jerusalem and I'm now at the World

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.860
Economic Forum on the Middle East in Jordan
and I've been asked if I think role models

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.050
are important and my answer is an absolute
yes. I think we all agree on that. What I

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:33.880
see is the question is not who are the role
models and I as an Isreali, Jewish, and American

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.160
citizen living in Israel feel that we lack
role models for peace. A lot of people that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.550
talk peace, they say they want peace, but
the things that they are supporting are not

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.060
really going to bring about that peace and
that's a problem. So then you have people

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.720
that follow them that think well my leaders
want peace, they say they want peace, I want

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.320
peace so if they think it's okay to build
more settlements, that will bring peace, they're

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.440
going to follow those people but we're not
going to get peace. And I'm concerned that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.280
we don't have role models that will truly
bring peace to the region and end the Palestinian/Israeli

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.600
conflict in a peaceful way.
