00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.960
SAL: In the last video we saw
all sorts of different types

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.630
of isotopes of atoms
experiencing radioactive decay

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.060
and turning into other atoms or
releasing different types

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.630
of particles.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.530
But the question is, when
does an atom or

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.360
nucleus decide to decay?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.820
Let's say I have a bunch of,
let's say these are all atoms.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.780
I have a bunch of atoms here.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.970
And let's say we're talking
about the type of decay where

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.550
an atom turns into
another atom.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.500
So your proton number
is going to change.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.990
Your atomic number is
going to change.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.490
So it could either be beta
decay, which would release

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.970
electrons from the neutrons and
turn them into protons.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.520
Or maybe positron emission
turning protons into neutrons.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.890
But that's not what's
relevant here.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.070
Let's say we have a collection
of atoms. And normally when we

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.650
have any small amount of any
element, we really have huge

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.690
amounts of atoms of
that element.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.540
And we've talked about moles
and, you know, one gram of

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:05.370
carbon-12-- I'm sorry, 12
grams-- 12 grams of carbon-12

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.870
has one mole of carbon-12
in it.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.440
One mole of carbon-12.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.310
And what is one mole
of carbon-12?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.170
That's 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd
carbon-12 atoms. This is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.680
a ginormous number.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.820
This is more than we can, than
my head can really grasp

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.110
around how large of
a number this is.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.290
And this is only when we have
12 grams. 12 grams is not a

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.560
large mass.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.440
For example, one kilogram
is about two pounds.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.525
So this is about, what?

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:38.750
I want to say [? 1/50 ?]

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.650
of a pound if I'm
doing [? it. ?]

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.500
But this is not a lot
of mass right here.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.810
And pounds is obviously force.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.570
You get the idea.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.240
On Earth, well anywhere,
mass is invariant.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.920
This is not a tremendous
amount.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.140
So with that said, let's go back
to the question of how do

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.730
we know if one of these
guys are going to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.870
decay in some way.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.710
And maybe not carbon-12, maybe
we're talking about carbon-14

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.240
or something.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300
How do we know that they're
going to decay?

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.440
And the answer is, you don't.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.590
They all have some probability
of the decaying.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.389
At any given moment, for a
certain type of element or a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.360
certain type of isotope of
an element, there's some

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.840
probability that one
of them will decay.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.790
That, you know, maybe this guy
will decay this second.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.750
And then nothing happens for a
long time, a long time, and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.600
all of a sudden two
more guys decay.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.530
And so, like everything in
chemistry, and a lot of what

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.310
we're starting to deal with in
physics and quantum mechanics,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.920
everything is probabilistic.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.570
I mean, maybe if we really
got in detail on the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.900
configurations of the nucleus,
maybe we could get a little

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.990
bit better in terms of our
probabilities, but we don't

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.040
know what's going on inside of
the nucleus, so all we can do

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.630
is ascribe some probabilities
to something reacting.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.040
Now you could say, OK, what's
the probability of any given

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.430
molecule reacting
in one second?

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.520
Or you could define
it that way.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.320
But we're used to dealing with
things on the macro level, on

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.950
dealing with, you know, huge
amounts of atoms. So what we

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.220
do is we come up with terms
that help us get our head

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.200
around this.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.680
And one of those terms is
the term half-life.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.480
And let me erase this
stuff down here.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.780
So I have a description, and
we're going to hopefully get

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.325
an intuition of what
half-life means.

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:20.730
So I wrote a decay reaction
right here,

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.780
where you have carbon-14.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.180
It decays into nitrogen-14.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.740
And we could just do a
little bit of review.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.100
You go from six protons
to seven protons.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.430
Your mass changes the same.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.870
So one of the neutrons must have
turned into a proton and

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.130
that is what happened.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.590
And it does that by releasing
an electron, which is also

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.630
call a beta particle.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.130
We could have written this
as minus 1 charge.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.710
Relatively zero mass.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.455
It does have some mass,
but they write zero.

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:48.820
This is kind of notation.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.130
So this is beta decay.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.480
Beta decay, this is
just a review.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.070
But the way we think about
half-life is, people have

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.260
studied carbon and they said,
look, if I start off with 10

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.450
grams-- if I have just a block
of carbon that's 10 grams. If

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.840
I wait carbon-14's half-life--
this is a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.300
specific isotope of carbon.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.890
Remember, isotopes, if there's
carbon, can come in 12, with

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.970
an atomic mass number of 12, or
with 14, or I mean, there's

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.790
different isotopes of
different elements.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.860
And the atomic number
defines the carbon,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.040
because it has six protons.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.440
Carbon-12 has six protons.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.090
Carbon-14 has six protons.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.490
But they have a different
number of neutrons.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.440
So when you have the same
element with varying number of

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.110
neutrons, that's an isotope.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.080
So the carbon-14 version, or
this isotope of carbon, let's

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.940
say we start with 10 grams. If
they say that it's half-life

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.930
is 5,740 years, that means that
if on day one we start

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.090
off with 10 grams of pure
carbon-14, after 5,740 years,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.200
half of this will
have turned into

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.980
nitrogen-14, by beta decay.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.270
And you might say, oh OK, so
maybe-- let's see, let me make

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.230
nitrogen magenta, right there--
so you might say, OK,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.660
maybe that half turns
into nitrogen.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.520
And I've actually seen this
drawn this way in some

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.200
chemistry classes or physics
classes, and my immediate

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.470
question is how does this
half know that it

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.690
must turn into nitrogen?

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.860
And how does this half know that
it must stay as carbon?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.550
And the answer is
they don't know.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.480
And it really shouldn't
be drawn this way.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.760
So let me redraw it.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.010
So this is our original block
of our carbon-14.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.230
What happens over that
5,740 years is that,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.000
probabilistically, some of these
guys just start turning

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.550
into nitrogen randomly,
at random points.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.340
And over 5,740 years, you
determine that there's a 50%

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.000
chance that any one of these
carbon atoms will turn into a

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.950
nitrogen atom.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.600
So that after 5,740 years, the
half-life of carbon, a 50%

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.470
chance that any of the
guys that are carbon

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.450
will turn to nitrogen.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.890
So if you go back after a
half-life, half of the atoms

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.120
will now be nitrogen.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.350
So now you have, after
one half-life-- So

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.420
let's ignore this.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.550
So we started with this.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.200
All 10 grams were carbon.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.410
10 grams of c-14.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.110
This is after one half-life.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.400
And now we have five
grams of c-14.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.140
And we have five grams
of nitrogen-14.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.330
Fair enough.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.210
Let's think about what happens
after another half-life.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.470
Well we said that during a
half-life, 5,740 years in the

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.280
case of carbon-14-- all
different elements have a

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.040
different half-life, if they're
radioactive-- over

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.180
5,740 years there's a 50%-- and
if I just look at any one

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.810
atom-- there's a 50%
chance it'll decay.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.380
So if we go to another
half-life, if we go another

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.330
half-life from there, I had
five grams of carbon-14.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.591
So let me actually copy
and paste this one.

00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:25.350
This is what I started with.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.115
Now after another half-life--
you can ignore all my little,

00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:33.390
actually let me erase some
of this up here.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.260
Let me clean it up
a little bit.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.380
After one one half-life,
what happens?

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.900
Well I now am left with five
grams of carbon-14.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.230
Those five grams of carbon-14,
every one of those atoms still

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:54.150
has, over the next-- whatever
that number was, 5,740 years--

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.300
after 5,740 years,
all of those once

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.740
again have a 50% chance.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.650
And by the law of large numbers,
half of them will

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.840
have converted into
nitrogen-14.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.530
So we'll have even more
conversion into nitrogen-14.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.240
So now half of that five grams.
So now we're only left

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.250
with 2.5 grams of c-14.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.690
And how much nitrogen-14?

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.320
Well we have another two and
a half went to nitrogen.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.190
So now we have seven and a half
grams of nitrogen-14.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:32.730
And we could keep going further
into the future, and

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.539
after every half-life, 5,740
years, we will have half of

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.620
the carbon that we started.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.710
But we'll always have an

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.630
infinitesimal amount of carbon.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.700
But let me ask you a question.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.600
Let's say I'm just staring
at one carbon atom.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.610
Let's say I just have this
one carbon atom.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.080
You know, I've got its nucleus,
with its c-14.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.780
So it's got its six protons.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.910
It's got its eight neutrons.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.756
It's got its six electrons.

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:04.870
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, whatever.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.800
What's going to happen?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.130
What's going to happen
after one second?

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.180
Well, I don't know.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.320
It'll probably still be carbon,
but there's some

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.580
probability that after one
second it will have already

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.000
turned into nitrogen-14.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.710
What's going to happen after
one billion years?

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.960
Well, after one billion years
I'll say, well you know, it'll

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.660
probably have turned into
nitrogen-14 at that point, but

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.620
I'm not sure.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.690
This might be the one
ultra-stable nucleus that just

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.740
happened to, kind of,
go against the

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.960
odds and stay carbon-14.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.390
So after one half-life, if
you're just looking at one

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:52.280
atom after 5,740 years, you
don't know whether this turned

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.120
into a nitrogen or not.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.690
This exact atom, you just know
that it had a 50% chance of

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.950
turning into a nitrogen.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.130
Now, if you look at it over a
huge number of atoms. I mean,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.340
if you start approaching, you
know, Avogadro's number or

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.350
anything larger--
I erased that.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.460
Then all of a sudden you can use
the law of large numbers

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.850
and say, OK, on average, if each
of those atoms must have

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.220
had a 50% chance, and if I have
gazillions of them, half

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.530
of them will have turned
into nitrogen.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.520
I don't know which half,
but half of them

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.890
will turn into it.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.770
So you might get a question
like, I start with, oh I don't

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:32.860
know, let's say I start with
80 grams of something with,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.580
let's just call it x, and it has
a half-life of two years.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.020
I'm just making up
this compound.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.720
A two-year half-life.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.200
And then let's say we go into
a time machine and we look

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.670
back at our sample, and let's
say we only have 10 grams of

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.760
our sample left.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.000
And we want to know how much
time has passed by.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.360
So 10 grams left of x.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.710
How much time, you know, x is
decaying the whole time, how

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.540
much time has passed?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.380
Well let's think about it.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:12.300
We're starting at time, 0 with
80 grams. After two years, how

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.400
much are we going
to have left?

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.980
We're going to have 40
grams. So t equals 2.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.160
But after two more years, how
many are we going to have?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.540
We're going to have 20 grams.
So this is t equals 3 I'm

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.650
sorry, this is t
equals 4 years.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:31.400
And then after two more years,
I'll only have half of that

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:31.940
left again.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.620
So now I'm only going to
have 10 grams left.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.590
And that's where I am.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.390
And this is t equals 6.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.630
So if you know you have
some compound.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.210
You're starting off with 80
grams. You know it has a

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.030
two-year half-life.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.340
You get in a time machine.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.130
And then you didn't build
your time machine well.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.080
You don't know how well it
calibrates against time.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.900
You just look at your sample.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.470
You say, oh, I only have
10 grams left.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:59.470
You know that 1, 2, 3 half-lives
have gone by.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.000
And you could also think
about it this way.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.760
1/2 to the 3rd power, because
every time you have 1/2 of the

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.100
original sample-- that's the
number of half-lives-- after

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.340
three half-lives you'll have 1/8
of your original sample.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.450
And that's what we have here.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.230
We have 1/8 of 80 grams. And
this is just when you're doing

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.140
it with a discreet you know,
when you're right at the

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.270
half-life point.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.200
In the next video we're going to
explore what if I asked you

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.000
a question, how many of the
particles, or how many grams

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.300
will you have in exactly
10 days?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.420
Or at two and a half years?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.820
And we'll do that in
the next video.
