00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.790
Hello.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.860
I just wanted to make a
quick video to introduce you

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.590
to what is probably or what
is definitely the biggest

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.510
change that we've ever made
in the history of the Khan

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.420
Academy.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.420
We've introduced a
new learning flow

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.110
that tries to
engage people more.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.210
We've heard from a lot
of users that there's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.630
a lot of content
on Khan Academy.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.040
They didn't know where to start.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.730
They didn't know what level
was appropriate for them.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.480
And so we've spent a lot of
time thinking about this,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.404
and what you're about to see
is our new learning flow.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:30.820
So I'm a new user,
and it gives us

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.580
a nice little welcome message.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.720
And I say, cool.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.190
Let's explore.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.950
So when you log in,
you'll see this mission--

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.950
The World of Math.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.610
And right now as we launch
that is the only mission

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.620
that we have.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.140
And it will essentially
walk through all of the math

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.197
exercises that we
have on Khan Academy.

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:49.780
Over the next few
months, you're going

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.490
to see other missions--
missions aligned

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.400
to grade levels,
missions aligned

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.400
to preparing for a test,
missions aligned to being

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.860
able to do some
type of a project.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.970
You'll also start to see
missions in other subjects.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.630
Now these squares that you
see-- This is, for those of you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.380
who are familiar with
our Knowledge Map,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500
you can kind of view it
as a condensed Knowledge

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.650
Map for the particular mission
that you're thinking about.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.250
So here there are 482 boxes.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.810
Each of these
represents a skill.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.454
It represents a type
of math problem.

00:01:21.454 --> 00:01:23.120
So what we're going
to start right now--

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.730
and I highly recommend
you do this as well,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.983
it's actually kind
of fun-- is we're

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:27.310
going to start with a pretest.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.100
This is to address
the issue of where

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.480
do I start on Khan Academy.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.842
What are the exercises that
are most appropriate for me?

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:36.050
So I'm going to actually
take this pretest right now.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.960
So let's start the pretest.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.450
So if I see anything that is
completely daunting to me,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.210
I should just say, "I
haven't learned this yet."

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.880
"What is the area
of the rectangle?"

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.790
Well that's just going
to be 3 times 9, which

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.990
is 27 square inches.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.960
Well, let's just say for
the sake of argument,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.460
let's pretend that we haven't
learned algebra or geometry

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.725
yet, so I haven't
learned this yet.

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:01.850
I haven't learned this yet.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.266
And this is an
adaptive test here.

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.690
If I answer
questions right, it's

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.320
going to get harder or go
to more advanced topics.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.930
If I get questions
wrong, it's going

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.600
to give us simpler
or more basic topics.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.050
Move the orange dot to 4/3.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.920
So 4/3-- that's 1/3,
2/3, 3/3, and 4/3.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.740
Submit my answer.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.270
And I have to do
five more problems.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.690
So this isn't too
long of a thing here.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.130
So similar triangles--
well I said

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.460
I'm going to pretend like I
haven't taken geometry yet,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.251
so I'm going to say I
haven't learned this.

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:32.130
Now they gave us a
proportion, 9 over 2

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.950
is equal to what over 18.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.840
Well, we multiply
the denominator by 9,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.180
so we have to multiply
the numerator by 9.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.900
So it's going to 9 times
9 is 81, and there we go.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.586
I've done my pretest.

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:46.210
And now the system
is actually building

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.640
a model for what I likely know
and what I likely don't know.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.760
And we'll look at
that in a second.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.510
So now you see that some of
these tiles changed colors.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.130
Gray means that I haven't
even practiced this thing yet,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.377
while blue means that I've shown
that the system thinks that I

00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:05.960
might know that at
a reasonable level.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.670
And the deeper the
darkness of the blue,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.640
the better that I
actually know that.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.990
So let's actually
start looking at these.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.500
So you can see here that I can
go on each of the concepts,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.790
and it says I'm Practiced
for congruent segments.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.400
It says right here
Need Practice,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.759
or it hasn't started for
points, lines, and planes.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.300
And if you click on
any one of these,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.590
you can go directly
to that exercise.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.160
So based on how I
did the pretest,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.920
it immediately figured out
what I probably know well,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.790
what I might not know that well.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.870
And now this is key.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600
Instead of having
the old Khan Academy

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.570
where you just had this huge
Knowledge Map, and you said,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.020
oh, I guess I'll work on
something-- one of these 500

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.630
things that I see
in front of me.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.870
This now will recommend what
the next best thing is for me.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.610
So let me see.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.800
So Reading tables 2, so I
can start working on that.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.620
The table below shows solar
panel installations by state

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.170
during the last fiscal year,
except one entry is missing.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.530
So this entry is missing.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.450
And if I'm completely confused
by this-- I've never seen it--

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.800
we have a video right
here that should hopefully

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.616
help explain that concept.

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:14.040
Let me go over here.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.738
And it says for this one I
have to get five in a row.

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:18.279
And if I get five
in a row, I'm going

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.019
to get to that Practiced state.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.184
So, I will just
continue touring.

00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:25.850
But I don't have to
do exactly this one.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.266
This is what the
system recommends

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.069
the most, is the
next best thing.

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.610
But then there's
other things that it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.620
thinks I should also be
working on right now.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.350
So say finding absolute values.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.500
What is the absolute
value of negative 6.5?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.810
Well that's 6.5.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.770
Likewise, we still
have videos there,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.440
and I got one out
of my five correct.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.950
And if you have a coach or
if you are someone's coach,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.500
the coach can also make
their own recommendations.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.120
Obviously we have a
lot of coach tools

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.300
so that a coach can
keep track of what

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.430
a student is working on.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.804
And then based on
that, the coach

00:04:58.804 --> 00:05:02.220
can recommend particular
exercises to be focused on

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.210
or to be prioritized.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.140
Now once you've spent
some time on the system,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.040
your Learning Dashboard
might look a little bit more

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.632
like this.

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:12.340
And to get closer and
closer to Mastery--

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.900
to get deeper and deeper
shades of blue there--

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.250
not only do you need to
practice it-- get five in a row

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.330
and that sometimes might change
depending on the exercise--

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.460
but later on you need
to show that you still

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.390
know how to do
that thing in a mix

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.900
of many, many, many
different types of problems.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.190
And the place that happens
is right over here,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.490
which we call our
Mastery Challenge.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.670
This is the tool that you want
to use repeatedly in order

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.630
to get those squares
as dark as possible.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.400
So let me take a
Mastery Challenge.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.322
Negative 7 minus 3i.

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:44.690
It'd be the absolute value of 5.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.523
Well, that's just 5.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.130
Is this triangle equilateral,
isosceles, or scalene?

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.390
So it is definitely isosceles.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.609
If it was equilateral,
these would be 60 degrees.

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:58.400
So it is isosceles.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.060
You have two common base angles.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.509
So you see it's
going through all

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.050
of the different
types of mathematics

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.050
to make sure that not
only have I remembered how

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.760
to do these, not
only have I retained

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.820
the understanding
of these concepts,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.082
but I also can do it
in a mixed environment

00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:13.790
where I have to also
recognize, hey, what

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.230
is a tool I need
to use right now.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.420
What are the factors of 18?

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.120
So let's see.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.230
We could have 1.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.190
We could have 2, 3.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.660
Let's see, 4 isn't divisible.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.740
5 isn't divisible.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.350
6 is.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.617
9 is, and 18.

00:06:30.617 --> 00:06:32.200
And I could have
used this little tool

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.340
to help me with that, but
if you know the factors

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.430
you can just type them in.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.130
So let's check our answer.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.060
Plot 10 comma 6 and
select the quadrant

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.650
in which the point lies.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.016
10 comma 6, and that's
sitting in the first quadrant.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.140
Move the orange dot to
negative 3 minus 2i.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.960
Negative 3 minus 2i.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.370
And now I'm completing
my Mastery Challenge,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.810
and I'm going to get essentially
a report for what did I

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.180
achieve by completing
this Mastery Challenge.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.490
And it's showing us the
things that have gotten darker

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.600
based on the fact
that these are things

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.320
that I had practiced
in the past.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.330
But in this last
eight problems, I

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
showed that I still
remembered them.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.810
And I could do it
in a situation where

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.980
I'm getting a whole
mix of problems.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.690
And so it's our hope that you
enjoy this as much as I just

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.490
did, that this
learning flow really

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.900
makes sure that you
know where to start,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.480
that you're starting on
things that are at your level.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.330
And not only are you
learning new things,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.734
but you have an opportunity
to review those new things,

00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:42.400
and you have an
opportunity to make sure

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.360
that you know when to use
those things when you're

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.480
faced with a whole
mix of problems.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.090
So I look forward to seeing how
you can fill out your Knowledge

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.000
Map here, fill out
all of these skills,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.890
and fulfill your mission
in the world of math,

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.410
and in the future,
other missions.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.280
And we really want
to hear from you

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.910
to figure out how we can make
this entire experience better.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.480
So I encourage you go down
to the bottom of these pages

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.540
and say Give Feedback.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.860
And tell us what you think.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.320
Tell us what's working for you,
what's not working for you.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.320
And if you have ideas for things
that might make it even better,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.260
let us know.
