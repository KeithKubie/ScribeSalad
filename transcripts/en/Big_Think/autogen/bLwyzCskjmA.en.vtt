00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
one of the things that museums have been

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340
one of the things that museums have been
 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.120
one of the things that museums have been
on the vanguard for for the last hundred

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
on the vanguard for for the last hundred
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.070
on the vanguard for for the last hundred
years is the discussion the public

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080
years is the discussion the public
 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.990
years is the discussion the public
discussion of evolution and specifically

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
discussion of evolution and specifically
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.650
discussion of evolution and specifically
the evolution of humans and for clearly

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
the evolution of humans and for clearly
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.930
the evolution of humans and for clearly
since Darwin's time its that was one of

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
since Darwin's time its that was one of
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.189
since Darwin's time its that was one of
the great discoveries was that humans

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
the great discoveries was that humans
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.080
the great discoveries was that humans
actually are descendants from other

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
actually are descendants from other
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.870
actually are descendants from other
forms of animals and we are part of the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
forms of animals and we are part of the
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.130
forms of animals and we are part of the
Tree of Life we are not separate from

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
Tree of Life we are not separate from
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.660
Tree of Life we are not separate from
the Tree of Life we are part of the Tree

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
the Tree of Life we are part of the Tree
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.439
the Tree of Life we are part of the Tree
of Life and we've watched that the 20th

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
of Life and we've watched that the 20th
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570
of Life and we've watched that the 20th
century this continuous addition of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
century this continuous addition of
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.460
century this continuous addition of
information to that narrative and now we

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
information to that narrative and now we
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770
information to that narrative and now we
have with the with the genome the human

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
have with the with the genome the human
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.049
have with the with the genome the human
genome project we have the ultimate tool

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
genome project we have the ultimate tool
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.350
genome project we have the ultimate tool
for mapping our position in the rest of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
for mapping our position in the rest of
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600
for mapping our position in the rest of
the Tree of Life so it's sort of like in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
the Tree of Life so it's sort of like in
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.319
the Tree of Life so it's sort of like in
many ways that the final nail in the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
many ways that the final nail in the
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.200
many ways that the final nail in the
building of understanding how we fit

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
building of understanding how we fit
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880
building of understanding how we fit
with the rest of the things that live on

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
with the rest of the things that live on
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500
with the rest of the things that live on
this planet I think it's really

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
this planet I think it's really
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.979
this planet I think it's really
important that people do understand that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
important that people do understand that
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.260
important that people do understand that
evolution is what makes biology make

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
evolution is what makes biology make
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.709
evolution is what makes biology make
sense

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
sense
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.500
sense
it's what makes all life makes sense so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
it's what makes all life makes sense so
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.229
it's what makes all life makes sense so
from the museum point of view it's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
from the museum point of view it's
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.350
from the museum point of view it's
always been a very important thing to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
always been a very important thing to
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.859
always been a very important thing to
show the actual evidence for evolution

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869
show the actual evidence for evolution
 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.760
show the actual evidence for evolution
so if you don't have a rational

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
so if you don't have a rational
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740
so if you don't have a rational
conversation about evolution and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
conversation about evolution and
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.929
conversation about evolution and
creationism and I have had many rational

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
creationism and I have had many rational
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.969
creationism and I have had many rational
conversations with creationists who

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
conversations with creationists who
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.770
conversations with creationists who
often feel that they haven't seen the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
often feel that they haven't seen the
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.580
often feel that they haven't seen the
evidence for evolution and museums again

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
evidence for evolution and museums again
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560
evidence for evolution and museums again
are the most accessible portal for

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
are the most accessible portal for
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510
are the most accessible portal for
understanding science that we have and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
understanding science that we have and
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.539
understanding science that we have and
museums by presenting dinosaur skeletons

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
museums by presenting dinosaur skeletons
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760
museums by presenting dinosaur skeletons
and exhibits about human evolution frame

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
and exhibits about human evolution frame
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770
and exhibits about human evolution frame
the evidence that we have the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
the evidence that we have the
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120
the evidence that we have the
three-dimensional evidence we have for

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130
three-dimensional evidence we have for
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100
three-dimensional evidence we have for
evolution and I found that be the most

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
evolution and I found that be the most
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020
evolution and I found that be the most
powerful way is to walk through an

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
powerful way is to walk through an
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.550
powerful way is to walk through an
exhibit and say here are the elements of

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
exhibit and say here are the elements of
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.530
exhibit and say here are the elements of
evolution manifests because frankly

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
evolution manifests because frankly
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.580
evolution manifests because frankly
evolution is not an obvious or intuitive

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
evolution is not an obvious or intuitive
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.179
evolution is not an obvious or intuitive
concept it was an amazing discovery that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
concept it was an amazing discovery that
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.100
concept it was an amazing discovery that
we're all related but it was not obvious

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
we're all related but it was not obvious
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.480
we're all related but it was not obvious
it's not obvious that I'm related to a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
it's not obvious that I'm related to a
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.290
it's not obvious that I'm related to a
strawberry

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300
strawberry
 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.040
strawberry
but that's the story of evolution
