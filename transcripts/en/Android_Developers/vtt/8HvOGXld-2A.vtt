MARIA GARCIA PUYOL: Hello,
everybody and thanks

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.290
for joining our session.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.230
My name is Maria
Garcia Puyol, and I'm

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.730
a software engineer
on the Android

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.640
Location and Context team.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.780
And I'm also one of the
co-founders of the Android

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.880
Emergency Location
Service, which

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.930
helps find wireless
emergency callers faster.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.240
Now, by a show of hands,
who in the audience,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.250
like me, has ever dialed 9-1-1
or any other emergency number

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.680
with their smartphone?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.509
So I can see a few.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.400
Let me share my
story of the one time

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.490
I dialed 9-1-1, which is
one of the reasons why

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.650
we started this project
in the first place.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.480
In 2014-- right after I
had just joined Google--

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.960
I bought my first car.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.390
And this is me, all
happy on that night.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.910
About 10 minutes after
leaving the dealership,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.870
I encountered one of the
scariest moments of my life.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.110
Suddenly, out of the
blue, out of nowhere,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.280
there was a woman standing
in the middle of the highway.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.190
I had to very quickly
swerve to avoid hitting her,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.530
and luckily I didn't.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.180
Immediately after,
I took my phone

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.580
and dialed 9-1-1, the emergency
number in the United States.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.410
And after explaining what
I had just witnessed,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.430
the first question they asked
me was, where's your emergency?

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.920
And they ask you
this because to be

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.970
able to send your
help right away,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.810
they need to know
your precise location.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.020
But today, over 80%
of emergency calls

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.110
are dialed with smartphones.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.270
In contrary to public
belief, first responders

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.860
may have a really hard
time locating you.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.210
This is because they rely
on very inaccurate location

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.940
information, as my
colleague, Soonil, will

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.260
explain in a moment.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.250
Now back to my story.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.230
I was new to the area--

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.780
I had just moved to the Bay
Area to work at Google--

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.465
and I didn't know where I was.

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:00.840
Everything that
I was able to say

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
was, I'm driving on some
highway in Mountain View.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.620
Luckily for us,
other 9-1-1 callers

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.960
had reported the
lady on the road,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.480
and they were able
to dispatch help.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.210
But finding emergency
callers may not

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.930
be as easy in many
other situations.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.590
The irony about this, is that we
rely on very accurate location

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.510
information for pretty much
everything in our lives.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.720
Today, you can get a pizza
delivered to your door

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.510
from a nearby restaurant.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
You can upload a picture with
the right, precise location

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.420
on social media.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.240
And you can even get
a date around you.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.140
But, somehow, that accurate
location that you see on Google

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.950
Maps cannot be shared
with first responders,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.530
so that they can find
you during an emergency.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.750
So even though you see the blue
dot that you're so used to,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.700
and that you rely on for
pretty much everything,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.830
nowadays, our first
responders may not

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.550
be able to say where you're
calling from in a big city.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.820
I had just joined the
Android Location team.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.800
So some colleagues
and I sat down,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.390
and wonder if
there was something

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.910
we could do to help fix this.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.860
It boiled down to
one single question.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.150
What if your mobile phone
could send its precise location

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.670
to first responders
automatically.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.640
By precise location, again,
I mean that accurate blue dot

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.010
that you see on Google Maps.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.860
We got very excited
about this possibility.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.540
And a small team of
us started to work

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.150
on this as a 20% project.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.040
So we spent 20% of our time--

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.780
roughly, one day a week--

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.240
at Google working on
the first prototype.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.850
And we focused on three
basic founding principles.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.050
The first of them was that we
wanted to make it automatically

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.710
available everywhere.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.310
So we decided to ship the
Android Emergency Location

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.340
Service as part of Google
Play services, which

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.310
is available on almost every
Android device out there,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.260
and is updated regularly.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.620
And that way users don't need
to download an emergency app,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.240
you just need to download the
emergency number normally.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.920
We wanted to protect
the user's privacy.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.089
And so the location is
computed on the device,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.730
on your mobile phone, and
sent directly from your phone

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.020
to first responders.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.110
And only during emergencies.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.130
And our main goal was to improve
the state of emergency services

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.920
around the world,
and help save lives

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.620
by providing more accurate,
but also, faster locations.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.770
The project became the Android
Emergency Location Service,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.630
or ELS.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.020
And it started to get deployed
in some countries in 2016,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.180
just two years later.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.090
Let me share with you one of the
most incredible examples of how

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.540
this technology is
helping save lives today.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.414
It took place in
Austria last year.

I'm going to hand it
over to my colleague,

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.900
Soonil, who's going to explain
what the state of emergency

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.420
location was when we
started the project,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.430
and why it would have
been very hard to find

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.830
the protagonist of our video.

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:47.500
SOONIL NAGARKAR: Thanks, Maria.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.640
So I'm Soonil, I'm
the tech lead for ELS,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.993
and great to be here
with all you guys today.

00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.660
Now we've all seen
the Hollywood movies,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.470
or even TV shows, where as
soon as there's a problem,

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.320
we can see a call taker with
a high tech screen tracking

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.460
the caller's location, down
to the exact room they're in.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.590
The reality, not quite as
glamorous, unfortunately.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.570
So how is it possible
that Google Maps

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.170
can know exactly where you
are, but a 911 call may not?

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.480
So we're going to start with
a quick, non-comprehensive

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.550
overview of how the
9-1-1 system actually

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.260
works in the United
States, and what

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.230
can go wrong along the way.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.200
So E911, Enhanced
911, is a system

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.150
in use in most of the US.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.460
Now, Enhanced 911
specifically refers

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.060
to the ability to get location
data alongside a call.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.940
In the US, 9-1-1 didn't
exist until the late '60s.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.380
And the vast majority of what
is now called the E911 system

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.200
was developed in the '70s,
when the only type of phone

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.559
was a landline.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.520
E911 was, of course, a huge
advancement at the time.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.020
Before that, there
was just a call.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.755
There was no location
information, whatsoever.

00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:51.130
Now, some quick
pieces of trivia.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.950
That red phone you see up
there is the actual phone

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.290
that the first 9-1-1
call was placed on.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.840
And below that, a real picture
of one of the first call

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.410
centers ever built. Pretty
high tech for the time, right?

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.910
All right, so this system
was designed in the '70s,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.550
but it hasn't really changed
that much since then.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.560
And even today,
if you visit a 911

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.305
call center, much of the data--

00:09:12.305 --> 00:09:13.680
even though it
might be presented

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.540
on modern LCD screens--

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.102
is likely delivered
via serial cables.

00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:19.560
Let's take a look
at how this aging

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.720
system works behind the scenes
in order to get location.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.470
The first thing that
we want to know about

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.920
is called the ALI, or the
Automatic Location Information

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.030
Database.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.430
The ALI is essentially
just a big look-up table.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.080
You get phone
numbers and one end,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.980
street addresses out the other.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.870
This makes sense
with landline phones.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.660
Your kitchen
landline phone is not

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.210
going to be changing street
addresses very often.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.770
But as mobile
phones came around,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.600
the ALI had to be retrofitted.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.850
Support for latitude and
longitude coordinates

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.780
was added.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.630
Carriers had to be able
to push cell or GPS

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.550
location into this database.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.600
So we take a look at this
real ALI record on the left,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.347
there's a couple of
things to notice.

00:10:00.347 --> 00:10:01.930
First of all, this
is a recent record.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.520
This is from 2018.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.710
Things still work
just like this today.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.340
The maximum record size
here, is 512 bytes.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.340
That's all the information
we have to work with, here.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.670
And in many call
centers, those 512 bytes

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.000
are delivered over a
1,200 bps serial link.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.620
Now, to do the
math quickly, that

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.740
means it takes 4.2
seconds just to download

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.990
this tiny amount of
information, and get

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.910
that in front of a call taker.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.380
Now, some other
things to look at.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.930
First of all, we
have the address.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.600
You can see, here, this is
a call 87 Terrace Street

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.680
in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.350
We also have some latitude
and longitude information.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.370
Kind of also buried in there
is accuracy and confidence

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.960
information that goes with it.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.760
Now I was curious
about this address.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.730
So I decided to take a look
at this on Google Street View.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.930
Here's what we turned up.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.670
This is a cell phone tower.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.550
The real call was pinging
off the cell phone tower

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.290
that, I bet, that
whoever was calling

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.450
was not located anywhere
near this address.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.580
And not anywhere near the
latitude and longitude

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.810
coordinates.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.000
So that's one problem
with the E911 system.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.070
But there's another problem
that better location

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.690
could help solve.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.500
And that is called routing.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.520
Now in the US, there are
6,000 call centers that

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.400
handle emergency calls alone.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.440
And whenever you call 9-1-1
a decision has to be made,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.950
which call center is
going to answer that call.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.840
Usually this is done
based on the cell tower

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.800
you're connected to.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.910
It's pretty straightforward,
usually works.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.430
But there can be problems.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.000
Cell towers often overlap
their range substantially.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.800
The jurisdictions
that they serve

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.660
can overlap substantially.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.330
All of these complications
mean that calls can easily

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.840
go to the wrong place.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.960
And when that happens,
the answering call center

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.230
has to manually transfer
the call to the right place.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.990
And that incorrect routing
eats precious time out

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.420
of every emergency call.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.560
To give you a quick
example, it used

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.950
to be the case that here, in
California, any emergency calls

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.490
near highways were routed to
the California Highway Patrol,

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.710
even if the call had nothing
to do with the highway.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.470
And the CHP call center was
responsible for triaging

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.150
that call, and
then redirecting it

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.470
to local agencies
as appropriate.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.620
Now, one study in
Sacramento found

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.920
that this led to an average
delay of almost 60 seconds

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.500
just to transfer that
call from the CHP

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.460
to the Sacramento
Police Department.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.670
Now, a 60 second delay
on every emergency call,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.990
that really starts to add up.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.600
So if ELS tell us
is able to deliver

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.538
highly accurate location
before the call starts--

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.580
or even in the first couple
seconds of the call--

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.190
then we can right place
immediately, instead

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.190
of routing it simply
based on the cell tower.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.915
So at this point, we've
covered some background on E911

00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:38.540
in the US, but we
haven't really talked

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.700
about the rest of the world.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.130
Historically, there have
only been four countries

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.950
that mandate GPS as part
of their emergency systems,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.530
and that have E911
systems similar to the US.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.930
As you can see on the
map, Canada, the United

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.810
States, South Korea, and Japan.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.550
For much of the
rest of the world,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.530
Emergency Location is broken.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.690
It either doesn't
exist, or is only

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.240
supported by cell tower
location technology, which

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.110
is notoriously inaccurate.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.450
Now, this is the problem
we wanted to help fix.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.750
And we designed the Android
Emergency Location System

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.450
to provide accurate and
quick fuse locations

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:16.202
to every country, as we saw in
the video from Austria earlier.

00:13:16.202 --> 00:13:18.410
So, at this point, we've
covered some of the problems

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.940
that we want to solve.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.070
ELS was designed
to bridge this gap,

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.970
providing Androids
quick and accurate

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.360
Fused Location
directly to emergency

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.830
services as a supplement
to existing E911 Location.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.590
And to be integrated with
next generation 9-1-1 systems.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.560
So let's talk about ELS
itself, and let's start

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.340
with a high level overview
of how our service works.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.100
We can break this flow down
into four discrete steps.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.890
First, of course,
the user has to call

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.610
or text 9-1-1, or other
emergency numbers such as 1-1-2

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.560
internationally, and so forth.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.860
As soon as that call is made,
we start computing the location

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.240
on the device.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.760
Once we get the
location, the next step

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.510
is to send that directly
from the device to emergency

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.488
partners.

00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:05.030
And it's direct,
and that it does not

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.755
travel through Google servers.

00:14:06.755 --> 00:14:09.170
It is then, the
partners responsibility

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.510
to send that location
on to the call center,

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.280
and to make sure
that it gets in front

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.330
of the call taker, who can use
that location on their call.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.130
So the left side
of this is broadly

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.570
Google's responsibility.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.533
And the right side is broadly
our partners responsibility.

00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:24.950
Which brings us
to the next point,

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.120
what exactly is a partner?

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.470
So generally, we work with
three types of partners.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.140
There are government agencies.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.720
There are carriers
and operators.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.700
And third party emergency
services companies.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.240
So with over 6,000 call
centers in the US alone,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.380
we rely on our partners-- and
their public safety expertise--

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.142
to get this location delivered
exactly where it needs to go.

00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:48.350
So there is the overall flow.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.190
How do we configuring
control this?

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.630
Well, Google administers this
on behalf of our partners.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.240
And we have an incredibly
flexible configuration system

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.950
that supports all
kinds of things.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.810
I'll touch on just a couple.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.210
We support arbitrary
geographic polygons.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.400
This lets us control
our activations

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.070
at a county level,
or a state level,

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.420
rather than just at
the country level.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.830
It lets us touch on all sorts
of different jurisdictions.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.040
We can use the country code and
network code from cell towers

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.650
to help base our logic, based
on the country and carrier

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.450
that this call is coming from.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.430
And, of course, we
support location updates

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.370
for the entire duration
of the emergency call,

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.850
instead of just a single update.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.520
So somebody made a 9-1-1 call.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.630
We get the location.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.070
Now, we need to send it.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.450
How do we do that?

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.950
At the moment, we
use two methods.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.917
Either an HTTPS
message or SMS message.

00:15:40.917 --> 00:15:42.750
We're going to examine
both, but let's start

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.530
by examining the SMS message
in a little more detail.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.230
Now, when we first started
thinking about ELS,

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.900
it happened that British
Telecom in the UK

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.100
had proposed a new standard
for location over SMS messages.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.820
This was called the Advanced
Mobile Location format, or AML.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.435
We adopted AML, and it's now
common everywhere in Europe.

00:16:03.435 --> 00:16:05.310
There was one other
thing we had to think of.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.050
We originally
started experimenting

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.090
using normal text messages,
the kind you might

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.260
send to your friend every day.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.337
But there's one problem.

00:16:12.337 --> 00:16:13.920
There's no way to
keep this from being

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.110
exposed in the user's
outbox, and this

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.090
presents a privacy concern.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.210
Now, if you've ever called
9-1-1 from your Android device--

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.430
and it sounds like a
lot of you had to--

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.800
you may have noticed that
that 9-1-1 call does not

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.570
show up in your call log.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.390
There's a good reason for this.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.325
In a lot of cases-- such as
domestic violence situations--

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.950
it's actually very
important that there

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.330
is no evidence on the
phone that somebody

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.460
has had to contact
emergency services,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.110
that the users as
privacy is preserved.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.740
So instead, we
switched to data SMS.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.740
This is simply a subset of
the normal SMS standard that

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.450
allows for binary payloads.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.420
But more importantly, does not
show up in the user's outbox

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.090
and helps us preserve
the user's privacy.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.090
A couple other things
I want to mention.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.370
SMS generally functions better
in lower signal coverage.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.780
It doesn't require a data
connection, of course.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.800
This makes it very useful
to us in emerging markets.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.380
It may require some coordination
with carriers, of course.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.908
So let's contrast
SMS with HTTPS, now.

00:17:11.908 --> 00:17:13.950
The first, and most
important, difference for us,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.960
is just HTTPS can handle
much more information.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.020
It's not size limited
like an SMS is.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.250
It's a very flexible and
more importantly, extensible.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.140
So you can add new information.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.349
Add new key value pairs
to help give our partners

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.310
more information.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.990
And help save lives that way.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.770
Now, we found that when a high
quality data collection is

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.080
present, HTTPS
actually turns out

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.600
to be more reliable
than SMS, generally.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.940
Of course, this depends
on your cell environment.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.140
Your signal environment.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.460
The country you're in.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.590
A whole bunch of things.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.720
But overall, we see
HTTPS is the way forward,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.750
but were unwilling to leave
out incumbent markets.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.060
So we encourage our
partners to use both options

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.230
whenever possible.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.530
So now that we have a high
level understanding of how

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.530
we transmit location, the
next piece of the puzzle

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.810
is how we actually figure
out where the phone is

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.985
in the first place.

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:07.110
So to tell you a little
bit about the Android Fused

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.327
Location provider, here's Steve.

00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:11.160
STEVE MALKOS: Great.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.630
Thanks, Soonil.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.540
Hello, everyone.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.670
My name's Steve Markos, and
I also helped co-found ELS.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.640
I'm super excited to be
here with you all today.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.850
Now, let's talk about
how location is computed.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.680
Because getting an
accurate location

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.480
is the key to all of this.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.490
The faster and more
accurate location

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.820
we can deliver, the
more people we can help.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.120
Accuracy and speed of location
will reduce the emergency

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.380
response times.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.210
Here's a great quote
from the US government,

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.050
the FCC estimates
that 10,000 lives

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.080
could be saved every year--

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.290
for one minute sooner, if a
user was calling the emergency

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.730
dispatching center.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.190
That's a very
powerful statement.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.550
One minute sooner, having
the potential to save 10,000

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.010
additional lives every year?

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.290
It's quite powerful.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.700
OK, so what you saw
earlier, from Soonil,

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.980
was that the existing
emergency system today,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.060
either used a cell-based
position or GPS-based position.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.130
Let's first focus on cell.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.890
Cell tower positions--
to emergency responders--

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.100
are not considered a location
that they could dispatch help

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:18.880
to.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.770
That's because the
emergency operator

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.460
is seeing the civic address
to the nearest cell tower.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.020
And that's nowhere near
where the actual emergency

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.290
is taking place.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.950
And cell tower position ranges
in the thousands of feet,

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.480
or hundreds of meters.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.190
Like, in this
example, where we see

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.380
the cell tower
position at our office

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.575
is over 2000 feet,
or 600 meters.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.660
GPS.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.910
Everyone in this room
is pretty much aware

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.670
that GPS works great
when we're outdoors,

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.680
in the open sky environment.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.110
Like in this
example where we see

00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:00.010
GPS Position fix of about
25 meters, or 85 feet.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.930
This was taken indoors and it's
not that good of a position.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.030
GPS doesn't work
that well indoors.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.220
This is the true
location where we

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.520
were when we did this example.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.900
But when you're outside, in
a pure open sky environment,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.950
GPS is typically around five to
six meters, or nine to 10 feet.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.060
There are many issues with
getting GPS into the legacy

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.070
emergency dispatching system.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.600
I'm going to highlight
two of those today.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.640
The first issue is that when
the GPS position is computed,

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.460
it's actually computed
on the carrier's network.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.710
It's not the location
that's available

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.010
on your mobile device,
which is much more accurate.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.980
The second issue is
that the carrier is only

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.390
computing a single GPS
position fix, whereas ELS

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.170
can compute multiple fixes
throughout the entire duration

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.180
of that call.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.790
So, more or less,
GPS has you covered

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.620
for the most part,
when you're outdoors,

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.850
in an open sky environment.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.020
But what about a downtown,
dense, deep urban area?

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.630
Or when you're indoors,
or deep indoors?

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.770
That's where we can help with
our comprehensive positioning

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.770
solution, which includes
indoor and outdoor locations.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.690
We call it the Fused
Location provider, or FLP.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.950
The Fused Location provider
is comprised of Wi-Fi, GPS,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.430
and sensors to do
sensor fusion that gets

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.560
us this very accurate location.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.450
And the Fused
Location provider is

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.300
available on almost every
Android handset in the market

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.920
today.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.300
In this example, the FLP is
able to compute a very accurate

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.550
position indoors.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.860
Right here, we
produced a position

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.410
at about 29 feet,
or nine meters.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.820
Earlier today, there was a
talk at Google I/O called

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.540
Seamless and Smooth Location
Everywhere With the New Fused

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.770
Location Provider.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.630
If you didn't get a
chance to see it live,

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.194
watch it on YouTube.

00:22:02.194 --> 00:22:06.000
OK, so this is the flow from
the lower hardware to the Fused

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.020
Location provider.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.640
It looks something like this.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.800
There's many different
location providers in Android.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.980
Let's say, as an app developer--
which most of you are in this

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.480
room--

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.680
wanted to create an app that
only access GPS only locations.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.960
You could do that by
calling the location

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.180
Manager APIs in Android.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.730
Or let's say you wanted
to build an app that

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.450
only access Wi-Fi locations,
or cell-based locations.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:35.080
Then, you could call the NLP, or
the Network Location Provider.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.810
But if you simply
wanted to get the best

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.220
of what Google offers--

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.200
which uses all the different
location providers,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.640
along with the sensors
doing sensor fusion--

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.390
our recommendation is to
access the FLP directly.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.960
The Fused Location provider
fuses all these technologies

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.170
together in order to derive
the best possible location.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:59.940
And that's what we supply
to the emergency responders.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.960
So the FLP is ubiquitous.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.950
It works globally, by
providing 3D locations

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.350
in all different
types of environments.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.080
We're especially proud
of launching altitude,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.570
or 3D location, for indoors.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.020
So now, we provide 3D
x, y, and z locations,

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:21.010
not only for outdoor
environments, but also indoors.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.200
The FLP is fast.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.540
GPS can sometimes
take a very long time

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.040
to get a position fix.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.280
The FLP is almost
instant on, and gives you

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.980
very quick location
updates as you move around.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.890
This is important--
as we noted earlier--

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:40.140
because the sooner help
is sent, the better.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.480
And the FLP is accurate.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.910
According to the EPA, the
Environmental Protection

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.260
Agency, the average American
spends 87% of their time

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.250
indoors.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.750
This is including while
they sleep, as well.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.570
So the FLP needs to work.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.330
And it needs to work
accurately, especially when

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.770
we need it most, while indoors.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.010
OK, demo time.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.450
As we were planning this
demo for Google I/O,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.810
we said we wanted to do a demo
that people could relate to.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.690
So we went to one of the
most recognizable places

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.700
that we could think of.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.280
I could hear Sean
Connery's voice, right now,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.440
from the movie The Rock.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.995

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.420
Thank you.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.290
But Alcatraz has its
own set of challenges.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.070
It has lots of metal.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.200
Super thick, concrete walls.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.210
And tiny, tiny windows.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.200
This is not conducive for
good GPS or Wi-Fi signaling

our Fused Location provider

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.010

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.710
But we said, we'd
like challenges,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.720
let's see how well we'll do.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.330
So we worked with the San
Francisco Emergency Dispatching

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:59.090
Center, who allowed us to place
real calls into their center.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.560
What this demo will show us is
the voice from the call taker

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.820
will be receiving
locations nowhere

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.475
near the actual emergency
where that's taking place.

00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:10.850
But I'd like you
to pay attention

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:15.350
to how quickly the location
shows up on the phone.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.990
And how quickly the
location shows up

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.350
on the laptop with
the red blinking dot.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.470
That's very accurate
update from ELS,

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.120
even before the
call is connected.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:36.245

STEVE MALKOS: What we saw from
the Legacy Emergency System

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.340
is unfortunately, very common.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.850
The dispatch operator noted
a latitude and longitude,

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.120
which mapped to the
nearest cell tower address.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.570
Both these locations
were to over 2.5 miles

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.810
away from the actual emergency.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:52.340
But what we saw with the ELS is
the location shown here in red

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.718
was right on top of
the true location.

00:26:55.718 --> 00:26:58.010
And it could have also, been
available to the emergency

to help more and
more people globally.

FIONA LEE: Thanks, Steve.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.590
So, Soonil, Steve, and
Maria have described

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.840
how we engineered ELS.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.120
And I think we've shown
you that ELS provides

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.020
more accurate location faster

build a better technology,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.480
does not mean that people
are actually going to use it.

about how we launched MLS

around the world.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.160

non-technical factors that

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.360
played a key role in our
ability to successfully deploy

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.930
We learned.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.770
And we iterated over time.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.850
So the first factor to keep
in mind is the ecosystem.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:02.860
What are the characteristics
of the community

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.500
of people who will use
your product or service?

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.820
What's the environment
in which they operate?

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.330
What products do they
currently use today?

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:14.080
With ELS, we focused on
two sets target users.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.060
The public safety professional.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.060
And the end user, who will
just dial or text in emergency

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.620
number and expect it to work.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.908
So when we looked at the
public safety ecosystem,

00:28:23.908 --> 00:28:25.450
the first thing that
jumped out at us

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.060
is that it is disparate
and fragmented.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.880
So you have some countries with
just a handful of emergency

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.360
communication centers.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.500
And then you have the
US, with over 6,500.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.630
That's more than all the
emergency communication

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.380
centers in Europe.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.780
There are some
emergency centers that

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.135
are only staffed by two people.

00:28:44.135 --> 00:28:45.510
And then there
are some that have

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.900
hundreds, or thousands, of
people taking emergency calls.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.570
They all use
different IT systems.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.390
In the US we have one
emergency number, 9-1-1.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.170
Thailand has 50.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.990
So what that told
us was that we have

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.198
to build ELS to be very
flexible, and to offer options.

00:29:02.198 --> 00:29:04.740
And Soonil walked you through
all the different configuration

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.930
options that we provide.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.880
Second thing about
public safety is

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.640
that it is rife with
legacy infrastructure.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.350
This tends to be expensive.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.670
Proprietary.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.320
Have high upgrade costs.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.280
And high switching costs.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.070
So what we did, was we built yes
so it's standards based, right?

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.400
So data SMS adheres to the
advanced mobile location

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.180
specification.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.910
And HTTPS is HTTPS.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.010
The benefit of
adhering to standards

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.980
is that it makes it very easy
for your partners to deploy.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.020
There's a uniform
process to deploy.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.150
We also design each ELS
to be fast and easy.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.400
So we can turn on a
new configuration.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.930
We can change configurations.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.720
And we can roll that all
out in under 24 hours.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.230
Finally, we designed
ELS to be safe.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.090
When we decide on a
production rollout,

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.870
we work with our partners
to roll ELS out in phases.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.550
We usually start at 1%.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.140
We let that soak for a few days.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.820
Then we increase to 5%.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.940
Soak some more.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.820
And we increase in increments.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.610
And at any point in time, it
is really easy to roll back.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.410
The third factor to keep
in mind is public safety

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.850
is risk averse, right?

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.680
So lives on the line.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.720
The costs of making a
mistake are very, very high.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.560
So we built ELS, as
I said, to be safe.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.620
And to roll in phases.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.030
The second factor
to keep in mind

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.185
is your distribution,
or business model.

00:30:30.185 --> 00:30:31.810
How do you plan on
getting your product

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.940
into the hands of users?

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.100
As developers, it's
really important for you

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.280
to find a distribution model
that can scale rapidly.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.380
For us, we made ELS free.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.550
Free to partners.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.290
Free to public safety.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.310
Mostly, because it is
the right thing to do,

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.760
and we want to keep
Android users safe.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.690
But free is good.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.070
Free promotes adoption.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.840
And public safety likes
free, because they

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.780
tend to be budget constrained.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.090
Second key decision we
made was to distribute

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.400
ELS via Google Play services.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.190
This gave us a scalable
distribution mechanism.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.950
And it allowed ELS to be
ubiquitously available.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.100
Because Google Play services
ships with just about every

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.240
approved Android phone.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.020
The other nice thing about going
out with Google Play services

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.370
is that Google Play
services updates over weeks.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.340
That meant we could roll out
ELS updates quickly, and not

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.440
be tied to an annual
OS release cycle.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.790
And then, finally, we
built ELS to be user first.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.790
For the user who
cares about privacy,

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.530
we offer an opt out feature.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.530
And, as my colleagues have
said, we calculate location

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.760
on the device.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.110
And we only activate ELS when
an emergency call is made.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.860
Now, there were trade
offs in this, right?

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.950
Because you can offer much
more functionality when you do

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.420
service side processing.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.090
But we made a decision
not to do that.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.300
The other thing
about ELS is the user

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.010
doesn't have to take any action.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.140
No special hardware
required on the phone.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.940
No need to download an app.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.790
If ELS is deployed
in your region,

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.600
you just dial and text
the emergency number

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.100
and it will work.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.260
For the public
safety professional,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.010
we designed ELS so that ELS can
be easily integrated into one

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.470
of their existing systems.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.970
So I don't know if you've ever
seen an emergency call taker.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.090
But they are juggling about
five different screens

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:18.170
on their desk.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.850
And the last thing
we want to do is

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.710
force them to have a
sixth screen, in order

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.820
to get ELS location data.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.540
So one of our best practice
recommendations to partners

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.050
is integrate ELS location
data into one of the existing

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.450
systems currently used at
the emergency communications

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.180
center.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.180
Usually, their mapping
system, or their computer

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.310
aided dispatch system.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.600
Finally, ELS is future friendly.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.200
We have built it so that it
will be easily integrated

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.900
into next generation public
safety systems that are being

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.200
designed all over the world.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.350
This third factor is my
personal favorite, regulation.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.140
What are the laws pertaining
to your product and service?

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.220
Who makes those Laws?

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.480
And how explicit
is the language?

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.090
So, as you might
expect, there is

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.287
a lot of regulation
surrounding public safety.

00:33:02.287 --> 00:33:03.620
It's a mission critical service.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.080
And governments want
to keep people safe.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.250
And for ELS, there's an
additional implication for us.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.920
Because we transmit location
during an emergency call,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.630
there are privacy
implications, as well.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:18.470
So when we look at regulation,
the first thing we notice

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.690
is that laws are lagging.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.230
Regulators simply cannot
keep pace with technology.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.840
So we position ELS as
a supplemental service.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.240
It's not meant to replace
existing emergency location

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.740
solutions.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.340
It's meant to augment it, and
provide the 9-1-1, or emergency

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:38.000
call taker, with another
tool in their toolkit.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.860
Second thing about law is--

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.000
believe it or not--

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.140
it can be ambiguous.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.590
Especially, laws that pertain
to privacy with respect

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.970
to emerging new technologies.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.470
So when we looked
at some countries,

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:53.840
we found that there were no
explicit laws saying that you

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.390
cannot transmit location
during an emergency.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.690
But there were no laws that
explicitly said, you can,

00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.190
as well.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:00.840
So this is a gray area.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.280
And we chose to exercise
due diligence and caution.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.940
And we decided to calculate
location on the device,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.949
and then transmit it
directly to our partners,

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.739
so that no personally
identifiable information is

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:14.960
stored on Google servers.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.510
Finally, laws are complex.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.300
There are different regulatory
frameworks and privacy laws

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.980
in each country.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.159
These laws, believe it or not,
can be sometimes contradictory.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.570
Often overlapping.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.760
And in the case
of ELS, generally,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.679
multi-jurisdictional.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.110
Because you make
an emergency call

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.909
over the
telecommunications network,

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:37.310
or you send an emergency text
over the telecommunications

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.850
network, we had to deal with the
Ministry of Telecommunications.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.130
We also had to deal with
the Ministry of Interior,

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.770
which is generally,
responsible for public safety.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:47.630
Sometimes the
Ministry of Defense.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.070
And the Ministry of Health.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.199
And then there were also
data protection agencies

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.050
that we had to keep in mind.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.620
Last, but not least,
is partnerships.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.630
So good partners are bridges.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.980
We view our partners as a
scaling force multiplier.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.430
And this is particularly
true in public safety,

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.130
because public safety
tends not to be

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.320
an early adopter of technology.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.050
So we rely on our partners
to educate and train

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.190
public safety.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.300
And also to work with them to
operationalize ELS location

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:16.800
data.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.010
So it can be useful in the
emergency communications

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.840
center.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.590
So what we do is we
look for partners that

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.820
have really high standards.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.200
In quality assurance.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.070
In security.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.030
In monitoring.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.870
In reporting.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.940
And in operational support.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.950
This ensures that we
have a high quality

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.800
end to end deployment of ELS.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.860
So how are we doing today?

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.080
Today, ELS is live
in 18 countries,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.170
serving a population of
600 plus million users.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:46.430
And we send location for over 1
and 1/2 million emergency calls

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.270
per day.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.840
One of the nice things
about being on the ELS team

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.880
is learning about
how ELS has made

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.060
a difference in emergencies
around the world.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.780
So I'd like to share a
couple of stories with you.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.590
The first one has to do with a
medical emergency in Lithuania.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.490
8-year-old boy calls
emergency services.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.640
He's found his father
unconscious, maybe dead.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.200
He doesn't know
his home address.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.230
He doesn't know the phone number
of any of his family members.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.540
Now, remember,
Lithuania public safety

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.480
does not get location
by a GPS, only cell.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.910
So the call taker is
seeing a cell tower

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.140
location of a whopping 14
kilometers, almost nine miles.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.330
In a densely populated
neighborhood,

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.640
that's hundreds, if not
thousands, of houses

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.930
that you have to search.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.050
But thanks to ELS, which
pinpointed the exact house

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.000
where the boy made the call--

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.990
accuracy rate is of 6 meters--

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:40.010
the first responders
could be dispatched

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.040
to render medical
help really quickly.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.790
And as it turns out,
the man was suffering

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.580
from an epileptic seizure.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.000
Second instance is a serious
mountain biking accident

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.750
in Austria.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.580
Mountain biker was alone.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.610
Had a bad accident in
a deeply forested area.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:56.690
No landmarks.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.220
No addresses.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.980
Cell tower location
was 900 plus meters.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.240
But thanks to ELS, which gave
a 12 meter accuracy radius,

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.120
they could send medical
help to the injured biker--

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.580
to take him to the hospital--
because they could locate him

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.250
quickly.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.280
So I'd like to hand the
microphone back to Maria

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.810
to wrap up.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.495
MARIA GARCIA PUYOL:
Thanks, Fiona.

00:37:19.495 --> 00:37:22.120
So now that you've learned more
about how the Android Emergency

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.970
Location Service works, I'd
like to close this session

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.700
with some final thoughts.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.420
Thanks to ELS,
your Android phone

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.900
is able to send accurate
location in 18 countries,

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.270
during emergencies
to first responders.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.695
But for us, this is
just the beginning.

00:37:38.695 --> 00:37:41.070
We're working on deploying
the Android Emergency Location

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.890
Service in more countries,
because we'd like to help

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.930
as many people as possible.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.020
Also, even though
our location accuracy

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.480
is much better than the
existing legacy location

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.820
systems in emergency
services, we're

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.130
always working on
improving location.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.340
Both indoors and outdoors.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.620
And one of our very
next challenging goals--

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.370
and we like challenges-- is to
provide dispatchable addresses.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.070
And also, floor numbers
to first responders,

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.560
so that they can find you
when you dial an emergency

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.230
number even faster.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.400
I, for one, am very
proud of the impact

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.670
ELS has had on people's lives.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.470
And I'm very happy
to know that if I

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:22.920
were to dial 9-1-1 today,
because I found a person

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.020
standing in the
middle of the highway,

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.110
first responders would be able
to locate me right away here,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.683
in Mountain View.

00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:32.850
This project, of course,
wouldn't have been possible

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.462
without the help of our many
partners and collaborators

00:38:35.462 --> 00:38:36.170
around the world.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.490
So we want to give
them a special thanks.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.140
And also, thank
you all very much

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.088
for coming to Google I/O. And
for coming to our session.

00:38:43.088 --> 00:38:44.880
Please reach out if
you have any questions,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.860
or want to know more.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.360
That's all from us, thanks.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.160
[APPLAUSE]
