00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.430
Some of the oldest people alive today drink
a glass of wine or eating two strips of bacon

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.430
every morning.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.960
Which doesn’t sound half bad.. but how can
we really live longer?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.640
Hey everyone!

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.040
Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.750
While genes are a big factor into living longer,
genetics only make up 30% of the story.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.310
The rest seems up to us.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.090
Life expectancy at birth in the U.S. has been
rising for all groups at rate of about .6

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.390
years a year.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.750
People born in the last five years could reasonably
expect to live into their late 70s even early

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.750
80s.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.679
At this rate, it seems like we could live
until 100 soon!

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:37.149
Well, not quite yet.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.859
Most researchers thought that living longer
meant more time doing what you love.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.879
The assumption just went without saying.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.489
However recent research showed otherwise.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.850
Scientists at University of Massachusetts
Medical School extended the life of roundworm

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.949
by playing with four different mechanisms.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.539
No matter what mutations they had, the worms
lived longer, but they spent a greater percentage

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.920
of their live in a frail state.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.109
BUMMER DUDE.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.289
As we extend our lifespans with modern medicine,
age related diseases like Alzheimer's and

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.070
certain cancers are on the rise.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.920
We seem to be extending the amount of time
we spend in suffering.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.420
To spend more time healthy, that’s going
to take some heavy scientific lifting.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.180
Researchers from UCLA showed that by turning
on a single gene they could extend life by

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.340
30%.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.909
AMP-activated protein kinase helps get rid
of cellular garbage by promoting autophagy,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.020
or destroying sick or damaged cells.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
The story goes that over time our cells get
damaged as we age and it’s the build up

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.719
of these damaged cells that lead to age related
illnesses.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.159
The enzyme helps the body clean up all these
damaged cells.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.380
The researchers found that flies who had this
gene activated lived up to 30% longer and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.229
were healthier during their later days.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.289
Yet note that I said flies, this hasn’t
been proved in mammals yet.

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.829
Another way to boost your lifespan?

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.259
Caloric Restriction.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.670
For some reason rats who are fed shockingly
low number of calories, live up to 40% longer

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.439
than their peers.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.249
Scientists think a lack of glucose is responsible.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.140
Glucose occasionally binds to some of our
DNA, proteins and lipids, and stops them from

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.259
doing their jobs causing some disease.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.100
A restricted diet might prevent some of this
process.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.620
But there’s no evidence this works in humans
and it’s not recommended, for obvious reasons.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.500
Rather than starving yourself, could you pop
a pill?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.030
One FDA approved drug, Rapamycin, already
extends the lifespan and healthspan in mice

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.370
by 30%.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.550
But unfortunately it’s designed as an immunosuppressant.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.250
Knocking out your immune system could be a
pretty heavy price to pay for a chance at

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.250
a longer life.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.760
Yet recent research is working on blocking
the immunosuppressant qualities.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.940
And you can’t talk about immortality without
talking about telomeres.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.400
Telomeres are like the plastic tips on your
shoelaces, but for your DNA.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.910
Everytime DNA makes a copy of itself, the
telomeres get shorter.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.200
If they weren’t there at all, your DNA would
fray like a shoelace and cause age-related

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200
diseases.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.440
So what would happen if we could stop telomere
shortening?

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.790
Most of these possibilities only seem to extend
lifespan 10-30 years, which is not forever.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.620
But hey, I’ll take it.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.630
Geneticist Richard Cawthon thinks if we could
get rid of all aging processes and repair

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.890
cellular damage, humans could live up to 1,000
years.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.120
The question is - would you want to?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
What do you think?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.230

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.370
