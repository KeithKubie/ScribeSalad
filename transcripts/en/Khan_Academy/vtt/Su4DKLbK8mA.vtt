00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.690
So what I want you to
do is pause this video

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.480
and think about what fraction
the red part represents

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.010
in each of these shapes.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.840
Or what fraction of the whole
does the red part represent?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.700
And I also want to plot
it out on a number line,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.260
to plot that fraction as
a number on a number line.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.720
So let's go through
each of these.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.550
So in this pie
right over here, we

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.040
have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 equal sections.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.700
And 1 of those 5 equal
sections is shaded in.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.700
So we could say that 1/5
of this pie is shaded in.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.994
Now over here, we have 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:45.570
10 equal sections, and
2 of them are shaded in.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.917
So we could say that
2/10 are shaded in.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.000
And then, finally, right
over here, once again, we

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.010
have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10 equal sections, and 2

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.600
of them are shaded in red.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.340
So in this situation,
the red slices

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.330
represent 2/10 of the whole.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.080
And if we were to try to
plot this on a number line,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.430
so right over here, we do a
quick one right over here.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.865
Let me do it like this.

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:20.160
Let me make a big
number line here.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.234
And let's take the
section between 0 and 1,

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:25.900
that's what we want
to focus on, and I'm

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.310
going to divide it
into 5 equal sections.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.350
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 equal sections
and then that gets us to 1.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.160
So this right over here, 1/5,
that would be 1 out of the 5

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.880
equal sections.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.810
So that would get
us right over there.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.270
So this would be 1/5.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.940
Now, what I want to do, let me
copy and paste this same number

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.795
line since I've
already drawn it.

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:56.135
So copy and paste it.

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:59.320
So let me put it
right over here.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.810
But now, I'm going to divide
it into 10 equal sections.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.310
Let's see.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.570
Let me divide it into 10
equal sections on the top one.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:18.460
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.550
So I've divided it
into 10 equal sections.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.470
And I want to figure
out where 2/10 goes.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.700
So I'm going to go 2 of those
equal sections, so 1, 2.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.950
So once again, I've got
to that exact same point.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.040
So this 1/5 I could
also represent as 2/10.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.110
So I could represent this
as 2/10, this point right

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.872
over here.

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:41.330
And you might be
saying, hey, wait,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.500
but that means that those
are the same number.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.420
They're the exact same
point on the number line.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.570
And if you said that, you
would be absolutely correct.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.120
1/5 is equal to 2/10.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.470
They represent the
exact same number.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.370
And it makes sense
even when you visually

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.090
look at them as a
fraction of these pies.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.510
Here going from this slice to
this slice, if you were just

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.770
divide all of these
slices into 2,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:19.020
you see that you have the
exact same fraction shaded

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.719
in as this one right over here.

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.760
They've become identical.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.090
I didn't shade in anything else.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.589
I haven't taken any
of the red away.

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.720
I haven't any of the red.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.960
I just divided all of
those pieces of pie into 2.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.850
And so you see that the exact
same part of the whole pie

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.040
is shaded in.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.830
And here it's not
quite as obvious,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.780
but if you imagine taking
this, dividing it into 2

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.700
and then splitting them up
so that they look like this,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.314
you still have the same part
of the circle shaded in red.

00:03:49.314 --> 00:03:51.230
So it makes complete
sense that they represent

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.688
the same number on
the number line.

00:03:52.688 --> 00:03:55.600
That this number right over
here, it's not only 1/5,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.620
it also is 2/10.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.405
1/5 is equal to 2/10.
