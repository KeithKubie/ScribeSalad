00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 the beginning 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.920
 Which I try to do in some upcoming videos that I try to see what 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.780
 Will happen to an integrative line, either an integrative line (Tam) across through 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.870
 An inserted field or a vector field (having a size and direction), but what will happen to that complete line 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.370
 When we change the direction of our way? 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.560
 Well let's say, when I say change the direction I mean by it 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.820
 We have some curves (C) that look something like this 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.760
 We draw the axis (x) and axis (y) 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.180
 So this axial (y) is axial (x), let's say 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.560
 The medallion starts from here and the more it grows the more it ends 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.120
 Above as we have seen now 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.230
 So she moves in that direction 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.130
 When I say I will reverse the way we can 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.350
 Clarification and other curved determination 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.430
 Let's call it negative (C) like this we are drawing now 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.150
 This pivotal (y) is axial (x) 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.690
 They look quite similar to what we have already painted, but they start from here and beyond 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 The more you grow, the lower you go towards the starting point 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.370
 Of the other curve 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.320
 So the shape is exactly the same for the curved but moving 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.530
 Towards the opposite direction exhibitions 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.310
 So what I'm going to do in this video will be understanding how 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.490
 We can build such a proxy representation 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.010
 We hope that you will understand the way in the best way possible 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.320
 After this video we will present two topics and try to watch them 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 Effectively what does this command for the integrated line, once in the dual domain 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.850
 And once in the vector field 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.430
 So let's just say that mediating is correct here 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.630
 Let us just clarify it and know it in the basic way 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.500
 Which we have always known 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.540
 Let's say that this x is equal to x for t 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.280
 And y equals and equalizes the y of t, let's say this is equivalent to t 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.670
 Let us write it this way 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.695
 Starting from a is therefore greater than or equal to a 

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:42.290
 And then move towards the top towards b 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.070
 So in this example, this situation was when t was adjusted and equated with a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:55.000
 The point here is the x-coordinate of a, and the y-effect of a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 Here is the top when t is equal and equal to b is only a 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.870
 When we want to review what we saw before 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.270
 The review of the proxy representation will be when t is equal to b above 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.160
 This is the point x of b, and the y point of b 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.980
 Nothing new there 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.570
 Now we have these functions (functions) how we can build 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.140
 Another little representation here has the same shape 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.460
 But it starts from here 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.660
 So here I want t be equivalent to a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.600
 Let me change colors 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.570
 Let's change the current color to purple 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.460
 Well I want to t tie that, and I've been growing and growing 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.020
 So I want t equal to b 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.270
 So I want to move in the opposite direction 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.950
 So when t be equal to a, I want to make me 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.470
 X is for b, and y is for b 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.350
 When t equal a, I want b in each of these disciples? 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.150
 When t is equal to a, I want a coordinate 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
 x for a, and y for a 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.630
 Okay ? 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.770
 Do you notice that they are currently in conflict and disagreeing? 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.180
 Here t is the equivalent of a, x for a and y for a 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.700
 Here t equal our final point 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.460
 Now I am in this x coordinate for a, and y for a. 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.520
 So how can I build this 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.450
 Well when you think about, t equalize a we want 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.740
 Both of these depend on their estimation in b 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.210
 So what if we set x in this position to give negative C? 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.900
 What if we say x equals x and here we mean b 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.700
 x is equal to x of the same child 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.240
 In fact, I might have to type in a similar color 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.180
 x for .... but instead of putting t or a or t here sequentially 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.340
 What if you put a plus b 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.030
 Minus t there 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.520
 What will happen ? 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.010
 Well let's do it for y too 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:54.310
 Thus y, y will be equal to y for a plus b minus t 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.920
 a plus b will be t 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.600
 Here I use a different light yellow shade perhaps 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.180
 It will be a bit confused 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.030
 After all, what happens if we define and know this? 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.000
 When t is an equation for a, when t is a equation let's say that 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 The intermediary representation is also specific to the beginning of a 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.470
 And then go to b 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.040
 So let's just try and prove that 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.560
 Intermediary representation is something similar to this 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.070
 But it is heading in the opposite direction 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.950
 Or at least make this bitterly fixed in our minds intuitively 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.240
 So when t is an equation for a and when t is an equation for a, then x is equivalent to 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.350
 x for a plus minus a, right? 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.040
 This is when t is equivalent to a negative t or negative a 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.370
 Which would be equal to what? 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.960
 Well a minus minus a result is the x result for b. 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.280
 Concisely when t equals a, y will be equivalent to 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.840
 y for a plus b minus a 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.990
 The a will be deleted and the y result of b 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.860
 Well this was done. 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.480
 Now when t is equal a proxy representation will be estimated for 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.160
 X coordinate of b and y of b. 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.480
 When t is equal to a x of b and y of b. 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.210
 Then we can do the same thing when t is equivalent to b 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.450
 I will do it here because I do not want to lose this 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.690
 Let me just draw a line here 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.160
 I am still dealing with the intermediary representation of us 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.300
 In fact let me move to the right 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.380
 So that it does not mix with me 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.630
 When t is an equation for b when t equals b what will x equal? 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.310
 x is equal to a plus b minus b? 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.580
 a plus b minus b where t is equal to b 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.420
 So the result will be x for a 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.000
 When the result is so why is the overlap of a plus b 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.080
 Minus b and certainly the result will be y for a 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.410
 If the end point is effective and when you think about it intuitively 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.010
 Such as t increases when t be in a thing that will be 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.270
 x for b and y of b 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.990
 We see this here at the bottom 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.760
 Now the more t this value will decrease 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.340
 We start with x for b and y of b, and the higher t this value 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.640
 Will you fall for a true? 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.940
 Then start from b and head towards a 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.370
 This certainly starts from a and goes towards b 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.490
 So I hope this will give you an intuition of why 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.610
 This is the same curve as the one before 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.270
 It just goes completely in the opposite direction 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.570
 Now if you accept what you have said and explained 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.540
 That this is the same as the intermediary representation 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.770
 Only in the opposite direction 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.050
 I should not say the same representation 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.500
 But the same curve is heading in the opposite direction or the same way 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.700
 In the opposite direction 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.530
 In the next video I will see what happens 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:00.550
 When we appreciate this integrative line of x ds 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.760
 In return for this integrated line 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.020
 So this is a dual-line field of integrated dual domain 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.750
 We use this curve and this way but what will happen if 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:18.050
 What we have taken this integrative line across the same dual domain however 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.150
 We will do it across this road or the opposite direction 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.690
 This is what we will do in the next video 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.510
 And the next video we will do in the vector field 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.000
 End
