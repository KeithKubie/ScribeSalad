story so we won't clarify that we'll

story so we won't clarify that we'll
leave it ambiguous and I think the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
leave it ambiguous and I think the
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650
leave it ambiguous and I think the
ambiguity is important because you don't

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
ambiguity is important because you don't
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.450
ambiguity is important because you don't
know who the stranger is when you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
know who the stranger is when you
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.029
know who the stranger is when you
encounter them and it depends on whether

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
encounter them and it depends on whether
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.119
encounter them and it depends on whether
you're thinking about it in the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
you're thinking about it in the
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.709
you're thinking about it in the
normative manner or if you're thinking

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
normative manner or if you're thinking
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.090
normative manner or if you're thinking
about it in the transcendent manner

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
about it in the transcendent manner
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160
about it in the transcendent manner
because with each person that you meet

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.639
well they're just a person that's one
way of thinking about it and and then

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
way of thinking about it and and then
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.439
way of thinking about it and and then
they're the person that you know or

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
they're the person that you know or
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.229
they're the person that you know or
they're the person as they choose to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
they're the person as they choose to
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299
they're the person as they choose to
reveal themselves to you and people keep

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
reveal themselves to you and people keep
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.039
reveal themselves to you and people keep
themselves shielded but then they're

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
themselves shielded but then they're
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560
themselves shielded but then they're
also something of great metaphysical

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
also something of great metaphysical
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140
also something of great metaphysical
potential right and you might say well

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
potential right and you might say well
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.510
potential right and you might say well
do you believe that and I would say well

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
do you believe that and I would say well
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.420
do you believe that and I would say well
yes you believe it because you expect a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
yes you believe it because you expect a
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.039
yes you believe it because you expect a
lot from people generally speaking and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
lot from people generally speaking and

more importantly our entire culture is
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310
more importantly our entire culture is
predicated on the idea that each person

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
predicated on the idea that each person
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.039
predicated on the idea that each person
has an indefinite intrinsic worth and

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
has an indefinite intrinsic worth and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
I'm not talking about self-esteem I'm
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.710
I'm not talking about self-esteem I'm
talking about something like the what

what would you say it the implicit

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
what would you say it the implicit
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.210
what would you say it the implicit
presupposition in our legal structure

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
presupposition in our legal structure
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.190

that no matter who you are even if
you're a murderer even if you're a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
you're a murderer even if you're a
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969
you're a murderer even if you're a
condemned murderer that there's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
condemned murderer that there's
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740
condemned murderer that there's
something about you that's of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
something about you that's of
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719
something about you that's of
transcendent value that has to be

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
transcendent value that has to be
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760
transcendent value that has to be
respected by the law by the law and by

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
respected by the law by the law and by
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.679
respected by the law by the law and by
other people right and so that's that's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
other people right and so that's that's
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.550
other people right and so that's that's
a remark

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
a remark
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920
a remark
you might say well you know do I believe

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
you might say well you know do I believe
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.749
you might say well you know do I believe
that and the answer that is well yeah it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
that and the answer that is well yeah it
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730
that and the answer that is well yeah it
out because you follow the law and it's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
out because you follow the law and it's
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380
out because you follow the law and it's
not an easy thing to pull out of the law

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
not an easy thing to pull out of the law
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.850
not an easy thing to pull out of the law
it's kind of the idea that you have

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
it's kind of the idea that you have
 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.370
it's kind of the idea that you have
intrinsic natural rights and you don't

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
intrinsic natural rights and you don't
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.109
intrinsic natural rights and you don't
pull that out of our law man without

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
pull that out of our law man without
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.359
pull that out of our law man without
having the whole thing fall down and I

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
having the whole thing fall down and I
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.680
having the whole thing fall down and I
think the whole idea that you have

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
think the whole idea that you have
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.330
think the whole idea that you have
intrinsic natural rights is predicated

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
intrinsic natural rights is predicated
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.800
intrinsic natural rights is predicated
on something like the biblical

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810
on something like the biblical
 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.450
on something like the biblical
hypothesis that human beings have a low

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
hypothesis that human beings have a low
 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.420
hypothesis that human beings have a low
ghost nature and that we are involved in

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
ghost nature and that we are involved in
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.320
ghost nature and that we are involved in
the speaking forth of being and as

beings who are involved in this speaking
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.610
beings who are involved in this speaking
forth of being there's something about

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
forth of being there's something about
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.880
forth of being there's something about
us that has to be respected by ourselves

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
us that has to be respected by ourselves
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.490
us that has to be respected by ourselves
in relationship to ourselves by

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
in relationship to ourselves by

ourselves in relationship to other
people but even more strangely by

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
people but even more strangely by
 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.520

criminals even to vicious criminals you
 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.840
criminals even to vicious criminals you
can't remove that transcendent element

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850
can't remove that transcendent element
 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.360

and that's that to me that's also a
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.400
and that's that to me that's also a
mirror a miracle of conceptualization

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
mirror a miracle of conceptualization

without that you you have a very
barbaric legal system right because no

tough guy and so if strangers show up
 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.890
tough guy and so if strangers show up
and he welcomes them it's not because he

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900
and he welcomes them it's not because he
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.960
and he welcomes them it's not because he
couldn't do otherwise he could certainly

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970
couldn't do otherwise he could certainly
 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.699
couldn't do otherwise he could certainly
do otherwise and it's not because he

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709
do otherwise and it's not because he
 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.710
do otherwise and it's not because he
isn't aware of what people can be like

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720
isn't aware of what people can be like
 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.510
isn't aware of what people can be like
he's perfectly aware of what people can

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520
he's perfectly aware of what people can
 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.520
he's perfectly aware of what people can
be like but he determines to take a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530
be like but he determines to take a
 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.260
be like but he determines to take a
particular attitude towards them and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270
particular attitude towards them and
 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.350
particular attitude towards them and
that is to welcome them and so and why

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360
that is to welcome them and so and why
 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.180
that is to welcome them and so and why
would you do that and I think the answer

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190
would you do that and I think the answer
 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.050
would you do that and I think the answer
to that is you hold out your hand

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
to that is you hold out your hand
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.140
to that is you hold out your hand
entrust to someone and you evoke the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150
entrust to someone and you evoke the
 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.960
entrust to someone and you evoke the
best from them if that's their to be

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
best from them if that's their to be
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.690
best from them if that's their to be
given so it's an act of courage it's

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
given so it's an act of courage it's
 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.090
given so it's an act of courage it's
like it's it isn't me meeting you

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100
like it's it isn't me meeting you
 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.150
like it's it isn't me meeting you
exactly not exactly it's more like the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
exactly not exactly it's more like the
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.120
exactly not exactly it's more like the
transcendent part of me

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130
transcendent part of me
 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.320
transcendent part of me
making a gesture that allows the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330
making a gesture that allows the
 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.850
making a gesture that allows the
transcendent part of you to step forward

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860
transcendent part of you to step forward
 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.550
transcendent part of you to step forward
and that happens all the time it happens

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560
and that happens all the time it happens
 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.070
and that happens all the time it happens
all the time an enormity of discourse

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080
all the time an enormity of discourse
 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.570
all the time an enormity of discourse
you know this perfectly well because

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580
you know this perfectly well because
 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.520
you know this perfectly well because
sometimes you can have a real casual

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530
sometimes you can have a real casual
 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.990
sometimes you can have a real casual
conversation with someone that just goes

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000

would call that a deep conversation
 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.960
would call that a deep conversation

the craziest things because I'm actually
 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.310
the craziest things because I'm actually

and that that's a very useful thing to
 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.740
and that that's a very useful thing to
know too because one of the things

you didn't know and so what that means
 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.630
you didn't know and so what that means
is that you can treat the landscape of

is that you can treat the landscape of
 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.810
is that you can treat the landscape of
strangers as an endless vista of places

think that but but the part of the
catastrophe is is that they get what

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:18.610
catastrophe is is that they get what
 

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.179
catastrophe is is that they get what
they evoke and I'm not saying it's their

they evoke and I'm not saying it's their
fault precisely but it doesn't matter

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:23.049
fault precisely but it doesn't matter
 

00:10:23.049 --> 00:10:24.960
fault precisely but it doesn't matter
that's still what happens and so you

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:24.970
that's still what happens and so you
 

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.059
that's still what happens and so you
might ask yourself if you're not getting

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:27.069
might ask yourself if you're not getting
 

00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:30.030
might ask yourself if you're not getting
from people what you need there is some

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040
from people what you need there is some
 

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.639
from people what you need there is some
possibility that you're not approaching

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:32.649
possibility that you're not approaching
 

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:34.019
possibility that you're not approaching
especially if this happens to you

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:34.029
especially if this happens to you
 

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:36.090
especially if this happens to you
repeatedly across people and this is a

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.100
repeatedly across people and this is a
 

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.069
repeatedly across people and this is a
virtual certainty if it happens to you

00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079
virtual certainty if it happens to you
 

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:39.840
virtual certainty if it happens to you
repeatedly across people especially if

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:39.850
repeatedly across people especially if
 

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.699
repeatedly across people especially if
you have the same bad experience with

00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:41.709
you have the same bad experience with
 

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:45.150
you have the same bad experience with
people it's not them it's you I would

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160
people it's not them it's you I would
 

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.639
people it's not them it's you I would
say three is the limit if something

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:47.649
say three is the limit if something
 

00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:51.449
say three is the limit if something
happens to you once you write it off if

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:51.459
happens to you once you write it off if
 

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:53.879
happens to you once you write it off if
it happens to you twice it's like you

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:53.889
it happens to you twice it's like you
 

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:56.039
it happens to you twice it's like you
open your eyes but you write it off but

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:56.049
open your eyes but you write it off but
 

00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:58.470
open your eyes but you write it off but
if it happens to you three times it's

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480
if it happens to you three times it's
 

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.889
if it happens to you three times it's
probably you or it's the rest of the

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:01.899
probably you or it's the rest of the
 

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:05.129
probably you or it's the rest of the
world better it's you because you're not

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:05.139
world better it's you because you're not
 

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:08.429
world better it's you because you're not
going to change the rest of the world
