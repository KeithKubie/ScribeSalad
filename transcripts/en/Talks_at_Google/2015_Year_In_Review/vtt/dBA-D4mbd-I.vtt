00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:18.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: Shall we?

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.120
Which side would like to be on?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.056
OK, good.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.340
Well, good afternoon, and
it is my great privilege

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.030
to welcome a friend of
mine for some years.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.740
It's interesting that the
Secretary actually grew up

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.030
in North Carolina, and after
doing very well in school

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.840
in all the obvious ways,
ended up becoming a lawyer out

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.680
of a New York legal
system, and so forth.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.610
And at some point, he felt
the calling to go back.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.550
It's interesting, he became
the youngest mayor of Charlotte

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.960
in its history.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.740
And when he was
mayor, he actually

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.680
had a pretty big impact
on economic growth,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.080
because you foolishly
became the mayor

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.670
at the bottom of the recession.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.170
So--

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.190
ANTHONY FOXX: Only
one way to go.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.260
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
definitely going to go up.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.540
So because he
turned out to be one

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.970
of the most extraordinary
mayors in America,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.140
President Obama appointed him
Secretary of Transportation

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.780
about a year and half ago.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.450
And since then, the secretary
has been spending his time

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.150
basically figuring out how
to get transportation working

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.140
really, really well-- all
of the issues we care about.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.410
What I like about
the secretary is

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.270
he's a real
innovator-- he actually

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.040
cares about this stuff,
he's pushing hard,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.290
he's pushing hard to do all the
things to lead in our country.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.580
And I think, Mr. Secretary,
I should just say,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.330
welcome to Google.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.746
ANTHONY FOXX: Thank
you very much.

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:50.792
It's great to be here.

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:51.691
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:52.190
Thank you.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.148
Thanks for the welcome.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.530
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
for some reason,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.300
you're unveiling a
30-year program today

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.870
at Google, which has not
been around for 30 years.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.240
Tell us about your program.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.100
ANTHONY FOXX: Well,
periodically the Department

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.392
of Transportation has put
forth future outlooks,

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:17.375
a comprehensive look at the
future of transportation

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.820
in our country.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.630
And I can't think of a
better time, or frankly

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.340
a better place, because
our country is facing

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.470
some very, very
significant headwinds when

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.930
it comes to transportation--
population growth, climate

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.520
change, there's a
number of factors.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.300
And if we don't get ahead
of those challenges,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.880
we're going to find
ourselves stuck

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.750
in traffic for a long time.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.600
So rather than find ourselves
stuck because we didn't look

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.620
out far enough,
our thought process

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.060
is that we put these facts in
front of the American public,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.530
and then we spend time
working in Congress,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.530
working with state capitals,
and local communities--

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.760
city halls-- to figure
out how we move forward.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.880
So the plan, the idea here
is not to be prescriptive,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.610
it's to define the
problem, and let

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.680
the solutions
evolve organically.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
as part of this,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.200
you have to work
with Congress, right?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.300
Now, you were mayor--

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.260
Now, give me that big smile.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.100
As mayor-- mayor strikes
me as a pretty good job.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.060
It's a defined model, and you
clearly care a lot about people

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.240
that you serve.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.411
Here, you have to
get their approval.

00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:37.160
ANTHONY FOXX: Yes.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.340
ERIC SCHMIDT: So what's
your strategy for that?

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.520
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, look--
I think part of the strategy

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.720
is changing the nature
of the conversation.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.810
In Washington, there's
so much conversation

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.990
on surface transportation,
for example, about the Highway

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.010
Trust Fund, and the
fact that we have

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.469
four more months
of funding for it.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.926
ERIC SCHMIDT: By
the way, I did not

00:03:56.926 --> 00:03:59.120
know this until I was reading
about it-- the highway

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.240
transportation bill
expires in May?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.574
ANTHONY FOXX: It expires in May.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:04.156
ERIC SCHMIDT: What
happens after that?

00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:05.950
ANTHONY FOXX: Well,
what happens after that

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.740
is that state governments
across the country that

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.950
depend on these dollars
for highway funds

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.021
will either slow
or stop projects.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.770
That's essentially
what's going to happen.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.390
Now, right now the state
departments of transportation

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.240
are actually planning their
plan of work for the year,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.424
and the construction
season starts in about May.

00:04:24.424 --> 00:04:27.090
So if the funding runs out right
when they're supposed to start,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.700
you can guess that there are
going to be some problems.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.230
So it's a big issue.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.579
But the point is that we've
been talking in Washington

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.620
about getting the Highway
Trust Fund replenished.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.810
Well, what does that get you?

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.590
Well, what it gets you
is budgeting to a number,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.080
but it doesn't help
you budget to outcomes.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.370
And part of what we're
trying to define in this plan

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.090
are the types of
problems that are

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.050
going to impact the outcome.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.540
What are those problems?

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.630
Number one, how we move.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.100
We're changing how we
move in this country.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.660
As population starts
to concentrate around

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.110
metropolitan areas
around the country,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.630
and you start to
see more congestion,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.010
increasing travel
times, increasing--

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.260
it has implications on how
much money we need to invest,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.040
but also what it is we're
paying for with that money.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.210
Multi-modal systems are going
to be needed in the future.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.244
ERIC SCHMIDT: Multi-modal
meaning bus-- bus car, train.

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:23.160
ANTHONY FOXX: Choices.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.320
Yeah, just giving
people choices.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.380
How do we move things?

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.950
Freight?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.590
We obviously have
a lot of things

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.987
moving around this country
today by rail, by ship, by air.

00:05:35.987 --> 00:05:36.945
That's going to change.

00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:39.220
We're going to have a 60%
increase in truck traffic,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.420
we estimate, over
the next 30 years.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.350
We have technologies that
I know folks are working on

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.390
here, and elsewhere,
on unmanned aircraft.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.280
There's lots of ways
that we can attack

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.070
the problem of how
you move freight.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.760
But we need to figure
it out, and start

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.590
creating the rules of the road.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.460
How do we adapt to changing
weather patterns and climate

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.690
change-- building at a
more resilient level?

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.830
How do we integrate technology
in our transportation system,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.500
so that we can get
more utilization out

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.680
of what we have?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.560
And then, finally, how do we
align dollars and decision

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.120
making so that we can achieve
an optimum level of performance

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.850
in our system?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.308
ERIC SCHMIDT: I
was actually struck

00:06:19.308 --> 00:06:21.470
in reading the report--
the numbers are

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.700
so much larger than I thought.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.240
America's population will
grow by 70 million by 2045.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.550
These mega regions,
as you identify them,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.260
will have 75% of the US
population will be there.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.710
So this will become
the defining--

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.400
we think of America
as a rural country,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.620
but in fact, it's going to
be these mega regions that

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.410
will define most
people's experience.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.474
That you're concerned
about airline mergers

00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:46.890
and consolidation
of hubs actually

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.390
making the traffic at airports
worse, for all the reasons

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.200
that you can imagine.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.930
We have all of these issues
about pipelines and goods

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.030
and energy, and energies
in the wrong places.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.610
And you identify all
these in the report.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.114
How will these issues get
resolved in your judgment?

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:05.780
ANTHONY FOXX: Well,
the political system

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.900
has to respond,
that's part of it.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.460
But actually, the way that our
transportation system works,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.350
the control is
actually dispersed

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.520
among levels of government.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.700
So, for instance, most of
your bicycle and pedestrian

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.790
facilities are developed
at the local level,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.920
as are your transit systems.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.795
Your highway system is
mostly state driven.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.044
Your air traffic control
system is actually run

00:07:34.044 --> 00:07:35.960
by the federal government,
even though they're

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.310
commercial providers that
offer the airline service.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.694
And so, we have this
sort of [INAUDIBLE] chart

00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:46.790
of control over our
transportation system.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.680
And part of what the
report points out

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.630
is that, in order to build
the future that we probably

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.450
want to have-- which is one
where travel times decline,

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.180
you're able to get things
and people moved more quickly

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.950
and safely-- we're going to
have to have more coordination.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.770
And that's going to mean not
only the political solutions

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.330
at the federal, state, and local
levels-- funding and policy--

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.340
but it also means working very
closely with the private sector

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.124
to get it done.

00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:15.790
ERIC SCHMIDT: So let's
talk a little bit

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.620
about the
technological road map,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.742
and you talk about
this in the report.

00:08:21.742 --> 00:08:23.200
And you spent a
fair amount of time

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.908
at Google, and some
other tech companies,

00:08:24.908 --> 00:08:26.840
trying to understand that.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.710
I think it's worth
beginning by talking

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.290
about autonomous
cars, and all of that.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.591
You and I today
rode here in a car

00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:35.340
without a steering
wheel, which is, to me,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.460
always a heart attack moment,
and it worked just fine.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.370
ANTHONY FOXX: It did.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.060
My hair kind of stood
up a little bit.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: So, I think
our audience would probably

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.520
say, when will I be
in a self-driving car?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.130
When will I be in
an autonomous car?

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.690
When will the laws allow
me, do they allow it now?

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.260
There are all sorts of
questions like that.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.710
What's the process you
foresee-- and let's

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.430
pick cars, because
everybody here is a driver.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.190
How does the car get
smarter in your view?

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.230
ANTHONY FOXX: Well,
we have some things

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.370
we're doing now to try to help.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.800
We're trying to set a
regulatory framework for things

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.310
like vehicle to
vehicle technology.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.020
But the question
that you're asking

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.100
is actually one that I
think is really important,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.140
because the vehicle to
vehicle technology rules

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.110
estimated to take us three
to four years to create.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.790
And the rate of
change in technology

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.220
could happen much more
rapidly than that rule.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.490
And so, what we have
to do as governments,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.290
we have to work on two fronts.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.320
One, as technology
is being incubated,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.850
we need to find ways to be
at the table with the idea

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:54.600
creators so that we can help
you shape those technologies

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.350
in ways that will
actually gain faster

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.246
approval into the marketplace.

00:09:59.246 --> 00:10:00.870
The other piece of
it is, is that we've

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.250
got to look at our own
regulatory framework--

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.000
and this is not only
at the federal level,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.458
it's at the state
and local levels,

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:11.680
too, to make sure that we're
being as nimble and flexible

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.460
and adaptive as we
possibly can be,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.150
because that's what
the future's demanding.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.610
The fact of the matter is,
is our transportation system

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.370
isn't the old, creaky
system than it used to be.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:28.550
It actually can be a very
dynamic, innovative area.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.890
But if the regulatory system
is too slow or too antiquated,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.960
we're going to lose
opportunities to move forward.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.150
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
in Google's case,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.660
you're aware of our
car activities--

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.580
autonomous cars and so forth.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.086
Does the federal government
support-- this is essentially

00:10:46.086 --> 00:10:48.210
regulated by the states,
and the federal government

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.499
supports what we're doing.

00:10:49.499 --> 00:10:51.540
What concerns do you have
about what we're doing?

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.706
In other words, what's the
federal government's view

00:10:53.706 --> 00:10:55.640
of all of this initiative?

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.320
ANTHONY FOXX: Our main north
star on any new technology

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.670
is safety.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.570
And as long as we're
convinced that it's safe,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.940
first and foremost,
I think we, then,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.890
are then talking
about how do we go

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.020
through the process of
getting it certified

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.530
and out into the market place.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.600
From our perspective, I see a
lot of promise for automation

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.460
to do a lot of things
that we care deeply about.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.560
Number one, we've
seen an 80% reduction

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.500
in fatalities and accidents in
cars since 1960, mostly because

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.000
of--

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: Can
you repeat that?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.670
80%?

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.300
Eight zero?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.280
ANTHONY FOXX: 80%-- due,
in part, to technology.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.710
Now the technology
was everything

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.420
from the seat belt to
different lighting systems

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.990
in cars, and so forth.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.720
But we now believe that a lot
of the reductions in fatalities

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.690
and accidents that we
take for granted today

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.960
can be reduced with the
adoption of technology.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.240
So we're bullish on
technology, and I'm

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.190
part of the reason I'm
here is because we're here

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.520
to say that the Department
of Transportation

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.920
wants to lean in and try to
get more automation deployed.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.226
But of course, we've got to do
some homework on our end, too.

00:12:13.226 --> 00:12:15.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: Another area
that you are responsible for--

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.308
and I want to come
back to infrastructure

00:12:17.308 --> 00:12:18.910
at the end of my
questions-- has to do

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.502
with aviation, and so forth.

00:12:21.502 --> 00:12:23.210
There's lots of
questions about aviation.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.370
There's the free
flight programs,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.329
there's the
modernization of the FAA,

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:29.870
there's the whole
question of drones.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.890
So maybe let's start with
the drone AUV question.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.000
What is the status of
the law with respect

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.450
to personal and professional
use of drones-- AUVs-- what's

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.890
legal, what's not?

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.170
And then, as I
understand it, you

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.990
have a deadline to produce an
answer to some other questions.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.630
Take us through the agency's
view on all of this.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.420
ANTHONY FOXX: Currently,
commercial use

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:03.160
of unmanned aircraft is
banned, absent an exemption.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.780
And so, what the
FAA has designed

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.640
is an exemption process that,
on a case by case basis,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.760
reviews applications
that have come in.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.680
And we're seeing many
of them come through.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.910
We've allowed exemptions, for
example, in the movie industry,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.210
for the use of
unmanned aircraft.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.570
We also, simultaneously,
have been

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.220
working through the
development of what

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:33.150
we're calling a small, unmanned
aircraft rule that will provide

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.370
a lot more flexibility
for the commercial use

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.170
of these devices.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:43.142
And that is work that's
ongoing at DOT through the FAA,

00:13:43.142 --> 00:13:44.600
and, of course, at
the White House.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.256
And we're moving through that
process as quickly as we can.

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:50.130
We know the rules of
the road need to be set,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.500
so we can unleash
this information.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.333
ERIC SCHMIDT: And there's
a deadline, right?

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.960
The deadline is a
year or two from now?

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.880
ANTHONY FOXX: We're
hoping, actually,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.312
to do it sooner than that,
on the small [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:58.312 --> 00:13:59.895
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
so small means what?

00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:01.440
What's small?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.020
ANTHONY FOXX: We're
defining, mostly,

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.440
the height at which
these vehicles can go.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.540
And I don't think it's a
secret that we're talking, more

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.320
or less, about 400
feet and below.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: Think of
it as ground to 400 feet

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.077
would be reserved for or shared
with these sorts of devices.

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:23.660
Now there's a lot of rumors in
the aviation-- and as you know,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.450
I'm a pilot, so lots of rumors
in aviation about things--

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.569
there's a rumor that for, I'm
going to call them big UAVs,

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:32.860
heavy ones, they're actually
going to require something

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.210
like a pilot's license.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.716
Is that on the table?

00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:37.090
ANTHONY FOXX:
There is discussion

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.460
about how best to focus
on the larger ones.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.490
And we have not developed
an agency position--

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.400
that is a discussion that is
rich and robust and ongoing.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.960
But it becomes much
more complicated

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.820
when you're talking about
larger scale vehicles that

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.102
may compete at the same
levels as other aircraft.

00:14:58.102 --> 00:14:59.560
ERIC SCHMIDT: The
question is, if I

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.480
have a pilot-less
airplane, who is

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.730
the pilot in the
pilot-less airplane,

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.151
and the legal mechanisms,
are they above 400 feet?

00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:07.900
ANTHONY FOXX: Yes.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.890
And if you looked at some of
our exemptions, some of them

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.090
are ones in which the
applicant is actually

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.930
certified that someone
with a pilot's license

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.211
is going to be
utilizing aircraft.

00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:21.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: And again,
that's under the theory

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.530
of maintaining
separation, because you

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.210
don't want to hit these things.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.421
If we go back to
the FAA, there is--

00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:30.920
and you and I have
spoken about this

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.790
before-- there has been
a long-standing effort

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.540
to modernize the air
traffic control system.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.520
And I'll just say,
it's generally

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.760
known that the
computers were basically

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.153
invented in the Stone Age,
which is roughly the 1980s,

00:15:44.153 --> 00:15:47.010
and at Google that's
like they weren't alive.

00:15:50.874 --> 00:15:52.790
And there were discussions
about vacuum tubes,

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.530
I mean we're talking about
seriously primitive things.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.030
And you've inherited
this structure.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.650
There are serious proposals
how to modernize that.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.260
Where is that process?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.020
Is it funded?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.770
What are the steps,
that kind of thing?

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.740
ANTHONY FOXX: Frankly,
we're talking about NextGen.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.580
The funding for
NextGen has actually

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.580
been below what was
originally intended.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.330
And, frankly, for a
little while there, it

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.370
was moving behind schedule.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.920
And when this
administration started,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.810
the FAA actually recalibrated
the scheduled for NextGen.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.300
And despite the fact
that we have less money

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.730
to devote to it, we've actually
managed to keep that schedule.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:43.250
And so most of the back
office set up for NextGen

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.870
has actually been put in place.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.570
We are now starting to roll out
things like optimized profile

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.170
descents-- doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue--

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.290
but it basically means
the planes can glide down

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.150
into a landing.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.910
And that is being used
at the Houston airport,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.791
the Washington area airports,
are now using that system,

00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:05.540
and we're looking
forward to rolling those

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.849
out more around the country.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:11.730
But that is a NextGen type
of strategy and tactic

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.560
that we are starting to see
happen out in the world.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.226
ERIC SCHMIDT: And the
key decision there

00:17:16.226 --> 00:17:19.155
was to assume the GPS
was highly reliable.

00:17:19.155 --> 00:17:20.740
The GPS enables all of those.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.650
ANTHONY FOXX: Bigger
picture-- we have a 1940 radar

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.150
system that has relatively
imprecise tracking

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.190
ability of our airplanes.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.030
And as a result of that, we have
to have the airplanes flying

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.870
at wider separations.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.500
When we get to more precise
tracking of the airplane using

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.340
GPS, we can actually move the
airplanes closer together.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.450
We can do things like the
optimized profile descents.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.440
And it saves huge
amounts of fuel,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.427
saves huge amounts of time,
and money out of the system.

00:17:51.427 --> 00:17:53.760
And hopefully that will get
passed on to consumers some,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.310
too.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.780
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
the other thing

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.660
is if you go back to
your 30-year report,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.390
you're pointing out that the
crowding in these cities,

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.210
those airports are
inside those cities.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.330
So you're going to have even
greater conflict over noise,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.410
use, and how do I
get to the airport,

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.050
all those kinds of
things will become--

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.952
ANTHONY FOXX: Absolutely.

00:18:09.952 --> 00:18:11.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: I wanted
to ask about the Highway

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.743
Transportation Safety
Agency, because that's

00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:15.830
an independent agency
that reports in to you,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.560
is that correct?

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.370
ANTHONY FOXX: Yes.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.869
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
how does that work?

00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:21.520
What are they telling
you about the state

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.304
of safety improvements?

00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:25.970
Is there something
interesting that they

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.900
have-- are they
more investigative?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.620
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, they
both track safety trends,

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:41.380
regulate mostly automobile
companies and manufacturers,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.337
and they do track how we are
doing when it comes to safety

00:18:45.337 --> 00:18:46.920
and they give us
suggestions from time

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.570
to time on things we
can do differently.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.540
The effort towards
reducing distracted

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.859
driving, for example,
is one that NHTSA--

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:56.150
ERIC SCHMIDT: That means I'm
texting while I'm driving.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.250
ANTHONY FOXX: Texting
while you drive.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.208
ERIC SCHMIDT: You don't
recommend that anymore.

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.100
ANTHONY FOXX: I don't
recommend that, no.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.050
Although interestingly,
one of the capabilities

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.500
NextGen will give
us is the ability

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.910
for pilots not to have to
have an auditory communication

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.260
with air traffic control,
but actually to be texting.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.680
So it's OK to text
while you're flying,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.340
but when you're driving,
not a good idea.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.550
But anyway, we are
starting to really focus in

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.730
on how can we reduce fatalities
in different ways going

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.230
forward.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.922
And that's why technology
plays such a big role, here.

00:19:29.922 --> 00:19:32.130
ERIC SCHMIDT: So I thought
I'd ask my final question,

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.110
then get to audience and-- we're
being broadcast all around-- so

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.000
lots of questions
from around the world.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.230
I think the question that's
on a lot of people's minds

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:48.340
is why is the infrastructure
in America falling behind?

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.120
And this is not a
new problem, it's

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.980
been going on for
a very long time.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.340
But many people believe
the infrastructure budgets,

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.460
the spending, and I
look at it, and I think,

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.840
interest rates are at huge lows,
the return on infrastructure,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.980
I think, would arguably
be very high-- think

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.250
about the interstate
highway system of the '50s,

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.290
and so forth-- so if
you're going to spend money

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.980
on infrastructure, this
is a pretty good time

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.050
to be doing it.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.620
So why are we in
this constant debate?

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.380
And you mentioned
earlier this expiration

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.830
in May of funding, which
is, I think-- that's all

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.780
funded through a gas tax, right?

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.980
So what's wrong here?

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.110
Do we not care about
infrastructure anymore

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.914
as a country/

00:20:29.914 --> 00:20:32.080
ANTHONY FOXX: I don't think
that it's we don't care.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.920
And in fact, what
I've noticed as I've

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.450
talked to members of Congress
is that on a bipartisan basis,

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.250
people realize that we've
got to do something.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.400
But it is a question of
what that something is.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.700
And that is why this framework
that we're introducing today

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.700
is so important.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.490
The country has
basically been riding

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.140
on cruise control with our
system for quite awhile.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.910
And the highway system
that was substantially

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.690
completed in 1992,
the expectation

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.430
was, well, we've
got that done, we're

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.910
ready to move onto
the next thing.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.920
The air traffic control
system has basically

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.570
been the same
since World War II.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.580
And meanwhile,
the rate of change

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:23.000
in terms of where people are
moving, how people are choosing

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.654
to live more closely into
metro areas-- as opposed

00:21:26.654 --> 00:21:28.570
to rural areas, which
is different than it was

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.340
40 years ago-- all these
changes are happening,

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.970
and our system is
basically static.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.380
And the debates we
have about funding

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.640
are really debates about
trying to get to last year's

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.210
funding, as opposed to looking
out for a longer window

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:47.080
and working your way backwards
to result-oriented investments.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.270
So I think that the
will is still there,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.400
folks who are stuck in
traffic right now someplace

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.220
in the country certainly want
to see a solution happen.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.270
But I think the problem
is that no one knows

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.804
what the next thing is.

00:22:02.804 --> 00:22:04.720
And I think that when
we talk about the trends

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.220
in this report, it gives
people a window that, you know,

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.730
we can actually
choose the future.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.830
Just like the folks
who said, you know,

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.770
the airplane can actually work.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.300
Folks probably thought they
were crazy, when the air traffic

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.160
system was first established.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.240
But it's been a huge return
on investment to this country,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.030
and I think those
technology innovations

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.224
are out there in the offing.

00:22:26.224 --> 00:22:27.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's hope so.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.570
Let me just remind our audience
that this is on the record,

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.850
and there are members of
the press in attendance.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.420
And we have a couple
microphones here

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.079
for people's questions
on this or anything else.

00:22:39.079 --> 00:22:40.620
I'll ask you the
first question which

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.905
was submitted-- we have
an internal systems which

00:22:42.905 --> 00:22:47.381
asks questions-- which is,
quote, "Why is the quality,

00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:49.880
convenience, and affordability
of public transport in the US

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.200
so far behind developed
countries in Asia and Europe?"

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.370
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, let's see.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.840
Let me try to answer this
in very plain English.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:08.100
The first reason is that much of
the responsibility for planning

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.070
public transportation
comes at the local level.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.380
So in highly congested
parts of the country,

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.690
where folks are flummoxed by the
amount of just pure automobile

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.150
traffic, they tend to
figure out that they

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.950
need to come up with
some other options,

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.670
and that's how transit
agencies really get going.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.980
But we don't control
whether a community decides

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.650
to invest in transit or not.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.990
That's a local decision.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.650
So that's one thing.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:41.220
Secondly, we spend, out
of the highway trust fund,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.180
about 20% of the dollars
in public transit.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.120
And that has to pick up not
only urban transit, but also

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.640
rural transit, as well.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.640
So it has to pick up
everything that we invest in,

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.220
fundamentally.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.520
That's also a challenge
when you have a country that

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.200
is increasingly more
concentrated in more

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.250
highly congested places.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:08.650
The third piece is that in terms
of how public transportation

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.180
becomes necessary, there
is a growing recognition

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.949
that land use plays a
role in that congestion

00:24:15.949 --> 00:24:16.990
that we're talking about.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.550
And when you have vertical,
dense development,

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.790
you have a greater need for
that kind of transit investment

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.590
then you do when you
have sprawled green field

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.870
growth, where growth
is more dispersed

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.605
and it's hard to
connect those assets.

00:24:30.605 --> 00:24:31.980
ERIC SCHMIDT: It
just seems to me

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.910
that when these cities
were built, somehow

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.600
they were willing to
build the subways.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.614
And now you can't
get a subway built.

00:24:37.614 --> 00:24:39.155
ANTHONY FOXX: It's
almost impossible.

00:24:39.155 --> 00:24:40.280
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
there's something

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.060
about the cities which need the
most amount of infrastructure

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.440
building, for whatever internal
political reasons, can't do it.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.460
Now you match 90% of
the money in many case?

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.210
ANTHONY FOXX: For
transit, we will usually

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.490
match somewhere around 50%,
maybe a little higher, maybe

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.270
a little lower.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.102
For highways, it
ranges, depending

00:24:59.102 --> 00:25:00.060
on the different state.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:06.410
I think in California, you
all are about 80% or 90%

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.645
local and state funding,
versus 10% to 20% federal.

00:25:10.645 --> 00:25:12.520
ERIC SCHMIDT: So money
maybe the other issue.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.900
Because as you know, as
a mayor, getting money

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.860
for this sort of
stuff is hard to get.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.740
Next question is-- and you'll
hear a theme from Googlers

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.650
about where Google
operates-- "The popularity

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.920
and scale of the
Google buses highlights

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.590
a severe shortage of
public transportation.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.420
What can and should be done for
non-car based transportation

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.540
solutions?

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.630
If everyone on 101
was taking a bus,

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.800
there would be a bus
every few seconds."

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.520
And for your
background, I believe

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.840
we operate the largest
private bus system in America,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.960
in terms of the number
of people that we move.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.380
And it's the only way to deal
with the fact that we want

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.050
our employees roughly here and
in a couple of other locations,

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.860
and they're spread out.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.700
And it's been a huge success.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.770
Now, the buses are-- you have
to use your badge to get in,

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.480
they have, of course, very
high-speed networking in them,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.140
and people work on the bus.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:09.980
ANTHONY FOXX: Well,
look-- congestion

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.570
forces folks to think
about different options.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:17.200
And the importance of having
those options available

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.300
can't be underscored.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.910
I think public transportation,
public transit,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.650
is one of those answers.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.310
But I don't think
it's the only answer.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:29.960
I think there are other types
of uses they can be employed.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.600
If you had a shorter distance
to go from, for instance,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.860
the Bay Area to
here, you might have

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.960
a bicycle path that
got people here.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.690
We're seeing that
kind of thing happened

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.530
in some regions of the
country, where bike is actually

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.160
the way people commute.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.660
So we need to use all of the
system, all the different ways

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.690
you can get around.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.780
ERIC SCHMIDT: The next
question is so aggressive,

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.050
I have to ask it
to you before we

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.096
get the audience's questions.

00:26:55.096 --> 00:26:56.221
ANTHONY FOXX: I can't wait.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.250
ERIC SCHMIDT: Welcome to
Google. "Acela Express,

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.270
Boston to Washington,
456 miles in seven hours;

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:08.260
TGV, Paris to Marseilles,
536 miles in three hours,

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.120
seven hours in 1962.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:15.731
Is Joe Biden the only one who
loves trains in Washington?"

00:27:15.731 --> 00:27:18.230
ANTHONY FOXX: I'm glad you know
that Joe Biden loves trains.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.100
I'm going to go tell him that
you all know he loves trains.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.020
I'm a little hurt that you don't
know that I love trains, too.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.480
I love trains.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.810
But, look, we have,
in our country,

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.440
with the Northeast
Corridor, I'm told

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.230
that there are three turns
on the Northeast Corridor

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.580
that if you could
straighten, would enable

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.350
us to run at much higher
speeds than we do today.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.420
I don't know if we
could get to 500 miles,

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.900
but certainly appreciably
more than we can.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.590
And the reason why
that is tough is

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.230
because you have very
expensive real estate that

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.630
surrounds that corridor.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.670
So it could cost anywhere-- it
could be billions of dollars

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.370
just to acquire the right
of way to make that change.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.630
But the point here
is this-- I do

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.530
think we're going to see
high-speed rail happen

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.360
in this country.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.630
You're going to see it happen
right here in this area.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:16.360
I'm seeing some
activity in Texas

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.232
and in Florida
that encourages me

00:28:18.232 --> 00:28:19.940
that this is going to
be something that's

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.470
going to happen in this country.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.470
And hopefully we can get it all
connected together over time.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.407
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:28:26.407 --> 00:28:28.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I work
on self-driving cars,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.755
but I'm concerned about much
simpler ways of getting around.

00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:34.360
And it seems like a
lot of governments

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.220
deliberately, or
inadvertently, discourage

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.140
pedestrians and other
means of transport.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.220
And two examples, LA
did a study awhile back

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.510
that found a correlation between
cross walks and pedestrian

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.600
fatalities, so they
instituted a policy

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.580
of getting rid of cross walks,
which seems a little backwards.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.847
ERIC SCHMIDT: Really?

00:28:51.847 --> 00:28:53.930
AUDIENCE: Also, I got here
by electric skateboard,

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.190
which is technically
illegal in California

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.330
due to a law from the '80s.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.330
And in general, I
know a lot of people

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.320
who take their kids
to school by car, even

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.975
though it's a few blocks away.

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.600
I think there could
be a lot of benefit

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.730
by people using their legs, and
getting places without cars.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.930
Is their a role for
the federal government

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:17.320
to prevent local governments
from discouraging pedestrians,

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.080
and would you like to do that?

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.890
ANTHONY FOXX: I think
bicycle/pedestrian work

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.630
is incredibly important for the
Department of Transportation

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:28.581
to engage in.

00:29:28.581 --> 00:29:30.330
And it's been, actually,
one of the things

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.390
I brought from being a mayor.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.430
As I was leaving my city
to come to Washington,

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.040
we actually were experiencing
an uptick in pedestrian

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.090
and bicycle deaths, and
it's a passion of mine

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.000
to try to make the
world safer for folks

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.780
that are walking and biking.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.502
What can we do at
the federal level?

00:29:47.502 --> 00:29:48.210
Couple of things.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.500
Number one, we have the
ability to pull together

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.980
best practices, and help
local communities that

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.850
are spending probably 70% of
the dollars that are invested

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.610
in pedestrian and bicycle
assets even better,

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.980
so that they're using
the collective knowledge

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.140
around the country to
make those investments.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.130
We also are engaging
in an information

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.760
exchange with America's mayors.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.850
I launched an effort to
challenge America's mayors

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.300
to focus on this, and
we're serious about it,

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.840
and I think we're going to
get some good work done.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.830
Your question about that
skateboard and the rules

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.310
gets back to a point
I was making earlier,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:27.640
which is that I do think we
have to look at our own rule

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.140
and regulation processes
at the federal, state,

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.200
and local levels, and look at
the country we're walking into,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.360
and focus a little
less on the country

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.286
that we had 20 or 30 years ago.

00:30:40.286 --> 00:30:41.660
It was a great
country then, it's

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.243
going to be a great country in
the future, but it is changing,

00:30:44.243 --> 00:30:45.500
and we have to change with it.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.510
By the way, my kid would
love that skateboard.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:49.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:49.830
ANTHONY FOXX: Thank you.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.270
AUDIENCE: Hi there, I
have a question about apps

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.630
like Uber and Lift, some
of these ride-sharing

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.130
technologies-- what are your
thoughts on how those are going

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.405
to play out in the next 30
years that you've laid out

00:31:00.405 --> 00:31:01.860
in this plan?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.580
ANTHONY FOXX: You know, I think
those companies are introducing

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.430
a disruptive force in
conventional ride sharing

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.520
through taxis.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.440
It may turn out that it's
like FedEx and UPS have been

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.870
to the United States
Postal Service,

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.630
and providing a level
of competition that

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.390
starts to change the
conventional industry

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.490
in productive ways.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.480
There's still some issues
that have to be addressed,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.100
and will be addressed at
the state and local levels

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.260
around how Uber
and Lift integrate

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.760
with the rest of the system.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.370
But I'm encouraged
to see entrants

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:46.020
coming into the transportation
space, introducing new ideas,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.220
finding new ways to put people
to work, and grow the economy.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.020
It's really, really neat.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.450
ERIC SCHMIDT: What's interesting
is that-- in disclosure,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.709
Google is a part owner of Uber--

00:31:56.709 --> 00:31:58.250
ANTHONY FOXX: Oh,
I take it all back.

00:32:02.495 --> 00:32:04.120
ERIC SCHMIDT: Uber
actually has a pitch

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.650
where we talk about reducing
the number of cars on the road

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.230
by virtue of ride
sharing, and so forth.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:14.570
So, I'm still sort of depressed
about the math in your report,

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.670
this infrastructure, I'm
going to call a deficit.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:21.227
Uber and Lift are a
mechanism to make it better.

00:32:21.227 --> 00:32:22.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.060
ANTHONY FOXX: Thank you.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.127
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:32:24.127 --> 00:32:26.210
AUDIENCE: The more we use
electronics and highways

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.570
for things like
tolling, the harder they

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.280
become to use for visitors.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.780
Different regions have
different systems.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.970
And, as a visitor from
outside the region,

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:44.240
there are certain roads and
lanes that I cannot take

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.760
at all, in many cases.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.600
How is that not a barrier
to interstate commerce?

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.970
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, look, this
is getting back into the fact

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:57.730
that most of our road
systems are state based.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.860
And you could see,
and probably do see,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.170
situations where a given
toll-way system that's

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.680
used in one state may not
work as well in another state,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.420
or at all.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.160
Sure there are
challenges that that

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.600
poses to people who
are passing through,

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.499
but who don't happen to live
in that particular state,

00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:21.040
but a lot of these
systems are really

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.980
developed for people who use
those systems every day, as

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:29.110
opposed to folks that are
traveling from some other place

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.770
to some other place.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.030
I think this is a
question that currently

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.620
has to be addressed
at the state level,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.310
not necessarily at
the federal level.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.260
But I think it also
speaks to the fact

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.640
that there are areas that we
talk about in this report that

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.690
probably do need greater
federal attention.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.320
One of them happens
to be our freight

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:56.020
system in having a real set of
national goals around freight

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.960
that states and local
governments help us actualize.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.571
ERIC SCHMIDT: This is truck
freight, or rail freight?

00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:03.820
ANTHONY FOXX: Both, all of it.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.710
Because all of it
is interdependent.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:11.150
And in order to make
it all work seamlessly,

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.860
and to realize the
potential of this century,

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.300
we're going to have to
make our freight systems

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.124
work more seamlessly.

00:34:18.124 --> 00:34:20.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go
ahead, thank you.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.679
AUDIENCE: Given the
reality of limited funding

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.250
available at all
levels of government,

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.080
what role should
the private sector

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.980
play in funding major
capital improvements

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.025
for public infrastructure?

00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:34.949
For instance,
bringing light rail

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:38.770
to this area, North Bay Shore,
or of capacity improvements

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.120
for Cal Train.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:49.620
And should the government
incentivize private investment

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.931
in public infrastructure?

00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:52.389
ANTHONY FOXX: Look,
I think there's

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.520
a bright future for
public/private partnerships

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.110
in transportation.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:03.560
And it has to be part of what
we add to the use of tools

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.530
that we have available to deal
with the infrastructure deficit

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.620
that Eric was talking about.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.840
Candidly, not every
project is going

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.630
to be one the private sector
is going to want to finance.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.200
And the most important
distinction here is to realized

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.490
that for most of our
grandparents' and parents'

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:27.329
generation, infrastructure was
basically government funded.

00:35:27.329 --> 00:35:29.620
And there's a difference
between funding and financing.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:35.560
So whatever projects we
come up with that obtain

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.130
private funding have to have
some revenue that spins off

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.490
to repay that
investment, and that's

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:46.620
why we'll see a small number of
projects actually be attractive

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.920
to the private sector.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.850
But they will likely
be large-scale projects

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.260
that spin off some
type of revenue.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.510
Ports are an area
where there are

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:59.070
a lot of public/private
partnership opportunities.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.580
Highways, to some extent, and
we're even seeing some activity

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.530
around high speed rail
in Florida and Texas

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.867
that looks promising.

00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:09.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.699
ANTHONY FOXX: Thank you.

00:36:10.699 --> 00:36:12.720
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.410
AUDIENCE: In certain
cities in China,

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:19.350
the congestion has become so
bad that the city is forced

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.514
to limit the amount of
cars the residents can buy.

00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:24.180
They have to go through
a lottery system

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.612
now in some cities, if
they want to buy a car.

00:36:27.612 --> 00:36:29.070
Going to the future
for the States,

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.190
do think with 70
more million people,

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.860
and more concentrating
in the urban areas,

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.880
do you think the US solution
for decreasing congestions

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.530
might have to be somewhat
more restrictive as well,

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.747
and whether that be at
local or federal level?

00:36:42.747 --> 00:36:44.330
ANTHONY FOXX: It's
really interesting.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:50.650
I doubt we'll get to a point
where the American public will

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:56.500
want to limit the acquisition
of vehicles in that way.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.430
But what we are seeing with
the younger generation,

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:03.690
the millennials, is a trend
towards fewer of them actually

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.730
buying a car, more of them
moving into these densely

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.200
populated metro areas, making
use of bicycle and pedestrian

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.230
facilities.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.830
And more of them
using ride-share

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.910
as a way of making the
trip to the grocery store,

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.700
or what have you.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.560
This generation is an
important generation,

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.590
because there are
more millennials

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.180
today in the country
than there are boomers.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.010
So it is a big group.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:34.560
And they're going to be driving
the market in a lot of ways.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.830
And if their activities today
are portent of the future,

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:39.780
it may mean that folks
are just choosing

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.190
not to buy as many
cars in the future.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.120
ERIC SCHMIDT:
Speaking as a boomer,

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.331
it goes downhill from here.

00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:47.580
These millennials, there's
just more and more of them,

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.556
and fewer and fewer of us.

00:37:49.556 --> 00:37:51.930
But let me push you on this,
because one of our employees

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.050
says, "What's your
stance on using policy

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:58.250
to decrease urban sprawl, an
arguably outdated model that

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.570
contributes greatly
to climate change?"

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.610
How far should
the government go?

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.822
Your answer so far
has been, the reality

00:38:04.822 --> 00:38:06.280
is that a lot of
this stuff is done

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.181
at the state and civic level.

00:38:08.181 --> 00:38:10.180
Do you think that you and
the federal government

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.638
should take a
tougher line on this,

00:38:11.638 --> 00:38:14.660
given that it's such
a massive issue?

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.530
ANTHONY FOXX: I think that the
federal government's best place

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:22.240
here is to have programs
that are flexible enough

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.440
to help communities
that are grappling

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.820
with this problem in smart ways.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.310
So one of the things-- we
introduced some legislation

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.900
last year, today the
president announced

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:38.560
his budget contains a six-year
transportation funding

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.300
approach that will substantially
increase the amount of money

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.150
in public transit, for
instance, so that we can build

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:49.040
for the future and
deal with this problem.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.990
I do want to say though,
that at the local level,

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.850
there's a real
important imperative

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:59.820
to connect transportation
and land use.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:05.350
In other words, if we build
another highway lane to manage

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:09.040
the capacity that exists today,
and then the local government

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.820
then zones in twice
the population there,

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.130
guess what's going to happen
to that extra lane now,

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.940
it's going to get re-congested.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.440
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
in fact, there's

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.480
an interesting statistic
in traffic studies

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.540
that whenever you
add more highways,

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.200
the commute stays 30
minutes on average--

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.660
that the sprawl adjusts.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.650
So if you just
build more highways,

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.280
you don't really
change the outcome.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.260
Go ahead.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.040
AUDIENCE: I guess, thank
you for being here.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.290
Could you reflect on the
role of the marketplace

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.090
to decide versus the
role of the government

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.320
to mandate innovations
in safety and efficiency

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.090
for transportation
and urban planning,

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.370
as it impacts transportation?

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.450
ANTHONY FOXX:
Here's how we do it,

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.300
and then I'll try to
answer your question

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.540
from a normative position.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.380
The way we do it
is, you say, I've

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.140
got a great, smart, new
idea to make vehicles safer.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.900
And then you come in, and you
meet with our team at NHTSA,

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.770
we go and put it through the
paces, and at the end of it

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.030
we either say one
of three things.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.770
Yeah, you're right,
this is great, go do it.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.990
No, it's not quite
right, and here's why.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:32.030
Or we've got some questions
that we need to ask you,

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.760
the testing is
incomplete, we need

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.270
to come back and
have more study on.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.890
That's the way the
system basically works.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:46.020
Now, our goal is to do for the
automobile what the Consumer

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.720
Product Safety committee
does for the toys

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.450
that your kids use, which is
that when you buy something,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:57.510
you can have a confidence
level that it's actually safe.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.580
I think that's the right
place for us to be.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.977
It's not a desire to
inhibit innovation,

00:41:03.977 --> 00:41:05.935
it's a desire to make
sure that what's promised

00:41:05.935 --> 00:41:06.870
is what's delivered.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.772
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you, let's--
we have all of these questions,

00:41:12.772 --> 00:41:13.730
and then we'll wrap up.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.130
So let's pick it up.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:15.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.258
AUDIENCE: Secretary
Foxx, thank you

00:41:17.258 --> 00:41:18.570
for your emphasis on safety.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.070
I think under your
leadership, we're

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.720
hearing the feds talk much more
about safety in transportation.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.511
And I know we're seeing
at the local level,

00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:27.090
from San Francisco to New
York City to Fort Lauderdale,

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.800
an emphasis on
the idea of Vision

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.250
Zero, the goal of
setting zero traffic

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.030
fatalities and severe injuries.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.300
We know that with increasing
technological abilities

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:40.150
with design, know how, and
with policies in place,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.750
we can, if not
decrease completely,

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.300
decrease significantly traffic
fatalities and severe injuries.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.200
What can the federal level do
to support communities, again,

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.560
like San Francisco
to New York City, who

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.420
want to really prioritize
every traffic decision based

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.417
on safety?

00:41:55.417 --> 00:41:57.000
ANTHONY FOXX: That's
a great question.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And we've done quite a bit,
not only under my tenure,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.330
but previous secretary
Ray LaHood's tenure,

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.410
to really focus on
pedestrian safety.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.230
When Mayor DeBlasio
from New York

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.890
announced his Vision
Zero campaign,

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.850
and we had a TIGER grant
process, $600 million,

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:22.524
of basically race to the top
money for transportation,

00:42:22.524 --> 00:42:24.440
we got a great application
from New York City,

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.800
and put $25 million into helping
them achieve Vision Zero.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.170
So we're investing in
helping communities deal

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.340
with this issue.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.850
Let me say this,
too-- that it is not

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.090
just densely populated
urban communities

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.630
that are having a problem
with pedestrian deaths

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:41.740
and accidents.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.140
It's also in our rural
communities, too.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.210
And we've got to
figure out solutions

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:48.860
that address both
of those areas.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.590
But you can count on us to be
very sensitive to this when

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.080
it comes to our
discretionary grant programs,

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.000
when it comes to the work that
we're doing on best practices

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.580
with local communities,
and frankly,

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:06.416
as it relates to how we help
even transit systems get built

00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:08.790
in a way that are going to
protect pedestrians as they're

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.770
trying to get to those
transit facilities.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:13.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think it's true
that more than 30,000 people

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.387
die on America's
highways every year.

00:43:15.387 --> 00:43:16.970
And there's more
than a million people

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:21.230
who die in cars and car-related
accidents globally every year.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.700
Every one of those is a
family and a terrible tragedy.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.650
Go ahead.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.380
AUDIENCE: In your Beyond
Traffic report, and a number

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.670
of other recent
publications, we've

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:33.880
been hearing more and more
about unmanned aerial systems.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.130
And I'd love to get more of
your thoughts about what role

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.540
you think they'll play in
these future multi-modal

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.592
transportation systems, and in
the smart cities of the future.

00:43:43.592 --> 00:43:45.050
ANTHONY FOXX: It's
a good question,

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.930
and we reference
unmanned aircraft systems

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.860
as part of our report here.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.720
And we think it holds
tremendous promise.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.740
Look, every year during
the holiday season,

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.340
my wife will sit
down and she will

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:06.516
start going online and
getting stuff for folks.

00:44:06.516 --> 00:44:08.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's OK, you
can say she uses Google.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.944
ANTHONY FOXX: I was having
so much trouble saying that.

00:44:14.944 --> 00:44:16.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: We're
among friends.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.550
ANTHONY FOXX: We're
among friends.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:25.970
You know, look, at some level,
you say, gosh, I saved a trip.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.310
I didn't go to the mall.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.030
I didn't go to the store and
actually look at the stuff,

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.380
I just bought it online,
so what a great thing

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.010
I'm doing for the environment.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.220
But, you know,
whatever you bought

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.140
has to get to you somehow.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.510
And so that stuff is
moving, and we're still

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.550
trying to understand the
impacts of e-commerce

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.860
on the overall impact on
miles traveled in the system.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.180
What something
like UAS introduces

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:58.030
is a way to deal with the
fact that a trip is still

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:01.070
happening today on the roadways.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:03.720
And if they're able to
create another platform

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.015
to make that trip happen,
there are implications.

00:45:06.015 --> 00:45:07.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: It
really does have

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:08.556
an impact on infrastructure.

00:45:08.556 --> 00:45:11.530
ANTHONY FOXX: So, we
see the value of that,

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.380
and we're working through
our regulatory system

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.490
to try to achieve
the promise of UAS.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:19.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.930
AUDIENCE: So we
stop having cars--

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:25.760
you will have fewer accidents,
but there will be accidents.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.010
And in some cases, when
an accident is inevitable,

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.344
how are you going to
decide how that accident is

00:45:33.344 --> 00:45:34.010
going to happen?

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:36.610
Like, say you have
the option of crashing

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.620
to a mother with her child, or
a teenager, or a [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.332
on his bike, how
is the car going

00:45:42.332 --> 00:45:45.510
to decide who it's
going to crash into?

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.885
And will that be
undefined behavior,

00:45:48.885 --> 00:45:51.905
or will that be regulated,
or who's going to be liable?

00:45:51.905 --> 00:45:53.884
Can you talk about this?

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.550
ANTHONY FOXX: It's a
very good question.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:59.680
And it's one that,
I think, hopefully

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.530
we can find ways to limit,
maybe even eliminate,

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.300
those situations
you're describing.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.990
But that's a conversation the
public and private sector are

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:14.340
going to have to have
together about how

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.632
we work on those things.

00:46:15.632 --> 00:46:17.090
That's one of the
reasons why there

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:20.160
is an organization like the
National Highway Traffic Safety

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.010
Administration, to help
advise the innovator on how

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.840
to deal with those
types of problems.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.620
The other thing
that I would say is

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.260
that-- and we were talking
about this earlier--

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.110
one of the challenges
of automated vehicles

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.069
is that they actually follow
the rules of the road.

00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:40.110
ERIC SCHMIDT: This is
known as, they don't speed.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:44.390
But it's a good question.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:47.050
So in California,
it's well-known

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:49.639
that there are plenty of
times in the right lane, where

00:46:49.639 --> 00:46:51.680
in fact you're going faster
than the speed limit,

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.890
and it's considered safe to go
with the flow of other traffic.

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:56.840
So what do we do?

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.550
ANTHONY FOXX: Yeah,
well it's a question.

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:01.750
I think it's one that we're
going to have to address.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: Can you
imagine the highway patrol

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.010
pulling over the
self-driving car?

00:47:09.919 --> 00:47:12.210
ANTHONY FOXX: That is really
blowing my mind right now,

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.820
Eric.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.760
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK, go ahead.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.110
AUDIENCE: Given that
different agencies are

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.740
responsible for different
modes at different levels

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:27.800
of jurisdiction, is there a mode
split that this vision document

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.780
has in mind, sort
of broadly speaking,

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:35.300
so that the federal agencies
can nudge the different state

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:41.220
and local level agencies
towards that mode share?

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.580
Do you see this effort to be a
compilation of best practices,

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.300
wherever federal agencies can't?

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.890
ANTHONY FOXX: The
document is really

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:52.430
focused on breaking open
a conversation we need

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.700
to have as a country-- holding
our system up and letting

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.200
folks see it from
the inside out.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.240
And beginning the conversation
about whether this is the way

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.910
we're going to move
into the future.

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:06.860
My own personal belief
is that this system

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.110
has served us incredibly
well across the board.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.660
It's really, across the board,
one of the finest systems,

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.510
if not the finest system,
the world has ever known.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.737
But we've got to take
better care of what we have.

00:48:18.737 --> 00:48:20.820
We've got to create new
capacity where we need it,

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.990
and we need it to be
smarter, so that we're

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:27.990
using every bit of space
and ingenuity that we have.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.800
But the way to do
that, I think, is

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.360
going to be creating
greater coordination

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.140
among these entities.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.430
I don't think we're going to
be able to un-ring the bell,

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:44.070
so to speak, on the
states' work on the highway

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.800
system, or local
communities on transit,

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:53.030
or the federal rail
administration-- which

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.974
the railroads are basically
private systems-- I don't know

00:48:55.974 --> 00:48:57.640
that that's going to
necessarily change.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.240
But I think what
can change is having

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.280
all of those entities
working more closely together

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.800
in a more fully integrated
and seamless system,

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.426
so that we can advance
mobility in the 21st century.

00:49:10.426 --> 00:49:12.050
AUDIENCE: So since
we're among friends,

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.220
could you tell us a story about
a negotiation with Congress,

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.880
or opposition or whatever, that
left you completely shocked

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.588
and in disbelief?

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.550
ANTHONY FOXX: Shocked and
in disbelief-- well, I'll

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:28.140
tell you, last year,
this time last year,

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.780
we started putting out a
highway trust fund ticker.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.820
This was literally
like a clock that

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.570
was going backwards in time
towards the point at which we

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:45.010
would run out of money, because
we were facing the same cliff

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.740
last year that we're facing
in the next four months.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.120
And I spent a lot of time
going around Congress,

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.740
and talking about the need for a
long-term bill, and everything.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:59.360
And on the eve of
running out of money,

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.550
Congress passed a
10-month extension.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.680
Now, this is the 32nd
short-term extension

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.720
we've had in the last six years.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.780
ERIC SCHMIDT: My god.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:09.280
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:09.860
ANTHONY FOXX: Yes.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.610
And so, think about this--
think about if you're

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:13.151
a state department
of transportation,

00:50:13.151 --> 00:50:15.990
you've got big projects you
want to do that take two, three,

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:19.300
four years, and you've
got 10 months of funding.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.050
The problem we have is
that the country has really

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:25.450
slowed down its planning
process, which is slowing down

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.620
the ability to get
these projects done,

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:32.140
which is affecting jobs, travel
times, and everything else.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.200
That's pretty shocking.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.575
ERIC SCHMIDT: I
remember, there's

00:50:34.575 --> 00:50:37.660
an FAA control tower that
needed to be upgraded.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.700
They would not pay the
FAA re-authorization,

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.724
they had to shut
down half the FAA,

00:50:41.724 --> 00:50:43.140
then they had to
rebuild the tower

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.010
and it cost twice as much.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.990
It was crazy-- complete
waste of the citizens' money.

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.620
Yes, ma'am.

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.610
AUDIENCE: So, related
to the whole idea

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:53.090
of more collaboration
between modes,

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:56.590
how are you going to fund
that for research and data

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:57.430
across modes?

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:59.590
Because I know that that's a
huge problem-- it's hard enough

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:01.140
to fund infrastructure,
it's even more

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.264
difficult to fund research
in infrastructure needed

00:51:03.264 --> 00:51:05.742
to conduct all of
the operations.

00:51:05.742 --> 00:51:07.700
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, I'm
glad you mentioned this

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.220
because in the
president's budget today,

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:14.780
you'll be happy to know
that there was $145 million

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:18.910
dedicated to the study
of automated vehicles.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:21.890
And that's a specific line
item in the president's budget.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:25.300
More generally, we do
believe in research.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.220
We work with a number
of universities

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.660
across the country on a
wide variety of issues.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.930
We have studies that are
going on with universities

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.860
on the use of
biofuels in aviation.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.640
We're looking at connected
vehicle technologies,

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.070
automated vehicles,
any number of things.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:47.300
Frankly, the percentage of GDP
in transportation research,

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:57.340
as our plan shows, has decreased
about 0.7% of GDP, down 0.01,

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.200
I think it is.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.099
And so we've gone down in
terms of research dollars,

00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:03.890
but we're still very
bullish, because we've

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.990
seen the results
of that innovation,

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.640
including the work on
the automated vehicle.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.300
ERIC SCHMIDT: And you have the
honor of the last question.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.490
AUDIENCE: With regards
to this small UAS rule,

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:16.160
I'm sure we can agree that
an operation over a populous

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.140
area, or a private farm area,
as well as the size, weight,

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.450
and kinetic energy of
the vehicle, drastically

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.175
changes the profile.

00:52:24.175 --> 00:52:26.550
What are your thoughts on
taking this risk-based approach

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.740
to regulation, as
other countries have?

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.360
ANTHONY FOXX: We're working
through our own process

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:38.220
for creating the footprint
for the innovation.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.427
But the good news is, is
that we have been working

00:52:41.427 --> 00:52:43.260
on this for awhile, and
I think it's coming.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.569
It's coming sooner
than you know.

00:52:46.569 --> 00:52:48.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: There's
a precedent that when

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.620
you change the GPS
approach, as you

00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:55.530
do something called RMP,
which is the rule about how

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.430
accurate the receiver
of the airplane

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.450
is-- in other words, whatever
receiver you have then

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:02.070
determines what your rules are.

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:06.200
So it was about the object,
not some blanket rule.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.380
That's, I think, the right
direction, in my opinion.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.320
I think for all of you, Google
has many, many initiatives

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.160
in transportation.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.197
We care an awful lot
about things in the air,

00:53:17.197 --> 00:53:19.030
and obviously all the
transportation issues.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.965
There are many--
and of our course

00:53:19.965 --> 00:53:21.930
our employees have
many comments as well.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.550
It is unprecedented,
Mr. Secretary,

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.260
for you to bring
your entire team here

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.140
to talk to us, to see what we're
doing, as a show of, I think,

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.220
support for American innovation.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.030
And frankly, I think
to our audience,

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:38.490
this is why the president
made the right choice

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:42.380
in putting my friend in as the
Secretary of Transportation.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.182
And I think you're clearly going
to be a great, great leader

00:53:45.182 --> 00:53:46.640
for America for
many years to come.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.340
Thank you so much for coming.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:48.640
ANTHONY FOXX: Thank you.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank
you very much.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.940
ANTHONY FOXX: Thank you
very much, I appreciate it.

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:54.090
[APPLAUSE]
