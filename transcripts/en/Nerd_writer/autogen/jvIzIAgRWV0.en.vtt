00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
 * The names of the translators are attached in the video description below * 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 This is a motherboard for the Super Nintendo device: a 16-bit video game device 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.140
 Released in 1991 in the United States. 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.680
 These are the acoustic chips that worked side by side to create all sounds, sound effects and music 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.040
 Which you have heard in super Nintendo games. 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.220
 The first chip named SMP or SPC 700 was 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.420
 The kernel processing enables the music programmer to play video games 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.080
 From writing the program that tells the other DSP chip 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.260
 Any votes he wants to issue. 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.620
 While the original Nintendo Entertainment System sound chip had only 5 channels, 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 It offered only a few creative differences to the same basic voice, 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.520
 The Super Nintendo had 8 special channels 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.169
 The sampling system was used 

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:51.060
 Which means that artists were able to add sounds and vocalizations, which made them musical instruments. 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.560
 The space is available for 8 synchronized machines 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.280
 The possibility of sampling from various sounds, the Super Nintendo 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.560
 Was a significant improvement over his predecessor. 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.320
 But there is still one big handicap. Through the two chips, the device can only absorb 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 64 KB of audio RAM. 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.960
 To give you an idea of ​​how small this size is, 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.600
 The average volume of a 3-minute mp3 song you might buy is from the iTunes store, 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.640
 Is about 6 MB, 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960
 Which is larger than the full capacity of the Super Nintendo 100 times, 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.600
 This is for one song only. 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 She mocked 64 kilobytes in order to save all music and sound effects to the whole game. 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.020
 So you often listen to music ... its quality is poor. 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 When you think about re-integrating popular music, you might consider someone you cut 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.500
 Some seconds of old drum rhythm and use it in a new song. 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.980
 But even samples that are a few seconds long carry a tremendous amount of information. 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.540
 In order to take into account the space of 64 KB, the Super Nintendo music samples were to be slim, 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.780
 Sometimes it is so small that it is just a circle of one waveform. 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.380
 In order to produce good music despite these restrictions, 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.220
 You had to be creative. 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.340
 What you are hearing now is the "Aquatic Ambiance" of "Donkey Kong County" 1994, 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.240
 Outstanding music produced by one of the best composers Video Games: David Wise. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.340
 Wise managed to spin beautiful music despite the limitations imposed by Super Nintendo's sound chips. 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.540
 For example, the growing background sounds you hear in this track. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.840
 Such musical compositions were impossible on Super Nintendo, 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.280
 The integration of something of such length and complexity would have exceeded the absorptive capacity of the system. 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.400
 He had to think outside the traditional range. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.920
 One of the main features of the Korg Vision is the possibility of weaving a number of sound waves. 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.740
 The waves are defined as single-circuit or multi-band rings with more than 400 internal waves. 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:04.580
 You can select up to 255 different waves and play them in any order, including the choice of volume, duration and fading times. 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.500
 The "Korg Vision" 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.080
 An electronic sounding device released in the early 1990s that used something called "wave sequence" 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.020
 To play a number of small samples in a quick sequence to produce distinctive sounds and growing. 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.260
 Of course, Nintendo was unable to arrange and rearrange the samples on its own. 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.540
 To achieve this acoustic effect, Wise worked hard to record individual waveforms at different frequencies 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.440
 And put them all in one codec after another. 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.680
 This program is called "Musical Tracker", where music is reduced to mere numbers. 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.380
 Each little sound is placed on a vertical time frame and the columns represent the musical notes, the octave and the sampling options 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.260
 Sound level and some minor effects such as sound propagation, flash and echo. 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.000
 It took Wise five weeks to enter each sample in the Aquatic Ambiance section. It was a tedious process 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.520
 But the results are rich. 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.980
 The Super Nintendo was a restricted device for composers without a doubt. As with anything, 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.460
 The constraints generate creativity, 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.940
 And just because the audio system consists of only two chips, 64 kilobytes of RAM and a lot of hexadecimal symbols, 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.060
 It does not mean that he can not produce beautiful music.
