Dear fellow curious minds and world explorers,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.520
It’s come to our attention that many folks
- including us - have been enjoying the excitement

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.660
that is Pokemon Go. It’s created a great
sense of adventure and lust to get out, explore

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.190
the world, and catch’em all!

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.180
But, dear friends, please don’t forget about
the Pokemon in REAL LIFE. You know, like the

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.760
electric, poison AND water Pokemon the Platypus.
It’s one of the only egg laying and venomous

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.500
mammals! Not to mention they use electroreception
to locate their prey. Or what about the ever

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.429
mysterious Dark, Ground pokemon the raccoon,
using their high intelligence to remember

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.530
solutions to tasks for up to three years.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.379
Of course there are many rare Pokemon to find
around planet earth - try looking for the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.989
Psychic, Ground star-nosed mole with it’s
twenty-two pink fleshy appendages on it’s

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.859
snout hosting 25,000 minute sensory receptors.
Or the Blue Dragon nudibranch, which floats

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.870
upside down in the water using surface tension
- and camouflages with the water. This treehopper

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.409
is a rare Grass and Bug pokemon, with a unique
horn-like extension or helmet. And, who’s

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.310
THAT Pokemon? Why it’s the red-lipped batfish,
which uses its pectoral fins to walk on the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.439
ocean floor, and the structure on it’s head
to attract prey. Much like the lures in Pokemon

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.259
GO attract you! You may not want to take on
the rhinoceros beetle though. This fighter

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.770
can lift 850 times its own weight! If you
had this strength, you could lift close to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.189
two 18-wheeler trucks.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.729
While you’re chasing Caterpie, why not look
for caterpillars? An awesome creature that

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.310
literally evolves from one form to another
- many of which create beautiful metallic

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.900
looking chrysalises in the process. Found
a pidgey? Look around and you might see a

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.159
pigeon too! This amazing bird can learn to
distinguish every letter of the alphabet,

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.260
and many have the unique ability to find their
way home over huge distances using megnetoreception.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.229
And if you come across a geodude, it never
hurts to stop and check out the local rocks,

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.350
which can be pretty dang neat too.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.259
These pokemon have always been all around
us - Which is why we are proposing the Pokemon

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.080
