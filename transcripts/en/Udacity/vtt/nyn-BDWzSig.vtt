00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Where is the energy stored?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In the previous example we have three charges 2+ and 1-,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we want to know, well is the energy stored in the charges?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Somehow in the space between?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And the answer is that the energy stored in something called the electric field.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now the concept of the field is a strange one. So don't worry if this is intuitive at first.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We actually could have talk about this concept of a field when we talk about gravity.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So for example, if you look at the earth, we can draw this imaginary

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
arrows pointed towards the center of the earth and these arrows somehow indicate

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what would happen if I put a mass near them.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If I put a mass in this arrow, well it will a feel force into the direction that the arrow is pointing.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
These arrows are somehow representing the gravitational field.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The electric filed is very similar in the same way that gravity is caused by mass,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
electric fields are created by charges, and just as gravitational fields are felt by mass,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
electric fields are felt by charges.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Both created and felt by objects with charge. Interesting!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, how are we going to measure the electric field.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well it must have some strength associated with it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The way we measure that strength is by putting a small test particle

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
with a charge let's say +q somewhere and if there's an electric field, this object will feel a force.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Electric fields cause forces, and of course if this charge were bigger, the force will be bigger.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But it seems like there's something more fundamental going on

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
than the force on this particular charge.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Actually, what we want to do is to find the electric field in the following way

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
as being equal to the force but we divide

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by whatever the charge of the particle we're putting in this.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If we find that there is some force in this direction

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that means it must also have been an electric field in this direction at this point.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
As a quick example of how to use this equation, E=F/q.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Let's say we take our +1c charge, set it down somewhere

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and note that it feels a force to the right of 4N.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Well the electric field is just force over charge 4/1 and both of those numbers are positive.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
In this case the E field or electric field would be 4N/c

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and maybe I'd want to say something like to the right because electric field is a vector.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It has both the size and the direction. Now what if I gave you a different problem.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Let's say I have a negative charge that when placed in a certain electric field

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
fills a force of 10 N to the right.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Can you fill this out for me? Can you tell me what's the strength of the electric field is?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And that strength should be a positive number

00:02:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and can you tell me whether it's an electric field to the right or to the left.
