00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Good news.

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.370
We all have a new brain cell.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.549
And it’s looking like this particular kind
of brain cell could be unique to humans!.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.910
Do you feel smarter yet?

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.300
Well you’re about to, ‘cause we’re gonna
talk about your brain.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.419
Which, it turns out, science actually knows
very little about.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.640
We’re JUST starting to scratch the surface,
and mapping the brain is a far greater challenge

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.320
even than mapping the human genome.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.689
But let’s go over some basics:
Your brain is full of cells: neurons, and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.689
glia.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.410
We’re going to focus mostly on neurons,
which are the messengers of information.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.079
Neurons communicate with each other and with
the rest of your nervous system through electrical

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.380
and chemical signals, and are supported by
glial cells.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.720
There are three main kinds of neurons: sensory
neurons, which communicate information from

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.030
your senses to your brain; motor neurons,
which help you control your body’s movements,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.550
and interneurons, which help motor neurons
and sensory neurons talk to each other.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.810
Within these categories, neurons can be either
excitatory or inhibitory.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.830
As their names suggest, excitatory neurons
pass information along to other neurons, while

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.850
inhibitory neurons can slow down excitatory
action and stop other neurons from firing,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.870
controlling the flow of information in the
brain.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.000
And the big news is that we’ve found a new
kind of interneuron, called the rosehip cell--sittin’

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.350
right there in this vast, unknown universe
that lives inside our own heads.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.000
What’s particularly exciting about this
new research is that scientists are starting

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.830
to use novel methods to delve into the brain.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.820
Recent advances in RNA analysis techniques
called transcriptomics allow to see more detail

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.800
than ever before about how the brain works.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.250
A group at the Allen Institute for Brain Science
in Seattle used these RNA sequencing techniques

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.060
to identify unique gene expression patterns
in frozen brain tissue.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
Meanwhile, a partner research team in Hungary
used more traditional slice and dice lab imaging

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.990
techniques--on live brain tissue taken from
brain surgery patients--to see evidence of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.159
a cell that matched the genetic markers found
by the Seattle group.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.909
Ta da--brand new brain cell type, observed.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.780
So how does it affect human behavior?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.940
We’re not quite sure.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.940
Yet.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.350
The rosehip neuron appears to act as an inhibitory
neuron.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.450
It’s called the rosehip neuron because it
looks like the plant, and its specialized

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.209
shape, with rosehip-like bulges on its axons
may help it act on the brain in a particular

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.209
way.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.269
Lots more research is needed to discover the
effect of rosehip neurons on human behavior

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.730
and cognition, but there are early hopes that,
as a neuron that controls information flow

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.969
in the brain, it could be a key part of understanding
intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.860
diseases like schizophrenia.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.510
Perhaps the most important part of this discovery
though is that so far, we haven’t been able

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.099
to find the same kind of brain cell in the
mouse brain.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.139
We rely on mice to study everything from cancer
to pharmaceutical development to alzheimer’s,

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.189
so this lack of an analogous structure in
the rodent brain highlights how different

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.999
the two really are.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.959
This discovery in particular points out important
gaps that may result from trying to study

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.489
human brain function in mouse models.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.799
We’re making valuable progress in the vast
unknown frontier of our brains, but there’s

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.150
still a heck-of-a long way to go.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.019
Does your brain hurt from all the knowledge?

Subscribe to Seeker so we can guide you through
all the brain learnin’.

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.389
And fun fact, there’s a project in the US
called the BRAIN Initiative, which stands

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.689
for Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies, and is dedicated to improving

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.670
our understanding of the human brain.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.010
Thanks for watching.
