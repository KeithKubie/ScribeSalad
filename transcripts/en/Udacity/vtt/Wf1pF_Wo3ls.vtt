00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.644
To do experiment and determine the genetic contribution

00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:07.221
and variability of a trait, scientists need controls and

00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:10.263
identical twins serve as a genetic control. For

00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:12.477
example if we want to figure out the heritability

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:14.313
of a certain trait, for example sense of

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:18.306
humor. We might take identical twins raised in different

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.366
environments and then see if they have that

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:25.250
trait or not. Now if both twins always have

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.570
the trait, even if they were raised in completely different environments.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.260
Would that mean there's a strong or a weak genetic component.
