Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, March 27th, 2017 2017 fuck a decades flying bike.

Speaker 1:          00:00:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       You know what? I'm the 2011, 1213. Can somebody tell me that 14 was cool? Vaguely remember 15 and then 16 and you know, I want to thank everyone who whined so much about it last year, the worst year ever. I mean, that one's pretty vivid. Lot of crying, lots of crying. And I don't mean for the right reasons like David Bowie and prince passing, but you know, you know Hillary losing and that type of shit a lot. A lot of crying, a lot of whining. Um, anyways, I uh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       I don't even know what the fuck to tell you. I've been a did being fucking daddy daycare here. You know what I did for the first time we finally went out, right? Me And d were going fucking crazy. Cause you have a baby, you have a little baby. Yeah. Have a little lady. This is the thing, if it's your first kid, you fucking scared to death. You're like, I can't take this thing outside. It's going to get a bowler. You get all fucking nervous, you know, and then it's gotta get his fucking immunizations and all of that type of shit. And he just let go neo. Who Do I fucking believe here? Jesus Christ. I'll tell you those fucking shots. This is what I actually, I just sat down. I was like, nobody who's ever been in the medical field told me not to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       I've had comedians, high school friends, a fucking actresses, a bunch of non doctors have advised to go, what am I not going to get her fucking vaccinated for polio? No, it's that what it is in fish. Shut the fuck. Do you even own a lab code? All you're doing is scaring the shit out of me. So anyways, um, so we were, you know, you fucking afraid. So finally we were just like, all right, fuck this. We got a Stroller, you know. So we started taking walks around the block, but my block has like the shittiest sidewalk. It's like a, you know, the ground's all shifted out here. There's tree roots pushing it up. You have no idea when you just walk down the street, you know, you start pushing the strolling, you're trying to keep the kid quiet, you know, cause she finally fell asleep.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       It's like I'm pushing my daughter up the street. It's like fucking linked to liquid nitrogen. I'm just trying to keep her, I don't want to say I'll start crying, middle of the street, just going down the street, waking everybody up. And I guess they were already awake. I Dunno. So, um, we finally ended up going to the mall. I had that experience. I went to the mall with my wife and my kid. We pulled in at a take out a stroller, take her out of the car seat, put her in and start walking around the mall. And I gotta tell you, it was fucking awesome. I, for the first time in my life, I get the mall, I get it. You know, it's for teenage kids when they're trying to get away from their parents, like, mom, just leave me alone, whatever. With friends, that era before you have a license really.

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       And you can't really go anywhere. You just need some sense of fucking freedom. And it's for what? After you become a parent, you have to get out of the fucking house into some sort of controlled environment where there's enough God damn people that you don't have to worry about anybody snatch and your goddamn kid, you know. Um, so we walked around and uh, just had a great fucking time, was like the perfect day and uh, you know, neo was all excited to be out because uh, you know, women just to have Jesus the shit they go through being being the guy, it's the best. I swear to God it's why they fucking, I think it's why they make our lives so god damn miserable is they, they see how easy it is. And the thing is is we don't realize how easy it is cause we've only been us, you know what I mean? How long it takes them to get ready.

Speaker 3:          00:04:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       Do you know how long it takes me to get ready now? I've got a fucking shaved head. I mean I don't even have to do anything. You could literally hose me off in the backyard and I could, you know, I'd be ready in like seven minutes, easy, seven minutes. Cause I always got to run around and find my cell phone for like five of those minutes. But you know, if I, if I actually was organized and knew where all my shit was, I could be, I could be writing like three minutes. Um, anyways. Yeah, they go through all of that shit. You know what I mean? You gotta breastfeed, they gotta, they gotta they gotta pump all of that crap. I don't have to do any of that. You know what I mean? So she was going fucking nuts dealing with, um, everything that nature put on her.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       And she finally had to get out of the house and it's the happiest I've seen her. We walked around, had a great time. You know what? They haven't malls now this is second mall I've been to that they have like a Tesla, um, store. Like you can go and like, who the fuck just goes to the mall and buys a car? You know what I mean? You go there, you buy sunglasses, right? A fucking Hula Hoop, whatever, whatever it is, you buy it, buy a car. So I, you know, I can't resist. I got to go in there, right? And I'm like, what's the deal with this thing? Zero to 60 what do you, what are you 2.5 the guy's like 2.3 that's amazing. I was up in San Jose. The Guy told me 2.5 you shaved off in another two hundreds of a second. And I'm like, all right. So I get four adults in there and he goes, you can get five. And I go and I'm still going to go zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds. It doesn't make any sense. All that weight. What am I up to there? Oh 2.93 and he goes, yeah, probably two six. It's like, what are you basing that on? Other than the fact that you want to make a commission?

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       What am I basing mine on? I don't fucking know. So he goes, all right, let's take a look at this over. I go, dude, I just bought a car. I love it. I'm not going to buy a car and we tell you right now, but I just want to see, you know, if I got the car that I wanted, what this thing's going to cost me, right? So I I go give me the one with the motor, the all wheel drive. Alright, I went black. I didn't want to get the black interior cause it's hot as shit out here, right? So the guy goes, do you want the fucking, the full moon roof and everything? I go, dude, look at me. Oh I'm almost an albino and I have a shade. Had DD fucking and he goes down all the tents, crazy on it. And I said, all right, put it on the fucking car.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       What do I care? I'm not buying this thing right. Give me the best you know, best tires, best rims, best, best fucking everything. Then they had this thing, oh know for five grand when you get on the highway kind of drives it kind of helps you. And I was like, dude, why would I buy a car like this? And have something else dry. I want to drive it. I don't need that shit. Right. So that I didn't get everything else I got in in the end. I took a picture of it. I forget how much it costs. Ah, fuck. I don't need the exact number in the end. You know what it costs hundred and $52,000.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       Oh fuck. And what kills me. Someone's going to go to the mall and buy one of those hundred 52,000 fucking dollars. I just wish they looked cooler. I love the fucking tires and everything and there's is, you know, if you get the right tires and rims and shit really helped that car and the front end definitely looks better, but I dunno man, you don't, it looks like it looks like that for two a portion. It's ugly as shit had Panamera whatever that, you know, you don't think like always try to do that in like the uh, the car commercials will, they have a two door car. They have the dad, then he has the baby and then he grabs the bumper and he turns it into a four door car. Like, Oh wow, this is like a sports car, but it's a four door sedan.

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       No it isn't. It's a four door sedan and it won't, but that's trying to be a sports car and then it becomes ugly. That's why I liked the Mercedes, the BMW in the jet and the Jaguars because they still look like cars, like four door sedan. Then you step on the gas. It's like, Oh shit, look at this. Who Knew I'm aren't talking about here. Anyway, so we ended up having a, a a great time and uh, I walked by the, um, the fucking split stories, that thing, whatever, whoever, uh, the one that looks, looks like the letter h, it's not Nike or Adidas, it's the other one is the one that fucking Steph curry has an in the window there, these ugly ass basketball shoes. And I looked in and said curry threes.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08:19       dude, gun to your head. What do you like better than the Colby eleven's or the curry threes? I don't know. Do the curry threes, you know, with a fucking Chris pair of jeans and a Hoodie over we you chain on the outside.

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       Male fashion needs do Jordan threes. All right. Jordan trees. Okay. With the pair of Joe's jeans. All alright. And, and a button down in a new Yankee dude. New Yankee had two and a slice of pizza. Does it get any better?

Speaker 4:          00:09:10       Playing playstation on the TV and inside down this cowboy stadium.

Speaker 2:          00:09:16       Crazy ultimate bachelor party dude. A pair of fucking Jordan nine right jeans cuffed creased with, with an Abercrombie and Fitch v-neck t shirt, extra soft

Speaker 4:          00:09:33       play play station with the slice of pizza in a fucking cowboy stadium.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       Does it get any better than that dude?

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       I'm sorry. I don't know what it is. I like sneakers and I've actually been buying some, I just liked the old ones. Like I got a pair of shell toes and I got a pair early eighties fucking Adidas like high tops. Like I liked that shit. Like, I dunno what the, when fucking Picasso started designing these goddamn things, it's like, it makes no sense. Um, I'm going to get in trouble for this shit. I'm going to say later on in this podcast that I didn't know what the fuck to tell you. I get some shout outs to do. I never give shout outs. Right. And um, I just had a bunch that would just pile it up and I'm like, I finally got to give out some fucking shout outs and then, but I just never get around to them. It's extra work. I never give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       But then finally somebody tipped me over the fucking edge. Right. Laura is, I gotta gotta I gotta give this person a shout out. All right, so first of all, let's, let's get the, uh, let's get the opener and the feature out of the way. A shout out to Eric and Bose for hooking me up with some of those Bose headphones. I was bitching about, um, people being loud in, uh, you know, on the plane and shit. And by the way, this is not so I can get more free shit. I don't want any more shit. I'm getting rid of Shit. If you give me free shit, I'm going to give it away or I'm going to send it down to fucking goodwill and it's going to end up in a truck that sits in a warehouse and they're going to dump it and then, Oh shit.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       So I don't want any shit, you know, and nice email. Hey Bill, like you stuff, that's just fine. Okay. But if somebody did send me, you gotta say thank you. Right. All right. Shout out to Eric at Bose and then, uh, James Shotwell. Um, I did this thing this weekend, um, rock against ms where I got to give an award to a Richard Pryor's widow, Jennifer Pryor, and uh, you know, Richard suffered from that disease and of course he turned it into comedy and set out the disease, actually slowed him down so he could live longer. Um, which is really fascinating that, that's probably true. Um, and anyways, James Shotwell was down there doing, I don't know, working like the sound, I've got to see all these fucking killer bands, these amalgams, like fucking Alison chains with Nancy Wilson from heart coming out, crushing it. Then she brought her new a band out, road case royal and they fucking killed it too.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       She's a, she's still a beast. I got to see Steven Adler play with an all star band. He played um, the hell did he play? He played, uh, the Ramones. I want to be sedated and then I got to stand at like 10 feet away from him. I got to watch him play. Welcome to the jungle and rocket Queen and see all this subtle, all these little subtle things that he's, first of all, I get to see all the genius drum parts that fit so perfectly to that song. And then just the different ways that he played them. Um, you know that part, you know, so, uh, no, no, no, no, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's really, I always thought he was on both times. He's just riding on the floor, Tom. And on the second scenario it comes over with the Flint. That's that little shit when you're a drum nerd like me. I'm like, that's how we fucking plays it. And I got the, of course he was Cooley Shit, you know, he's such a fucking great guy, man. Had, you know, a couple people were there that had MSC, let him fucking sit like right behind them while he played. When he finished playing, he came out, he high fived everybody in the front row do. We were at the La Theater in downtown La and it was um,

Speaker 3:          00:13:10       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       I guess it was a theater was designed by Charlie Chaplin. Okay. And when you walk in in the foyer, there's a picture of Charlie Chaplin walking in the night at first opened with Albert Einstein. And uh, of course I missed that photo. Somebody told me it was there, but downstairs they have this kid's room that still has the original paints. So they say don't touch the walls. And of course it's all these creepy fucking drawings. Like being a kid was so fucking scary back then. All these creepy drawings of clowns and horses and shit. And um, someone was trying to claim, and I refuse to believe that this is true, that they, that's where you brought your babies when they cried. And if they got really loud, they had these little like cabinets, you just opened the door and you put the baby in, you closed the door. It's like even downstairs they could still hear it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:01       I refuse to believe that that's true. But, um, I ended up, I call hosted it with Craig Gas, who that guys impressions of fucking unbelievable man is Sam Kinison is Gene Simmons, Sebastian Bach. And he's hung out with all of these guys. So he has all these unreal stories and he does dead on impressions of Jim Florentine was there. Um, it was an amazing fucking night. So, um, thank you to Nancy sail for putting that whole thing on and I'll do it any year that they want. And then lastly, but Lezley um, got it. We got a, actually I got a request from somebody who says that she's a fan, a lady fan of the podcast that my stand up, but a, what she requested I guess is already over. Ah, she's trying to be, uh, in next year's sports illustrated swimsuit, Lisa Marie Jafta. But the voting's already closed. So I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       I don't know if it was real or not. I immediately didn't believe that it was a real email. And then she sent a video golf. Now, seriously, I know you're a bald, middle-aged content, but I actually liked your stuff. If you could send your listeners over to vote for me, you know, maybe I could get in the issue next year. And uh, I dunno, that's such a weird world. You know what I mean? You don't need that fuck myth about that world was one time Nia had been watched this fucking thing about it and they had this creep that was like the Goto guy and he called himself uncle Terry.

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       Anybody who's not your uncle ladies, anybody who's not your uncle. And he says, just call me uncle so and so. Yeah, he's trying to fuck you. He's a fucking, this guy was one of the creepiest fucking people I've ever seen in my God damn life. Um, so anyways, my apologies. The voting is already fucking over, but I don't even know if this, I don't even know if it was real to be honest with you, but you know what? I'm a middle aged bald man and I that's wanting to believe that that's true. Is it? That's really all I have.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       Um, and speaking of swimsuit models, oh, la Billie fat tits area's been fucking doing great on the elliptical of back at it, man. I'm back at it. I fucked up last night and had a glass of booze, all the booze one last night I just added a glass, which is probably considered a triple in any fucking hipster bar. But, um, I was going to go to bed. I wasn't gonna have it, you know, I've been doing good. I stopped eating at five and 1130. You know, Nia had come home. I was hanging out with my daughter, the whole nightmare. She was a riot. She was a riot. Jesus Christ out. She had two apocalyptic fucking diapers yesterday. That was just like, it's just like really, I don't think, I don't think I, I don't think I, we've bought enough provisions to ever get this fixed again.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       So, um, she came home late and, uh, and I was just going to go to bed and I kept playing that mental tennis. Should I have a glass? Don't have glass, try to lose weight. Should I have a glass? Don't. And then finally the booze was just looking like, come on. You know what the booze was like? It was like Jimmy the gent, you know, after they fucking did the lift, one's the highest. However you say the bottle is just over there and going [inaudible] and Henry comes walking in. So I add one. So I dunno. Um, it like one 80, 1.2, and I've just been in the 80s. I hate being in the 80s. That's one. That's when I just, and when I shift my weight around on the couch just to go reach for the remote, you just feel the role's going home on the side of you.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       You know, I don't know how people do it. I don't know how you just walk around being a fucking fat body. I don't know why you tolerate that. You got one fucking life and you knew, you know God damn well in the back of your head. You don't know where you go after this. Okay. Let's say best case scenario, you get reincarnated. All right? Cause the whole heaven health thing, it's the same thing every day. After a while it's, it's not even gonna have any value. What are you like me on fire again? Okay, what does it, another perfect day. Oh boy, you're going to be like those teenagers at the mall. Oh God, I'm so bored. Right? Um, best case scenario, you get reincarnated. The fucking odds that you're going to come back again as a human being. I mean, you know, if you can come back as a fucking mouse or some shit, like, you know, fucking run around almost having a heart attack.

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       His, some reptile is slowly tracking you getting eaten alive. You know, this is the best she got. So you can fucking sit here and become a tub of shit. You don't want you, you owe it to yourself. So this is what I've been doing. This has been the breakfast of a freckled champion. Um, every morning I wake up, go do to do dude, and I go out to the garage and, um, what do I do? I go to, um, I go in the fucking elliptical as my, um, my rotator cuff is slowly getting better. Today. I did some lady pushups. I was going to do 20. I was like, don't push it. Stop to 12, stopped at 12, just trying to keep the fucking man tits from sagging down into my navel. Um, and I do like a half hour on the, uh, on the elliptical and then it come in and for breakfast I have one of those little oranges and I have a, a, a poached egg and that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       And then I have a banana between there and lunch. And then for lunch I have some sort of protein, a, you know, maybe with a little bit of bread, some sort of Ghana. I know breads the enemy, go fuck yourself. Um, it's the only bread I have. And then I don't know what the fuck it is. Then I have a protein with the salad at four protein with the salad at six, and then I'm done. Then I just drink waters for the rest of the night. In theory, unless the fucking Jimmy, the jet moment happens. And I get fucked over. Um, anyways. Uh, so I have to do this shit. I gotta get my ass back down. I can't, my birthday's coming up in June. I'm going to be 49 fucking years old, which I'm actually pretty, I'm all right with it. Once you have a kid, you kind of are right with being old.

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       You're like, other than that, yeah. Yeah. And I'm 47. I don't have a kid. I'm just going to die alone. I'm going to be 49 and there's no fucking way I'm going to be in the one 80. So it's just not going to happen. I'm telling you right now, I am going to be one 72 my fighting weight, where the hell I want to be. My shoulder's going to be healed. And I have a bet with Paul Versey that when I'm 70 years old, I'm going to be able to do 10 pull ups. And if I don't get this rotator cuff fixed, uh, I'm going to be fucked because all I keep thinking about is Jordan, when he came back on the wizards, you know, and that was the first time you really saw drop off in his playing level. Cause not only was he gone for three years, he didn't really play.

Speaker 2:          00:21:13       And when you stop, that's when you're fucked. That's what I've learned. Trying to get it back. It's, it's hard. It's really fucking hard. Although, although Dee del Ray who crushed it in San Jose del Ray in San Jose told me he's doing sets of 20 fucking pull-ups. I've never done 20 pull ups in my life straight. I think the most I ever I was able to do is I just can't get past like 16. He's 51 years old. Can do 20 pull ups, sets of 20. So there's hope. There's always hope. Is this like an inspirational podcast bill used to shit on stuff. All right. I will. Um, but I, I can't, I can't, I'm jabbing up. I'm having, you know, I've gotten such so little material I have on a daughter. I thought like, all, fuck, here we go. My whole act is gonna fucking change, man. And it's been so awesome. You know, what am I going to do? Talk about how great it is somehow get you don't really do as I, I should. I, I pretty much in my act, I just shit on people that talk about how difficult parenting is. You know what I mean? I'm not saying, you know, it's not, I'm not walking around sleepy as shit all the time, but you know, come on.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:23       You know, go watch that fucking movie. I tell. Told you to watch where they torture that kid that plays the violin. That guy from peaky blinders is in it. Anthropoid go watch that fucking thing. Watch what those people went through and tell me that being a parent is hard. Um, anyways, sorry. Plowing ahead. Oh, what happened? Where do I start? Do I talk F1 do I talk about the Celtics? Do I talk about the Bruins playing for their play off, fighting for their playoff lines? Let's talk Bruins and I'll do a little advertising here with the Bruins. Fucking 84 points. We lost four fucking games in a row. We just won one of those goddamn games. We are now, we will like all the way up to like, I think a fourth seat at one point or a fifth c. We are now an eighth seat.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Toronto is ahead of us. I heard that goaltender got hurt though.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:23:22       where the fuck is it? I had this goddamn standing sweat. Do I? What? Did I deal with it anyways?

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:29       I Dunno. Well, we, we got a huge Wayne, thank you to Riley Nash for those two fucking huge goals against the island is we got the predators on Tuesday and then we played this Stass is a big fucking Boston team week. Dude. You're going to the BS versus Stass show them against the predators, dude. Um, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say we kind of have to win both of those fucking games or hope everybody beneath is just keeps losing unreal. Unreal. This is the third year in a row. We're just, the bottom's fallen out. But you know what, I slowly see improvement though. And I can see how this could be a team that could, uh, actually score a ton of goals in the future. You know, I saw on their website today the up, you know, the, the frozen four is happening and uh, we got like, we have four prospects in the frozen for this year.

Speaker 2:          00:24:24       So who knows. I mean the frozen for versus getting HL is a big fucking leap. But who knows, who knows? Maybe there's an, there's an Austin, uh, with the fuck's his name Matthews in there. Who knows. Um, but anyways, dude, speaking of that shit, speaking of the frozen four, what about the final four? I barely paid attention, man, cause I've been running around, you know, being a dad and everything, but I, every time I would just like, you see, you heard me going, Duke lost, then I'm like Kansas Lost Kentucky, lost the final fours. I remember verbally telling me was it's North Carolina, understandable, South Carolina Gonzaga. And uh, I forget who the other team is. Basically, there's no, everybody's bracket is fucked at this point. If your bracket isn't fucked, if there's somebody out there that actually picked this year's final four in the NCAA, you that don't know shit about fucking basketball and just guessed or your dad's in the mob and something's going down this year because just everybody's out of it. Um, I don't know who I'm going to vote for.

Speaker 3:          00:25:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       Gonzaga South Carolina. My teams would Duke or Kansas and I was always liked UCLA. Um, and they all got, UCLA got fucking knocked out. You know what annoyed me that day? I was walking down the street and you know, cause all the bandwagon fucking UCLA fans, all of a sudden everybody's rabid out here. You know what? I was wearing a Bruin sweatshirt and I'm walking down the street and this guy goes, hey, goes hates UCLA Bruins, not Boston Bruins. And I just laughed at him. Ed, you guys are good this year. He's like, yeah, we are. And walked away. And I was like, wait a minute. That was at the car wash and I fucking looked it up. Like, who was the Bruins first? And it was like the UCLA basketball team was around before the Boston Bruins, but their first year and like 1918 or something, they were the UCLA cubs and then the next year they switched to the grizzlies.

Speaker 2:          00:26:27       And in like 1928 they joined. I don't know what there was the pack something pack 10 pack 12 Oh, I don't know what the fuck it was back then. Pack eight I have no idea. But like there was some team from Montana that was already the grizzlies. In 1928 they switched to the UCLA Bruins. However at the Boston Bruins were in 1924 all right, so all due respect to coach wooden, all due respect to the UCLA program. I actually liked the school and everything, but when it comes to that Bruin Shit, go fuck yourself. All right. We were there first. Okay, CIF, stand the fuck down. It's a different sport. It's a pro sport. So relaxed, you know, you know bad. I've been replaying that in my head that I wished that I had that information. You know, I wish they were in the final four and I would've actually, I'm such an argumentative con.

Speaker 2:          00:27:21       I would actually fucking maybe drive over to Westwood and gets some air quote lunch and just walk around with that shirt. It's like, it'd be like, ah, Nike crazy. Hey, no gay history, no history. You know, like, like I'm the fucking the sports guru. Like I just didn't look that shit up cause some guy was a contemplating of the car wash.

We're going to do traffic on the sixes. Anybody out on the four oh five, you might want to get yourself a helicopter. There's a lot of traffic. Everybody slowing down, watching somebody change a tire. Um, anyways, let's talk some F1 action. Did anybody, did you watch the Australian grampy grampy Grand Prix down in Melbourne, Australia? Uh, it was a great fucking race and it lived up to the hype that this year the Ferrari's, we're going to be good.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       And I've only watched this sport for one season, so I don't know shit about it all. He knows. Last year it was all about the Mercedes team, Louis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, you know, they had the whole days of thunder. You know, I'm the guy who's been around the block on the other. Fuck I'm, I'm the Tom Cruise Guy, somebody fucking Robert Duvall and everybody else, which is watching last year. And if those two guys didn't hate each other, it would have been fucking boring as shit because basically every race was erased to the first corner. Whoever got there first was just driving through clean air and the cars were so equally matched, nobody could catch up with somebody. You basically had to fuck up or your car died. Um, so all the exciting racing was for like, you know, fourth, fifth, sixth place or whatever, three psychos going after it for the last, you know, championship point as they say, you know, back in 10th place.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       That was exciting. But up front it was just Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg just, just doing laps was, you know, Kinda got a little boring. So this year they were talking about how, um, Ferrari was very quiet, eerily quiet during the off season, working on their, their, their suspension and the engine and all that type of shit with the new regulations, whatever the fuck they are, I don't know what they are and that they were gonna make a serious challenge for, uh, against Mercedes issue. So the fucking race starts and, uh, the Australian Dude, I already forget his name. Uh, Rico Rican Berg. I have no fucking idea. Like eventually I'll, I'll get these people's names down. Ricky rocket, I forget. Okay. Everybody wanted him to win the poor bastard. He's down there and they'd taken like the, the, the warmup lap or whatever. And uh, not even the warmup lap. They just going around, getting ready to get into positions just to do the warmup lap and his car gets stuck in sixth gear.

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       We've all been there, right the side of the highway, except he's got 100,000 people in a fucking zillion millions of fans around the world watching this shit. So they got to push his car and they got to take out the fucking transmission in like five minutes. Throw a new one in there, try and get it back in the fucking car before the race starts. That alone, if they just showed that, that would've been amazing. They kind of kept cutting back to it. I wish they showed more of it. A long story short, he wasn't able to get out there until, uh, the second lap. He was already two laps down. So that kind of sucked for all the Australian fans and uh, then his car shit, the bed halfway through the race, however, so the race fucking starts. All right. I think Lewis Hamilton had the pole and then Sebastian Federal, um, for Ferrari was in second place and Lewis had a great start and he was out front and I go, wow, I guess that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       I guess the Mercedes are gonna win it this year. Right. So they get about 20 laps in and Lewis Hamilton pits, it's one of these races, it's like 57 laps and the announcers were saying that they were going to pit one time and it's all when you pit and blah blah blah, blah blah. So all this shit is becoming fascinating to me. So Lewis Hamilton goes into Pitt, right? Sebastian Vettel was, I don't know how far behind, couple seconds behind he decides to stay out there. So the whole time when Lewis was out there in first place, Sebastian's behind him. All right. So Louis is driving in the clean air. It's like, you know, if you want to fucking on a lake and you bring, it's just still water. You could, you could go way faster and you boat as opposed to if the water was all fucking choppy, you got to go slower than, it's the same thing, except it's what's with air.

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       I'm just saying this for everybody else out there who's dumb like me in the fact that air is invisible, you don't understand it. So no matter what this guy's doing, Sebastian Vettel, he can only get so close to a, to Lewis Hamilton because all the air coming off of him, and I guess the tires are bigger this year, which causes more turbulence. It would actually, he's going to use more fuel and chew up more of his tires if he gets too close to him, which is really fucking, I dunno, I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. So Hamilton was having problems with the tire. He pits early. So the Ferrari team takes a gamble and says, fuck this. We're going to stay out there. So Sebastian now is in first place driving into clean air. He's got the nice smooth lake. He's bringing the boat across, except it's a car and it's going through air.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       He's still with me. And he stays out there for one lap and they go, he's definitely gonna come in for the second lap. Meanwhile, um, Lewis Hamilton came right back out of the pits and then was, you know, technically in fourth place, but he's, you know, but he already pitted the other two guys in front of them at the pit. And so does the other guy. So technically it's like he's still in first place, but now he's driving in dirty air back there. So Sebastian's flying around the track, he goes around a second time and, you know, the tires are getting chewed up. He's driving like a fucking maniac and the d comes around a third time and they're like, he's not gonna, he's not gonna fucking stay out there. He stayed out there again and now basically it was like, this was the most exciting part of it because this is the fucking race.

Speaker 2:          00:41:45       So basically what he's trying to do, he's trying to get out so far ahead that he has time to pit when he goes in, get his tires and get back out on the track in front of fucking, uh, Lewis Hamilton. It was like a fucking movie. He pulls in his fourth time around, comes in, they fucking take the tires. You've got to go so fucking slow too now. And he, he got to slow down to like, like you're driving a Prius when you're in there. And as he's slowing down this show and Lewis is coming around, he's coming around, he's coming around, he gets the tires, fucking Sebastian's coming out. It's like a fucking action movie. And it was literally, he just Sebastian, uh, for Ferrari just get out in front of Lewis Hamilton. And then that was the race. He saw the Mercedes guy slammed his hand down on it.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       The guy in the pits, right? They had fucking guy, right. The guy goes the eyes wide shut illuminati parties at the end of the fucking race right there. Probably on some yacht that's like invisible, like the air that they drive through. Right. He fucking slammed his hand down like medium and then fucking slammed it down a second time. And right there I was like, this guy knows this fucking race is over. And that was it. Ferrari won the first race, you know, backing up their lack of shit talk. They were real quiet in the off season. So, uh, I was actually really, you know, I like the way my, I'm one of those guys, I like both, both team proceedings and Ferrari. I mean, I don't know how you get mad at either one of them, the fucking beautiful, amazing cars that they've built all this fucking, uh, over the years.

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       So I'm just happy that this seems like there's going to be competition and if it can be as exciting as that, um, for the whole season, uh, I think, um, maybe some more you guys can get into it. Like I did, I believe the next races in China, in Indochino, in China. Um, that's gonna be the next one. But I was, I was thrilled with the race. Um, I don't know how many F1 fans listen to this shit. Uh, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Um, all right. What else? What else does Celtics one, the Celtics are technically in first place right now, but we got two games at hands. We've one more, one more game and lost one more game than, um, the Cavaliers. But, uh, I mean I don't, I don't see them, not the Cavaliers not getting the number one seed, let's say get real enough.

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       I don't know if somebody gets fucking hurt or some shit like that. All right, last announcement and then I'm going to read the, uh, your fucking emails for the week are in my youtube channel that I'm slowly but surely building up. All right. I'm gonna. Um, I'm gradually just transitioning to the fucking Internet here. My whole career is just going to be on the Internet of the Internet other than my live dates and f is for family because everything else is drying up. So my youtube channel, which I'm, I'm serious about building up with content. Um, I actually hired a, a, an animator and, um, hired a couple of people to start making videos and putting content up there. I'm going to be doing tours of every city that I go to. Now I'm bringing those things back. Uh, I'm actually considering, um, bringing on this guy that does drum covers that looks like me, but you know, isn't me, but maybe it's me.

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       Um, so anyways, what do we got here? Uh, on Tuesday, the first video from Alan Pailin, pronounced Pailin on the official podcast channel, Alan Pale and is the guy who edited it together. Um, remember that one when I commentate commentated basketball. Um, he's the guy who did that. So, um, we're going to have new, uh, videos from him every single week. Um, my, uh, youtube page is youtube.com/user/ it's backslash, you know, the one that starts further away and then comes in towards you like a flare chop. Um, youtube.com backslash user backslash Monday morning podcast. Please subscribe to the channel, check it out, and, um, I'm going to start making some videos and that type of shit. Um, I don't know that I'll have a video tape that podcast cause it's just me laying here right now I'm wearing a tee shirt. Pajama bottoms and slippers. How interesting is that going to be?

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       And I, every time I, whenever I saw radio shows videotaped, they just, something happened where it was boring. I liked the fact that like podcast, it's just like radio on the fact that you, you, you're doing shit right now. You drive it home from work. You're on the fucking elliptical. You know, you're pouring yourself a drink, you cleaning the house whenever you're doing whatever the fuck it is you do and you can do other shit, right? All of a sudden it's videotape you feel you've got to watch somebody's talking into a microphone. I don't get it. All right, here we go. Internet privacy. Everybody. Uh Hey Billy thought you might like this. A private Internet access provider took out a full page ad in the New York Times calling up 50 senators who voted to monitor, monitor the public's internet activity for financial gain. What people care a lot about their public image. And I think this should be done more to combat assholes. Let me call, let me click on this thing. I can't click on it because I'm not on the Internet. Hang on, let me try and find this here. I gotta see who the cons are. Who are the cons that signed to the onto this. Alright, we are the cons. We don't give a shit. All right. Hello world. These are the 50 senators who monitor, who voted to monitor your internet activity. Now Jesus Christ. I can't read on the too fucking small.

Speaker 3:          00:47:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       All right.

Speaker 3:          00:47:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       Oh Jesus. Jesus. What are they all Republicans, dude, the way they vote, man. Cause it was probably something else that was pro conservative. That's the only reason why that fucking Democrats didn't so fucking and McCoys. It's basically they're all Republicans representative from Tennessee. Alexander representative from Wyoming. Barrasso blunt from Missouri. Boozman from Arkansas burn from North Carolina. You fucking piece of shit.

Speaker 3:          00:47:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       Ruining the name. Kaputo from West Virginia. Cassie from Louisiana. Car from, from Mississippi. Collins from Maine. Corker from Tennessee. You know what? I'm just going, I'm going to just retweet this fucking picture. Jesus Christ, Republicans, all Republicans cruise from Texas, Crappo from Idaho, some element names, Danes from Montana, another one from Wyoming, NZ from Wyoming earns from Iowa. This is all of this shit, all that. Rubio from Florida, Perdue from Georgia, Portman from Ohio. This is all like, this is all saying it's fake news. It's all fake news. Do you know it's basically, um, you know whose kid new news is? It's propaganda. It's bullshit. It's bullshit. But what they want is their bullshit in your brain. That's what they want. So what they want to do is gradually take control of this shit and they're gonna make fake news. Basically your opinion of what's going on.

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       They're going to make that like illegal to do. Um, and they're probably looking over at China going like, Hey China, how the fuck did you do this? And China's going like, all right, this is how we did it. So they gradually do that. Much like the Nazis were looking at us going like, hey, how did you do that shit to the native Americans? Because we want to do that to the Jews. Now we're going to do that. Probably what? Look it, I bet. I bet the fucking hire rub 1% cuts the people who make profit off a war and everybody's misery. I bet they are envious of the Internet in, in Red China. The way you know Uri is envious when somebody drives down the street by you in a fucking Ferrari, you know, I dunno. Alright, well I'm, I'm good for that person that put that up there.

Speaker 2:          00:49:52       Um, that's fucking disgusting. I wonder what was linked to it though. You know what I mean? Cause it's never just in defensive, all of those fucking people. It's never just one thing, which is another bullshit thing. You know, when, when they vote for something, they shouldn't just be one thing. Should we or should we not vote for solar power? It should just be about that. But then they tag all this other shit onto it, onto the bill, which is fucking, that's how they get everything through. And then it's always like, yeah, you know, something completely fucked up. And then when that person goes to run for office, you know, they voted for the bill because they're into solar power. But then the, the, the thing that they, the appendix that they put onto it, they can be like, this guy doesn't take, kids should have ice fleet.

Speaker 2:          00:50:37       They voted against that. It's like, no, I voted for alternative sources of energy to bankrupt the, uh, the terrorist terrace. Um, all right. Bullying manager, dear bill, about a month ago, a lady dairy Queen Manager in Missouri was charged for involuntary manslaughter. What did she get? The guy in ice cream, headache pill. She did keep eating ice cream. Then I'll blow you. The guy fell for it and he stuck his hand under the fucking smoothie machine. The soft serve there. All right. Allegedly, the dairy queen manager was a dick to one of its employees, uh, filled with name, calling and belittling day after day. Is it a great to see women getting like positions of power and just acting exactly is fucking ridiculous as men, you know, most, most people can not handle a position of power. I mean, look at me. Look at the power I have with this podcast. I don't have the decency to put on pants. I mean pajamas and slippers. I am part of the problem. Um, one incident report lead, the manager threw a burger on the floor after he made it incorrectly and then made the 17 year old clean it up.

Speaker 2:          00:51:51       The kid was also a victim of bullying at school as well. Um, none of this is going to justify this kid harming this. This boss, you, you quit the job, uh, but voiced most of the bullying but foist most. That doesn't make sense. But most of the bullying happened, happened at work. What happened to this person who wrote the sentence they wrote but voiced most of the bullying happening at work and singling, singling out his boss, his boss. Okay, well eventually the kid ended up shooting himself in the head. Oh boy. He did not see that coming. Yes, I know. It's a sad story that Oh, that happens too often. Does it, do a lot of people get bullied at dairy queen and then blow their brains out? I thought that was a happy place. Oh, they've got soft serve ice cream. What could go wrong? But the town wanted to hold somebody responsible for a suicide. The authorities air quote investigated and interviewed people and his stories of being teased and made fun of where retold the cops ultimately came to the conclusion that his dairy queen boss was the reason the kid is dead now by Jesus Christ. Wait a minute. Hey, that's a little bit of an overreach. And she was charged with secondary involuntary manslaughter.

Speaker 1:          00:53:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:17       After me hearing this story, is that proper English? Should it be after I heard this story after for me, after hearing this story, I'm waiting for somebody on TV to state these. The obvious, this is bullshit. How can you blame someone for another person killing themselves? It's not my fault. How other people handled my insults. You've been called Billy fat tits. How many times? Well, first of all, I'm not 17. All right. Um, I think enough bullying can drive somebody to it. It depends on how it is and how fragile somebody is, but uh, there's just so many fucking variables involved. Like, what had the person, let's say this person was a bully at dairy queen, like what happened to them as a kid that made them the way they are? How old is this person? Because, um, for me, I just feel that, I honestly believe that, you know, people in their twenties, for the most part, it's just, it's, that is the most purest form of the direct results of the parents that you had is now you're out in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       They're not there to be like, hey, you know, knock it off. You know, and you have to make decisions for yourself and you go around. Like, I know when I was in my twenties, I took, without realizing it, I was taking my, everybody takes a childhood out on people in their twenties, cause you don't know what the fuck you doing. So hopefully you had a good one. So you take in and out on people is, um, is you're actually a nice person like Pete Holmes, his character on crashing, by the way, I fucking love that show. Um, TJ Miller, um, rd Lang and I believe the guy's name is George Bazell. Uh, I watched the first three fucking episodes and they were killing me. And their interaction with Pete's character is great and I can't wait. I love Pete Holmes. I cannot wait to break his balls about his character on that show though. I really gonna break his balls like Pete. Is that how you see yourself? I'm just a nice guy who tries to do nice things. It's like Pete, you're a fucking lunatic. Just like the rest of us.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Um, anyways, oh, I can't wait to, I, they, one of my favorite things in this business is teasing him cause he can fucking take it. But a, you gotta check out crashing. Uh, John Apatow, uh, Pete Holmes, uh, Joey Roses, Joe to Rosa, uh, rode on the show to a Mike Birbiglia, I believe, wrote on the show. There's a bunch of people, a comics and everything and comics on it. I saw agree a bunch, dove Davidoff all these comics, Marina Franklin. It's just fucking them. It's a such an amazing show. Cause I remember when he came to New York, um, as that wide eyed kid and I'd actually worked with him. And, uh, this comedy club in Peoria, Illinois. That doesn't exist anymore. I worked with him at Brewster's when he was still married. I believe. Maybe he'd just gotten divorced. I can't fucking remember. I've told this story before. We went to go see the ring and we, and we were the only two people in the movie theater and I hate that.

Speaker 2:          00:56:36       That's that, that is the detail because that sounds fake. That's the only time that it's ever happened. We walked in, it was a shitty movie theater. We were two comedians. It was the middle of the fucking, there was like two or the afternoon when we saw the ring on like a Thursday afternoon and a shitty movie theater. And I swear to God, we the only two fucking people there. Um, that movie stayed with me certain with Blair, which stayed with me. That one stayed with me. Um, some of them just too, just, they just fucking creep me out and they stay with me. Um, for whatever reason, Jordan peals movie when that, that guy comes running, when the kids smoking the cigarette and then the guy comes fucking just run it up full speed at Adam. That fucked with me. That's for whatever reason that fucking stayed with me.

Speaker 2:          00:57:22       Um, anyways, there's like shit I think about when I go to my car at night, even though I know it's not real. I just think about what if that fucking dude just came running just like that at the last second. Made a right turn in front of me. Um, anyways, how the fuck did I get onto all of that shit? Talking about this poor kid who killed himself. Um, anyways, he can send that throwing. Uh, okay. What did he say? You've been called Billy fat tits. How many times and by how many peoples you kill yourself. Over half of your listeners will go to jail. How is this a law? How many times can you call somebody fat before it's against the law and can we stop saying bullying? It's just being teased and made fun of. That's not true, man. That isn't, that's not true.

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       That's not true. It depends on the level and it depends on the intent. I'm in, all of this shit will be really hard to prove, but like, you know, there's, what it is, sir, is you have to have empathy here. And what I'm guessing is, is that you are more the person teasing than getting teased. Um, and maybe you are a little bit more of a stronger person the same way somebody else might've just been better at math than you. Um, I know looking back, you know, in my high school, I know that there was, uh, you know, there was kids that got it really fucking bad, really bad and uh, you know, one of them, you know, killed himself a few years later. And I remember thinking back, I don't know what it was based on, but certainly did not have a good experience in high school the last couple of years.

Speaker 2:          00:59:01       And it's one of those things because kids are kids and they don't, they don't understand it. Um, it's a really common extinct. But I would say at this kid was also bullied at school. And then if this person was a content at dairy queen, I mean it's sort of an amalgam of all of that. And then also the personalities. People are born, they're just really sensitive, shy people and uh, they don't know how to handle it. And if you're prone to depression, shit, I imagine that, you know, that sort of the perfect storm. So, um, anyways, he goes, they throw this bullying word around like it's an epidemic sweeping all these heartless millennials. Uh, we've all been made fun of before. We've all been called names ever since we were little kids. Um, you sound like an older person like me and you just doing the day.

Speaker 2:          00:59:51       These kids today, these millennials and they'll make God, they're fragile little flowers and they're not all like that dude. You think they still net them mean kid. You still don't think there's this, you know, the big guy just fucking beaten on. There's always going to be the bigger kid beating on the younger kids, the smaller kids or whatever. Um, we need to let this continue. It builds character. If you were always given a trophy, you're all over the map here. Dude. It only told compliments you, you wouldn't be a comedian. Um, no. Now you speaking for me, you would still be working in the carpeted area discussing which I never worked there. Your favorite route to work in the morning. All I'm saying is that we're all becoming weak pussies because of laws like this and nobody's addressing it. But you can bill with your soon to be Emmy winning podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:00:41       You can champion this cause for all hours sake or whatever. I hope to see important suit. Thanks. I have to be honest with you sir. All right. I think, uh, the true sign of maturity, aside from on one side, being able to take a good ribbing and, and learning how to have more of a sense of humor by yourself and also learning that whatever's happening today is not the end of the fucking world. And that, you know, it's probably kids listening right now. They get bullied. This is the thing, all of that shit. It's, you're not going to see any of those fucking people ever again after high school. And your whole fucking life is going to be determined by you and the decisions you make, and you have 100% control over that. So, um, you know, and I think a lot of times people get bullied up the side from the fact that they're, that they're just smaller, weaker.

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       They just seem like targets. I think, you know, sometimes when people see somebody that's talented, um, they'll go after him and, uh, so you've gotta make sure that you kind of push all that shit away. But the other side, I think that really shows that you're mature. His, uh, his empathy, you know what I mean? Uh, it certainly helps. Like, uh, I mean, I can think it's easy to do that. The rent that you did, I understand there's a lot of truth in some of the shit that he's saying, but, um, you know, it's not all just like, oh, I'll learn how to fucking take it. You fucking pussy stop wearing a helmet when you ride bicycles and shit. And I'm guilty of saying stuff like that. I understand where you're coming from, but like a, you know, so what, what is, what, what, why do you think this kid killed himself?

Speaker 2:          01:02:27       You know what I mean? Do you think if that shit wasn't happening, the kids still would have made it's a possibility on our own fit kid had clinical depression? I have no idea. But I agree with you to try from what you've written for the sentences where the [inaudible] was spelled correctly. Uh, it seems like that kid was just having a miserable experience. I mean, I can't imagine if you were getting bullied all day at school and then you'd go, okay, well now I'm going to get a job. This might be a ray of light to what the future is going to be, where I'll be at work and maybe people are nicer and then it just becomes somebody else screaming at you. Um, you know, when you're 17 years old, if it sucks at school and it sucks at the dairy queen, you work at that is your world and, uh, you don't have an ability to step out of it and you can downward spiral.

Speaker 2:          01:03:17       Like once again, I don't think that they should put it all on this person, but that's a a, it's a fucking terrible story. Um, but I, I don't think this backlash to the two to political correctness to then go the other fucking go the all the way back once again to what caused political correctness. All you fucking guys ain't pull you bootstrapped up. Stop being a fucking pussy. You fucking millennial flour. It's guys like you that are fucking ranting against fucking political correctness. It's constant. Like you that created a political correctness, you know, white guys that tell it like it is, is there anything worse than the white guy that I know. I always say that I fucking, that's, that is, to me, that is the most boring fucking mindset you could possibly have. Hey, I'm a white guy. Everything's set up for me. Let me tell you who, you know, just not have the advantages that I have, why you need the toughen up.

Speaker 2:          01:04:16       You know, as I slept in my bunk bed and my Culdesac, those were the years that I really became a tough guy. Um, anyways, so, yeah, I mean I, that's just a terrible story. I, I, I, I hope that, you know, something good can come out of it cause that's, you know, it's very rare that, you know, you bring up an ice cream store and something like that happens. I was all excited. You know, I love fucking dairy queen. You know, my wife loves dairy queen. We are dairy queen people, uh, cleaning up. All right, dear bill t ability red faced in, um, I'm 52 years old. Congratulations. Most people don't live that long or a lot of people don't make it that far. Uh, I'm 52 years old, but a life of drinking has made me look 62. I still drink and I smoke weed all day.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       Jesus guys going hard. You drink and you smoke weed all day. I wasn't there for my kids growing up. They had to go through a lot because of my mine and my wife's addiction problems. JZ. I imagine they did. Uh, let's say Jesus is two depressing ones in a row. What does this doctor, Phil, you need to stop drinking, smoking, Wade and pay attention to your children. Crowd goes crazy. Another episode in the can and he gets more syndication money and then that fucking drunk walks out the door, continues to do what the fuck he's doing. And Dr Phil Looks Great. Uh, let's just say the fact that they turned out, let's just face the fact that they, the way they turned out has nothing to do with me. I take no credit for the people they are today. Well, nor should you with the exception of any lingering anxiety.

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       I May, I may have caused them. I mean if you're the kind of dad that you're saying you were, yeah, you kind of own up to it, which is good I guess. Unless you're doing that like, so everybody goes, no, no, you are actually, you're good. Dad. All depends on what your, your reasoning is. Um, I don't live close to my daughters, but I am starting to miss them. Um, I feel like they'd be better without me at this point. Nah, I'm at a fork in the road. I can either clean up and realize that my life isn't over set my phone buzzing. Oh, and he spills his first glass of water the day. All right. I can fucking call this back in a minute. Um, all right. Where am I? Um, I can either clean up and realize that my life isn't over and then I may have the grandchildren one day that I want to have a relationship with or just enjoy my responsibility.

Speaker 2:          01:06:45       Less life, uh, responsibility, less life until I die. That sounds morbid in the answer. May seem more obvious to someone else, but there was a good chance my kids won't care either way at this point. And I don't want to disrupt them by being the annoying, hey, can I come back into your life person quitting won't be easy and I'm trying to weigh my options. What should I do? A, you should get clean and sober and own up to everything. Apologize to your kids and then understand that it's your kid's choice whether they want you back in their life or not. And uh, that's what they decide that they don't. You have to be a man about it and I wouldn't pao and go back to drinking and smoking. Um, you can totally clean your life up and you can put years back on the odometer, you know, or you can be dead in 10 years.

Speaker 2:          01:07:33       I mean, it's up to you. I mean, it's pretty a pretty easy, easy choice. But I would say the first thing you should do is try to get help and, um, I dunno, I got to tell you, dude, not drinking and all that type of stuff. You feel like you feel like 1 million bucks, you know, four days of not drinking alone. When you wake up in the morning, you're going to feel 20 years younger, you know? So, uh, I don't know. You want to keep feeling like shit. It's gonna. That's gonna be a brutal death bed dude. Just sitting there waiting for someone to show up, hoping someone's going to show up. You don't want that man. You're only 52. You know, you got a lot of years left. You got a quarter of a century left if you, if you eat right in a exercise. And all of that type of stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:08:17       So, you know, it's up to you, man. You're an adult. I hope you make a positive choice. Jesus Christ. All Right, yogurt. Does anybody die in this one? Um, maybe it's more than you want to bother, but it's really easy to make your own yogurt. Uh, then you know what's in it. I'm not going to down going to load you down with links, but this is a pretty decent start. Yeah. And they send me this fucking video of this woman immediately. I'm envious of her cha of her kitchen and the fact that she gets us, she can speak more than one language cause I think that's cool as shit. But, uh, she's making yogurt and one of the things, one of the ingredients she goes is very simple yogurt. One of the ingredients she makes, one of the ingredients to her yogurt is yogurt.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       I'm going to show you how to make chicken. All right? Get Salt and pepper, put it in a ball and then go to the store and buy some chicken. Some already made chicken. I don't get it. I don't get that video. Um, I'm fine with just the Greek yogurt, probiotic. It tastes fucking weird as shit. The plain stuff. And after a while you're going addicted to and you love it. So, um, I appreciate it. I will post the link. It's a great fucking steal. I love about that stove. It's got four burners and then it's got the griddle in the middle. Oh, I love that. Oh, I want that stove. So fucking bed. All right. Fun Car to drive Billy sports car. Uh, you were talking about cars on Thursday. The most fun car I ever drove was a 1968 Alpha Romeo sedan. Not this spider. Google it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       Short throw, manual shift. My favorite fucking thing ever handles greats. Um, yeah, I actually, um, I actually looked up the car though. There was only youtube videos, pictures of them. Nobody had this sedan. I'll tell you one of the best, most fun shifting cars I ever drove was my older brother had a, had like a 1981, two door Toyota Tercel for speed and that fucking thing. It was so tight it would do, you had to move that fucking thing. Like, I swear to God, like an inch and a half and you were in another gear and uh, even though it was a four cylinder by today's standards, you know, it was a pretty goofy looking car, sand high up off in shit. But it was funniest shit to drive. We used to have these jobs with, you know, we had paper routes from the time we were in third grade right up til ninth grade.

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       And then when we got our licenses we just delivered bigger routes and we drove around beating the shit out of our cars and that was the most fun car to drive cause you could stack it the back seat up with all the papers and um, and dude it was a Toyota and that's when Toyota was really competing with the American shit. And um, the only way that they were going to get it. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me too? This is how fucked up my houses. I just spilled water and I was just like, you know what? On the hardwood floors, I'm going to finish the podcast. I'm almost done. I got to take. I can't believe this just happened and I'm thinking that's the fucking water. It's going to be on the floor. It's just going to be a puddle. This is what just happened. I just looked down at the floor. I feel I spilled a full glass of water. It's all gone. It's not there anymore. Sorry. I put the headphones back on the fuck out of here. The floor isn't even wet. This is what happens and this is only one part of my house. If the house is settled so much. My house is 94 years old this year. It's settled so much that I swear to God, the water rolled down the hill and the baseboard. This is space between the floor ports in the baseboard and it just rolled into the cracks and disappeared. This can't be fucking happen

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       on fucking believable.

Speaker 2:          01:12:13       Well, I've got it now. I'm wondering where did that go? Is the ceiling below now? Gonna have all watermarks on it. I don't think that's enough water to do it,

Speaker 2:          01:12:22       dude. I'm telling you. I'm telling you right fucking now. Okay. The next house I get is going to be fucking, if it's an old house, it's going to be, we looked at one this weekend where we should we just look into when it would bullshit. You know what I mean? Um, but just trying to see what's out there, what the prices are and that type of shit do. We looked at one, it was turnkey. That's what I want. And for all you people never bought a house. That means the whole fucking thing has been redone. I don't give a fuck that somebody flipping it. I don't give a shit that they're trying to make fucking 500 fucking thousand dollars in two months. I don't care. The fact that they're going to strip it all the way down, all the way down, all the piping, the sewer line right out to the fucking street. Everything's brand new. That's the house I'm getting. That's the house I'm getting and that's the house I'm dying. And when I died, the fucking next person can deal with whatever bullshit I did to it. I just spilled a full glass of fucking water and it disappeared like a magic trick. All right, that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves up. Checking on you on a on Thursday. Go, Bro. It's.
