everything we've been doing so far has
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.300
everything we've been doing so far has
involved systems of equations in this

involved systems of equations in this
video we're gonna tackle the problem of

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500
video we're gonna tackle the problem of
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.419
video we're gonna tackle the problem of
systems of linear inequalities linear

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
systems of linear inequalities linear
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.560
systems of linear inequalities linear
inequalities what we're going to do is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
inequalities what we're going to do is
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.900
inequalities what we're going to do is
essentially figure out all of the points

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
essentially figure out all of the points
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.470
essentially figure out all of the points
on the XY plane that satisfy a system of

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
on the XY plane that satisfy a system of
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.910
on the XY plane that satisfy a system of
linear inequalities so let's start with

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
linear inequalities so let's start with
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.150
linear inequalities so let's start with
our first linear inequality let's say we

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
our first linear inequality let's say we
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.840
our first linear inequality let's say we
have 2x minus 3y is less than or equal

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
have 2x minus 3y is less than or equal
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.500
have 2x minus 3y is less than or equal
to 21 and we've seen how to graph this

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
to 21 and we've seen how to graph this
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.410
to 21 and we've seen how to graph this
before you can just graph this line and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
before you can just graph this line and
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720
before you can just graph this line and
then figure out what the less than part

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
then figure out what the less than part
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030
then figure out what the less than part
means so let's just rearrange this into

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
means so let's just rearrange this into
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790
means so let's just rearrange this into
slope intercept form so if you subtract

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
slope intercept form so if you subtract
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.790
slope intercept form so if you subtract
2x from both sides minus 2x minus 2x

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
2x from both sides minus 2x minus 2x
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.029
2x from both sides minus 2x minus 2x
subtract 2x from both sides we get

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
subtract 2x from both sides we get
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.689
subtract 2x from both sides we get
negative 3y these cancel out is less

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
negative 3y these cancel out is less
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150
negative 3y these cancel out is less
than or equal to 21 minus 2x or we could

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
than or equal to 21 minus 2x or we could
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.710
than or equal to 21 minus 2x or we could
say negative 2x plus 21 and then we can

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
say negative 2x plus 21 and then we can
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.469
say negative 2x plus 21 and then we can
divide both sides by negative 3 and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
divide both sides by negative 3 and
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630
divide both sides by negative 3 and
remember when you divide by a negative

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
remember when you divide by a negative
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.230
remember when you divide by a negative
number you multiply by a negative number

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240
number you multiply by a negative number
 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.780
number you multiply by a negative number
you swap the inequality so you get

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
you swap the inequality so you get
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.609
you swap the inequality so you get
negative 3y over negative 3 is greater

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
negative 3y over negative 3 is greater
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.310
negative 3y over negative 3 is greater
than or equal to negative 2 over

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
than or equal to negative 2 over
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.469
than or equal to negative 2 over
negative 3x plus 21 over negative 3 and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
negative 3x plus 21 over negative 3 and
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.440
negative 3x plus 21 over negative 3 and
so this equation becomes y is greater

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
so this equation becomes y is greater
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.649
so this equation becomes y is greater
than or equal to two-thirds X minus 7 so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
than or equal to two-thirds X minus 7 so
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080
than or equal to two-thirds X minus 7 so
that's this first inequality right there

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
that's this first inequality right there
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.520
that's this first inequality right there
let's graph it I'll graph it in orange

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530
let's graph it I'll graph it in orange
 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.920
let's graph it I'll graph it in orange
y-intercept is negative 7 so 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
y-intercept is negative 7 so 1 2 3 4 5 6
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.910
y-intercept is negative 7 so 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 and it's slope is positive 2/3 so when

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
7 and it's slope is positive 2/3 so when
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.410
7 and it's slope is positive 2/3 so when
you run 3 you go up 2 when you run 3 you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
you run 3 you go up 2 when you run 3 you
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.730
you run 3 you go up 2 when you run 3 you
go up 2 when you run 3 you go up 2 and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
go up 2 when you run 3 you go up 2 and
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490
go up 2 when you run 3 you go up 2 and
in this direction if you go back 3 you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
in this direction if you go back 3 you
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100
in this direction if you go back 3 you
go down 2 so the line will look

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
go down 2 so the line will look
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.589
go down 2 so the line will look
something like this

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599
something like this
 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.770
something like this
the line will look

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
the line will look
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.300
the line will look
like that keep going and since we have y

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
like that keep going and since we have y
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.050
like that keep going and since we have y
is greater than or equal to essentially

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
is greater than or equal to essentially
 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.680
is greater than or equal to essentially
this line the area that satisfies this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
this line the area that satisfies this
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.470
this line the area that satisfies this
inequality is going to be above the line

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480
inequality is going to be above the line
 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.190
inequality is going to be above the line
at any point for any X for any X you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200
at any point for any X for any X you
 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.590
at any point for any X for any X you
pick this is the value two-thirds X

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600
pick this is the value two-thirds X
 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.140
pick this is the value two-thirds X
minus seven so if Y is going to be

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150
minus seven so if Y is going to be
 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.550
minus seven so if Y is going to be
greater that it'll be all the points

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
greater that it'll be all the points
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.490
greater that it'll be all the points
above that so just this constraint right

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
above that so just this constraint right
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500
above that so just this constraint right
here Y is greater than two-thirds X

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510
here Y is greater than two-thirds X
 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.240
here Y is greater than two-thirds X
minus seven or this constraint which is

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
minus seven or this constraint which is
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.940
minus seven or this constraint which is
the same thing two X minus three Y is

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950
the same thing two X minus three Y is
 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.699
the same thing two X minus three Y is
less than or equal to 21 will give you

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709
less than or equal to 21 will give you
 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.830
less than or equal to 21 will give you
all of this area up here I don't want to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840
all of this area up here I don't want to
 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.650
all of this area up here I don't want to
draw it too dark just yet so we'll give

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660
draw it too dark just yet so we'll give
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.630
draw it too dark just yet so we'll give
you all of this area all the way above

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640
you all of this area all the way above
 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.900
you all of this area all the way above
this line now let's add another

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
this line now let's add another
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.390
this line now let's add another
inequality to the mix let me do that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400
inequality to the mix let me do that
 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.180
inequality to the mix let me do that
other inequality in blue let's say I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190
other inequality in blue let's say I
 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.240
other inequality in blue let's say I
have X plus 4y let's make it less than

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250
have X plus 4y let's make it less than
 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.770
have X plus 4y let's make it less than
six so the problem I have written here

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
six so the problem I have written here
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.420
six so the problem I have written here
as less than or equal to but I want to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
as less than or equal to but I want to
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.580
as less than or equal to but I want to
mix it up with a couple of a couple of

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
mix it up with a couple of a couple of
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.289
mix it up with a couple of a couple of
with an equal sign and a couple of them

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299
with an equal sign and a couple of them
 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.970
with an equal sign and a couple of them
with without an equal sign just so we

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980
with without an equal sign just so we
 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670
with without an equal sign just so we
remember how to graph these things and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
remember how to graph these things and
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.920
remember how to graph these things and
so let's put this again into slope

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
so let's put this again into slope
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.110
so let's put this again into slope
intercept form so we can subtract X from

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120
intercept form so we can subtract X from
 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.770
intercept form so we can subtract X from
both sides then the left-hand side just

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
both sides then the left-hand side just
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.530
both sides then the left-hand side just
becomes 4y the right-hand side becomes

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
becomes 4y the right-hand side becomes
 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.070
becomes 4y the right-hand side becomes
negative X plus 6 and then we can divide

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080
negative X plus 6 and then we can divide
 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.120
negative X plus 6 and then we can divide
both sides by 4 divide both sides by 4

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130
both sides by 4 divide both sides by 4
 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.449
both sides by 4 divide both sides by 4
and we get Y is less than negative 1/4 X

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
and we get Y is less than negative 1/4 X
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.720
and we get Y is less than negative 1/4 X
plus 6 so just like the first equation

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730
plus 6 so just like the first equation
 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.539
plus 6 so just like the first equation
let's graph the line the gridline is

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549
let's graph the line the gridline is
 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.910
let's graph the line the gridline is
well the y-intercept is positive 6 so

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920
well the y-intercept is positive 6 so
 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.580
well the y-intercept is positive 6 so
one two three four five six and then the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590
one two three four five six and then the
 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.069
one two three four five six and then the
slope is negative 1/4 so every time we

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079
slope is negative 1/4 so every time we
 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.530
slope is negative 1/4 so every time we
run by four one two three four we're

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540
run by four one two three four we're
 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.620
run by four one two three four we're
gonna go down one so you run by four one

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630
gonna go down one so you run by four one
 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.340
gonna go down one so you run by four one
two three four you go down one you run

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350
two three four you go down one you run
 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.949
two three four you go down one you run
by four one two three four you're gonna

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959
by four one two three four you're gonna
 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.530
by four one two three four you're gonna
go down one so this line is actually

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540
go down one so this line is actually
 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.150
go down one so this line is actually
going off the table if you go back by

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160
going off the table if you go back by
 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.920
going off the table if you go back by
four one two three four you gonna go up

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930
four one two three four you gonna go up
 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.170
four one two three four you gonna go up
by one and since we're not actually

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180
by one and since we're not actually
 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.670
by one and since we're not actually
including the line we're gonna have to

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680
including the line we're gonna have to
 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.600
including the line we're gonna have to
draw a dotted line

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610
draw a dotted line
 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.719
draw a dotted line
here so it's gonna be a dotted line draw

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729
here so it's gonna be a dotted line draw
 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.029
here so it's gonna be a dotted line draw
my best try my best to draw a dotted

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039
my best try my best to draw a dotted
 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.159
my best try my best to draw a dotted
line and actually let me continue that

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169
line and actually let me continue that
 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.600
line and actually let me continue that
previous line there cuz I actually want

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610
previous line there cuz I actually want
 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.420
previous line there cuz I actually want
to show where they intersect it goes a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430
to show where they intersect it goes a
 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.490
to show where they intersect it goes a
little bit off of our graph paper but

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500
little bit off of our graph paper but
 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.260
little bit off of our graph paper but
the graph of this equation is that right

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270
the graph of this equation is that right
 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.369
the graph of this equation is that right
that I did a dotted line because it's

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379
that I did a dotted line because it's
 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.619
that I did a dotted line because it's
not less than or equal to it's just less

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629
not less than or equal to it's just less
 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.050
not less than or equal to it's just less
than so this inequality if I were to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060
than so this inequality if I were to
 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.089
than so this inequality if I were to
graph it it would be the area below the

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099
graph it it would be the area below the
 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.790
graph it it would be the area below the
line it would be the area below the area

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800
line it would be the area below the area
 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.209
line it would be the area below the area
below the line right there that's what

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219
below the line right there that's what
 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.059
below the line right there that's what
satisfies this inequality for any X this

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069
satisfies this inequality for any X this
 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.909
satisfies this inequality for any X this
is the value of that line but the Y's

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919
is the value of that line but the Y's
 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.469
is the value of that line but the Y's
that satisfy it are the Y's that are

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479
that satisfy it are the Y's that are
 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.589
that satisfy it are the Y's that are
below the line now if I were to ask you

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599
below the line now if I were to ask you
 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.839
below the line now if I were to ask you
if I were to have a system where I have

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849
if I were to have a system where I have
 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.980
if I were to have a system where I have
2x minus 3y is less than or equal to 21

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990
2x minus 3y is less than or equal to 21
 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.790
2x minus 3y is less than or equal to 21
and another equation or inequality I

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800
and another equation or inequality I
 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.740
and another equation or inequality I
should say these aren't equations these

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750
should say these aren't equations these
 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.269
should say these aren't equations these
are inequalities they're not equal to

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279
are inequalities they're not equal to
 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.809
are inequalities they're not equal to
each other

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819
each other
 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.540
each other
the other one is X plus 4y is less than

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550
the other one is X plus 4y is less than
 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.420
the other one is X plus 4y is less than
6 and if I were to ask you what X's and

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430
6 and if I were to ask you what X's and
 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.230
6 and if I were to ask you what X's and
Y's satisfy both of these inequalities

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240
Y's satisfy both of these inequalities
 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.369
Y's satisfy both of these inequalities
well you say well gee it's just going to

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:38.379
well you say well gee it's just going to
 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.170
well you say well gee it's just going to
be the overlap of their solution sets

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180
be the overlap of their solution sets
 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.719
be the overlap of their solution sets
right it's going to be the area in the

the same drill we put this in a slope
 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.529
the same drill we put this in a slope
intercept form so you get Y is greater

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539
intercept form so you get Y is greater
 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.829
intercept form so you get Y is greater
than or equal to negative 3x minus 4 I

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:31.839
than or equal to negative 3x minus 4 I
 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.260
than or equal to negative 3x minus 4 I
just subtracted 3x from both sides we

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270
just subtracted 3x from both sides we
 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.870
just subtracted 3x from both sides we
can graph this line its y-intercept is 1

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880
can graph this line its y-intercept is 1
 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.159
can graph this line its y-intercept is 1
2 3 negative 4 it has a slope

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169
2 3 negative 4 it has a slope
 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.679
2 3 negative 4 it has a slope
of negative three so every time you go

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689
of negative three so every time you go
 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.719
of negative three so every time you go
one to the right you go down three one

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729
one to the right you go down three one
 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.689
one to the right you go down three one
two three if you go one to the left if

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699
two three if you go one to the left if
 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.939
two three if you go one to the left if
you go negative one in the X direction

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949
you go negative one in the X direction
 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.409
you go negative one in the X direction
you go up three so you go negative 1 1 2

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419
you go up three so you go negative 1 1 2
 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:01.379
you go up three so you go negative 1 1 2
3 negative 1 1 2 3 negative 1 1 2 3 so

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389
3 negative 1 1 2 3 negative 1 1 2 3 so
 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:03.239
3 negative 1 1 2 3 negative 1 1 2 3 so
this line right here this line right

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:03.249
this line right here this line right
 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:05.189
this line right here this line right
there it's going to look like this

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199
there it's going to look like this
 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.189
there it's going to look like this
it's going to look like that trying my

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199
it's going to look like that trying my
 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.260
it's going to look like that trying my
best to draw it that's that right there

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270
best to draw it that's that right there
 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.390
best to draw it that's that right there
and I can have it in bold I don't have

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400
and I can have it in bold I don't have
 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.350
and I can have it in bold I don't have
to do a dotted line because I have a

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360
to do a dotted line because I have a
 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.659
to do a dotted line because I have a
greater than or equal to and so what are

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669
greater than or equal to and so what are
 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.339
greater than or equal to and so what are
all the Y's that are greater than this

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349
all the Y's that are greater than this
 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.670
all the Y's that are greater than this
line well for any x value you pick for

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680
line well for any x value you pick for
 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.829
line well for any x value you pick for
any x value pick the value of negative 3

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:22.839
any x value pick the value of negative 3
 

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.499
any x value pick the value of negative 3
X plus negative 3 X minus 4 is going to

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:25.509
X plus negative 3 X minus 4 is going to
 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.749
X plus negative 3 X minus 4 is going to
be this and we care about the Y values

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759
be this and we care about the Y values
 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.249
be this and we care about the Y values
that are greater than that so it'll be

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259
that are greater than that so it'll be
 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.279
that are greater than that so it'll be
above the line so for just this

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:32.289
above the line so for just this
 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:34.140
above the line so for just this
inequality will be everything above the

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150
inequality will be everything above the
 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.719
inequality will be everything above the
line and then if someone were to come

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729
line and then if someone were to come
 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.269
line and then if someone were to come
along and say all right tell me show me

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:39.279
along and say all right tell me show me
 

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.209
along and say all right tell me show me
graph me all of the points on the XY

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:42.219
graph me all of the points on the XY
 

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:45.350
graph me all of the points on the XY
plane that satisfy this system of

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360
plane that satisfy this system of
 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.519
plane that satisfy this system of
inequalities what would you tell them

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:47.529
inequalities what would you tell them
 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:49.499
inequalities what would you tell them
well it would be the overlap of their

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:49.509
well it would be the overlap of their
 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.389
well it would be the overlap of their
solution sets so the part of the XY

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:51.399
solution sets so the part of the XY
 

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.189
solution sets so the part of the XY
plane that exists in all of their

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199
plane that exists in all of their
 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.929
plane that exists in all of their
solution sets so it's above the orange

00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:54.939
solution sets so it's above the orange
 

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:56.850
solution sets so it's above the orange
line right we have to be above the

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:56.860
line right we have to be above the
 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.800
line right we have to be above the
orange line right and we graph that

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810
orange line right and we graph that
 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.769
orange line right and we graph that
before it was all in in orange before

00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:01.779
before it was all in in orange before
 

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:05.399
before it was all in in orange before
because we're above the line 2 X 2/3 X

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:05.409
because we're above the line 2 X 2/3 X
 

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:07.499
because we're above the line 2 X 2/3 X
minus 7 it might trick a little bit

00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:07.509
minus 7 it might trick a little bit
 

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:08.790
minus 7 it might trick a little bit
because it has a less than here but when

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800
because it has a less than here but when
 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.769
because it has a less than here but when
you put it in the slope-intercept form

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:10.779
you put it in the slope-intercept form
 

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:11.909
you put it in the slope-intercept form
you know for greater than so it's

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919
you know for greater than so it's
 

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.399
you know for greater than so it's
everything above this line which was all

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:14.409
everything above this line which was all
 

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:17.519
everything above this line which was all
of that over there everything below this

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:17.529
of that over there everything below this
 

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:19.559
of that over there everything below this
line below the blue line and not

00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:19.569
line below the blue line and not
 

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:21.360
line below the blue line and not
including the blue line and everything

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.370
including the blue line and everything
 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.469
including the blue line and everything
above the green line so it's going to be

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479
above the green line so it's going to be
 

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:31.499
above the green line so it's going to be
this area right over here is the

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:31.509
this area right over here is the
 

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:33.230
this area right over here is the
solution set and we're going to include

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240
solution set and we're going to include
 

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.790
solution set and we're going to include
this boundary right here and we're going

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800
this boundary right here and we're going
 

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.699
this boundary right here and we're going
to include that boundary right there and

00:08:38.699 --> 00:08:38.709
to include that boundary right there and
 

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.610
to include that boundary right there and
since I engineered the problem to have a

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:41.620
since I engineered the problem to have a
 

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.290
since I engineered the problem to have a
less than there not a less than or equal

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:43.300
less than there not a less than or equal
 

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.660
less than there not a less than or equal
to up here is going to be a dotted line

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:45.670
to up here is going to be a dotted line
 

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.220
to up here is going to be a dotted line
because you're not actually going to

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.230
because you're not actually going to
 

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.980
because you're not actually going to
include that line anyway hopefully you

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:49.990
include that line anyway hopefully you
 

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.649
include that line anyway hopefully you
found that useful
