TIMOTHY JORDAN: On this
end of The Boardwalk,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm joined by former attorney,
human rights activist,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.490
and inclusive
designer Elise Roy.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.060
Elise, thanks for
coming to I/O Live.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.623
ELISE ROY: Thanks
for having me here.

00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:16.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: For those that
don't know your back story,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.822
you lost your hearing at age 10.

00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:18.530
ELISE ROY: I did.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Which is why we're

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.530
going to be using Google's
Live Transcribe app

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.620
to make our conversation
happen in real time.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.405
Can you tell us what it means
to be an inclusive designer?

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:28.880
ELISE ROY: Absolutely.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.420
So an inclusive
designer is someone

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.940
that helps organizations
solve problems

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.780
from the perspective of
people with disabilities,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.050
or difference.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.770
It's based on this
human-centered design tenet

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.360
that, when we
solve for extremes,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.630
we often develop
better solutions

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.720
than when we solve for average.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.210
And that might seem kind
of counter-intuitive,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.360
because the greatest
number of people

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.290
tend to hover around average.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.450
But the problem is that no
one actually is average,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.635
and so when we
solve for average,

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.760
and people are a little
bit over here, a little bit

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.510
there, there's this gap
between what we create,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.260
and what their needs are
that we're not meeting.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.950
If instead, we solve
for those extremes,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.620
then we've already
covered that gap,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.480
and we've created
something that's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.162
a lot more adaptable, and
a lot more innovative.

00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:32.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
makes so much sense to me,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.020
and it reminds me of something
else that you've talked about,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.312
which is human-centered design.

00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:37.550
Can you define that
term for us, as well?

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.780
ELISE ROY: Sure.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.340
So human-centered design is
a philosophy, a methodology,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.780
for problem solving.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870
It's based on a lot
of things that we've

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.880
taken from the
design realm, and it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.330
can be applied to almost
every realm you could imagine,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.960
from international development,
to privacy, to the sciences,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.700
to technology.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.000
And what differentiates it,
is its almost obsessive focus

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.639
on designing around the human
that we're trying to reach.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.600
So in the past, a
lot of times, we

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.750
think that when we're
trying to solve a problem,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.080
we want to get all the
experts into this room,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.360
and have them figure
out how to solve it.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
The problem with
that is, they have

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.010
one point of view, their own.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.030
So if, for example, they're
a bunch of developers,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.180
they're probably going to create
something that's very complex,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.480
and most of us don't-- you know,
the so-called average people,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.840
don't really understand.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.450
If instead we focus our
process on the people

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.660
we're trying to reach, then
we develop something that

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.945
fits their needs much better.

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:46.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.330
ELISE ROY: And so there's a
lot of empathy involved, where

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.540
you're trying to understand
what their needs are,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.930
you're following them around
in real-life situations.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.750
You want to make
sure that you're also

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.130
answering the right problem.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.880
So many people are
answering the wrong problem.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.500
ELISE ROY: And then
there's ideation,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.260
which is similar
to brainstorming,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.550
but we use a lot
of design methods

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.070
to really get people
thinking outside the box.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.340
It's a lot more powerful.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.210
We want people to
throw out crazy ideas,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.760
we want as many as
they can think of.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.470
And then, we prototype,
which is a lo-fi solution

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.430
that we know we're going
to mess up with, you know?

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.480
But that's the purpose of it,
is to fail and to learn from it.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.340
And then the last step is to
implement it, and make sure

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.885
that it's sustainable.

00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:47.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I love this
idea of having practices

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.300
and mechanisms for
helping experts get out

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.055
of their perspective.

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:53.930
Because when you bring
an expert in the room,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.780
you're asking them to give
their expert opinion, not

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.980
their general opinion.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.275
And that's so focused
most of the time, right?

00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:02.000
ELISE ROY: Exactly, exactly.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.430
And that's also why I
love inclusive design,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.110
because that brings people even
further outside of their tunnel

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.330
vision.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes, I see.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.870
This reminds me of another
quote of yours, if I may.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.170
You said, "when we look
for gaps of exclusion,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.810
we identify opportunities
for great change."

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.820
And I find this
really inspiring.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.010
Do you have some examples
that you can share,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.810
where you see this
really clearly?

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.460
ELISE ROY: Definitely.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.380
I can give you some
Google-centric examples.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.172
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:04:28.172 --> 00:04:34.340
ELISE ROY: So Google's Chief
Internet Evangelist, Vint Cerf,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.630
he created email
for his deaf wife.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.140
And as you know, that's become a
huge thing that everyone loves.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.810
But he didn't see
it as something

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.740
that would be applied
to everyone, initially.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.010
And most people didn't think
of it in that way at first,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.330
because we have the capabilities
to talk to people on phone,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.890
and that was the way
that business was run.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.400
But slowly, we realized that
people also have this desire

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.840
to not have to keep talking
to someone on the phone,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.940
and they want to say
something real quick,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.200
and be done with it.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.110
And sometimes, we
also have this desire

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.480
to formulate our thoughts before
we communicate with someone.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.170
And email filled
those hidden desires.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.410
Another example is YouTube.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.790
They inserted closed captioning
capabilities into their media

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.940
player, which was really
amazing at the time,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.490
and closed captioning
was originally

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.110
created for the deaf, so
that they could follow along.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.740
But what YouTube realized was
that if a video has closed

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.790
captioning capabilities,
then the likelihood

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.870
of it being watched to the
end was increased by 80%.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.915
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Wow.

00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:00.700
ELISE ROY: Yes.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Is that because
there's so many situations

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.060
where you have to sound off?

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.735
ELISE ROY: Exactly.

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:05.527
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:06:05.527 --> 00:06:09.850
ELISE ROY: So the reason why
designing for inclusion works

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.170
is because we find ourselves,
as we go about our lives,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.530
in these momentary
situations where

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.490
we have a momentary disability.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.040
So we might be
carrying something,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.160
and we lose the use of our arms.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.800
If we're in a bar,
closed captioning

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.750
is helpful, because
we can't hear.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.120
And if we are in
our office, and we

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.790
want to sneak in
a Facebook video,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.298
closed captioning is helpful.

00:06:36.298 --> 00:06:37.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's awesome, those

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.080
are really great examples, and I
love how it's really connecting

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.200
this idea of designing
for the extremes,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.258
and then it becomes more
usable for everyone.

00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:47.300
ELISE ROY: Exactly, yeah.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really great.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.950
Elise, thank you so much
for joining us, and sharing

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.840
your gifts and your insights,
I really appreciate it.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.632
ELISE ROY: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:06:54.632 --> 00:06:55.720
I really appreciate it.
