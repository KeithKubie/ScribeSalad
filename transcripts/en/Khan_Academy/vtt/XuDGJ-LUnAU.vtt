00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.760
We're on problem 141.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.665
On Jane's credit card account,
the average daily balance for

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:12.292
a 30 day billing cycle-- when I
see these long paragraphs it

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:14.430
starts to give you a headache--
the average daily

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.560
balance for a 30 day billing
cycle is the average of the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.660
daily balances at the end
of each of the 30 days.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.330
OK, so they take the average
balance of each of the days

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.730
and then they average it.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.400
OK.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.940
At the beginning of a certain
30 day billing cycle, Jane's

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.850
credit card account had
a balance of $600.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.780
At the beginning.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.630
What problem is this?

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.320
141.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.230
So at the beginning, she
had a balance of $600.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.530
Fair enough.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.040
Jane made a payment of
$300 on the account

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.200
during the billing cycle.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.900
So this is the beginning of the
month, and then at some

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.960
point-- this is 30 days later--
at some point she made

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.230
a $300 payment.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.040
Fair enough.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.520
Continuing.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.370
If no other amounts were added
or subtracted from the account

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.590
during the billing cycle, what
was the average daily balance

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.930
on Jane's account for
the billing cycle?

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.590
OK, so I think I'm visualizing
this right.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.670
If we say that this is days,
where this is day 0

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.020
and this is day 30.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.300
So essentially, at the end of
every day, so at the end of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.960
day 1-- so at the beginning of a
certain billing cycle Jane's

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.050
credit card account had
a balance of $600.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.480
So we don't know.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.910
She might have paid
it on day 1.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.170
So I'm not going to put
any labels here.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350
But she starts at 600.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.580
And that's her balance until on
some day she pays off half

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.190
of it, and her balance
goes down like that.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.950
So the question is, what
is the average?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.680
So it's going to be $600 times a
certain number of days, plus

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.270
$300 times a certain number
of days, divided by 30.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.190
So let me write that down.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.940
The average is going to be equal
to $600 times however

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.610
many days she carried the $600
balance plus $300 times

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.530
however many days she kept
the $300 balance.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.580
And that's going to
be 30 minus x.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.064
If she paid after 15 days, she
would have had a $600 balance

00:02:10.064 --> 00:02:13.850
for 15 days and then she would
have had the $300 for the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.730
remainder of the days.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.180
If she paid after one day, then
you would have the $300

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.850
balance for 29 days.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.860
And all of that divided by 30.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.170
That's the average.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780
And I try to do that from the
get-go, because I just want to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.690
get my algebraic brain around
the problem so it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.540
becomes less abstract.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.705
So statement number one.

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:33.610
Let me keep that
in the screen.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.000
Statement number one tells us
Jane's payment cycle was

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.960
credited on the 21st day
of the billing cycle.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.960
So that means she had a $600--
that x in this example-- that

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.880
she had a $600 balance
for 20 days.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.735
And then on the 21st day
her balance would

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:55.790
have gone to $300.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.500
So the average is going to be
equal to $600-- she had a $600

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.200
balance for the first 20 days.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.610
Times 20 plus 300 times
the remainder days.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.315
So 300 for 10 days.

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:12.310
And that's all divided by
the number of days.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.750
So statement one, alone, is
enough to figure out her

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.130
average balance for the month.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.060
Statement two.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.740
The average daily balance
through the 25th day of the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.010
billing cycle was $540.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.550
This is interesting.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.440
So $540 is the average
through the 25th day.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.300
So if we average the first 25
days-- so her balance was $600

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.390
for x days, plus $300
for the remainder.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.910
Only the first 25 days.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.040
So it's x minus 25.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.980
So you can actually take this
equation and solve for x.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.680
It's actually a linear
equation.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.460
And I'm sure this time.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.750
Multiply both sides by
25, you get a number.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.450
And then you can distribute
this out.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.180
Add all the x terms.
Solve for x.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.190
And then once you solve for x,
you can just use this equation

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.860
up here to figure out
the average daily

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.460
balance for 30 days.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.680
So actually, each of these
statements independently are

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.630
sufficient to figure
out this problem.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.140
Actually, it was very critical
that we kind of thought about

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.350
in this term from the get-go.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.880
Otherwise this would have been
a very hard problem to get

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.900
your hand around.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.180
But it's interesting.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.900
I, strangely, really
like that problem.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.900
Anyway, next problem.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.730
142.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:43.070
If x is an integer, they're
asking is 9 to the x plus 9 to

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.150
the minus x equal to b?

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.760
Who knows?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.800
Problem one says 3 to the x plus
3 to the minus x is equal

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.450
to the square root
of b plus 2.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.560
So right from the get-go I don't
see-- I mean there's 3's

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.170
there's 9's, there seems to
be some relationship.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.890
Let's square both sides of this
equation, see if it can

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.180
reduce to something that's
useful here.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.510
So the right hand
side is easy.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.020
The left hand side, if you
square it you get 3 to the 2x.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.910
And then you get plus
2 times these

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.210
multiplied by each other.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:32.650
3 to the x, 3 to the minus x
plus 3 to the minus 2x is

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.940
equal to b plus 2.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.730
I just squared both sides.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.190
3 to the x times 3 to
the minus x, that

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.890
just equals 1, right?

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.970
You could add the exponents,
that's equal to 3 to the 0.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.630
That equals 1.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.750
Or you could view that as 3 to
the x divided by 3 to the x.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.060
Either way, that equals 1.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.335
Then you're left with 2 on both
sides of the equation.

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.970
So you can get rid of that.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.870
So then we're left with 3 to the
2x plus 3 to the minus 2x

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.340
is equal to b.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.390
But then we could
rewrite this.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.950
Think about this.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.060
3 to the 2x, that's the same
thing as 3 squared to the x.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.105
And this is the same thing as
3 to the minus 2 to the x is

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.250
equal to b.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.960
And I think now bells are
ringing in your head.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.720
3 squared, that's the same thing
as 9 to the x plus-- I

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.570
should do 3 squared
to the minus x.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.290
That's easier.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.450
Plus 9 to the minus
x is equal to b.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.870
So statement number one actually
reduced to what we

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.170
were trying to prove.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.060
So statement number one, at
least alone, is sufficient.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.500
Let's see what statement
number two gets us.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:43.970
Statement number two says x is
greater than 0 is equal to b.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.560
Let's see.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.890
The original was 9 to the
x plus 9 to the minus

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.590
x is equal to b.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.200
So they're now saying that
b is equal to 0.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.440
So how does that help us?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.130
If b is equal to 0-- let's
subtract 9 to the minus x from

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.550
both sides.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:16.740
You get 9 to the x is equal
to minus 9 to the minus x.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:23.290
Now let me multiply both sides
by negative 9 to the x.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.810
I just want to make this--
minus 9 to the x times

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.130
minus 9 to the x.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.140
I'm just trying to
simplify it.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.380
So what do you have here?

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.070
The minus sign, minus
9 to the 2x, right?

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.350
Just add the exponents.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.750
Is equal to-- a minus times a
minus is a positive-- and then

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.110
a minus x and a positive x.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.350
Add them together, you get 0.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.370
So 9 and 0 is 1.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:58.670
That simplifies to minus 9
to the 2x is equal to 1.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.013
So can this ever be true?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.670
Let me think about that.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.160
The only way something that's
non 1 or non negative 1, the

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.960
only way that when you raise it
to a power you can get a 1

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.280
is if you raise it
to a 0th power.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.900
So this is only true
if x is equal to 0.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.960
But they tell us that
x is greater than 0.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.780
So, actually, this is
an interesting case.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.570
Using the information they
gave us in problem number

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:47.940
two-- I just want to make sure
I'm not missing something.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.570
Statement one was sufficient.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.950
Can we prove--

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.900
well, we don't have
enough information

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.090
to prove the statement.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.120
We have enough information to
disprove the statement but not

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.060
to prove it.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.630
So I'm going to stick with a.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.940
I was going to say that we can
say whether the statement is

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.840
true or false, but we definitely
don't have enough

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.300
information with just statement
b to prove-- so they

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.800
want to know, right.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.190
You have to be able to prove
the statement is true.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.020
Statement two actually proves
that it is false.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.970
It doesn't prove
that it's true.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.840
It answers the question
but says no.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.520
So statement one, alone, is
sufficient to say that that

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.360
statement is true.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.660
And I'll continue in
the next video.
