00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.709
Of the many desires we might harbour in relationships,
few attract as much mockery or suspicion as

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:12.559
‘the rescue fantasy.’ According to this
longing, a lover – normally a man – becomes

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.590
unnaturally concerned with finding a partner
– normally a woman – who is suffering

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.920
and unhappy. While ostensibly interested in
assuaging her grief, the lover is in reality

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.570
more concerned with exploiting her vulnerability
– for what are assumed to be nefarious ends.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.120
He is excited, perhaps even sexually, by her
sadness and far from rescuing her, uses her

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.920
sorrow to aggrandize himself. Even before
mentioning the horse on which the rescuer

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.390
might ride into town, this is all meant to
– and does indeed – sound properly ridiculous,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.489
if not outright sinister. However, it is arguable

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.109
that the longing to assist someone does in
fact occupy a legitimate role in healthy love

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.830
for both genders – and that we should dare
to understand and recognise the appeal in

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.330
ourselves and our partners. Emotional sanity
may be wholly compatible with a powerful,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.200
intermittent attraction to distress. It is
normal if we are sometimes drawn to, and deeply

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.370
touched by, what has made someone sad, what
they find hard, what they have until now been

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.740
very alone with. It is as we discover the
fragile sides of someone that we have a sense

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.060
of what separates them from casual acquaintances
and recognise, with relief and a sense of

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.860
new loyalty, how much they share in our own
confusion and pain.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.770
We can admire people for their accomplishments,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.670
their vibrant social life or their buoyancy
of character. But in so far as we love them,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.000
it is often because of bits of them have known
suffering, because moments of their childhood

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.040
were difficult, because they can doubt themselves
and are acquainted with melancholy and isolation.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.060
Nor should it surprise us if there can be
an erotic component to our attraction, sex

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.860
being bound up with a desire to be close,
intimate and nurturing. Unless a partner allows

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.170
us to see their vulnerable core, it may feel
as if there is nothing for our love to hold

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:37.090
on to. It would be impossible to love an invulnerable
person; only, at best, to feel happy for them.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.020
That said, there is a way in which the desire
to rescue someone can go awry: when the intention

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.600
is entirely asymmetrical: when we want to
rescue but have a serious resistance to being

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.900
rescued. It is for some of us a great deal
easier to fall into the caring rather than

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.510
the dependent role. So long as we are assisting
someone else with their fears, insecurities

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.920
and shame, we can keep our own collection
of vulnerabilities out of sight and mind.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.410
Perhaps, in childhood, we did not have a chance
to come to a good accomodation with our weakness,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.480
we lacked reliable nurture, had to be strong
before we were ready and now flinch at the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.740
prospect of opening up to someone who might
betray us in the way we were once betrayed.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.190
In such circumstances, starting to look after
a lover can provide a psychologically-ideal

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.040
scenario: another’s vulnerability enables
us to get in touch with our own, while at

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.940
the same time, not requiring us to show our
weakness directly, with all the dangers involved.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.200
We can be vulnerable, as it were, by proxy;
we can be weak via another while at the same

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.560
time shielding ourselves from the risks of
abandonment and hurt.

This suggests that healthy love isn’t one

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.930
in which the desire to rescue is absent. It
is one in which the desire is honoured as

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.930
mutual; in which both parties have accepted
the risks that come from showing the other

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.281
their needy, dependent and fragile sides.
It is very kind to want to help someone; it

00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:34.410
is more heroic and truly brave at other points
to let them look after us; to show them that

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.940
we too are scared, small and ashamed, and
could be desperately hurt by their indifference

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.350
and coldness. A rescue fantasy isn’t wrong,
it is simply only ever one part, and should

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.360
never be a one-sided part, of what love really
involves.
