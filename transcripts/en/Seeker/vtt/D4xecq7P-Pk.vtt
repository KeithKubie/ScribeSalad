00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.540
You may or may not know that the Mars robot
club is about to get bigger, with the addition

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.530
of the European Trace Gas Orbiter and a new
lander or whatever.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.610
TRACE gas orbiter.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.550
Obviously it's cool.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.000
Hi there Red Planet fanatics, Trace here for
DNews!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.510
Mars might already have plenty of orbiters
and rovers hanging out.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.760
But, it’s about to gain an awesome new orbiter-lander
double-whhhhhammmmy!

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.560
ExoMars is actually two parts: the first,
is an orbiter, wonderfully named the Trace

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.949
Gas Orbiter, and a lander named Schiaparelli.

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.559
The second is a European rover and Russian
surface lander and that will launch in 2020.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.870
It’s taken that first half of the ExoMars
mission seven months to reach the red planet,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.640
but once it arrives things get really exciting.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.869
First, Schiaparelli detaches and after a 3-day
coast to Mars, it will reach the Red Planet’s

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:55.929
upper atmosphere travelling an incredible
13,000 mph (20,921 km/h).

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.769
At that speed, you could go from Los Angeles
to San Francisco in a little over a minute

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:00.769
and a half!

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.189
As it plows through the atmosphere, the lander's
heat shield will bear the brunt of the deceleration

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.550
and it only has 6 minutes to nail the perfect
touchdown.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.939
To do that, it will ditch the heat shield
and use in-built parachutes designed for the

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.939
super thin Martian atmosphere.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.560
And once it's slowed down, it will cut away
the ‘chute and kick in some rocket power

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.299
to control the final landing.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.170
The crazy bit, is at around 2 meters above
the ground, the Schiaparelli lander will hover,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.600
the engines will cut, and a specially designed
“crushable structure” will absorb the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.439
shock of the final fall like a car’s airbag.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.142
Now, the lander is a bit of an experiment
for the European Space Agency (ESA), because

00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:38.750
they've never successfully landed on Mars
before.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.310
It's not easy about half of missions to Mars
have failed.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.420
So, Schiaparelli and the TGO are, in part,
to test the technologies to safely land payloads

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.960
onto the Martian surface, and then to carry
out science once there.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.400
On the surface, should the landing be successful,
Schiaparelli will become a temporary Mars

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.689
weather station, measuring wind speed and
direction, air pressure, humidity and temperature

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.189
at its landing site.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.499
Up in orbit, the TGO will act as a relay station,
beaming back Schiaparelli’s data to Earth.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.869
Alas, the lander is only battery-powered.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.599
So it has a limited lifespan.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.659
Once it completes 2 days of tasks, its mission
will be over.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.610
Considering NASA currently has two operational
rovers on the surface, and previous landers

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.930
have carried a more sophisticated suite of
instruments to the Mars than this mission…

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.830
this new Schiaparelli lander may, at first,
seem a little lame.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.830
But, c'mon!

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.659
This lander-orbiter double-act is only the
first half of the awesome ExoMars mission

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.500
that will see a followup rover in 2020.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.170
And the TGO isn’t just a glorified telephone
operator for Schiaparelli and this future

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.170
ExoMars rover…

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.209
It will itself map methane in the Martian
atmosphere, with the hope of pinpointing where

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.129
the gas is being produced.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.129
Why?

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.770
Because methane can be produced by microbial
life, so tracking down its source could be

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.530
a huge boon to astrobiologists hoping to uncover
whether or not Mars CURRENTLY has a sub-surface

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.280
infestation of Martian bacteria!👌

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.909
This will set the stage is set for the 2020
rover arrival, and the second half of the

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.019
ExoMars mission.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.830
That future rover will to hunt down life’s
so-called "biosignatures."

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.129
Biosignatures are basically chemicals that
can be produced by biological processes, so

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.280
their detection could point to evidence of
past life on Mars, or, possibly, current life

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.340
on Mars!

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.659
The European Space Agency just sent its final
commands to the little robot lander, that

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.819
is set to separate from the TGO on Oct. 16th,
2016 -- which is next week.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.030
If all goes well, it will automatically land
near the Red Planet’s equator in a region

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.870
called Meridiani Planum.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.299
Needless to say, this is a crazy cool mission
that we’ll be talking about for years to

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.299
come.

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.380
The ExoMars mission has only just begun…

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.110
Okay, in the spirit of science, I'm excited
to announce that next week I will be a guest

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.270
judge at the Discovery Education: 3M Young
Scientist Challenge finals.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.290
You can register to watch the event live to
see the presentations from the top 10 finalists.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.829
They've been working all summer with a 3M
Scientist Mentor to create their original

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:02.829
projects.

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.030
And they are awesome.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.930
Biodegradable plastics, remote control robots
to test water quality, plastic pollution reduction

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.659
using… wait for it… pumpkins!

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.400
Seriously, I'm geeked.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.280
You can register to watch live at YoungScientistChallenge.com
/ Final Event.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.790
It's on Tuesday, October 18th from 11 am to
1 pm eastern.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.870
Did you know there's a plan to get to Mars
in three days?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.910
Yep. three.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.410
You could be at Mars by Monday!

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.130
Check out how you'd be getting there, here.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.300
I am obviously partial to the Mars Science
Lab mission, known as Curiosity mission, it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.730
was the first one I covered… but what's
your favorite mars mission?
