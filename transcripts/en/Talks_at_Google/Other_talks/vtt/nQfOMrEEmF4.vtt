00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: This talk is brought to
you by Googlers for Optimize Your Life, Google's

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.050
campaign to build the happiest and healthiest
workforce on the planet.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.360
So, Jeff is a former US Olympian in the ten
thousand meters.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.350
He's written numerous books, notable "Jeff
Galloway's Book on Running", and is a frequent

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.230
writer for "Runner's World" magazine."

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.960
He's a life-long runner and believes that
everyone is capable of a successful running

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
career.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.310
Today, Jeff will briefly talk about his experiences,
will answer your questions in pursuit of running

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.640
injury-free.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.149
I had the unique opportunity to attend the
Galloway School in Atlanta, Georgia, in high

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.429
school--a school founded by Jeff's father,
Elliot Galloway.

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.530
Both of Jeff's sons were classmates of mine,
which had the distinct advantage of having

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.649
Jeff Galloway as one of your track coaches.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.059
[laughter]

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.660
Not a bad deal.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.219
During my senior year, Jeff helped our track
team reach some really amazing goals.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.559
Personally, running a sub-five mile and sending
a number of people to the Georgia State finals.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.749
So, it was a really, really good experience.

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.550
As you can imagine, Jeff has lots of stories
to tell from running with Steve Prefontaine

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.719
and Frank Shorter in the '72 Olympics in Munich
to his more recent ventures, hosting all kinds

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.479
of running programs all over the world.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.520
I know I'm not alone in saying Jeff is a truly
inspirational person who cares deeply about

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.689
healthy living and running injury-free.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.429
His unique run/walk/run training programs
have helped thousands of people complete running

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:30.429
of all distances.

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.159
He's one of the most humble people you'll
ever meet.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.090
[chuckles]
And I'm really glad that we were able to bring

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.090
him here today.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.150
So, please join me in welcoming Jeff Galloway
to Google.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.600
[applause]

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.950
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: OK.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.140
I'm on a little bit of a string here.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.140
Is this OK?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.579
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yeah, great.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.770
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Great.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.770
OK.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.770
Yes.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.229
I was on the Olympic team in 1972.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.670
And a lot of people accuse me of being the
Forrest Gump of running because before running

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.829
was anything at all, I was out there and I
had already gotten hooked on it.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.650
But I will tell you, there are worse things
to get hooked on.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.459
As a 13-year old, I was a fat kid.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.959
My dad was in the Navy.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.489
I'd gone to 13 schools and I'd been able to
slink out of doing regular physical activity

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.640
due to a lot of excuses.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.430
And then reality hit when my father got out
of active duty in the Navy.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.010
And we went to a school that required boys
to go out for athletics after school.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.090
I'd gotten to know some of the other lazy
kids in school.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.140
So, I asked them what they were gonna go out
for during the winter.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.480
And most of them were choosing winter cross-country.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.340
I said, "That can't be easy."

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.810
And they said, "It is because the cross-country
coach is the most lenient in the school.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.370
And all you have to do is lie to him.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.100
Tell him that you're gonna run in the woods
and you can go out and hide in the woods."

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100
[laughter]

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.120
Two hundred yards is all you have to run.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.190
So, I did that for two days.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.909
And as fate would have it, on the third day,
an older kid that I liked came up to me and

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.049
said, "Galloway, you're running with us today."

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.340
Well, I had my strategy all set up.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.209
I was gonna reach the edge of the woods, grab
my hamstring, and say, "I'm injured.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.209
I can't go on."

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.760
But they started telling jokes and then they
started telling gossip about the teachers.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.829
And I just found myself lured on, day by day,
to go another half mile.

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:27.829
And even--.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:34.150
The two things that I discovered right away,
I felt better even after the worst days, the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.569
most exhausting days, than I used to feel
all week long.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.160
There was something going on up in the brain
that I liked and I liked a lot.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.769
Secondly, the friends I was meeting were the
first real friends I had ever met.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.459
And we argued with one another.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.510
We shared experiences.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.310
We really got to know one another.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.780
Fifty-three years later, we're still the closest
friends.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.420
And the fact is that there's a lot of things
that go on in mind, body, and spirit when

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.610
we run that don't occur in most other activities
in life.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.370
I'm here mainly to help you.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.640
I want to be available for any questions.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.980
If you do not understand my Atlanta accent,
John can come up and translate.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.540
But seriously, if you'd like anything clarified
right on the spur of the moment, simply raise

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.540
your hand.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.540
I'm here for you.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.670
Barbara, who's hiding out in the corner over
there, we do a lot of clinics together.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.440
We just came up from Carmel.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.350
And I have to tell you that it was extremely
unlikely when I started running in the '50s

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.490
and '60s that there would ever be retreats
for running or these massive events that you

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.890
have today.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.940
And I'm very proud to say that I am partially
to blame for that.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.610
And I'm accused of that all the time because
of run/walk/run.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.600
So, I'm gonna tell you a bit about run/walk/run,
how it came to be, and then the principles

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.750
behind it.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.910
And then, I can apply any solutions to problems
you're having by using that as one of the

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.910
methods.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.590
In 1973, I started my running store called
"Phidippides."

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:27.050
And as far as I know, it was the first running
store that was purely running in the country.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.770
Anyway, we didn't have much business in 1973
in running.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.210
There were very few people running.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.570
It was really a stupid business idea to do.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.570
[laughter]

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.800
We didn't really get a regular profit going
for ten years.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.840
And so, I had to figure out other things to
try to bring people in the store and then

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.020
have side businesses in running.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.390
So, that's why I started doing our running
retreats and running groups.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.000
We now have those in 90 cities around the
US.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.300
We also have consultations that we do on a
regular basis.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.510
And things like Carmel.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:13.170
But in all of this, what I learned I applied
to the next set of advice and the next book

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.600
that I wrote on it.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.400
So, what I'm telling you today is not based
on the type of training that I used before

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.590
the 1972 Olympics.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.770
And it's not what I use per se as I tried
to get faster.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.210
It's the compiling results from over 300 thousand
people that I have advised and had in our

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.320
various training programs and retreats.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.410
And 90 percent of them have gotten back to
me to tell me how the advice works.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.730
So, I'm very confident that most of you will
have some solutions--.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.420
I'll have some solutions for you based on
this track record.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:58.030
But in 1973, I was asked to teach a class
in beginning running.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.010
And when I convened the class of 22, none
of them had been doing any running for at

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.010
least five years.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.010
And so, this was true beginners.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.700
I knew that I didn't want to run them very
much because I didn't want them to get injured

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.160
because I wanted them to be customers in my
store.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.970
So, anyway, we did a lot of walking.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.800
There was one group that was self-proclaimed
basket case physical specimens and they were

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.610
mostly walkers with a little running.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.020
And then we had another set of young guys
that did other sports and they progressed

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.900
pretty rapidly and didn't do very much walking
at the end of the program.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.000
And there was middle group, too.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.790
But at the end of the ten-week class, every
one of those folks finished either a 5 or

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.790
a 10K.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.630
The biggest thing for me is that there were
no injuries.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:52.430
I had never been with a group of 20 or more
runners for ten weeks where there wasn't any

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.430
injuries.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.210
And I realized that the walk breaks were the
buffer zones.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.090
They were the shock absorbers to the system.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.120
They allowed the body to adapt.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.340
And from that point on, I used the run/walk/run
method.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.780
It has evolved greatly since that time.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:15.510
Today, what I'm finding is the ratios of running
to walking will allow your body to adapt.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:21.310
And therefore, you don't have to crash on
the bed or the couch all afternoon after a

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.050
long run, or in some cases, a short run.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:33.750
So, the amazing other factors are quicker
recovery and the ability to run faster in

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.979
races.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:42.360
In marathons, I've studied this for numerous
surveys and found that the average person

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:51.939
who has been running marathons continuously--ten
or more-when he or she shifts to run/walk/run,

00:08:51.939 --> 00:08:54.889
experiences an average of 13 minutes faster
with run/walk/run.

00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:56.589
And I'll tell you where it is.

00:08:56.589 --> 00:08:57.860
It's in the end.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.110
If you conserve your resources early, then
you're the one that feels great in the end.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.490
You're passing people.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.920
And I know it's tough to have to pass those
poor people in the latter stages of a race,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.379
but you know, somebody has to do it.

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:16.670
And I will tell you, psychologically it's
better to be the passer rather than the passee.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:22.870
Now, the other thing I wanted to say very
clearly is that I'm not trying to drag anyone

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.019
kicking and screaming into run/walk/run.

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:26.990
It has many benefits.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:34.790
It's as close of a panacea as I've found in
running to reducing or eliminating injury

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:40.769
and eliminating fatigue and allowing you to
have a life outside of just running.

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:47.779
But if you apply the principles that I've
come up with and don't even use run/walk/run,

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:50.279
there's still several other major benefits.

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:57.290
But run/walk/run has been the greatest single
thing I've found to allow people to keep away

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.980
from injury and to reach their goals, and
to be strong all the way to the finish.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.649
Currently, our ratios are as follows: At eight
minutes per mile, run for four minutes and

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:10.579
walk for 30 seconds.

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:14.209
For nine minutes per mile, it's a four and
one ratio.

00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:16.560
Ten minutes per mile is three in one.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.370
Eleven minutes per mile is two and a half
and one.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.540
Twelve minutes per mile, two and one.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.589
Thirteen minutes per mile, one and one.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:26.290
Fourteen minutes per mile, 30 seconds and
30 seconds.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:32.560
We take beginners and we do as I did back
in 1973.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.790
We will start them out with five to ten seconds
of running and the rest of the minute walking.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.600
And what I found is the body can adapt to
that in practically every single case.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.360
So, if you have friends that wanna get into
running, suggest that they only take it in

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.089
small doses first.

00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:51.350
And then, the body will thank them.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.649
And the mind will thank them, too.

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:54.379
And they won't get overwhelmed.

00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:58.069
Any questions so far?

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:59.069
Yes.

00:10:59.069 --> 00:11:01.759
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: [inaudible].

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:09.550
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: I have written a book called,
"Fit Kids, Smarter Kids" for that very issue.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:15.540
And the biggest single lesson I learned in
the research, which was really delivered to

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:23.889
me by a lot of folks at the CDC in Atlanta,
who specialize in this area of kids, is that

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:30.439
the brain is the greatest thing where you
get the most benefit in kids that exercise.

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:36.249
And the studies are rampant out there showing
better learning, quicker learning, a better

00:11:36.249 --> 00:11:41.649
head start on things, the unlocking of the
circuits in the brain that solve problems.

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:49.930
Mainly because what running does particularly,
is it stimulates frontal lobe activity--the

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.589
executive brain--and this is true with kids
and adults.

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:59.660
And it really does allow for the brain to
really grow up quicker in terms of solving

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.660
problems.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.150
But the key is not to burn kids out.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.829
And so, you really have to take small doses
first because kids are able to run farther

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:11.180
and faster than they should be doing.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.639
And if you let them go too far, too fast,
too soon, they can get psychologically burned

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:20.560
out and later on, not want to think about
running again.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.820
So, make it fun.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.820
Make it playful.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.820
Have rewards.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.600
And don't overdo it.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.020
And then, you can have a lifelong exerciser
that's smart.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.020
And that's real good.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.339
I like that.

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:35.930
Yes.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: [ inaudible]

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:48.189
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is relating
to half-marathons and marathons and how you

00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:51.089
would use the ratios that I just mentioned.

00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:56.990
Very appropriate because a lot of people get
confused as to when they should they be using

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.529
one ratio or another.

00:12:58.529 --> 00:13:00.240
I try to make it simple.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.800
And the simple rule is whatever pace you're
running that day would then determine what

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.129
ratio you would be using.

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:14.230
For example, if you're gonna run a training
run-- it's 12 minutes per mile-- then two

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.889
and one would be the most ratio that you would
want to do.

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:23.019
There are a lot of people that use one and
one at 12 minutes and some that use 30:30,

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:26.550
30 seconds, 30 seconds, also.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:32.300
But if you're running a race faster than that
at say, ten minutes per mile, then a three

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:38.000
and one ratio, or sometimes a two in one ratio
has been the best way to do that.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.320
And again, when you have a ratio of three
and one, you can also do 90 seconds, 30 seconds,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.310
or 60 seconds, 20 seconds.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:51.699
And more and more, folks are finding that
they actually run faster when they drop down

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:56.110
instead of going up in the amount of running.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.430
Let me just go over a couple more principles
and then I really want to get to any questions

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:08.720
you have about anything, including nutrition,
areas of beginners, trying to break through

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.279
barriers, run faster in races, or whatever
it is that you want to do.

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:13.279
I want to get--.

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.649
I'll be here for any of you.

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:20.990
And if there are any questions about women's
issues, my wife, Barbara, is here.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.779
We wrote that book together.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:28.329
And when I edited her stuff on women's running
and the problems that women have, I learned

00:14:28.329 --> 00:14:31.980
far more about women than I wanted to know.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.990
But there are a lot of problems that women
perceive are deal-killers and they really

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.369
are not deal-killers.

00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:42.959
There are solutions to practically every single
problem that I have ever found in running.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:45.259
Now, the other principles.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:52.490
When you're training for a long event, the
best single training component that will help

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.899
you more is a long run.

00:14:54.899 --> 00:15:00.199
And I found that slowing down on those long
runs is crucial if you want to avoid long-term

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:06.519
recovery and also the hitting of the wall
and injuries.

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:13.360
So, the rule of thumb is that you should run
at least two minutes per mile slower on long

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.369
runs than you can currently run in your race.

00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:20.970
The Kenyans actually run three to four minutes
per mile slower on their long runs than they

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.360
run in their marathons.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.440
And you know if it's good enough for the Kenyans--.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.680
[laughter]

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.389
And this is a dirty little secret that has
been around for generations.

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:36.420
The Kenyans in my generation, back in the
70s at the World Class level, were running

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:41.149
often ten minutes per mile when they were
racing at five minutes per mile.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:45.010
And I said, "Oh, that's way too slow."

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.240
Of course, the Kenyans were whipping my butt.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.839
And I should've been thinking about that.

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:53.610
But the fact is that slow, long runs are not
gonna hurt you.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.610
They will help you.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:16:01.660
You'll recover faster and you have much lower
chance of having problems with slower runs.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.310
And whether you take walk breaks or not, a
slow run is definitely recommended.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.800
Now, building the long--.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800
Just one second.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:15.399
Building the long run up to at least the distance
of your race has been shown to produce a great

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:18.310
deal of improvement if you haven't been doing
that.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.839
And marathons?

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:24.389
Those who used to run no more than 20 miles
in preparation for a marathon, when they go

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:31.290
up to our recommended Galloway 26-mile training
run, there's an average of 15 minute improvement.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:35.499
Fifteen minutes from increasing the length
of that last long run.

00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:42.459
One thing that has surprised me over the years
for marathoners, when people go from our 26-miler

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:49.629
and want to improve to say, qualify for Boston
or set a personal record or beat that obnoxious

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:54.170
person in their neighborhood that's running
faster than they are in a marathon and go

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.490
up to 29 miles, there's an average of 11 minutes
of improvement.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.769
So, there's a huge amount of improvement out
there if you haven't been going these long

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:08.450
distances before the races that you have.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.870
Yes, sir.

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.510
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: [inaudible]

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:23.080
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is about footwear
and the trend currently to go to barefooted

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:29.550
or minimal shoe use as being sort of a superior
way to run.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:39.130
Well, a lot of people assume, due to some
of the articles and book, "Born to Run," that

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.400
this is a new thing.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.660
But I have been running for 53 years and I've
seen the fad of minimal shoe, barefooted running

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.420
come and go five times.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.160
About every ten years, there will be something
in the media about it and people will get

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.240
jazzed up.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.600
Runners will go out and try it.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.710
And most times, they will only do a little
bit of it at first and it feels good.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.630
You know, the feet tingle, but it's OK.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:10.020
So then, they go out and do a lot more or
buy a pair of Vibrams and go out in pavement

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.610
and the foot breaks or the leg breaks.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:18.070
And they have to take six to eight months
off from running.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.870
They tell their friends that that's why they
had to take this time off.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:27.400
So, the trend and the fad goes away and this
fad will go away.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:36.830
Now, there are some shoes that are more minimal
that work for a small section of the population.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.100
And that's why there's so many models of shoes
today.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:49.630
But I strongly caution the general population
to think that having less heel on a shoe or

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:56.870
less sole and less build-up on the shoe is
going to help you because I've heard from

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.761
thousands already that have been injured by
going into those shoes.

00:19:00.761 --> 00:19:05.750
And then, when they shift back to a conventional
shoe, the injuries go away.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:12.890
The shoes today are amazing compared with
shoes 15, 20, 30 years ago in how they reduce

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:13.890
injuries.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:19.140
And so, the contentions in some of these articles
and books that regular shoes cause injuries

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:25.150
is not supported by the experience nor the
prevailing research on that subject.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.390
Yes, sir.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.750
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: [inaudible]

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.280
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The surface?

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.280
Whether--.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.280
What type of surface you--?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.280
Does it matter?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.280
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Yes.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.510
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is about the
surface and does it matter when you're warming

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.910
up or whether you're running on it.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:52.450
Shoes and walk breaks act as shock absorbers
even on the hardest of surfaces.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:58.740
So, I've really not found anything inherently
wrong with running on pavement.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:06.810
If the shoe is good enough for you and the
walk break ratio is right for you, both of

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.750
these act as shock absorbers on your system.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:17.010
And on hard pavement, if you don't tend to
like that, then you can just take walk breaks

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.010
more frequently.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.800
And that almost always does away with the
extra pounding.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.340
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: [inaudible]

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.600
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: That was your question, too?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.260
OK, great.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.260
Yes.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: What's your take on post-run stretching
compared to [inaudible]?

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.710
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: What type of stretching?

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: Stretching after.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.710
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Just regular stretching.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:37.710
OK.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:38.710
Yeah, OK.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.710
The question is about stretching.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.910
What is my take on stretching?

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:45.130
I used to be a huge advocate for stretching.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.930
That was before I looked into the research
about it.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:55.980
Basically, during my era leading up to the
'72 Olympic Games, nobody in distance stretched.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.010
It was not part of the culture at all.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:04.680
In the mid-70s, a lot of football coaches
started coaching track teams and they had

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.040
been using stretching effectively for football
teams.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.080
And they started incorporating that on the
track teams.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.590
And stretching became a way of life for running.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.800
But it was an old husband's tale.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:24.340
I looked into the research about ten years
ago on this and believe it or not, there's

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.750
not a study anywhere showing that stretching
has any benefit whatsoever for distance running.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:35.840
However now, there are dozens of studies showing
that distance runners who stretch have more

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840
injuries.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.470
The injuries last longer and the injuries
don't tend to heal.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:46.460
So, my children, I am going to absolve you
of all guilt for never stretching.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.049
[laughter]

00:21:49.049 --> 00:21:51.600
Anything else right now?

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.500
Yeah.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:59.210
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: [inaudible].

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:06.520
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: There's no evidence that
post-stretching has any benefit whatsoever.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.600
And unfortunately, I hear the negatives.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.440
I average hearing from over a hundred runners
a day.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.640
And about a third of those are injury problems.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.370
And a high percentage are those that stretch
and a high percentage of those are those that

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.480
stretch after a run.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:31.520
So, there's inherently beneficial in stretching
before, after, during, at night, in the morning,

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.660
or any time.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:38.400
And so, without any benefit and a lot of stuff
that's out there showing that stretching has

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.450
detrimental aspects, I'm gonna just not recommend
it.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:49.900
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: Do you also recommend concurrent
strength training [inaudible]?

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:56.420
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: In my book, "Running Until
You're 100," I went into several databases.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:01.430
And one of them was the effects of various
types of exercises.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:09.510
And if you collect all these studies, long-term,
on the various exercise modes, running has

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:15.590
been studied a little more than other activities.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:22.470
But the bottom line is that any exercise we
do is gonna tend to be good for us because

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:28.000
it engages circuits in the brain that keep
us active and keep working and keep the body

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.570
working at better capacity year after year,
even into the 80s and 90s.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.150
We don't know that much about the 100s yet.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.430
But they're a growing number.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:43.380
The fastest age group in running today is
the over 80 group percentage-wise.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.820
And it's really neat to see these folks.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:54.640
Anyway, bottom line is strength training is
not really gonna help your running, but it

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.840
can help your posture if you have postural
exercises that work for you.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.350
And the ones that I use are the crunch for
the front part of the body and arm running,

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.400
hand-rolled weights in the standing position.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.450
Just like this.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:15.030
Strengthens the shoulders, the neck, the muscles
up and down the spine to provide a backup

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.650
strengthening support for the spine.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:24.770
And when you have the right strength activities
for you, it doesn't take much time, but you

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.760
tend to stay upright for a longer period of
time.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.830
And I think that's a good thing.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.620
I'm in favor of being upright.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.620
Yes.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.580
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: [ inaudible].

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.500
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Recovering from injury.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500
Yes.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:44.770
My first 20 years, I experienced hundreds
of injuries.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.640
About every 20 days, I came down with an injury.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:56.470
And then, in 1978, I decided that I probably
was not gonna run any faster than I had run.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.120
And so, I started backing off the intensity.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:08.230
I stopped stretching and I found that walk
breaks that I had been advising people to

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.840
do worked for me, too.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.440
And my goal became to run injury-free.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:22.020
And I knew, even as of that time that the
walk breaks were probably the very best way

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.530
to stay injury-free.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:31.400
So, with that as my new goal, I decided to
take walk breaks on virtually every run.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.360
Well, 33 years later, I'm proud to say I haven't
had a single running injury.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.640
So, those who say, "Well, if you run, you're
gonna get injured," not true.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.190
I'm not alone.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:47.880
I've heard from dozens of people who've been
running for over 40 years.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:53.310
And for most of that time, once they've put
together the right formula, have not had injuries.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.940
So, it is very possible to stay away from
that.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:05.130
But coming back from an injury, you want to
do what you can to stay fit while you're injured.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.150
Walking, usually, is an appropriate activity.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.050
A few injuries won't allow it.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:17.660
But I've had a number of e-coach clients that
I have actually walked their long runs when

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:23.140
they've had a running injury and they've maintained
all the endurance that they needed as one

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.620
would get from a long run.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.430
So, walking is a good mode.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:31.950
Running in water is another activity that
can keep you in good running shape and allow

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.330
you to transition back sooner.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:40.590
Once you start back, it's best to build your
walk up to 30 minutes first.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:46.230
And then start integrating these small amounts
of running into each minute of walking.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.410
Some people can come back fairly fast.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.840
Some can come back a little slower.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.860
I've actually found that on most of the clients
that I've worked with, if they've gotten injured,

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.370
that they can keep running as long as they
stay below the threshold of further irritations.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:07.430
So, someone who was doing a five and one--run
five minutes, walk one--often can go down

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.830
to three and one, two and one, or one and
one, and continue their training.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.710
As long as they don't do speed work.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:20.620
Speed work is the single thing that is a deal-killer
if you're trying to heal from an injury.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:30.340
&gt;&gt; MALE #9: How do you take those ratios to
find the best times [inaudible]?

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:35.660
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: [chuckles] The question is
about how do you experiment with the various

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.770
ratios of running and walking.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:43.560
And for example, he said, "Well, have you
ever tried on a three and one ratio, running

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.610
for 30 minutes and walking for ten?"

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:51.780
Well, I don't recommend that one because what
I found is that you get most of the benefit

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.760
from a walk break during the first 30 seconds
of that walk break.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.400
And the longer you go beyond that, you tend
to slow down more, stiffen up, and you don't

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.010
tend to get any more benefit at all.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:06.650
So, the shorter amounts of running and walking
have actually been better.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:13.661
But the way that I suggest experimenting is
to devote one day during the week--a short

00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:21.110
mileage day--and go out and try different
ratios on a measured mile course.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.970
The first time try one ratio.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.430
The second mile, try another one.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.430
The third mile, try another one.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:32.440
And if you do this every week and keep experimenting,
you're gonna find a ratio that works best

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440
for you.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.310
And you're also gonna have several different
variables if you have problems in a race.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.980
You can shift to another one because you've
tried it before.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.980
Question.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.980
Yes.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.930
&gt;&gt;MALE #10: [inaudible ]?

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.780
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: How many days a week?

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.870
To stay injury-free, it's three days a week.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.880
Three day a week runners have the lowest rate
of injury.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.850
Although, a lot of folks, including myself
have found combinations of other things such

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.250
as walk breaks that will allow them to run
six or seven days a week.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.540
And that's what I do and a lot of other people
do, too.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:15.030
So, to get the benefit though, I'm totally
convinced now that you can run as fast on

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:21.480
three days a week if you include all the components
as you could on more days a week.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.450
One of my talented friends put that to the
test.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:30.590
He trained when he was going through his first
year of medical residency on three days a

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.390
week, dropping down from seven--World Class
runner.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:39.490
And I dropped his mileage from 120 miles a
week down to 40 miles a week.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:46.780
And after one full year, he ran a marathon
in 2:14--2:14.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:54.470
And he was only four minutes behind his PR
that was set on a much easier course.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.410
And this isn't an isolated instance.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:02.730
I've heard a lot of people who are thrown
off by their job or something else and they

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.790
reduce down to three days a week.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.020
They assume that they're not gonna be able
to run nearly as fast.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.040
And they go to a race and totally surprise
themselves.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:18.700
So anyway, three days a week are the minimum
if you really wanna stay in decent shape.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.540
If you wanna run more than that, it's mostly
for the head.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:28.310
But you know, keeping that brain in good working
order is a darn good thing and one of the

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:35.700
greatest aspects of my work is that I'm able
to look in to other areas that help running

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.920
and help us in the rest of our lives.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.910
My most recent book is called "Mental Training."

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:46.970
And in that book, I went into how the brain
operates when we're under stress.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:53.870
And most commonly, the subconscious reflex
brain starts generating negative hormones

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:59.240
the higher the stress level to make us feel
less and less like exercising or like pushing

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.530
through barriers.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:05.760
And of course, we're producing more stress
when we have a goal and when we get out and

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.200
work hard.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:13.920
So, if you can get into the frontal lobe--the
executive brain--and set up a cognitive strategy,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:19.580
you can lower the stress levels slightly,
but then you can start producing positive

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.860
attitude hormones that will then change your
attitude.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:30.740
And there are a whole bunch of different mental
training techniques that can keep you on that

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.990
track.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:39.760
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: [inaudible]

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:51.780
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is about a tempo
run that is put in to a marathon training

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.460
program, particularly for time goals.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:32:02.140
Now, tempo is a term that I believe doesn't
have any meaning anymore.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.320
And the reason is that if you ask ten coaches
the definition of tempo, you're gonna get

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.630
ten different answers.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.120
So, I really don't use it.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:16.140
However, there's a race rehearsal segment
that I have in my training that ends up being

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:24.640
reasonably close to what I believe Ryan Hall
and Pete Pfitzinger and others term tempo.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.980
And that is, you're trying to get yourself
to have some segment that gets up to your

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.070
race pace so that you know what that feels
like on a regular basis.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.870
And I totally agree with that.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.680
In our program, we have that segment on a
Tuesday.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:47.410
And in that segment, I ask my athletes to
test different run/walk/run ratios at the

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:52.340
pace so that they dress rehearse the race
and can figure out what tends to work best

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.340
for that.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:59.960
I will say that what becomes sometimes a deal-killer
for a lot of people that read my "Runner's

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.670
World" article and then ask me questions about
tempo work, is that they try in the middle

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:12.330
of the week to have a fairly long run of 13
to 15 miles in the middle of the week when

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.380
they're doing hard training on the weekends.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.760
And that often is the deal-killer.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:23.880
So, that is the tempo, so-called tempo, component.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.630
It's something you need to be very careful
in doing.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:32.210
I don't like to go more than about seven miles
on the race rehearsal segment that I recommend.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.210
Yes.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:39.070
&gt;&gt;MALE #12: Can you talk a little bit about
speed walking and also if somebody is primarily

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:43.030
walking, does it make sense to walk really
fast and then really slow?

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:49.120
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is about speed
and walking, either during a walk break, or

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.980
if you're just walking by itself.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:57.820
The one problem that I have seen over and
over with walking is having too long a stride

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.820
length.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:06.330
If you have a short stride and walk fast with
quicker tempo, or turnover rate, then that's

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.330
fine.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.779
But when you lengthen that stride there are
a lot of bad things that can happen.

00:34:10.779 --> 00:34:17.470
So, my recommendation during walk breaks is
that you keep a nice short stride, make it

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:23.830
easy enough so that you recover during the
walk break from your running segment.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:29.010
And then, if you want to work on speeding
up the walk by having a quicker turnover rate,

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.450
then that's absolutely fine.

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:39.899
&gt;&gt;MALE #13: [inaudible]

00:34:39.899 --> 00:34:49.089
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is about puking--

00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:50.089
[laughter]

00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:53.829
and I will tell you that I am against puking.

00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:54.829
[laughter]

00:34:54.829 --> 00:35:02.810
I'm against death and I'm against a few other
negatives that people bring up about running,

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.000
but those are the major ones right there.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.349
Now, puking is something that is triggered
by several key elements.

00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:16.950
First of all, what you ate the day before,
the night before, particularly, or during

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.059
the day before you ran your run.

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:24.759
So, if you're having problems with that, you
wanna minimize what you eat.

00:35:24.759 --> 00:35:31.140
You still need to eat, but you need to minimize
it because if you're under stress and of course

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.450
you mentioned these were stressful workouts
where they occur, if you're under stress,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:42.279
then your subconscious brain tries to shut
you down.

00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:48.150
And one of the most effective ways that it
does so is by using your digestive tract in

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.359
a negative way against you.

00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:52.890
And boy, does that get your attention.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:36:02.420
Now, going into these workouts with a more
gentle pace in the beginning and then using

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:08.160
just the last portion to be the time that
you really pick up the pace is a good strategy

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.390
also.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:14.779
And if it's in a long run, more frequent walk
breaks in the beginning.

00:36:14.779 --> 00:36:21.220
And a lot of folks assume that my run/walk/run
is really just for those that are running

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:28.410
five and six hour marathoners, but we've had
people--over 150 people--I've heard from who

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:32.999
broke three hours for the first time because
the use run/walk/run.

00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:38.499
The fastest is a fellow that improved his
time from 2:33 to 2:28 and the only thing

00:36:38.499 --> 00:36:41.499
he changed was taking walk breaks every mile.

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:47.210
So, they have a lot of applicability and keep
your body from getting to that extreme point

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.520
that causes that shut-down to occur.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:57.210
And then finally, mental training program
that can keep you on the edge that you want,

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.359
but keep you from going over that edge.

00:37:00.359 --> 00:37:04.680
And there are a number of suggestions on our
websites and in the book.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.400
And if you have any questions about that,
let me know.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400
John.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.289
&gt;&gt;John: I actually have a question on VC from
Natasha.

00:37:12.289 --> 00:37:13.289
Question for Jeff.

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:17.299
I'm training for a 5K and then a 10K and working
my way up to a marathon later on in the year.

00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:19.789
What is the best way to prevent lower back
pain?

00:37:19.789 --> 00:37:23.619
Also, if you already have lower back pain
from running, what are the best cures?

00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:26.680
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Lower back pain and running.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.900
Often I'm finding when I've been able to watch
people run, that the most common reason for

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.569
that is a forward lean.

00:37:33.569 --> 00:37:38.819
It puts a lot of stress on the back and also,
it can put stress on the neck, which can also

00:37:38.819 --> 00:37:41.109
cause pain in the back overall.

00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:43.420
So, upright body posture.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.599
And what I recommend is coming out of a walk
break, take a breath before you start running,

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:53.170
and imagine that you're a puppet on a string
with this upright body posture.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:57.890
If you do it regularly, walk break after walk
break, you're gonna find that you'll have

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:01.579
a subtle behavioral change that will take
place over time.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:08.070
But really try to make the correction more
quickly if you feel the back pain coming on.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.990
And I've had a lot of good feedback from people
who used to have back pain who have been able

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.880
to reduce it or get away from it.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:24.369
Finally, this arm running exercise with hand-held
weights going in this arm running motion has

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:30.660
provided extra strength throughout the shoulders,
neck, and back area and has significantly

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.940
helped people reduce their back issues.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:39.279
&gt;&gt;MALE #14: So, what are your thoughts on
plyometric exercises, like jump squats, lunges,

00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:40.549
stuff like that?

00:38:40.549 --> 00:38:43.660
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Plyometrics, what's my stance
on that?

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:48.349
You know, there are all types of exercises
that people like to do.

00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:52.650
I'm going to answer that just purely related
to running.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.720
And for distance running, I see no benefit
at all.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.700
But sadly, I hear from a lot of folks that
get injured and some of them have gotten very

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.480
serious knee injuries from some of those squat
jumps and things like that.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.609
So, there's a real risk with those activities.

00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:18.920
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: [inaudible]

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:27.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Congratulations.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:31.950
He has had cramping issues in a lot of his
marathons right around the 15-mile mark.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.559
So, I'm gonna ask you some questions.

00:39:34.559 --> 00:39:40.220
What was the longest long run that you usually
do before these marathons where you have problems?

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: [inaudible]

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:46.030
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Twenty-two miles.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.030
OK.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:53.309
Generally speaking, and also what run/walk/run
ratio from the beginning, do you use in those

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:54.730
where you cramp?

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.119
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: Three and one.

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.119
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Three and one.

00:39:58.119 --> 00:40:02.900
And what time are you finishing in in those
ones where you cramp?

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.650
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: Thirteen minute per mile.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Thirteen minute per a mile.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.200
OK.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:14.540
If you go a one and one, or better a 30/30,
that should either eliminate the cramps or

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.310
they're not gonna come on 'till later on--much
later on.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:18.740
Maybe the last couple miles.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:25.289
But I also recommend in addition to that,
moving that long run up to at least 26 miles,

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:29.859
slowing them way down, and running them at
15 minutes per mile.

00:40:29.859 --> 00:40:36.480
Now, if you do both of those, you should see
a significant time improvement provided the

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.910
weather is appropriate.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:40.750
Obviously, the hotter the weather--.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:47.359
I've studied the effect that hot weather has
on marathoners and it's a 30-second per mile

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:50.090
slowdown for every five degrees above 60.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:51.320
It's significant.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.569
And if you don't make that adjustment, it
will be made for you at the end of those marathons.

00:40:56.569 --> 00:41:01.641
And sadly, some people wind up in the penalty
box, which is the medical tent.

00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:05.539
And you can avoid all of that if you will
just slow down.

00:41:05.539 --> 00:41:10.109
But a 30/30 is what my wife Barbara and I
use in our marathons.

00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:15.630
We are currently running a marathon a month
and just enjoying the heck out of it.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:23.650
We can recover very quickly, enjoy the evening,
enjoy the next day running if we want to.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.589
It's just really a good experience to go down
like that.

00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:31.839
And I think you're gonna find that that will
probably take away the cramping.

00:41:31.839 --> 00:41:34.349
&gt;&gt;MALE #16: [inaudible]

00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:36.759
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Ice baths.

00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:38.299
What is my opinion on that?

00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:41.770
Well, two words: cruel and unusual.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.130
[laughter]

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:49.599
But I will say that soaking your legs in a
cool tub of water has been shown to allow

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:51.900
them to speed up the recovery.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:58.140
Now that said, what the evidence is now is
that you only need a 20 degree differential

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.369
between body temperature and water temperature.

00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:04.290
And in most cases, the cool water tap will
do that for you so you don't have to go to

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.520
the extreme of putting ice in there.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:12.470
If you're in a tropical environment, you may
want to put some cubes of ice in and once

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:17.829
you put the water in the tub and just monitor
the temperature.

00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:22.599
And as long as it's 78 degrees or cooler,
you're gonna soak out the excess heat just

00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:25.529
as well as if you had ice in it.

00:42:25.529 --> 00:42:30.220
You may not feel that you're as tough, though,
as those that go in with all the ice.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.240
Yes.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:37.429
&gt;&gt;MALE #17: Can you go over the proper form
of running, both stride, full stride, how

00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:38.429
you hold your arms?

00:42:38.429 --> 00:42:39.429
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: OK.

00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:40.429
The question is about running form.

00:42:40.429 --> 00:42:45.240
What is it that I've found to be the most
efficient way to run in terms of the foot

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.240
and so forth?

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.430
Well starting with the foot, the research
is quite clear on this.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:57.470
And that is that we have certain basic mechanics
that we were born with and we're gonna tend

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:04.579
to run in that certain way and that those
who try to depart from that are usually in

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:05.579
for trouble.

00:43:05.579 --> 00:43:11.549
I mean, we can change it for a relatively
short period of time, but sooner or later,

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:13.410
it's simply not natural.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:14.660
And something breaks.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:20.769
So, anyway, I recommend going with the way
that's natural for you to run.

00:43:20.769 --> 00:43:27.920
Now, when it comes to the most important running
motion, it's the use of the ankle.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:34.400
The ankle is marvelous and it can do most
of the work of running with very little muscle

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.280
energy required.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:41.779
So the way you facilitate that is to have
a relatively shorter stride with feet low

00:43:41.779 --> 00:43:44.010
to the ground and a light touch.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:50.749
So, if you have very nice gentle motion, the
ankle does most of the work.

00:43:50.749 --> 00:43:56.510
And the calf muscle and other muscles and
the joints aren't aggravated by this.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:01.089
So, it's really marvelous to see people improve
when they do this.

00:44:01.089 --> 00:44:06.799
Moving on up the body, upright body posture
is generally best according to the research

00:44:06.799 --> 00:44:12.839
and according to a lot of surveys that I've
done with people.

00:44:12.839 --> 00:44:17.010
But there are a few people that naturally
lean forward.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:21.470
And if you're one that naturally leans forward
and that's more natural for you, that's fine.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:25.650
Still, the problem is back stress that you
could have.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.559
When it comes to arms, just minimal arm swing
is best.

00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:35.160
The arms really don't help you, but if you
try to move and lead with the arms, then you

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.790
can mess up your rhythm--that wonderful rhythm
that the feet and the legs naturally have.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:46.089
Our ancient ancestors programmed us for walking
and running because they used to cover 15

00:44:46.089 --> 00:44:49.970
to 20 miles a day going back more than two
million years ago.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.329
It's natural for us to walk and to run.

00:44:52.329 --> 00:44:56.140
And the rhythm seems to start with the feet.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.100
And so, if we let the feet lead, running is
better.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.100
John?

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.150
&gt;&gt;John: I have a question over VC from Don.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.309
I have asthma.

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:07.990
And having recently noticed I'm getting cramps
under my ribs--not on my side--even when I'm

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:11.930
not running hard, this has been an issue for
about two weeks where my lungs seem increasingly

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.020
irritated during runs.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.220
Is there anything I can do to release that
tightness?

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.829
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Yeah.

00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:24.420
This, as far as I can get from this question,
is more related to what people call "side

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.079
pain" when they run.

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:33.170
And asthma has a definite role in that because
if you cannot get good absorption in the lower

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.349
lungs, then the side pain tends to kick in.

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:45.500
The best way to facilitate better oxygen absorption
is from the start of your run.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.559
Try to breathe in such a way that the air
goes down into your lower lungs.

00:45:49.559 --> 00:45:54.260
And the way you tell is whether your stomach
rises and falls.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:58.119
If it's your chest rising or falling quickly,
that's panting.

00:45:58.119 --> 00:46:02.750
And that means that you're not getting that
air going down into the lower lungs.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:07.930
So, what I recommend for my athletes is when
they're walking for three to five minutes

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:13.980
as a warm-up, that they practice every third
or fourth breath blowing out a little bit

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:20.539
more and then bringing that air in so that
they're breathing with the lower lung motion.

00:46:20.539 --> 00:46:22.849
It's the way we breathe when we're asleep.

00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:29.450
It's the most efficient way and it really
does cut down on side pain dramatically.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:35.569
&gt;&gt;MALE #18: [inaudible]

00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:41.440
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is about knee
pain.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:46.809
A friend of his ran a half-marathon and developed
knee pain that has not gone away.

00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:48.950
He needs to see a doctor.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:54.440
He needs to see somebody who really specializes
in running type injuries.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.789
You're fortunate in the Bay Area to have a
lot of really good people.

00:46:58.789 --> 00:47:03.400
One of them is a specialist who goes out to
our Tahoe camp.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.150
We held a retreat in July every year since
1975.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:16.630
The best part about it is that we have a clinician
who's a podiatrist who specializes in running.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:21.210
He doesn't have to deal with any other area
because there are so many runners in the Bay

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.210
Area.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:23.950
He's actually up in Marin, San Rafael.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.640
His name is Dave Hannaford.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.420
And even when it's a knee issue, he can often
help.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.309
Dave is like an old line doctor.

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:37.420
He has the empathy for the patient.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.579
He also has intuitive senses as well as his
technical knowledge.

00:47:42.579 --> 00:47:44.009
And he applies this.

00:47:44.009 --> 00:47:50.140
And he will often diagnose and treat something
with success that people who've gone to eight

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.529
or ten doctors have not been able to find
it.

00:47:52.529 --> 00:47:54.739
Anyway, Dave Hannaford is his name.

00:47:54.739 --> 00:48:00.700
But try to find somebody who's seen just lots
and lots of runners and have been successful

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.619
in solving these problems.

00:48:02.619 --> 00:48:06.809
The knee is an area where there are many,
many moving parts and there are many ways

00:48:06.809 --> 00:48:08.180
that it can get aggravated.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:12.349
So, I can't really say and I can't give medical
advice anyway.

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:14.420
&gt;&gt;MALE #19: [inaudible]

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:15.930
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: I don't.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:21.229
I don't have any knowledge of people that
are in this area or the Southern Bay area.

00:48:21.229 --> 00:48:24.430
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #20: [inaudible]

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:28.140
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: The question is about shoe
rotations.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:34.859
And I do recommend that because when you find
a shoe that works, I strongly recommend you

00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:39.680
go out and get an identical pair because the
shoe company will mess with it.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.769
And then you have to start all over time.

00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:47.050
But once you get that second pair, once a
week at the end of a run, put on the second

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.289
pair and run at least a quarter of a mile
in it.

00:48:51.289 --> 00:48:55.609
Now, this gradually will break in the new
pair so you never have to go from a worn out

00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:56.890
pair to a brand new pair.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.509
But it does more than that.

00:48:58.509 --> 00:49:01.369
It will give you a gauge on the old pair.

00:49:01.369 --> 00:49:06.180
And after week after week of doing this drill,
you're gonna come to a point at some time

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:10.430
when the new one really feels good and old
one doesn't.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:15.640
Well, you wanna shift into the new one and
use the other one as a lawn mowing pair.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.760
Yes.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.119
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: [inaudible]

00:49:20.119 --> 00:49:23.489
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Supplements?

00:49:23.489 --> 00:49:25.880
Any particular category of supplements?

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.839
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: [inaudible]

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:32.349
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: I'm not familiar with it.

00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:37.289
In general, I like for runners to get their
nutrition through food.

00:49:37.289 --> 00:49:47.140
But I will absolutely tell you that the research
shows that a few days every month, the best,

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:51.619
most meticulous eating person is not gonna
get all the nutrients.

00:49:51.619 --> 00:49:56.249
Now, sometimes this will not cause a problem
and sometimes it will.

00:49:56.249 --> 00:50:03.019
I, personally, use a supplement that's researched
out of the Cooper Clinic, Dr. Kenneth Cooper

00:50:03.019 --> 00:50:04.019
in Dallas, Texas.

00:50:04.019 --> 00:50:10.310
He spent 15 years researching nutrition and
put out a vitamin line based on what he found.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:16.420
It prevents strokes, heart disease, a lot
of other situations including certain types

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.589
of cancers.

00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:22.229
And I figured if he spent 15 years doing it,
that I'd just follow what he thinks is best.

00:50:22.229 --> 00:50:23.249
And that's what I use.

00:50:23.249 --> 00:50:25.799
But there are many other reasons to have supplements.

00:50:25.799 --> 00:50:29.749
And people have specific issues and problems.

00:50:29.749 --> 00:50:32.920
And so, you find a supplement that can work
best for you.

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:39.349
But if you're not taking an overall vitamin,
I do recommend you look at least at One-A-Day

00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:46.550
because often, even the most meticulous person
won't get enough B vitamins or iron or calcium.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:49.799
There's another thing that Barbara and I suggest.

00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:57.630
And we tested several of the sites that you
can use--websites--and the apps that allow

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.309
you to analyze your diet.

00:50:59.309 --> 00:51:01.609
One of them if fitday.com.

00:51:01.609 --> 00:51:02.989
Another one is sparkpeople.

00:51:02.989 --> 00:51:06.729
They also have an app as well as a website.

00:51:06.729 --> 00:51:09.059
And calorie king.

00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:10.059
There's several of these.

00:51:10.059 --> 00:51:15.589
But the bottom line is that these will give
you a chance to analyze what you're eating.

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:18.960
Find out if you're deficient in things on
a regular basis.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:24.190
And once you do that, you can take action
and become in command of your nutritionship.

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:26.160
&gt;&gt;MALE #21: Hi.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:32.260
Speaking of knee pain, I get knee pain of
the upper corner of the knee usually after

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.839
I start running after a big, long break.

00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:39.609
I think it's ITB, but I don't know if it's
ITB or not for sure.

00:51:39.609 --> 00:51:40.609
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: OK.

00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:43.710
It's about knee pain, or is your pain on the
outside of the knee?

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:44.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #21: Outside of the knee.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:45.710
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: OK.

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.309
And you get it usually when you're coming
back after a layoff.

00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:54.339
My suggestion is that you ease your way back
into it, both in distance and in run/walk/run.

00:51:54.339 --> 00:52:02.030
So, I would start out with mostly walking
the first week and then even amounts the second

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.160
week if everything's OK.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.150
And the third week, you could ease into what
seems to work best for you.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:12.900
But if you suddenly go out and run continuously
or run too far for you starting back, that's

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.220
when the ITB happens.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.700
It's a wobble injury.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:20.940
And what I mean is the calf muscle, which
is the major muscle in running, will get fatigued

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.359
and then the body starts wobbling.

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:27.460
Well, the IT band tries to hold back your
body weight and it can't do it.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.460
&gt;&gt;MALE #21: Right.

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.759
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: It gets overwhelmed.

00:52:29.759 --> 00:52:33.280
Good news is nobody's died of iliotibial band
injury yet.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.329
&gt;&gt;MALE #21: OK.

00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:35.329
Thank you.

00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:36.329
[laughter]

00:52:36.329 --> 00:52:38.180
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: We have time for two more
questions.

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:39.180
Yes.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.779
&gt;&gt;MALE #22: [inaudible]

00:52:40.779 --> 00:52:42.729
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: Triathletes?

00:52:42.729 --> 00:52:49.539
A growing number are contacting me each year
about triathlon training using run/walk/run

00:52:49.539 --> 00:52:56.430
and it has really been extremely successful
because for one thing, when you get off the

00:52:56.430 --> 00:53:02.160
bike and start your run, most people can walk
as fast as they can run.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:08.099
But if you try to run, you're gonna put a
lot more fatigue on your legs for later on

00:53:08.099 --> 00:53:09.309
in that run.

00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:15.470
So, I would recommend walking for a minute
or two and then do a run/walk/run for at least

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.789
the first mile in some fashion.

00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:21.589
And then, vary it according to what works
best for you.

00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:27.769
My ratios do work quite well though for triathletes
and particularly Iron Man triathletes.

00:53:27.769 --> 00:53:29.530
So, the ones that I mentioned earlier.

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:33.239
And you'll find those on jeffgalloway dot
com.

00:53:33.239 --> 00:53:36.749
And feel free to ask any questions, also.

00:53:36.749 --> 00:53:41.039
My website again is jeffgalloway dot com.

00:53:41.039 --> 00:53:42.079
It's free.

00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:44.519
We have a lot of information up there.

00:53:44.519 --> 00:53:49.329
And you can ask me questions and there's no
charge for that.

00:53:49.329 --> 00:53:58.060
You can simply, if you put Google in the subject
line as a code word, then you will get a faster

00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.999
response than other people.

00:53:59.999 --> 00:54:00.999
[laughter]

00:54:00.999 --> 00:54:02.289
So, anyway.

00:54:02.289 --> 00:54:03.680
&gt;&gt;John: Two things.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.759
First off, I just wanted to let everyone know
that Google is currently offering a discount

00:54:07.759 --> 00:54:11.240
on multivitamins and DHA to Googlers.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.410
It was announced in the January Perks newsletter.

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:17.480
So, take advantage of that if you haven't
already.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.259
It'll probably be run again in February.

00:54:19.259 --> 00:54:21.479
We're still working out the details.

00:54:21.479 --> 00:54:26.690
Also, one question for you, Jeff, is around
frequency of breathing.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:30.390
How often do you recommend inhaling and exhaling?

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.079
Is it every couple strides and how deep?

00:54:33.079 --> 00:54:35.089
&gt;&gt;Jeff Galloway: OK.

00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:40.700
With breathing frequency, first of all, I
am in favor of breathing.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.440
I am definitely in favor of it.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:50.700
But seriously, the frequency is very individual,
but what has been shown in a lot of research

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:55.539
is that if you're increasing your breathing
rate--your huffing and puffing rate--this

00:54:55.539 --> 00:55:02.319
is a direct sign that your effort level is
rising and that your heart rate is rising

00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:03.319
also.

00:55:03.319 --> 00:55:08.999
So, on most of the runs, particularly the
long, easy runs, I recommend that there be

00:55:08.999 --> 00:55:16.329
no excessive huffing and puffing--that you
breathe naturally so that you can carry on

00:55:16.329 --> 00:55:17.329
a conversation.

00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:22.960
Now, on speed work, if you're doing some of
that, there will be some huffing and puffing

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960
there.

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:29.119
And at that point, there is no magic formula
because I see it all over the place.

00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:35.089
Where I see people getting in trouble is when
they let their panting get out of control.

00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:41.200
As long as you're having every third or fourth
breath that is lower lung breath, then you're

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.710
gonna tend to get good absorption out of that.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:49.900
But if you're panting all the time, you're
not gonna get as good absorption.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.390
So John, I'll turn it back over to you.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.470
&gt;&gt;John: Thank you, Jeff.

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:55.359
If we can get a round of applause for coming
out here.

00:55:55.359 --> 00:55:55.489
[applause]
