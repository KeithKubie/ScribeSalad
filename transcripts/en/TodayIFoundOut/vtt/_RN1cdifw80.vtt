00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:18.350
McDonald’s first started 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:29.789
the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.880
Monopoly promotion in 1987, and its premise
was simple: attach Monopoly pieces to food

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.910
cartons and cups, with each piece signifying
a Monopoly property or a small prize.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.079
One out of every four pieces would be a small
prize, such as a medium fry or soda, and a

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.190
very few of the prizes would be significantly
more valuable, such as a car or, with the

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.410
proper pieces, cash – up to $1 million.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.020
The key to any promotion is to keep the cost
of the prizes below the increase in sales

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.680
it produces, and so for the Monopoly game,
there were very few expensive prize pieces.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.899
In addition, as a full-set of properties was
needed to win the nice prizes, for each set,

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.179
at least one property only had a few pieces
printed (e.g., there would be many Park Places

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:16.950
but precious few Boardwalks).

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.579
Nonetheless, as long as everyone played fair,
and diligently collected the attached pieces,

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.340
eventually someone could win each of the prizes
(although some years no one won the $1 million

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.340
grand prize).

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.209
But that’s the key – playing fair.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.420
It turns out, as with the real game of Monopoly,
its not so hard to cheat if you’re the banker.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.849
Enter Jerome Jacobson of Simon Marketing Inc.,
the latter being one-time managers of the

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:47.299
Monopoly promotion for McDonald’s.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.639
Most important to the story at hand is that
it was the aforementioned employee of Simon

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.689
Marketing Inc, security officer Jerome Jacobson,
who was put in charge of the distribution

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.100
of certain key game pieces.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.419
As a part of that job, he would travel with
said pieces to the factories making McDonald’s

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:08.280
cups and cartons, where the pieces would then
be attached to said items.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.040
Not exactly an Ocean’s 11 style caper, en
route with the sealed envelope containing

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.650
the pieces, Jacobson would simply go into
a private place (like an airport bathroom),

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.590
carefully open the envelope, steal the best
pieces, and then reseal and deliver the rest.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.790
Smart enough not to try to redeem the pieces
himself, with his first theft in 1989, Jacobson

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.750
gave the piece ($25,000) to his stepbrother
who shared the proceeds with him.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.099
Over the years, apparently Jacobson became
more emboldened, and by 1995, he was stealing

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.670
most of the pieces of greatest value.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.969
To further distance himself from the theft,
Jacobson and his cohorts began recruiting

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.019
random people, who would simply purchase the
pieces from them for a percentage of their

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.109
overall ultimate worth once cashed in.

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.359
(Ironically, and one of the ways in which
the FBI tracked who was all involved, was

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.620
that in order to buy the pieces with large
prizes, many of the biggest prize winners

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.299
mortgaged their homes before collecting their
McDonald’s Monopoly prizes.)

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.790
Jacobson also in at least one instance completely
gave the biggest $1 million prize away in

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.799
1995 when he anonymously sent the needed pieces
for the prize to St. Jude’s Children’s

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:13.799
Hospital.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.540
While technically under the rules of the promotion,
the prizes were supposed to be non-transferable,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.709
McDonald’s chose to make an exception in
this case and awarded the prize to St. Jude’s.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.670
Of course, all good things must come to an
end, and if the banker in a Monopoly game

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.360
cheats too much, eventually the other players
will catch on.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.370
And so it was that the scam was first revealed
to law enforcement by an informant who had

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.389
been recruited by the Jacobson group to “win”
a 1996 Dodge Viper.

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.489
As the fraud happened across the country and
the U.S. mail was involved, the FBI had jurisdiction,

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.530
and they named their investigation “Operation
Final Answer,” in reference to another McDonald’s

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.459
promotion Jacobson was rigging connected to
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.129
Fully cooperating with the Bureau, McDonald’s
agreed to continue the contest to enable agents

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.219
to figure out which prize winners were involved
and which weren’t, gathering evidence via

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.220
methods such as wire taps, phone records,
and the aforementioned pattern of winners

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.090
who mortgaged their houses shortly before
collecting a big prize.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.019
In another rather humorous turn, during one
stake out, FBI agents reported watching one

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.709
of Jacobson’s associates meet with a recruit
in a parking lot in Fair Play, South Carolina.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.460
It all came crashing down in 2001 when Jacobson
and seven others were charged with conspiracy

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.060
to commit mail fraud (a federal felony) in
Jacksonville, Florida.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.199
Jacobson pled guilty to the charge in 2002
and was sentenced to three years and one month

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.669
in federal prison.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.390
He also had to give back the near $1 million
he had collected over the lifespan of the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.490
scam as his cut.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.100
Altogether, 51 otherwise law abiding citizens
were convicted, with 47 pleading guilty and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.240
four others ultimately being found guilty
(although four of these 51 later had their

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.070
convictions overturned due to technicalities).

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.330
It isn’t clear exactly if every prize winner
involved was actually aware the whole thing

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.330
was a scam, however, with many claiming they
didn’t know the prize pieces were obtained

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.330
illegally.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.250
Whatever the case, the fallout was much bigger
than just a few dozen people serving jail

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.210
time while a few dozen others who would have
won a big prize did not.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.580
After the scandal was revealed, McDonald’s
promptly terminated their approximately half

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.900
a billion dollar contract with Simon Marketing
Inc, causing a couple hundred of Jerome’s

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.750
former co-workers to lose their jobs.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.590
To make amends to the general public, McDonald’s
promptly launched a flash-Monopoly run, with

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.910
cash prizes awarded totaling about $10 million.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.900
It should also be noted that despite St. Jude’s
Children’s Hospital’s winning prize pieces

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.160
being acquired fraudulently, McDonald’s
still continued paying the installments on

00:05:38.160 --> 00:06:21.729
the million dollar prize 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:59.300
to them.
