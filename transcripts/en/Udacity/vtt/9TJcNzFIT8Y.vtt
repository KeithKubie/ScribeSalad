00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
To illustrate the technique of constraint propagation, let us consider this

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.820
figure drawn on a 2D surface. Although this figure has been drawn on a 2D

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.300
surface, you and I can almost immediately recognize that this is a 3D cube.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.690
How did we recognize that this is a 3D cube?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.730
How can we help machines do it? Cube is an example of a trihedral object.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.720
A trihedral object is one with three surfaces joined at a particular point,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.870
at this particular point. In general, what [UNKNOWN] a polyhedral surfaces.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.590
A polyhedral surface is one where multiple surfaces join at the same point. So

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.680
a soccer ball, with its white and black patterns, is an example of a polyhedral

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.240
object because at one point several surfaces can join. A pyramid is another good

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.920
example of a polyhedral object. A pyramid has four surfaces joining, at

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.130
the apex. So let's do a simple exercise together. Here are six figures all drawn

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.900
on a 2D surface. Which of these six figures do you think represents a 3D object?
