00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.460
While there are many birds that have naturally
evolved to be flightless, there’s only one

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.540
kind of bird humans have selectively bred
until it no longer possesses an ability shared

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.200
by most of its kin- the parlor roller.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.869
A member of the pigeon family, the parlor
roller is unique amongst birds in that instead

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.360
of flying, it travels not only via walking,
but much more interestingly via backflips…

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.250
Nobody knows when exactly the parlor roller
was first bred into existence.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.820
However, the breed, which is ultimately a
descendant of the rock pigeon, may go back

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.829
as far as the mid-19th century, with the bird’s
origins being traced to Scotland.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.010
More recently than its rock pigeon ancestry,
the parlor roller is a more extreme offshoot

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.820
of another breed of pigeon called the parlor
tumbler, which is similarly known for its

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.820
acrobatic prowess.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.780
However, a key difference is that parlor tumblers,
as their name suggests, tumble through the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.129
air as they fly instead of rolling across
the ground.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.490
As an extreme example of selective breeding,
tumbling pigeons understandably piqued the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.310
interest of Charles Darwin, who wrote of the
birds in 1859:

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.050
No one would ever have thought of teaching,
or probably could have taught, the tumbler-pigeon

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.780
to tumble, – an action which, as I have
witnessed, is performed by young birds that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.770
have never seen a pigeon tumble.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.660
We may believe that some one pigeon showed
a slight tendency to this strange habit, and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.280
that long-continued selection of the best
individuals in successive generations made

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.640
tumblers what they now are; and near Glasgow
there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.230
Brent, which cannot fly eighteen inches high
without going head over heels.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.600
As noted by Darwin, tumbler pigeons seem to
have been artificially brought into this world

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.360
by selectively breeding pigeons who exhibited
a specific behaviour (in this case, rolling

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.960
over for no particular reason) over many generations
until the behaviour became ingrained and exaggerated

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.770
to an almost comical degree.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.980
Darwin himself, at least judging by this quote,
probably never saw a parlor roller, because

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.220
he describes a bird that could still fly at
least a little off the ground, though perhaps

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.700
it was these low flying parlor tumblers he
heard about that ultimately were bred into

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.030
the parlor rollers.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.999
In any event, because they’re only selectively
bred for their ability to roll, color is largely

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:27.129
unimportant when it comes to parlor rollers
and as a result, the birds come in a vast

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.580
array of colorations, from pure white to the
traditional iridescent coat of a common pigeon.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.780
In fact, potential purchasers of these birds
will quickly find that the breeders typically

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.200
price them based on how far the bird can roll
at a time before stopping- the farther they

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.670
can go in more or less a straight line, the
higher the price.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.620
On that note, although the birds will roll
of their own volition, in competition, breeders

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.370
and owners will roll the bird much like a
bowling ball to get them started…

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.689
We just want to reiterate that we’re not
making any of this up and that there really

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.989
are competitions where many people gather
to watch other people throw pigeons like bowling

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.060
balls and then watch to see how far they’ll
do backflips before stopping…

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.650
(No doubt alcohol was involved in some way
in the sports’ origins.)

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.249
If you’re curious, the current world record
for distance for a parlor roller continuously

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:25.820
backflipping is 662 feet and 3 inches (201.85
meters), though a typical competition sees

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.230
the winning birds roll more in the range of
approximately 50-80 feet (~15 to 25 meters).

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.190
Exactly why the parlor roller cannot fly past
the age of about three months (before this

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.030
they can achieve some level of flight for
a brief period after they are weaned) is a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.560
matter of contention amongst researchers.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.810
The birds have all the necessary equipment
and aren’t too heavy, so flight should be

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.810
within their grasp.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.180
A common theory is that the bird has “some
defect in the balance centres of the brain”

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:19.849
making it so when they attempt to fly, instead
of doing so, they flip over backwards…
