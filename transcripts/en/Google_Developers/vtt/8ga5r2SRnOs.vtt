Liu: I'm Stephanie Liu,
and I'm here today

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.901
with Leslie Hawthorn
from the open source team.

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:19.133
And, uh, they just
announced something

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.133
very exciting last week.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.534
You wanna tell us about it?

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:23.701
Hawthorn: Sure, absolutely,
so, last week we kicked off

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.734
the Google Summer of Code
program for 2009--

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:28.734
so this is our fifth year
of running the program,

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:31.100
so it's really exciting
to hit that milestone--

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.834
and we started
accepting applications

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.667
from open-source projects
who wanted to act as mentors

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.434
for various students
throughout the world

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:41.434
to work on their
respective code bases,

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:43.501
and yesterday was also
a really cool day.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.300
We announced the list of
accepted organizations for 2009,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.567
so we'll be working

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:50.334
with 150 free and open-source
software projects,

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.434
uh, to mentor
our students this year,

00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:53.367
which is pretty groovy.

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:57.634
Liu: Do you wanna tell us
a little bit of a history?

00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:59.667
Kinda like behind the program,
and, like, why we do this.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:01.968
Hawthorn: So, back in 2005,

00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:03.801
Larry Page,
one of our co-founders,

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:06.601
was thinking about
kind of an age-old problem,

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.300
which is, you know,
students go to school,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.534
they work really, really hard
during the term,

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:14.000
and then over the summer,
they go off

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.133
and do various assorted things,
and, you know, what happens?

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.534
Their--their knowledge
of their discipline atrophies.

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:21.367
And, you know,
he was thinking particularly

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.300
in terms of computer science,
right,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.267
and looking at sort of the--
the experience levels

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.701
of different folks who are
coming in through Google

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:30.234
and also what he was hearing
from other folks in industry,

00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:32.567
and finding, you know, a lot
of computer science graduates

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:36.834
weren't--or students weren't
actually able to find jobs

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:38.467
in computer science
or technical fields

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:39.701
during their summer holidays.

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:42.300
And, you know, hey, here's--
here you go,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.667
here's open source, right?

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.701
Open source
is completely distributed,

00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:47.267
you can work on it from,
you know,

00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:48.367
the comfort
of your own living room

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.334
or your local internet cafe,

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:52.868
uh, it doesn't require
a specific job opening

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:55.334
uh, to be available
to you, but, hey,

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:57.734
if Google provides stipends
to these students

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:59.434
who are working
on open source projects,

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:01.601
they have kind of
an "ex-ternship"

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.634
in their chosen field,
and they get the opportunity

00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:06.267
not only to have a job
in a technical field,

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:08.534
but to learn about real-world
software development scenarios,

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:11.200
right, so things like
using version control,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.133
or working in a distributed team
where, you know,

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.067
some of the developers
are in, say, London,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.234
and some in Beijing,
and some in Sydney.

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:18.367
Liu: That's definitely
important at Google,

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:19.367
with distributed teams.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:20.868
Hawthorn: Oh, yeah.

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:22.868
Liu: It's much more challenging
than you would think at first.

00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:24.534
Hawthorn: Um, so, the thing
I tell students

00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:25.767
who are looking
to apply to the program

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:27.801
is, uh, number one,
don't be intimidated.

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:30.934
Um, I hear over
and over and over again

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:33.100
that, you know, folks are--
you know,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.701
they think Summer of Code
is exciting,

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:37.534
they really like the idea
of participating in open source,

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:39.133
you know, but they're just--
they're scared to death

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:40.701
because they think
it's really competitive,

00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.534
and it's really hard to get in,
and they're not smart enough,

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:45.968
or they don't have a, you know,
rigorous enough background,

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:48.801
and, you know,
that's just not the case.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.667
We have a--a wide variety
of projects from a wide variety

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:54.267
of technical disciplines
working with us each year.

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:55.901
Some projects are
looking for people

00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:58.567
who have almost no experience
in computer science.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.434
Some of the projects
are looking for forks--

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:02.534
folks who are more advanced
and maybe doing, you know,

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:04.167
post-grad research, for example.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:06.334
So there's really
something for everybody.

00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:08.834
And--and one of my favorite
examples to cite here

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.367
is, uh, a gal by the name
of Angela Byron.

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:14.133
She was a student in
the very first Summer of Code,

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:17.067
in 2005, and when
Angie started off

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:18.367
working with the Drupal project,

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:21.133
she had never worked on
an open source project before,

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.300
she was a community
college student,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.067
and she took a look at
the Summer of Code and thought,

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:27.634
well, it's for students, right,

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.367
so they have to be
looking for beginners,

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.534
so this whole open source thing,
you know, I could do it too.

00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:34.167
And she got
involved with Drupal.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:36.033
Now she's one of
the biggest advocates

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:38.200
for the Drupal project,
and, you know,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.000
four-plus years later,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.400
she is the maintainer
for Drupal 7,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.000
which is the latest
release of Drupal,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.767
she's on the board of directors
for the Drupal Association,

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:50.701
so do not be intimidated, even
if you are an absolute beginner,

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:53.367
this is still something that's
completely accessible to you,

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.267
and if you're not
an absolute beginner,

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.601
again, it's accessible,
you just have to be willing to--

00:03:57.601 --> 00:03:59.534
to take a risk,
put it out there and apply.

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:01.300
The worst that you can do
is not get accepted

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.534
and continue to be excited

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.801
about a particular
open-source project.

00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:06.100
Keep working with them,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.834
keep learning more
about their code base,

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:09.868
keep submitting patches
or writing documentation

00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:11.901
or doing whatever
really excites you,

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:13.534
and then, you know, who knows
what the future will hold

00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:15.667
in terms of your opportunity
to work with that organization

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:16.968
in, like, a future
Summer of Code,

00:04:16.968 --> 00:04:18.100
if we do one again,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.033
or to get a job in that
particular field, right?

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.801
Liu: So, what--what're the--
let's talk stats a little bit.

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.467
Like, how many applicants
do we usually get,

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:27.701
how many people
will actually get accepted?

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.634
Hawthorn: So, last year we had
a little over 3,000 applicants.

00:04:30.634 --> 00:04:33.734
And we had a total
of about 7,000 applications.

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:37.067
And we actually accepted, uh,
just under 1,200 students.

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:40.000
So, you know, about a third,
uh, of our participants

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.400
actually, you know,
joined the program,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.567
so it's competitive,
but it's not as competitive

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.267
as a lot of grant programs.

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:46.634
Um, and we do allow students

00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:49.200
to apply to multiple
different projects,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.300
so let's say you're
equally excited about, uh,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.067
kernel hacking
and open source games.

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:57.067
So if you wanted to submit
an application to, say,

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.534
the Linux Foundation to work on
the kernel, you could do that,

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:01.801
and you can also submit
an application to work with,

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.167
say, the Thousand Parsec project

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:04.734
on their turn-based
strategy game.

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:05.734
That's totally cool.

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:07.534
You have up to 20 applications,

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:10.467
so you could submit all 20
to one organization,

00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:12.367
or 20 to 20 different ones
if you want to,

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:15.234
but, um, another, you know,
tidbit of advice

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:16.801
for students
who are thinking about, uh,

00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:18.267
applying to Summer of Code,

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.067
spend your time concentrating on
just a couple of applications,

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:23.033
something that you're
truly passionate about,

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:25.300
something that's
really exciting to you,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.033
because quality
is better than quantity.

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:28.801
We hear that universally
from our mentors,

00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:32.501
so again, find your passion,
scratch your own itch,

00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.300
it's what's--it's what's
exciting and compelling to you.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.868
And that passion and--
and desire to improve things

00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:39.167
is really gonna show through

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.801
when you're talking
to your potential mentors.

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:43.434
Liu: So, what--what are--
what are mentors,

00:05:43.434 --> 00:05:45.567
what are organizations,
and what are we looking for

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:46.634
when we're looking for the--
you know,

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:47.868
looking through
these applications?

00:05:47.868 --> 00:05:49.300
Hawthorn: For mentoring--

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.701
So, uh, a mentoring organization
is any group

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.300
who is working on a free
and open-source software project

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.000
or a technology project
that, again,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.467
results in the production
of open source code,

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.234
and this is--

00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:02.200
I mean, the organizations
that have participated--

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.701
both in past years
and this year's--

00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:08.434
are working on a hugely wide
variety of--of technical areas.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.501
I mean, you've got folks
who are working on, you know,

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.067
media player software,
you have folks who are doing

00:06:13.067 --> 00:06:15.234
content management systems
so that you can design,

00:06:15.234 --> 00:06:16.701
you know, websites
using their software.

00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:17.968
We've got folks
who are working

00:06:17.968 --> 00:06:20.167
on the Linux kernel
and kernel drivers,

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:22.133
we've got folks who are
working on, you know,

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:24.200
creating open-source games.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.634
We have folks who
are working on, you know,

00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:28.467
open-source CAD and automation
software, we've got--

00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:29.534
there's really a little bit

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:30.934
of something
for everybody, right.

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:32.367
And one of the reasons
why we select

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:34.000
so many different
types of projects is

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.400
we want students
who, you know,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.167
have a wide variety
of interests to come in

00:06:38.167 --> 00:06:40.534
and start participating
in open source development.

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:42.167
Um, in terms of what we look for

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.667
in the organizations
that we accept,

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:46.167
there's a whole wide
variety of factors,

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:48.300
and actually, if there are
projects who are interested

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.801
in learning more about that,
there's actually a full document

00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.767
uh, produced on our website
that'll tell you

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.367
a little bit more
about our selection criteria,

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:55.968
so if you're interested
in the future,

00:06:55.968 --> 00:06:57.601
that would be
a useful resource for you.

00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:01.300
So, other advice that I would
give to--to student participants

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.934
who wanna get involved
in Summer of Code

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:04.667
and just open source in general,

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:07.734
is do not wait
for Summer of Code to start

00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:09.467
to get involved
with an open source project

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:10.634
or to get involved
in open source,

00:07:10.634 --> 00:07:13.200
because Summer of Code
kicks off for the year,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.434
and all the folks who were,
uh, you know,

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.501
interested
in a particular project

00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:19.200
who are really invested
in that community,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.701
they get really, really busy.

00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:23.634
And if they've only gotten
to know you in the last week

00:07:23.634 --> 00:07:26.367
versus someone who's been
hanging around a long time

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:28.033
and contributing a few patches,

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:30.200
answering questions
on a mailing list,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.234
um, you know, hanging out
in the IRC channel

00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:33.667
fielding questions,

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.968
they're gonna be that much more
likely to want to accept

00:07:35.968 --> 00:07:38.634
that particular person,
and it's not necessarily because

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:42.133
they have prior open source
experience or that they have

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:44.133
more knowledge
about the project, exactly,

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:45.234
it's more about

00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:47.534
they've already seen
that that person

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:49.634
is willing to make
an investment in the community.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.100
There are so many good stories.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.100
Um...

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.200
Liu: I like stories.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.601
Hawthorn: I know,
I like stories too.

00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:00.701
Well, okay, so...

00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:02.334
Okay, I just wanna be--
go on record as saying

00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:04.133
I hate this part
'cause I always feel like

00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:06.334
every single one
of our students who finishes

00:08:06.334 --> 00:08:09.200
is their own success story,
and unfortunately, like,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.834
now we've got, you know,
2,400 students

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:12.234
who've completed the program,

00:08:12.234 --> 00:08:15.400
and I-I-I think I know maybe
350 of the success stories.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.767
I really should know them all.

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:19.801
Um, so, a couple of really cool
ones, like, uh, you know,

00:08:19.801 --> 00:08:21.601
I've already mentioned
Angie's story.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.200
Uh, we have a gal
by the name of Joanna Trinidad

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.767
who is, uh--who is in Brazil,

00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:28.400
and she worked
with the Globus Alliance.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.567
They're a group of folks

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.767
who are working
on computing technologies.

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:33.400
She worked on some
single sign-on software

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.834
for them last year,

00:08:34.834 --> 00:08:36.934
and as a result of her
Summer of Code project,

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:38.868
she was invited to be
a visiting researcher

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:41.567
at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign.

00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:44.767
So--And we hear from students
all the time, you know,

00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:47.167
"I got my dream job because
of being in Summer of Code,"

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:49.734
or, "I was hired
to work at this, uh,

00:08:49.734 --> 00:08:51.467
"software consultancy shop

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:52.901
"because of my
Summer of Code project,

00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.100
"and it was
my mentor's business,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.334
and I did so well
that he wants to hire me."

00:08:56.334 --> 00:08:59.400
Um, so, there's lots
of cool stuff like that.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.467
You know, other cool stuff
like you may have seen, um--

00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:06.000
I'm sure everyone's
seen the &lt;i&gt;Matrix&lt;/i&gt; movies--

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.734
um, one of our
Summer of Code students--

00:09:07.734 --> 00:09:08.734
Liu: Oh, that little thing?

00:09:08.734 --> 00:09:10.367
Hawthorn: Yeah, you know.

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:12.801
Um, take the red pill, man.

00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:15.534
Uh, one of our students,
Adriato Montero Marquez,

00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:17.901
one year he did a whole
graphical user interface

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:19.934
front end
for Nmap Security Scanner

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.234
that was in &lt;i&gt;The Matrix.&lt;/i&gt;

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:26.434
So, I think one of the coolest
projects right now

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:27.801
that I'm thinking about
for Summer of Code

00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:29.901
is actually Melange.

00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:33.934
And Melange is the code base
that's going to run

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:35.968
the Summer of Code program
from here on out.

00:09:35.968 --> 00:09:39.167
And it's the first open-source
project that was developed

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:41.467
at Google, in the open,
with community input

00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:43.300
from commit number one.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.634
And it was a result
of a couple of things.

00:09:45.634 --> 00:09:47.767
One, you know,
we've got a community

00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:49.400
of over 2,500 mentors

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.334
and 2,400 student participants
from past years.

00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:55.100
And, you know, clearly,
that's gonna be more people

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.968
than Google is ever
gonna be able to devote

00:09:56.968 --> 00:09:59.734
to doing engineering work
for Summer of Code, right?

00:09:59.734 --> 00:10:02.934
And also, we've had people
come to us over and over again,

00:10:02.934 --> 00:10:05.300
saying, "Hey, we love
Summer of Code,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.567
"we love the model,

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:09.033
"we wanna do our own
Summer of Code-like program.

00:10:09.033 --> 00:10:10.801
Can we use
your infrastructure?"

00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.133
And since the infrastructure
was all tied

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:13.400
into Google
back-end technologies,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.667
we were unable to do that.

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:17.901
But now, anybody can
take this code, run with it,

00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:19.934
plug it into whatever
database back-end they want.

00:10:19.934 --> 00:10:23.033
Um, our instance is running on
Google App Engine, for example.

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:25.434
And, you know,
make this program their own,

00:10:25.434 --> 00:10:26.901
make this model their own.

00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:28.834
And a lot of folks
have already done that.

00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:30.400
Right, we've got, like, uh...

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.267
The Finnish folks
have done a Summer of Code.

00:10:32.267 --> 00:10:34.868
We had, uh, a New Zealand
Summer of Code.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.567
There was a, um,
Season of Usability

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:39.934
for students to work
on usability issues

00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:41.367
in open source software.

00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:44.100
Like, the Gnome folks last year
did an accessibility outreach

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.133
Summer of Code-like thing.

00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:49.334
So, you know, we're watching
this meme spread,

00:10:49.334 --> 00:10:51.234
and now I've--I'm really excited
about the fact that

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:54.167
not only is the model spreading,
but now we're actually able

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:56.067
to provide to the community
an infrastructure

00:10:56.067 --> 00:10:58.033
to grow that model, and to--

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.300
you know, to make it
happen on your own.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.901
So that's really,
really groovy.

00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:02.601
Liu: That's really cool.

00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:03.868
Hawthorn: And even cooler--

00:11:03.868 --> 00:11:04.901
Not that I'm not, you know,

00:11:04.901 --> 00:11:06.801
totally biased
and excited about this--

00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:10.100
Is the, uh--the committer team
for the Melange project--

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.133
We actually handed over
project management, uh,

00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:14.801
to the community
back in January,

00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:16.200
and our project leader
is actually

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.901
a former Summer of Code student.

00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:21.167
Uh, Pawel Solyga, so he was
a Summer of Code student

00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:24.000
for two years, then he went on
to become a mentor

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.734
for, uh,
the Natural User Interface Group

00:11:26.734 --> 00:11:29.968
in 2008, and now in 2009,
he's, you know--

00:11:29.968 --> 00:11:31.667
he's the project lead
for the infrastructure

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:33.667
that's actually
making the program happen.

00:11:36.234 --> 00:11:41.367
Please visit
code.google.com/soc

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.868
for Summer of Code.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.601
And, if you would like
regular program updates,

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.634
um, but you're not necessarily
ready to apply

00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:48.901
for Summer of Code just yet,

00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:51.567
you can check out
all the news you can use

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:53.434
on, uh,
the Google Open Source Blog,

00:11:53.434 --> 00:11:58.934
which is
google-opensource.blogspot.com

00:11:58.934 --> 00:12:01.133
So come on over,
hang out on our blog,

00:12:01.133 --> 00:12:03.934
feel the love with us,
it's a beautiful thing.

00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:04.868
Liu: Cool. Thanks, Leslie.
Hawthorn: Thank you.
