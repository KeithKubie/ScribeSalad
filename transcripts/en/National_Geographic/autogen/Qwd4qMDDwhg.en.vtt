you'd like to know how I can tell or we
 

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.390
you'd like to know how I can tell or we
can tell when a sub-adult lioness

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400
can tell when a sub-adult lioness
 

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.860
can tell when a sub-adult lioness
actually becomes an adult

well lions are fully grown at about

00:17:59.640 --> 00:17:59.650
well lions are fully grown at about
 

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.860
well lions are fully grown at about
three to four years old and usually in

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:04.870
three to four years old and usually in
 

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.720

just by sight look at her apart from

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:08.650
just by sight look at her apart from
 

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.799
just by sight look at her apart from
actually knowing their date of birth or

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:10.809
actually knowing their date of birth or
 

00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:12.659
actually knowing their date of birth or
something like that you would notice

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:12.669
something like that you would notice
 

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:16.620
something like that you would notice
that as the years go on the nose of the

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:16.630
that as the years go on the nose of the
 

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.350
that as the years go on the nose of the
lioness which is probably very pink when

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360
lioness which is probably very pink when
 

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.210
lioness which is probably very pink when
they're sub-adult so it is quite pink

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.220
they're sub-adult so it is quite pink
 

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.190
they're sub-adult so it is quite pink
when they're sub-adults

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200
when they're sub-adults
 

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.590
when they're sub-adults
gets darker that's one of the things

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600
gets darker that's one of the things
 

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.810
gets darker that's one of the things
that is quite obvious you also notice

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:27.820
that is quite obvious you also notice
 

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:33.600
that is quite obvious you also notice
even stature size that sort of thing but

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:33.610
even stature size that sort of thing but
 

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.169
even stature size that sort of thing but
I find it most the most obvious thing to

00:18:37.169 --> 00:18:37.179
I find it most the most obvious thing to
 

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:39.000
I find it most the most obvious thing to
me is that a lot of the time before they

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.010
me is that a lot of the time before they
 

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.210
me is that a lot of the time before they
are fully grown adults or they sort of

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:42.220
are fully grown adults or they sort of
 

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.030
are fully grown adults or they sort of
reach their peak which is about seven

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.040
reach their peak which is about seven
 

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.860
reach their peak which is about seven
years old you'll find that their face

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:46.870
years old you'll find that their face
 

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.770
years old you'll find that their face
still looks quite young if that makes

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:49.780
still looks quite young if that makes
 

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.990
still looks quite young if that makes
sense if these two just look at us then

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000
sense if these two just look at us then
 

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.180
sense if these two just look at us then
I could show you what I mean but you'll

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.190
I could show you what I mean but you'll
 

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.159
I could show you what I mean but you'll
find that they they do look still look a

00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:56.169
find that they they do look still look a
 

00:18:56.169 --> 00:19:00.780
find that they they do look still look a
bit cub like that usually goes away by

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:00.790
bit cub like that usually goes away by
 

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.970
bit cub like that usually goes away by
the time they're about 2 or 3 I find but

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:05.980
the time they're about 2 or 3 I find but
 

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.280
the time they're about 2 or 3 I find but
then after that it's there you're pretty

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.290
then after that it's there you're pretty
 

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.409
then after that it's there you're pretty
much looking at at an adult once it's

00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:10.419
much looking at at an adult once it's
 

00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:12.659
much looking at at an adult once it's
capable but like I said they're fully

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:12.669
capable but like I said they're fully
 

00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:16.020
capable but like I said they're fully
grown and they reach a maximum size at

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.030
grown and they reach a maximum size at
 

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:20.940
grown and they reach a maximum size at
around 7 years old so when these two

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:20.950
around 7 years old so when these two
 

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.440
around 7 years old so when these two
look at us we'll be able to do a nice

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:22.450
look at us we'll be able to do a nice
 

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:27.360
look at us we'll be able to do a nice
comparison especially looking at their

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:27.370
comparison especially looking at their
 

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.740
comparison especially looking at their
faces I always find looking at their

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:28.750
faces I always find looking at their
 

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:39.270
faces I always find looking at their
face is quite helpful

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280
 
 

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.520

the vehicle coming in they might just
 

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.380
the vehicle coming in they might just
lift up their head once look at me and

lift up their head once look at me and
 

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.980
lift up their head once look at me and
that's about it

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:52.990
that's about it
 

00:19:52.990 --> 00:20:10.480
that's about it
there's nothing seems to bother them

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.490
 
 

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.890

theories is that because they're on
their back and they're exposing sort of

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:14.470
their back and they're exposing sort of
 

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:16.530
their back and they're exposing sort of
the thin thinnest skin on the underneath

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:16.540
the thin thinnest skin on the underneath
 

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.000
the thin thinnest skin on the underneath
and you'll see that their legs sort of

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.010
and you'll see that their legs sort of
 

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.010
and you'll see that their legs sort of
flop apart so that thin skin is on this

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:20.020
flop apart so that thin skin is on this
 

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.550
flop apart so that thin skin is on this
is being exposed that they'll actually

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560
is being exposed that they'll actually
 

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.880
is being exposed that they'll actually
be able to cool themselves down easier

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:26.890
be able to cool themselves down easier
 

00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:29.190
be able to cool themselves down easier
with their legs that way now you'll see

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200
with their legs that way now you'll see
 

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.020
with their legs that way now you'll see
that Oh will will see when they start to

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:31.030
that Oh will will see when they start to
 

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.810
that Oh will will see when they start to
mate that the female doesn't as well but

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:33.820
mate that the female doesn't as well but
 

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.060
mate that the female doesn't as well but
she'll do it in a different way or for

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:36.070
she'll do it in a different way or for
 

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.070
she'll do it in a different way or for
different reason when you see lions just

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:38.080
different reason when you see lions just
 

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.270
different reason when you see lions just
like this and they're just chilling on

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280
like this and they're just chilling on
 

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.980
like this and they're just chilling on
their backs it's probably that they're

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:40.990
their backs it's probably that they're
 

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:43.080
their backs it's probably that they're
trying to cool themselves with that thin

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.090
trying to cool themselves with that thin
 

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.300
trying to cool themselves with that thin
skin but when you see females after

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:45.310
skin but when you see females after
 

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.370
skin but when you see females after
mating rolling on their back it's more

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:47.380
mating rolling on their back it's more
 

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.560
mating rolling on their back it's more
likely that they're trying it's sort of

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:49.570
likely that they're trying it's sort of
 

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.940
likely that they're trying it's sort of
an instinctual thing they roll on their

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:50.950
an instinctual thing they roll on their
 

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:52.410
an instinctual thing they roll on their
back after they mate because apparently

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:52.420
back after they mate because apparently
 

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.890
back after they mate because apparently
it may help in getting the sperm all the

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:55.900
it may help in getting the sperm all the
 

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.650
it may help in getting the sperm all the
way up into the lioness so that maybe we

00:34:58.650 --> 00:34:58.660
way up into the lioness so that maybe we
 

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.720
way up into the lioness so that maybe we
all can get some lion cubs or that the

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:00.730
all can get some lion cubs or that the
 

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.520
all can get some lion cubs or that the
chance of it may be higher but it seems

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:02.530
chance of it may be higher but it seems
 

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.720
chance of it may be higher but it seems
to be an instinctual thing they just

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:03.730
to be an instinctual thing they just
 

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:05.520
to be an instinctual thing they just
kind of roll onto their backs afterwards

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:05.530
kind of roll onto their backs afterwards
 

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:11.640
kind of roll onto their backs afterwards
but that is the theory it's not actually

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:11.650
but that is the theory it's not actually
 

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.980
but that is the theory it's not actually
very hot in fact I've just put my my

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:13.990
very hot in fact I've just put my my
 

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:15.630
very hot in fact I've just put my my
jacket on because I'm feeling a bit

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640
jacket on because I'm feeling a bit
 

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.950
jacket on because I'm feeling a bit
chilly

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960
 
 

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.200
 
but obviously this vocal mail is still

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.210
but obviously this vocal mail is still
 

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:27.190
but obviously this vocal mail is still
feeling a bit warm well if you're going

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200
feeling a bit warm well if you're going
 

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.349
feeling a bit warm well if you're going
to be mating the three thousand times

00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359
 
 

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:36.339
 
that's probably he's probably worth your

00:35:36.339 --> 00:35:36.349
that's probably he's probably worth your
 

00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:38.559
that's probably he's probably worth your
rest zebra and did you say maybe because

00:35:38.559 --> 00:35:38.569
rest zebra and did you say maybe because
 

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:40.510
rest zebra and did you say maybe because
it's comfortable yes absolutely I think

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520
it's comfortable yes absolutely I think
 

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.520
it's comfortable yes absolutely I think
that too it might just be a comfortable

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:42.530
that too it might just be a comfortable
 

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.069
that too it might just be a comfortable
position it's not always there's not

00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079
position it's not always there's not
 

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:48.069
position it's not always there's not
always a biological reason for it that

00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079
always a biological reason for it that
 

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.630
always a biological reason for it that
we know of yet it might just be a

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640
we know of yet it might just be a
 

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.609
we know of yet it might just be a
comfort well maybe he's just decided

00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:51.619
comfort well maybe he's just decided
 

00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:53.500
comfort well maybe he's just decided
it's a bit itchy on that side I'm gonna

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:53.510
it's a bit itchy on that side I'm gonna
 

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:58.240
it's a bit itchy on that side I'm gonna
roll over it definitely could just be

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:58.250
roll over it definitely could just be
 

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:06.280
roll over it definitely could just be
that Oh some movement we've got is a

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:06.290
that Oh some movement we've got is a
 

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.650
that Oh some movement we've got is a
canine sticking out there from one of

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:08.660
canine sticking out there from one of
 

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:15.520
canine sticking out there from one of
the females but that is the extent of

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:15.530
the females but that is the extent of
 

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.040
the females but that is the extent of
the movement at the moment her lip

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.050
the movement at the moment her lip
 

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.049
the movement at the moment her lip
flopped down to reveal that kayla was a

00:36:20.049 --> 00:36:20.059
flopped down to reveal that kayla was a
 

00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:23.349
flopped down to reveal that kayla was a
massive it was so much excitement it is

00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359
massive it was so much excitement it is
 

00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:25.000
massive it was so much excitement it is
it's endless Emma says it's endless I

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.010
it's endless Emma says it's endless I
 

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:34.330
it's endless Emma says it's endless I
agree with that

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:34.340
 
 

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.120
 
they'll spend most of the day like that

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:37.130
they'll spend most of the day like that
 

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.940
they'll spend most of the day like that
in fact I'm going to take a bet at what

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:39.950
in fact I'm going to take a bet at what
 

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.710
in fact I'm going to take a bet at what
time I think they'll start to move I

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720
time I think they'll start to move I
 

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:48.700
time I think they'll start to move I
think at about quarter to 6:00 that's my

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:48.710
think at about quarter to 6:00 that's my
 

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:55.960
think at about quarter to 6:00 that's my
guess it's like I said it's when I was

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:55.970
guess it's like I said it's when I was
 

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.280
guess it's like I said it's when I was
speaking about the Avoca mail and

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:57.290
speaking about the Avoca mail and
 

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.110
speaking about the Avoca mail and
talking about him feeling hot or perhaps

00:36:59.110 --> 00:36:59.120
talking about him feeling hot or perhaps
 

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.610
talking about him feeling hot or perhaps
feeling warm and that's why he's doing

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:00.620
feeling warm and that's why he's doing
 

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.680
feeling warm and that's why he's doing
that is that they're going to mate at

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:02.690
that is that they're going to mate at
 

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.320
that is that they're going to mate at
least or estimated Mount amount of about

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.330
least or estimated Mount amount of about
 

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:08.230
least or estimated Mount amount of about
3,000 times before an actual cub will be

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240
3,000 times before an actual cub will be
 

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.440
3,000 times before an actual cub will be
a sired or at least the the males would

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:11.450
a sired or at least the the males would
 

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:14.080
a sired or at least the the males would
and that's I think that's quite

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.090
and that's I think that's quite
 

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.520
and that's I think that's quite
incredible it also gives you an idea of

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:15.530
incredible it also gives you an idea of
 

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.400
incredible it also gives you an idea of
how much effort it takes to produce one

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:18.410
how much effort it takes to produce one
 

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.710
how much effort it takes to produce one
litter of Cubs and it obviously has to

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720
litter of Cubs and it obviously has to
 

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.960
litter of Cubs and it obviously has to
do with the fact that most of the mating

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:22.970
do with the fact that most of the mating
 

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:27.190
do with the fact that most of the mating
is in order to induce ovulation in the

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200
is in order to induce ovulation in the
 

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.140
is in order to induce ovulation in the
females and that once ovulation is

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:29.150
females and that once ovulation is
 

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.300
females and that once ovulation is
actually induced it's about a 95 percent

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:31.310
actually induced it's about a 95 percent
 

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.810
actually induced it's about a 95 percent
chance of that egg actually being

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:34.820
chance of that egg actually being
 

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.620
chance of that egg actually being
fertilized so most of this mating has a

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:38.630
fertilized so most of this mating has a
 

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.810
fertilized so most of this mating has a
lot more to do with trying to get that

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:40.820
lot more to do with trying to get that
 

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.030
lot more to do with trying to get that
female to ovulate and then one that once

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040
female to ovulate and then one that once
 

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.610
female to ovulate and then one that once
that's done we can look forward to Cubs

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:45.620
that's done we can look forward to Cubs
 

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.060
that's done we can look forward to Cubs
but it's like I said that might take

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.070
but it's like I said that might take
 

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:56.200
but it's like I said that might take
3,000 mating actual acts

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.210
 
 

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:08.120
 
no wonder these guys are tired

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.130
 
 

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.880
 
that's very true we do have double the

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:10.890
that's very true we do have double the
 

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.370
that's very true we do have double the
chance with these lions and the ones

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380
chance with these lions and the ones
 

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.410
chance with these lions and the ones
with Steve so let's go to him and see if

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420
with Steve so let's go to him and see if
 

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.930
with Steve so let's go to him and see if
his have done any exciting things like

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940
his have done any exciting things like
 

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:26.380
his have done any exciting things like
reveal canines

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.390
 
 

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.740
 
mmm juice I'm sitting right here waiting

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:29.750
mmm juice I'm sitting right here waiting
 

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.920
mmm juice I'm sitting right here waiting
for some more action to unfold but you

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:32.930
for some more action to unfold but you
 

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:34.570
for some more action to unfold but you
are very right I've got a very strong

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:34.580
are very right I've got a very strong
 

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.450
are very right I've got a very strong
suspicion that I don't know exactly when

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:37.460
suspicion that I don't know exactly when
 

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.760
suspicion that I don't know exactly when
but at some stage this afternoon no

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:39.770
but at some stage this afternoon no
 

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:42.880
but at some stage this afternoon no
doubt the two groups are going to join I

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:42.890
doubt the two groups are going to join I
 

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.210
doubt the two groups are going to join I

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:39.010
 
well it's good and bad I mean we haven't

found what we're looking for yet but the
 

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.330
found what we're looking for yet but the
tracks are getting fresher and fresher

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:43.340
tracks are getting fresher and fresher
 

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.490

we found that she went to chill a pan

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:49.820
we found that she went to chill a pan
 

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.550
we found that she went to chill a pan
and she's now come down across the

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:51.560
and she's now come down across the
 

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.580

in general but her tracks are getting

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:56.690
in general but her tracks are getting
 

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.970
in general but her tracks are getting
better and better they're on top of

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:57.980
better and better they're on top of
 

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.820
better and better they're on top of
everything they're nice and crisp and

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:00.830
everything they're nice and crisp and
 

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.290
everything they're nice and crisp and
clear and because we've had winter day

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:02.300
clear and because we've had winter day
 

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.910
clear and because we've had winter day
you would expect some disturbance on

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920
you would expect some disturbance on
 

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.860
you would expect some disturbance on
them but these tracks are kind of

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:05.870
them but these tracks are kind of
 

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.290
them but these tracks are kind of
shining a little bit and so I'm hoping

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:08.300
shining a little bit and so I'm hoping
 

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.630
shining a little bit and so I'm hoping
that we're gonna bump into somewhere

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640
that we're gonna bump into somewhere
 

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.730
that we're gonna bump into somewhere
around this area just taking it very

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:12.740
around this area just taking it very
 

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.870
around this area just taking it very
very slow because the tracks are almost

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880
very slow because the tracks are almost
 

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.140
very slow because the tracks are almost
impossible to see in places the roads

what's what have we got your sins so

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:25.850
what's what have we got your sins so
 

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:27.370
what's what have we got your sins so
there we go it looks like she walked

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:27.380
there we go it looks like she walked
 

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.070
there we go it looks like she walked
here there we go so she's walked on this

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:30.080
here there we go so she's walked on this
 

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.440

left side I'll try pull over so sins can

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:32.450
left side I'll try pull over so sins can
 

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.600

show you but there's a track that's just

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:34.610
show you but there's a track that's just
 

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.380
show you but there's a track that's just
there that's going up this pathway and

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:38.390
there that's going up this pathway and
 

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:40.660
there that's going up this pathway and
she's walking kind of on the road there

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:40.670
she's walking kind of on the road there
 

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.480
she's walking kind of on the road there
you can kind of see that's the tracks

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:43.490
you can kind of see that's the tracks
 

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:44.320
you can kind of see that's the tracks
that we're looking for and they're

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:44.330
that we're looking for and they're
 

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.060
that we're looking for and they're
starting to look really nice and crisp

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:46.070
starting to look really nice and crisp
 

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.250
starting to look really nice and crisp
and clear which is really good news so

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:48.260
and clear which is really good news so
 

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.450
and clear which is really good news so
hopefully we gonna track her down

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:49.460
hopefully we gonna track her down
 

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.140
hopefully we gonna track her down
it could be Tandy it's possible but I

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:53.150
it could be Tandy it's possible but I
 

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.330
it could be Tandy it's possible but I
suspect that this is Columba that we're

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:55.340
suspect that this is Columba that we're
 

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.040
suspect that this is Columba that we're
following just given where it's come

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:57.050
following just given where it's come
 

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.270
following just given where it's come
from I mean it's we've been tracking for

00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280
from I mean it's we've been tracking for
 

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.550
from I mean it's we've been tracking for
a long time now we've gone a long way so

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560
a long time now we've gone a long way so
 

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.650
a long time now we've gone a long way so
let's see if we can find it there's a

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:02.660
let's see if we can find it there's a
 

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.270
let's see if we can find it there's a
little pan at the edge here it's got no

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280
little pan at the edge here it's got no
 

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.210
little pan at the edge here it's got no
warts in it so it's very possible that

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:07.220
warts in it so it's very possible that
 

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.910
warts in it so it's very possible that
she kind of came here to look for water

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920
she kind of came here to look for water
 

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.560
she kind of came here to look for water
but because there's no water she might

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:11.570
but because there's no water she might
 

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:17.590
but because there's no water she might
have moved off naturally it's incredibly

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:17.600
have moved off naturally it's incredibly
 

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.970
have moved off naturally it's incredibly
difficult to track her lumber because

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:18.980
difficult to track her lumber because
 

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.660
difficult to track her lumber because
she doesn't walk on roads as much scent

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:22.670
she doesn't walk on roads as much scent
 

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.370
she doesn't walk on roads as much scent
marking she's kind of just goes wherever

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:24.380

her heart feels she just kind of bounces

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:27.050
her heart feels she just kind of bounces
 

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:28.930
her heart feels she just kind of bounces
around and crosses roads all over the

doesn't sit still for long periods of
 

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.250
doesn't sit still for long periods of
time at all which makes finding her and

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:36.260
time at all which makes finding her and
 

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.020

night me you've got to just kind of be

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:38.030
night me you've got to just kind of be

lot of it because she just doesn't

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240
lot of it because she just doesn't
 

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.480
lot of it because she just doesn't
really stop and when she does stop she

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:43.490
really stop and when she does stop she
 

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.070
really stop and when she does stop she
tends to stop in thicker areas at the

she makes life a little bit tricky in

that regard but it's it's nice because

that regard but it's it's nice because
she is active which means that a lot of

about alarm calls on themselves which

close by here somewhere she's going to
 

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:13.380
close by here somewhere she's going to
spark an alarm call and that's going to

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:13.390
spark an alarm call and that's going to
 

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.000
spark an alarm call and that's going to
help us and we're gonna be able to then

help us and we're gonna be able to then

help us and we're gonna be able to then
find it because of that now there's a

just want to double check if she didn't

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:23.650
just want to double check if she didn't
 

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.800
just want to double check if she didn't
cross over somewhere here it kind of

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:25.810
cross over somewhere here it kind of
 

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.530
cross over somewhere here it kind of
goes off in towards this drainage where

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:28.540
goes off in towards this drainage where
 

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.680
goes off in towards this drainage where
she spent a lot of time as a small cub

it doesn't look like she's come over

here we'll just check a little bit

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:34.690
here we'll just check a little bit
 

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.870
here we'll just check a little bit
further because sometimes they go over a

further because sometimes they go over a
 

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.280
further because sometimes they go over a
little bit further on there's like a

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:38.290
little bit further on there's like a
 

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:40.530

to my right now you see she's been up

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.150
to my right now you see she's been up
 

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:48.359
to my right now you see she's been up
and down here and has heard of Franklin

00:45:48.359 --> 00:45:48.369
and down here and has heard of Franklin

I think she's very close I don't think

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:56.590
I think she's very close I don't think
 

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.050
I think she's very close I don't think
we're far behind her at all at the

could be but mostly the problem with
 

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.230
could be but mostly the problem with
Cubs in the fact that they have such a

Cubs in the fact that they have such a
 

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.650

high mortality rate in lots of big cats
 

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.220
high mortality rate in lots of big cats
is the fact that no male that comes into

Cubs that are not his own so the biggest
 

01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:47.280

that she can actually have his own Cubs

in terms of mange mange being a problem

01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740
in terms of mange mange being a problem

in terms of mange mange being a problem
now mange is a mite that buries itself

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:01.540
now mange is a mite that buries itself
 

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.670
now mange is a mite that buries itself
into the skin and I suppose Cubs could

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680
into the skin and I suppose Cubs could
 

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.650
into the skin and I suppose Cubs could
get mange but mange is not really going

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:07.660
get mange but mange is not really going
 

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.680
get mange but mange is not really going

doing what lipids do when they get seen
 

01:27:53.230 --> 01:27:54.840
doing what lipids do when they get seen
as they kind of truck off to thickets

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:54.850
as they kind of truck off to thickets
 

01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:56.550
as they kind of truck off to thickets
and then they sit there and they kind of

01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560
and then they sit there and they kind of
 

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.680
and then they sit there and they kind of

01:27:58.680 --> 01:27:58.690
hide away so no darts are just driven
 

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.570
hide away so no darts are just driven
around - it's so dense in there that

01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:00.580
around - it's so dense in there that
 

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:02.340
around - it's so dense in there that
there's so many little hidey holes that

again so anyway it is what it is I mean
you know it's getting dark now so I

01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:14.020
you know it's getting dark now so I
 

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.229
you know it's getting dark now so I
can't really go back on foot and try and

01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239
can't really go back on foot and try and
 

01:28:16.239 --> 01:28:17.820
can't really go back on foot and try and
kind of find her again from your tracks

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:17.830
kind of find her again from your tracks
 

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:19.740
kind of find her again from your tracks
plus that leopard now is gonna be so

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:19.750
plus that leopard now is gonna be so
 

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:21.990
plus that leopard now is gonna be so
alert to any presence that if I walk

01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000
alert to any presence that if I walk
 

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.280
alert to any presence that if I walk
there she's just gonna keep running from

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:23.290
there she's just gonna keep running from
 

01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:27.420
there she's just gonna keep running from
me and it's not really gonna work no I

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:27.430
me and it's not really gonna work no I
 

01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:29.670
me and it's not really gonna work no I
don't think so I think I just got closer

01:28:29.670 --> 01:28:29.680
don't think so I think I just got closer
 

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.080
don't think so I think I just got closer
than that lipid thought I would be H

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:31.090
than that lipid thought I would be H
 

01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:32.970
than that lipid thought I would be H
because what happened was cuz we

01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:32.980
because what happened was cuz we
 

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.229
because what happened was cuz we
followed the tracks and it was some Jana

01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239
followed the tracks and it was some Jana
 

01:28:34.239 --> 01:28:36.060
followed the tracks and it was some Jana
that were very relaxed and I kind of

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:36.070
that were very relaxed and I kind of
 

01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:37.770
that were very relaxed and I kind of
lost the track there and we came back

01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:37.780
lost the track there and we came back
 

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:39.420
lost the track there and we came back
and then I figured out the tracks again

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:39.430
and then I figured out the tracks again
 

01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:41.459
and then I figured out the tracks again
and got down into this dub

01:28:41.459 --> 01:28:41.469
and got down into this dub
 

01:28:41.469 --> 01:28:43.350
and got down into this dub
and the tracks were really really really

01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360
and the tracks were really really really
 

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.000
and the tracks were really really really
fresh and they went up onto this rise

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:45.010
fresh and they went up onto this rise
 

01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:47.729
fresh and they went up onto this rise
and I wasn't expecting this little mud

01:28:47.729 --> 01:28:47.739
and I wasn't expecting this little mud
 

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:50.520
and I wasn't expecting this little mud
water further on from that pathway so I

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:50.530
water further on from that pathway so I
 

01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:51.899
water further on from that pathway so I
was expecting maybe that that lipid

01:28:51.899 --> 01:28:51.909
was expecting maybe that that lipid
 

01:28:51.909 --> 01:28:54.870
was expecting maybe that that lipid
would be there and so as I came up she

01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880
would be there and so as I came up she
 

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.520
would be there and so as I came up she
was close I mean she was maybe I don't

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:56.530
was close I mean she was maybe I don't
 

01:28:56.530 --> 01:29:00.089
was close I mean she was maybe I don't
know but even in five maybe four five he

01:29:00.089 --> 01:29:00.099
know but even in five maybe four five he
 

01:29:00.099 --> 01:29:01.680
know but even in five maybe four five he
meets his sort of ten meters away from

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:01.690
meets his sort of ten meters away from
 

01:29:01.690 --> 01:29:04.290
meets his sort of ten meters away from
where I was and obviously just gave her

01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:04.300
where I was and obviously just gave her
 

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.399
where I was and obviously just gave her
a little bit of a fright she didn't

01:29:05.399 --> 01:29:05.409
a little bit of a fright she didn't
 

01:29:05.409 --> 01:29:08.549
a little bit of a fright she didn't
expect me to pop up right there and so

01:29:08.549 --> 01:29:08.559
expect me to pop up right there and so
 

01:29:08.559 --> 01:29:10.140
expect me to pop up right there and so
that's what's happened unfortunately it

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:10.150
that's what's happened unfortunately it
 

01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:11.310
that's what's happened unfortunately it
does happen from time to time with

01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320
does happen from time to time with
 

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.709
does happen from time to time with
tracking that's one of the hard parts of

01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719
tracking that's one of the hard parts of
 

01:29:13.719 --> 01:29:15.989
tracking that's one of the hard parts of
being on foot is that sometimes if

01:29:15.989 --> 01:29:15.999
being on foot is that sometimes if
 

01:29:15.999 --> 01:29:17.580
being on foot is that sometimes if
there's not a kill or something like

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:17.590
there's not a kill or something like
 

01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:19.109
there's not a kill or something like
that the lipid can get a little shy and

01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:19.119
that the lipid can get a little shy and
 

01:29:19.119 --> 01:29:23.100
that the lipid can get a little shy and
just kind of sneak off but I feel like

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:23.110
just kind of sneak off but I feel like
 

01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:24.810
just kind of sneak off but I feel like
it's it's a frustration because it was a

01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:24.820
it's it's a frustration because it was a
 

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.969
it's it's a frustration because it was a
job well done we tracked a long long way

01:29:26.969 --> 01:29:26.979
job well done we tracked a long long way
 

01:29:26.979 --> 01:29:30.600
job well done we tracked a long long way
together and then unfortunately just

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:30.610
together and then unfortunately just
 

01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:33.540
together and then unfortunately just
didn't find it at the car to show all of

didn't find it at the car to show all of
 

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:35.939
didn't find it at the car to show all of

drone we managed to bump into with the
car exactly where I found on foot so we

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:22.770
car exactly where I found on foot so we
 

01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:24.649
car exactly where I found on foot so we
decided to come all the way back just in

01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659
decided to come all the way back just in
 

01:49:24.659 --> 01:49:27.560

we've managed to find her like I said it
 

01:49:41.579 --> 01:49:43.310
we've managed to find her like I said it
was a long track to get to I mean she's

01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320
was a long track to get to I mean she's
 

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.490
was a long track to get to I mean she's
walked all the way from Rebecca's - yeah

01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:46.500
walked all the way from Rebecca's - yeah
 

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.890

which probably is meaningless to most of

01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:48.900
which probably is meaningless to most of
 

01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:52.010
which probably is meaningless to most of
you but it's about in terms of walking

01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:52.020
you but it's about in terms of walking
 

01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:53.689
you but it's about in terms of walking
time would be probably about a two hour

01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699
time would be probably about a two hour
 

01:49:53.699 --> 01:49:57.109
time would be probably about a two hour
walk if you had to track but she looks

01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119
walk if you had to track but she looks
 

01:49:57.119 --> 01:49:58.850
walk if you had to track but she looks
like she's kind of watching down below

01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860
like she's kind of watching down below
 

01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:00.140
like she's kind of watching down below
there I wonder if she maybe doesn't have

01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:00.150
there I wonder if she maybe doesn't have
 

01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:03.260
there I wonder if she maybe doesn't have
a kill here somewhere um where she's

01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:03.270
a kill here somewhere um where she's
 

01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:04.910
a kill here somewhere um where she's
looking down is exactly where I was

01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920
looking down is exactly where I was
 

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.250
looking down is exactly where I was
coming up when she spotted me earlier

01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260
coming up when she spotted me earlier
 

01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.680
coming up when she spotted me earlier
and where she kind of moved off from now

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:09.690
and where she kind of moved off from now
 

01:50:09.690 --> 01:50:12.109
and where she kind of moved off from now
but let's see maybe she's got some sort

01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119
but let's see maybe she's got some sort
 

01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:13.850
but let's see maybe she's got some sort
of food item you can see are difficult

01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860
of food item you can see are difficult
 

01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.350

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.140
the terrain is here though I mean it's
really almost impossible to get any sort

01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:18.150
really almost impossible to get any sort

01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.050
think let's try and kind of figure out a
way to get to where she is I'm gonna

01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.060
way to get to where she is I'm gonna
 

01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:54.910
way to get to where she is I'm gonna
have to try and cross back over we I

01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920
have to try and cross back over we I
 

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.750

let's try and figure out how we gonna

01:52:58.490 --> 01:52:58.500
let's try and figure out how we gonna
 

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.020
let's try and figure out how we gonna
get there because where she's gone now

01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:00.030
get there because where she's gone now
 

01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:04.870
get there because where she's gone now
is very unfriendly but it is a kind of

01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880
is very unfriendly but it is a kind of
 

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:08.839
is very unfriendly but it is a kind of
way it's going to be safer for her can

01:53:08.839 --> 01:53:08.849
way it's going to be safer for her can
 

01:53:08.849 --> 01:53:11.750
way it's going to be safer for her can
you see yeah no we can't go that way and

drainage line we have to go over the
 

01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:24.169
drainage line we have to go over the
drainage line and then drive on the

01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:24.179
drainage line and then drive on the
 

01:53:24.179 --> 01:53:26.000
drainage line and then drive on the
other side for a little bit and then
