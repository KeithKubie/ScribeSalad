00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's think about who bears the burden

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.767
of a tax in different situations.

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:06.678
In this video, we're
going to focus on insulin.

00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:08.133
Insulin is interesting.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.736
It's what's needed by Diabetes

00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:12.181
in order to maintain
their blood sugar level

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:14.347
so for them, you can almost imagine

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.150
they need this just to survive.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.606
It almost has an infinite
marginal benefit for them.

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:21.069
So they're willing, no
matter what the price,

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:22.536
they're essentially willing to take the

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:24.066
insulin that they need to take.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.596
So, for example, even if
the price of insulin were

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:29.613
a dollar, if the doctors in
this town say collectively

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.800
all the diabetics need 3,000 vials a year,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.929
they will take 3,000 vials a year.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.592
If the price is $80 a vial,

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:37.348
they'll still take 3,000 vials a year.

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.936
So within reason, within a reasonable

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.013
price range, you have no change

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:42.542
in quantity demanded.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.802
So, in this case,

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:46.312
at least in a reasonable price range,

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:51.189
the demand curve for insulin is vertical.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:52.990
Obviously, if we went up to prices like

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.462
$9 million per vial, then all of a sudden,

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:58.728
some of the diabetics just won't be able

00:00:58.728 --> 00:00:59.923
to afford it, and all of a sudden,

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.528
the curve wouldn't be able
to be vertical anymore.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.394
But at least in a reasonable price range,

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:05.257
you have a vertical curve.

00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:07.772
So this right over here
is our demand curve.

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:09.923
That is our demand curve.

00:01:09.923 --> 00:01:11.124
You might remember when

00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:12.322
we talked about elasticity,

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.055
this is perfectly inelastic demand.

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:19.924
It's perfectly inelastic
... perfectly inelastic.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:21.858
The way you can think about it,

00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:22.982
I kind of think of a brick

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.263
as perfectly inelastic.

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:25.861
No matter how much you
push or pull on the brick

00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:28.932
within reason, at least
with my level of strength,

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:31.729
you're not going to be
able to deform the brick.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.336
That's the opposite of a rubber band,

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.279
which is very elastic, or you can

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.279
think about the definition of elasticity,

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:38.445
the one that we've been using,

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:41.746
elasticity is equal to percent,

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:48.030
change in quantity over
percent, change in price.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.135
Over here, no matter how much we

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:50.940
change price within reason,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.401
at least in this range of
price along this curve,

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:55.382
people are still going to demand

00:01:55.382 --> 00:02:00.211
a quantity of 3,000 vials per year.

00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:04.379
Let's just draw a supply curve here,

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:05.800
so let's do a supply curve,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.625
looks something like that,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:11.664
So if you have ... this is supply,

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.882
so if you have no taxes,

00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:16.297
no regulation of this market,

00:02:16.297 --> 00:02:18.303
based on the way I've
drawn it right over here,

00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:19.630
the equilibrium price lands us

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.808
right around $75.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.342
I did a little research before this video,

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.122
it actually turns out that is

00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:26.889
about the market price
for a vial of insulin.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.229
The equilibrium quantity, because that is

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.564
the exact quantity that people need

00:02:30.564 --> 00:02:32.064
is 3,000 vials.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.477
A slightly interesting
thing to think about

00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:36.396
in this situation where you have perfectly

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:39.942
inelastic demand, is
what is the producer's

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:42.290
surplus and the consumer's surplus?

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.944
The producer's surplus is how much more

00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:46.356
money they're getting relative to their,

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:48.801
you can view them as
their opportunity cost

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.803
or their incremental marginal cost,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.120
and here we will [unintelligible]

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.115
multiple times, this is the producer's

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:54.448
surplus right over here.

00:02:54.448 --> 00:02:56.256
It's the area between the prices equal

00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:58.391
to the clearing price
and our supply curve.

00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:00.736
So, that's our producer surplus.

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:03.571
Producer surplus.

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:05.824
Our consumer surplus is where things

00:03:05.824 --> 00:03:06.993
get a little bit interesting.

00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:09.119
Consumer surplus is how much more

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.390
marginal benefit people are getting

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.460
than what they are paying.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.657
We've traditionally said that's the area

00:03:14.657 --> 00:03:17.574
between the demand curve and the price.

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:21.047
But now, all of a sudden,
this area is infinite.

00:03:21.063 --> 00:03:22.879
This area is infinite.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.198
One way to think about it is that

00:03:24.198 --> 00:03:25.878
these diabetics get, you could almost say

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:27.657
close to infinite marginal benefit

00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:28.391
from that insulin.

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.211
It allows them to have a healthy life.

00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:32.547
It allows them to stay alive.

00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:34.932
For them, it's essentially priceless.

00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:37.550
It's kind of an interesting idea that

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.592
you have infinite consumer surplus.

00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:40.993
It's not necessarily saying that this

00:03:40.993 --> 00:03:42.590
is like a great deal for the diabetics,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.727
it's really just saying that their benefit

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:45.731
is something that they need to survive.

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:47.945
If this was just slightly more elastic,

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:49.445
so if we were to get, maybe to a slghtly

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:50.713
more real world scenario.

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:52.197
In a real world, if things got

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:53.112
a little bit more expensive,

00:03:53.112 --> 00:03:54.279
there might be a few diabetics who

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:55.318
would all of a sudden try to lower

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.382
their dose or something like that.

00:03:57.382 --> 00:03:59.913
The curve, in a real world, actually might

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:01.779
have some very slight elasticity.

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.117
It would still be a very steep slope,

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:05.532
but it would actually have
some slight elasticity.

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:07.284
You could imagine if I kept taking this

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:09.525
up and up and up, and at some point,

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.616
it actually would bound the area,

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.443
but it would, so maybe it goes up here.

00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:15.717
Maybe if this was like $2 million up here,

00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:17.777
then the demand would
go down dramatically,

00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:19.779
but it would be bounded.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.049
But it is a very, very,
very large consumer surplus.

00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:24.112
Now with that out of the way,

00:04:24.112 --> 00:04:25.448
let's think about what happens

00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:26.861
if some misguided politician decides

00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:28.286
to tax insulin.

00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:29.650
Obviously a very bad idea,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.717
and nothing that I would ever advocate,

00:04:30.717 --> 00:04:33.316
but let's think about who
would bear the burden?

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:34.316
I think you could probably guess

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:35.713
who would bear the burden if you had

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:37.447
to put a tax, but we'll actually see it.

00:04:37.447 --> 00:04:38.585
We'll think it through with our

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:42.199
supply and our perfectly
inelastic demand curve.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.613
What ends up getting passed is a tax

00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:48.383
of $10 per vial.

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:50.049
I'm just making it,
instead of a percentage,

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:51.531
I'm just doing it as a fixed amount

00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:53.311
so that we get kind of a fixed shift

00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:57.276
in terms of the perceived supply price.

00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:59.313
For the producers, this
is what they need to get.

00:04:59.313 --> 00:05:01.049
If you want them to produce 3,000 vials,

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:03.280
they need to get $75.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.713
If you [unintelligible] that first vial,

00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:07.443
they need to get $60.

00:05:07.443 --> 00:05:10.512
What the producers need
to get, plus the tax,

00:05:10.512 --> 00:05:11.532
we can draw a new curve.

00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:13.114
We've done this multiple times.

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:15.445
For the very first vial,
the producer needs $60,

00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:17.980
but then you add the tax there,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.583
it's going to be $70.

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:21.650
For 1,000 vials, it looks
like it's going to be

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.613
I don't know, 60 something ...

00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:25.980
you add the tax, it's
going to move up to here.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.361
For 3,000 vials, the producers need

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.449
around $75, $76, you add $10 to it,

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.779
it gets to $85, $86 like that.

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.051
What you get is this new curve,

00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:39.112
you could use the price from the

00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:41.388
consumer's point of view,

00:05:41.388 --> 00:05:43.470
or you could view it as

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.636
the supply plus tax curve.

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:53.522
I'll call this supply plus tax curve

00:05:53.522 --> 00:05:54.549
and that's hard to read, but that

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:56.056
says tax over there.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.888
This is the supply plus tax curve.

00:05:57.888 --> 00:06:00.806
Where does that intersect our perfectly

00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:02.807
inelastic demand curve?

00:06:02.807 --> 00:06:03.989
Well, you can imagine people,

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.326
even though the prices are higher,

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:10.258
people still have to get
exactly 3,000 vials per year.

00:06:10.258 --> 00:06:12.191
They intersect right at that quantity,

00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:14.328
but now we have a new equilibrium price.

00:06:14.328 --> 00:06:18.218
Our new equilibrium price
is exactly $10 higher.

00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:23.992
If this was $75 or $76,
this is $85 or $86.

00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:28.724
This distance right over here is $10.

00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:29.792
Let's think about a few things.

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.190
Let's think about the total revenue

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.804
that the government is going
to get in this situation.

00:06:34.804 --> 00:06:36.552
The total revenue is going to be

00:06:36.552 --> 00:06:40.460
that $10 times the
3,000 vials per year ...

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.311
times 3,000.

00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:48.350
So they're going to get $30,000 per year.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.750
Let's think about whose
surplus that came out of.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.536
The tax revenue, this right over here

00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:55.339
is the tax revenue.

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.338
That right over there is the tax revenue.

00:06:57.338 --> 00:06:58.605
The producers are still going to have the

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:00.809
exact same producer surplus,

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:04.421
so all of that tax revenue came directly

00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:06.871
out of the consumer surplus.

00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:09.876
Another interesting thing to note here is,

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.871
because we had this
perfectly inelastic demand,

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:13.421
that even when you raise the price,

00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:15.831
it didn't lower the quantity demanded

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:17.866
that we actually don't have
a dead weight loss here

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:19.415
because this was perfectly inelastic.

00:07:19.415 --> 00:07:21.268
We're actually having the
same quantity produced

00:07:21.268 --> 00:07:26.335
so you have a transfer of surplus from

00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:28.506
essentially the diabetics
to the government

00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:30.536
in this situation, but you don't have any

00:07:30.536 --> 00:07:36.068
lost surplus here because
there's no lost area,

00:07:36.068 --> 00:07:38.874
I guess you could say, between where

00:07:38.874 --> 00:07:43.863
the supply curve and the
demand curves intersect.

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.069
Another way to think about it is

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:47.833
the quantity demand
did not go down because

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:51.000
the price went up.
