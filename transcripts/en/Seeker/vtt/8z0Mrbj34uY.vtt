00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.760
You know what’s better when it’s more
FLOPpy?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.810
Super computers.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.070
Hi everyone, Julian for DNews.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.670
China has just announced it has created the
most powerful supercomputer yet.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.960
The machine, named Sunway TaihuLight, is theoretically
capable of almost 125 petaflops, or 125 million

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.220
billion flops.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.410
I don’t mean 125 million billion futbol
players, I mean FLOPS, a metric for computer

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.410
speed.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.620
It’s an acronym which stands of Floating-point
Operations Per Second , which basically translates

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.120
to how many calculations they can do with
gigantic or infinitesimally small numbers

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.370
in one second.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.040
Because supercomputers can do a hundred million
billion calculations every second, and because

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.610
the range of numbers it is able to use is
so incredibly large, supercomputers are perfect

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.490
for running models that deal with things of
all sizes, from how galaxies form to how atoms

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.490
interact.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.270
In other words they’re ideal for science.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.860
Every time we mention on DNews that an experiment
used a computer model, they did it on a supercomputer.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.259
These computers can be privately owned, as
is the case with some pharmaceutical companies

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.490
that use them to model how a drug will behave
on a molecular level.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.369
Super computers can be ludicrously expensive
though.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.929
Sunway TaihuLight cost $270 million dollars
to research, develop, and build.

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.520
And that’s before the costs of operation
are factored in.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.280
Imagine how much electricity it takes to run
a computer as big as your house.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.369
And how much it would cost to keep it cool
so said house didn’t melt itself.

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.609
For that reason more often they’re paid
for by a government and then that government

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.429
decides what experiments are awarded access.

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.009
Sometimes supercomputers are built with just
one purpose in mind, like IBM’s Deep Blue

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.859
which was made to beat one guy at chess in
1997.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.779
Two years later they made Blue Gene with the
purpose of studying how proteins folded and

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:46.310
to make a really lame pun.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.270
Usually though supercomputers can be general
purpose.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.579
They’ve been used to test nuclear weapons,
not just the explosion themselves, but everything

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.810
that could affect how they work from when
they’re pulled out of storage to when they

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.810
go off.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.340
Even things like how much a transport truck
rattles could have an effect on a nuclear

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.700
missile's guidance system, so it’s factored
into the calculations.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.349
And all this can be done without actually
setting off a nuke, so they’re making our

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.039
deadly weapons safer…

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.260
I guess?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.769
Supercomputers are invaluable to astronomy
and cosmology, modeling the first few moments

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.260
after the big bang on an atomic level, or
what happens during a supernova.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.610
They’ve been instrumental in simulating
how a protein can fold itself because they

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.060
can track how every single atom would interact
with those around it.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.370
This can also be used to figure out why proteins
sometimes go wrong and cause diseases.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.780
And for our day to day lives they have been
most noticeably useful for predicting the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.340
weather, taking in information from hundreds
of thousands of weather stations around the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.980
world and comparing it to the data from yesterday
to predict what will happen tomorrow.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.870
Extending that much farther and using averages
instead of specifics, supercomputers can be

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.660
used to simulate climate change.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.640
They’re the only beasts powerful enough
to take in the many many variables that go

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.189
into predicting the climate far into the future.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.750
And there’s still room for improvement.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.940
When they crack the next milestone in speed,
the exaflop, or a billion billion flops, scientists

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.269
think they’ll be able to make a fully coupled
earth system model that is accurate down to

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.340
a kilometer.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.319
Every variable a scientist could want to include,
of the entire earth, down to a kilometer resolution,

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.840
all calculated before I die of old age.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.459
That’s what I call a super model.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.090
If there’s one thing you don’t need a
supercomputer for, it’s creating your own

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.200
website, and you can stake your claim to a
corner of the internet thanks to Domain Dot

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200
Com.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.790
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.280
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.959
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.499
Today’s supercomputers build on the foundation
laid down by the earliest computer scientists.

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.280
With that in mind, we salute Ada Lovelace,
the OG computer nerd.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:52.870
Trace tells you her story here.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:10.029
If you had access to a supercomputer, what
would you use it for?
