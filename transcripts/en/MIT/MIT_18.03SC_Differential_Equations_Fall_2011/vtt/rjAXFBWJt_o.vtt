00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.810
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.949
So today, I'd like to talk
about frequency response.

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.490
And specifically,
we're going to take

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.149
a look at a couple different
differential equations.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.970
And we're asked to graph
the amplitude response

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.740
for each equation.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.010
And you'll note that these
equations a, b and c have

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.400
varying amounts of damping.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.790
So for part a we're asked to
plot the amplitude response

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.760
for x dot dot plus 4x
equals F_0 cosine omega*t.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.870
For part b it's
the same equation,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.820
however we have an
x dot term added.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.520
For part c, again we've
increase the damping.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.920
So now we have 6x dot.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.120
And then lastly for
part d, we'd like

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.557
to discuss the resonance
for each system.

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:52.140
So I'll let you work
out this problem,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.348
and I'll be back in a moment.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:07.110
Hi everyone.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.880
Welcome back.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.500
So for part a, we're asked to
graph the amplitude response

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.450
to the differential equation
x dot dot plus 4x equals F_0

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.130
cosine omega*t.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.770
And from a previous
recitation, we already

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.410
wrote down the
particular response

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.540
to this differential equation.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.520
So I'm just going to write
down the particular response,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.770
which has the form F_0 4 minus
omega squared cosine omega*t.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:02:04.750
Now the amplitude response
is defined as a ratio,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.729
and specifically it's the
ratio of the output amplitude

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.540
of a differential equation
to the input amplitude

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.250
of a differential equation.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.020
So in the case at hand,
we have the output

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.600
is a sinusoidal function
whose amplitude is F_0 divided

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.880
by 4 minus omega squared.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.860
So it's the output
divided by the input.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.300
These are both amplitudes.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.930
And in our case,
we have F_0 divided

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.290
by 4 minus omega squared.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.140
This is the output amplitude.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.670
And the input
amplitude is just F_0.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.349
So we see when we compute this
ratio the F_0's divide out.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.890
And at the end of
the day, we're left

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.900
with 4 minus omega squared.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.370
So I'm going to draw the
amplitude response now.

00:03:13.847 --> 00:03:14.555
So we have omega.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.765
And we see that when
omega is equal to 2,

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:23.640
there's an asymptote.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.780
When omega is equal
to 0, we have 1/4.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.130
And specifically, we have
this tent-like function.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.640
So this is the
amplitude response.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.310
So notice how when we drive
the system with frequency two,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.980
the amplitude response
goes to infinity.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.667
As a result, we
call this frequency

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:01.625
the resonant frequency.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.029
So this concludes part a.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:22.250
For part b, we have a
differential equation

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.020
with damping now.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.670
And to compute the
particular solution,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.090
we follow the standard
procedure of first complexifying

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.230
the right-hand side and then
using the exponential response

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.730
formula.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.090
So I'm just going to write
down the particular solution.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.740
If we follow these steps, we
find that it's the real part

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.130
of the right-hand
side complexified,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.930
which is F_0 e to the i*omega*t
divided by the characteristic

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.385
polynomial evaluated at i*omega.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.000
And in this case, the
characteristic polynomial p

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.440
of s is s squared plus s plus 4.

00:05:29.044 --> 00:05:38.430
p of i*omega is then 4 minus
omega squared plus i*omega.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.830
And when we put the
pieces together,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.590
we end up with a
particular solution,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:56.100
which looks like the real part
of 1 over 4 minus omega squared

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.090
plus i*omega, F_0 upstairs,
e to the i*omega*t.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.190
So we're asked to compute
the amplitude response graph.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.130
And if we take a
look at this, we

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.570
see that the denominator here
is really just a complex number.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.430
So we can convert it into
the form of r e to the i*phi.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.930
Now, the amplitude
response is defined

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.950
as the ratio of the output
divided by the input.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:37.440
And so the output
amplitude is going

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.560
to be the magnitude of
this complex number.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.660
So as a result, the amplitude
response is just the magnitude

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.740
of 1 over the characteristic
polynomial evaluated

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.020
at i*omega.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.490
This is also sometimes referred
to as the complex gain.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.800
Moreover, this term
right here contains

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.560
two pieces of information.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.660
Not only does it contain
the amplitude response,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.077
but it also contains
the phase information.

00:07:22.077 --> 00:07:23.660
When we take the
absolute value, we're

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.745
throwing out the
phase information,

00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:27.050
and we're just remembering
the amplitude response.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.700
So what is this
amplitude response look

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.220
like for this case?

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:48.530
Well, we have 1 over and it's
the magnitude of this complex

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.995
number, which is 4 minus
omega squared plus i*omega.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.420
So I just take the
real part, square it,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.707
add it to the
imaginary part squared,

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:00.165
and square root
the whole quantity.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.840
Now there's a question
of how to graph this.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.240
And we see that first
off, the square root's

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.800
an increasing function.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.330
And we see that we're 1
over an increasing function.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.270
So there's a trick,
which is to just

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.560
look first at sketching
this piece which

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.620
is under the radical sign.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.560
And if you look at trying
to maximize this function--

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.590
so finding the critical points--
we'd see that in this case,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:40.090
we have one maximum, to 4
minus omega squared plus omega

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.150
squared.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:48.065
And this is at when omega
equals the square root of 7/2.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.260
Sorry.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.010
This is a minimum.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:05.030
So when I go to sketch
this now, we have omega,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.500
we have the amplitude response.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:19.310
Now, I'm going to draw in 2
from our previous diagram.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.030
Now, the square root
of 7/2 is just below 2,

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.970
so square root of 7/2.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.820
So we end up with
a maximum at 7/2,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.320
and then a decay to infinity.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:46.780
And again, this is going
to be 1/4 when omega is 0.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.320
So this is the peak
amplitude response.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.510
So note that in this case, by
adding damping, what we've done

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.500
is we no longer have an
asymptote at omega equals 2.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.620
But we now have a
finite amplitude,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.594
which occurs at omega equals
the square root of 7/2.

00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:08.260
So I'm just going to
clean up the board,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.920
and I'll be back with
part c in a second.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.360
For part a, we have an amplitude
response diagram, which

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.580
looks like a tent function.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.740
And at 2, omega equals
2, we have a resonance.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.330
So the amplitude
response diverges.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.250
Just like to point out, I
made a small error before.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.390
I forgot to include absolute
values on the denominator here.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.020
The amplitude response
function, it's

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.420
always a positive quantity.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.160
We always throw out
any phase information

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:46.495
and leave that for the phase in
the description of the response

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:48.870
of the linear system.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.210
So the amplitude response
is always positive.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.960
For part b, we added
dampening to the system.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.092
And we see that there's
actually a peak point which

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:00.300
is at the square root of 7/2.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.290
And the amplitude response
is bounded at this point,

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.200
but it achieves a maximum.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.710
And then again it
decays to infinity.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.550
So I'd like now to
take a look at part c.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.850
And in part c, we have the
differential equation x dot dot

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:30.380
plus 6x dot plus 4x
equals F_0 cosine omega*t.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:39.430
And again, the amplitude
response is going to equal 1

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:45.380
over the absolute
value of p of i*omega.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:52.020
And in this case, p of i*omega
is going to be 1 over-- Well,

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.750
we still have the 4
minus omega squared term.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.930
Instead of x dot, we now have
6x dot, which gives us 6i*omega.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.130
And then again, we want
to take the absolute value

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.750
of this complex number.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.250
And when we take
the absolute value,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.230
we just get the sum
of the real parts

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.600
squared plus the sum of the
imaginary parts squared,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.742
which in this case is going
to be 36 omega squared,

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:25.662
the whole quantity
squared rooted,

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.120
and then we have
1 over this value.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.300
So now if we'd like
to plot this function,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.240
we can still do the same trick
and try to maximize or find

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.022
the critical points of the
denominator under the radical.

00:12:39.022 --> 00:12:40.480
And if we did this,
in this case we

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.540
would find that the
only critical point

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.000
is when omega is equal to 0.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.840
Secondly, if we look at
omega going to infinity,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.730
we see that the denominator
goes to infinity.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.680
So this whole
quantity must go to 0.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.770
So if I were to go back here
to the amplitude response

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.710
for part c, again, when
omega is equal to 0

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.250
it's going to start off at 1/4.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.380
I've just argued that it goes
to 0 as omega goes to infinity.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.990
And since there are
no critical points,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.426
we must smoothly paste the
function between the two.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.925
And in fact, it's
always decreasing.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.030
So the amplitude
response, in this case,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.420
is just a decreasing function.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.020
So this concludes part c.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.670
And now I'll take
a look at part d.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.720
Discuss the resonance
for each system.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.350
So in part a, we had no damping.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.500
And we saw that there was a
resonance at omega equals 2.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.940
And the resonance
manifested itself

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:53.590
in the amplitude response graph
with a divergent asymptote

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.870
at omega is equal to 2.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.690
So as you drive the system
close to omega equals 2,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.370
the amplitude of the
system starts to diverge.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.620
In case two we introduced
damping into the system.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.940
So we still have a very large
amplitude response at omega

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.180
equals the square root
of 7/2, however it's

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.585
no longer infinite.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.940
And then lastly, when we
increased damping even further

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:28.140
so we had the 6x dot term, the
presence of a peak disappeared.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.010
And in fact, the
amplitude response

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.000
just monotonically decayed
from 1/2 to infinity.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.720
So just constantly
decreased to 0.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.150
So I'd just like
to conclude there,

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.390
and I'll see you next time.
