00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.700
For major league pitchers, getting a grip
on a baseball can get a bit muddy.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.691
That’s because, at least for now (this may
well be changing in the next few years), every

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:17.850
single baseball used in a major league game
is coated with a little bit of actual mud,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.830
known as Lena Blackburne Original Baseball
Rubbing Mud, which comes from a secret location

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.130
on a tributary of the Delaware River in southern
New Jersey.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.840
Why do they rub the balls down in mud?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.880
Baseballs fresh out of the box are glossy
and slippery as a byproduct of the manufacturing

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.010
process, reducing the chance that the ball
will actually go where the pitcher wants.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.950
In a nutshell, the mud in question functions
to make the baseball slightly easier to grip.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.550
This now leads us to the question of why exactly
do they use this this particular mud?

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.630
The story of how Delaware mud’s became an
integral part of baseball began on August

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.350
16, 1920.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.110
In the fifth inning of a game between the
Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.950
Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman was at the
plate when a fastball thrown by Yankees’

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.949
pitcher Carl Mays struck him in the head.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.820
A report in The New York Times on August 17,
1920 described the aftermath:

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.820
The blow had caused a depressed fracture in
Chapman’s head three and a half inches long.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.060
Dr. Merrigan removed a piece of skull about
an inch and a half square and found the brain

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.270
had been so severely jarred that blood clots
had formed.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.900
The shock of the blow had lacerated the brain
not only on the left side of the head where

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.940
the ball struck but also on the right side
where the shock of the blow had forced the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.130
brain against the skull….

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.439
Shortly thereafter, at 4:40am, Chapman died.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.932
To this day, Chapman remains the only Major
League Baseball player to die as a result

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:38.610
of an incident on the field.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.250
Chapman’s beanball death forced MLB officials
to find ways to make the game safer.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.050
While you might think requiring some form
of batting helmet would be item number one

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.280
on the to-do list here, this was not the case.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.590
Various types of protective head gear had
been tried before, but weren’t popular among

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.970
players, and it wouldn’t be until Hall of
Famer Mickey Cochrane had his career ended

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.970
(and nearly died from a skull fracture) in
1937 that things on the batting helmet front

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.070
would start to pick up a little steam, though
it still took about two more decades for batting

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.000
helmets to become mandatory in Major League
Baseball.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.370
Another potential option for Major League
Baseball to pursue here would have been more

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.700
strictly policing the then relatively common
practice of “head hunting” by pitchers.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.620
This includes Carl Mays himself having been
notorious for it before he accidentally killed

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.069
Chapman, with Mays explaining, “Any pitcher
who permits a hitter to dig in on him is asking

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.069
for trouble…

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.760
I never deliberately tried to hit anyone in
my life.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.389
I throw close just to keep the hitters loose
up there.”

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.209
As many pitchers employed this strategy for
that same reason, the league instead focused

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.659
on making the balls less slippery and making
sure that both scuffed and dirty balls got

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.939
thrown out of the game in favor of pristine
ones with more predictable flight paths and

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:46.939
that were easier to see.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.099
Essentially, if the pitchers were going to
insist on throwing balls near (or sometimes

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.309
at) player’s heads to back them off the
plate, Major League Baseball wanted to ensure

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:58.449
said pitchers could control the ball as well
as humanly possible and that, even in the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.060
gloaming, hitters could see them coming.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.669
And so it was that in 1921 an official rule
was instituted requiring that “the umpire

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.579
shall inspect the baseballs…. and that they
are properly rubbed so that the gloss is removed.”

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.700
This rule is still on the books today.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.349
Setting the rule is one thing, figuring out
and easy way to accomplish it proved to be

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.400
more difficult than originally anticipated.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.439
Various methods were used in the early going,
the most popular of which being rubbing the

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.519
balls with infield dirt, sometimes mixed with
a bit of water.

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.089
This worked, but a little too well sometimes,
resulting in scuffing up the leather in the

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.089
process.

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.529
This could in turn result in a change of the
flight path of the ball- a fact many a pitcher

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:38.939
has taken advantage of with strategic scuffing
of balls when they can get away with it.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.670
Other early substances used to remove the
“gloss” included shoe polish and tobacco

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.549
juice, with even less desirable results.

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.209
What they really needed was a consistent way
to remove the gloss without darkening the

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.249
ball too much, without scuffing it up, and
without getting gunk stuck in the laces (the

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.069
latter of which would potentially have a huge
effect on the movement of the ball).

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.809
It was 1938 when Philadelphia Athletics third
base coach Russell Aubry “Lena” Blackburne

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.619
overheard the umpires complaining about that
day’s set of balls.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:09.949
A former Chicago White Sox infielder in the
1910s and 1920s, Blackburne was a player himself

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.310
when Chapman was killed.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.510
He was also an avid fisherman who spent his
off-seasons fishing in the backwater of the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.850
Delaware River near his home in Palmyra, New
Jersey.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.150
He knew that region of the river like the
back of his hand.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.771
He also knew that the primary problem with
the commonly used infield dirt was that it

00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:25.771
was much too abrasive.

00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:28.419
Putting two and two together, he experimented
with the ultra-soft mud at the bottom of the

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.520
Delaware River and discovered that a tiny
bit of mud off the top layer worked phenomenally

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.800
well at getting the gloss off the balls without
staining or damaging them.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.630
And if you’re wondering why, subsequent
research has been done on the mud in question

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.560
to see what properties it has, including by
the University of Pennsylvania, who ran a

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.069
chemical analysis on it.

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.599
They discovered that it was more than half
water and the dirt contained traces of dozens

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.360
of minerals, including calcium, sodium, potassium,
green mica, etc.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.879
In other words, it was a smoothie of minerals,
though nothing particularly special about

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.139
it in terms of its contents over a lot of
other mud.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.490
But what is relatively special about it is
its soft “pudding” like consistency, allowing

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.229
it to work well as an ultra-fine grit buffing
agent- just gritty enough to serve its grippy

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.289
purpose, but not so gritty that it discernibly
scuffs the soft leather when rubbed in.

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.300
Evenly applied, any microscopic scuffing is
likewise done evenly, ensuring it doesn’t

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.500
interfere in an abnormal way with the flight
of the ball.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.379
As for why it has this pudding like consistency,
this may stem from its exact location via

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.740
a tributary with finer grain sediment, as
opposed to the coarser grain material often

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.060
found in the main stems of a river.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.729
This often makes the mud in such regions smoother,
thicker and not full of rocks.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.960
As for Lena Blackburne, he had thus discovered
a substance that took the gloss off the ball,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.909
didn’t smell or discolor the balls significantly,
and was, quite literally, dirt cheap.

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.490
Soon after his discovery, “Lena Blackburne’s
Original Baseball Rubbing Mud” was being

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.030
sold to every American league team.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.330
Why only the American league?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.970
At a time when the American and National leagues
were bitter rivals, Lena, a long time American

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.289
League player, refused to sell to the National
League.

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.889
(He would later relent in the 1950s.)

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.449
With business booming, Blackburne refined
his mud collection process, which ultimately

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.030
comprised of first carefully scooping the
surface layer of the mud into buckets.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.900
(Deeper layers ended up resulting in a more
gritty and slightly smelly product.)

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.080
Next, he’d screen off any debris like leaves,
sticks or the like.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.710
Finally, he’d place the mud in large barrels
to age for a minimum of around a month.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.789
The mostly dried product is then placed in
containers and sold.

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.219
Today, Major League Baseball still uses this
same mud.

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.960
Although, while the company is named after
the ballplayer, it is actually currently run

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.129
by the descendants of a friend of Blackburne,
John Haas.

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.960
Upon Blackburne’s death, he turned the business
over to Haas, who had been helping him run

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.960
the business.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.780
Haas eventually turned it over to his son-in-law
Burns Bintliff.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.259
Today, one of Burns’ sons, Jim Bintliff,
runs the mud business.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.409
The process of how he goes about getting the
mud is really pretty much the same as it was

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:58.819
in the 1930s.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.710
Every year from July to October, Bintliff
goes out to the secret spot to gather more

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.270
than a thousand pounds of mud.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.129
He hauls it home, ages and screens it, supposedly
adds a hidden “natural” ingredient, cans

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.669
the dried mud, and then sells it as is to
major league teams, college and high school

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:16.840
teams, and to whoever else wants their own
authentic baseball mud.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.580
It should also be noted that, according to
Bintliff, it isn’t just baseball teams who

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.249
buy the mud anymore – many American football
teams rub their balls down with it too.

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:26.909
He told the Washington Post that about half
of NFL teams use his mud to help their players

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:28.590
get a better grip on the balls.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.379
Currently, mud is within the allowable rules
of the NFL – unlike deflating the football.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.449
As you might imagine given his product is
essentially just fine dirt and water, Bintliff’s

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:42.430
never solely made a living off the product,
in 2009 claiming the mud was bringing in about

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.190
$20,000 a year profit at that point.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.749
This was actually significantly more than
it used to make thanks to having opened up

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:50.440
the product to sell to anybody via their website
a few years before.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.210
This low figure might seem surprising given
Major League Baseball alone goes through about

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.650
160,000-190,000 mud rubbed balls per regular
season (not to mention spring training).

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.960
However, it turns out each team only needs
about two 32 ounce tubs of the mud for spring

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.029
training and another two for the regular season,
all at just $75 a bucket.

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:14.300
Doing the math, that’s only about $9,000
per year from Major League teams, and even

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.250
then only after relatively recently bumping
the price from $50 to $75.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.819
Bintliff did note that because every Major
League team uses his mud, and given that they

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:27.360
need so little, he could jack up the price
to those teams significantly, even hundreds

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.940
of dollars per bucket, and they’d probably
pay without giving it a second thought.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.289
This would allow him to make a great living
off the mud, but he’s much more interested

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.440
in ensuring the tradition continues than making
a lot of money off the whole thing.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.529
As to how the mud is applied to the baseballs
and who does it, while formerly coaches, umpires

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:46.690
or sometimes even players were given the task,
in more modern times, this is usually done

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.050
by a clubhouse attendant.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.060
The general process is to apply a tiny dollop
of the mud to the ball with a little water

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.440
(sometimes using a spray bottle) and then
spinning and rubbing the ball in one’s hands.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.110
The key here is not to use so much that the
ball turns too dark and not to use too little

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.110
so that it remains slippery.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.589
While this might seem awfully arbitrary (especially
given how much is riding on the line of the

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:10.960
balls being exactly as the pitchers and hitters
expect), given that the same attendant might

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.180
rub literally tens, if not in some cases hundreds,
of thousands of balls over the course of his

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.160
or her career, the results are actually pretty
consistent.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.170
And while you might think this would be a
time consuming process given in a typical

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:28.209
game around 6-9 dozen balls need prepared,
it should be noted that Cleveland Indians’

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:33.060
attendant Jack Efta stated he can apply mud
to 72 balls in roughly twenty minutes.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.839
Philadelphia Phillies’ Dan O’Rourke also
noted he could rub mud on 4 balls at one time

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.460
in an equally quick process.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.839
Red Sox clubhouse attendant Dean Lewis claimed
he could rub down about a dozen balls per

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:46.120
five minutes, so roughly 25 seconds a ball.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.740
It should also be noted that some individuals
– like former Atlanta Braves’ assistant

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.560
manager Chris Van Zant – used to mix the
mud, not with regular water, but with his

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.560
own saliva.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.440
Said Van Zant in 2009 to CNN, “When you
see fans fighting for a souvenir ball that

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.980
goes into the stands, you’re like, ‘Well,
that ball has my spit on it.’

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.950
There’s a little kid somewhere with a baseball
on his nightstand and I spit on that ball.”

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.720
In any event, given the cheapness of the product,
how little of it is needed, and that its use

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.310
ensures a certain consistent, relatively predictable
grip from season to season and stadium to

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.180
stadium, there has been virtually no effort
put into finding an alternate product to solve

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.170
the slippery new baseball issue… until recently.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.380
You see, while the mud does provide more grip
than the stock balls, a little talked about,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.340
but widely known “secret,” in the game
is that, despite it being against the rules

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.389
(and despite pristine HD broadcasts often
revealing the fact to those who care to pay

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:37.320
attention), pitchers still regularly use various
substances to help them get a grip on the

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320
ball.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.400
As Phillies pitcher Clay Buccholz states,
“Everybody does something.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.130
It’s a game within the game; you just have
to be discreet about it.”

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.750
Opposing managers could call out the other
team’s pitcher and get the umpires to throw

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.860
them out of the game, but that would open
their own pitchers to similar scrutiny, as

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.060
no doubt the other manager would retaliate.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.230
Further, even the hitters, who in terms of
their own numbers for a variety of reasons

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.230
would benefit from the pitcher not being able
to grip the ball well, tend to agree that

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.850
they’d prefer the pitchers had a good grip
before they throw.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.940
As Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia noted,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.000
We’re facing some guys who are throwing
98 or 99 [mph].

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.570
You’d like them to have some idea of where
it’s going.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.570
Hitters know what the pitchers are doing.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.400
Most of the time we’re fine with it.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.200
It’s all part of the game.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.430
So the use of substances to get a better grip
on the ball (usually) goes unmentioned and

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:27.970
unpenalized, unless a player is being ridiculously
blatant about it à la Michael Pineda in 2014.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.949
What does this all have to do with the future
of the traditional mud in baseball?

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:36.440
Very recently Major League Baseball asked
Rawlings, the official baseball supplier for

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.899
MLB, to come up with a way to make the balls
more tacky right out of the box.

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:44.750
The goal here is to help pitchers get a better
grip on the ball and, thus, hopefully stop

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.110
them from having to sneak random substances
onto their fingers during the games.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.330
Another solution would be to simply allow
pitchers to use something like pine tar- after

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.480
all, rosin bags are allowed, functioning to
help dry off the hand when too sweaty.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.029
But changing the rules to allow something
like pine tar could potentially be ripe for

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:04.940
abuse, and there wouldn’t be any way to
make it consistent from pitcher to pitcher.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.610
The current system of having it be against
the rules, but more or less looking the other

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:13.579
way, tends to self regulate in this regard,
as pitchers have to be very careful how much

00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:17.710
they use to keep it from being too obvious
or showing up too much on the ball.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.649
While, again, you might think hitters would
be adamantly against new extra tacky balls,

00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:26.680
given the potential effect on spin rate on
the ball and how much that might hurt their

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.300
numbers (more spin potentially meaning more
movement or more so-called vertical “rise,”

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.530
depending on how it’s thrown), so far there
has been little outcry on that front.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.180
Beyond the aforementioned reasoning that hitters
would prefer the ball is not slipping out

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.290
of the pitcher’s hands, there’s also the
added benefit in this case that extra tacky

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.300
balls are a much brighter white than the mud
treated ones, with some players, such as Detroit

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.130
Tiger’s prospect Grayson Greiner, noting
brighter white balls help the hitters pick

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.620
up the ball better as it streaks towards them.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.569
Others have noted that the brighter white
also helps them to see the seams better, helping

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:03.160
them to discern what pitch is being thrown,
despite the potential boost in spin rate which

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.680
would normally make it harder to see the seams
and type of spin.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.170
As for Rawlings’ progress on this front,
Rawlings executive Vice President Mike Thompson

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.949
has stated “We think we’re close now.

00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:14.860
We’re just waiting for MLB to give us the
go-ahead on when they want it.”

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.380
The two primary methods they’ve been experimenting
with are a spray-on tacky substance, ensuring

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.800
even application, with the downside here being
it wears off fairy quickly (though given how

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.380
often balls are switched out in the Major
Leagues, this isn’t probably that big of

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.529
an issue at that level of play) and a more
durable substance that is tanned right into

00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:33.529
the leather.

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:39.790
However, a three day test in the Arizona Fall
League in 2016 resulted in less than stellar

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.810
reviews from Washington National’s prospect
Austin Voth, who noted, “It felt like a

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.920
big league ball not rubbed up and it felt
like it was slippery.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.910
Every ball I had, I rubbed it up with dirt.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.199
And after that, if felt about the same.”

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:54.069
That said, the problem has already been long
solved in Japan where the balls in the Nippon

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:58.199
Professional Baseball league are manufactured
to be quite tacky, completely negating the

00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:02.610
need for mudding the balls or pitchers sneaking
illegal substances on their fingers.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.290
As Cubs pitcher Koji Ueheara notes, “It
took me a while to adjust when I came to the

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.910
majors [from Japan].

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.350
Rosin is not enough to get a good grip.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.610
[So] I do what everybody else does, but I’d
rather not talk about it.”

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.360
Given all this, it would seem likely that,
with concerted effort, whether the current

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.000
tacky solutions by Rawlings are accepted or
not, eventually they will come up with something

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.720
that makes everybody happy.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.089
When that happens, it’s just a matter of
getting the player’s and owners to agree

00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:28.540
on the change (not always an easy thing, though
not without precedent, such as when MLB switched

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.540
from horse-hide balls to cow-hide in the 1970s).

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.959
Once that happens, presumably over the next
few years, there will be little need for the

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:34.980
traditional mud (or traditional pitcher cheating),
ending about an eight decade baseball tradition

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.199
on the former, though on the latter… a certain
level of cheating in baseball has always been

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:52.899
an integral and accepted part of the sport-
as long as you’re sneaky enough.
