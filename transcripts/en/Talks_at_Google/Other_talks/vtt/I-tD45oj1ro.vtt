00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.670
&gt;&gt;presenter: I'm gonna keep the introduction
short because he's a super interesting guy

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.860
and I'd like to get him on the mic sooner.
But just briefly, he's a Dominican American

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.339
writer; he lived in Jersey after moving here
with his family around age six. Just from

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.620
talking to him, I learned that he worked in
a steel mill and, I think, probably a lot

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.869
of other things. If you haven't checked out
his first short story collection, it's called

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.880
"Drown". It's super excellent. And his newest
novel, which hopefully you have a copy of,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.200
got rave review from Michiko Kakutani in The
New Yorker and an excerpt of it was illustrated

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.480
by one of the Hernandez brothers--famous cartoonists.
He also wrote this really, I read this really

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.629
great story in NPR's, "This American Life"--
I thought it was hilarious-- called "How to

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.050
Date a Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl or
Halfie" and he also teaches undergrad creative

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.410
writing at MIT. And the last thing I'd like
to say is that if you open your book, the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.289
epigraph to the book is from The Fantastic
Four comic book: "Of what import are brief,

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.520
nameless lives...to Galactus?" It's probably
the best epigraph I've ever seen. Please welcome

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520
Junot Diaz.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.520
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Thank you.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
[applause]

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.840
Guys, thanks so much for coming out here.
It's kind of a cool thing and I really don't

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.200
know what the actual details of it are, but
it's really kind of a wonderful thing that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.620
the, that they give you these kind of little
events, yeah? And for me, it's just like--

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.270
I'm always kind of astonished and humbled
when anybody will take any time from their

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.580
lunch break to come talk to an artist or interact
with an artist or some kind of writer or anything

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.160
like that. So, I find that to be extraordinarily
human and touching. So, thank you for taking

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.330
a little bit of time. It's hard to make any
time for anything, so this is like, I honestly

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.850
just can't believe it, so thanks so much.
And it's sorta weird, I have this year off.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.530
I'm not teaching at my school; MIT. And so
I have these bizarre pangs when I'm walking

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.240
around your campus because it's like the same
architect who built the damn MIT and built

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.700
this place? You know? It's like, just the
numbered buildings and your signs don't work.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.890
Which is like MIT. My students always change
all the signs. So, they're like, "Building

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.740
41; it'll actually be the opposite direction."
So, I felt like, "Aww. God, this place is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.260
equally fucked up. I think it's cool."

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.260
[laughter]

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.420
So, thanks guys. And since we're-- I hope
you guys don't mind, we're like an intimate

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.240
group, if I like talk more like I would normally
talk and not how I would talk with my students?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.170
Is that ok? Cause it takes a lot of energy
to pretend to be someone else, yeah? Which

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.480
you have to when you're at work, yeah? So,
at least we have to. But I'm sure other people

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.640
do. Yeah, so I got asked here, what I was
gonna do was just a small reading and then

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.050
probably we could have some questions to talk
about some things. By way of introduction,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.210
I'm a writer and I'm really interested in
probably the dumbest thing you could be interested

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:28.569
in if you're a writer. I'm like interested
in the gaps in stories, like the places where

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.730
there isn't a story. Like, if someone misses
four or five, if there's like a four or five

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.990
month gap in someone's life, that's what really
pulls me, yeah? If there's a period of history

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.560
where there's no writing or there's no records
about it; I'm absolutely fascinated. So, it's

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.920
like a bizarre thing because most writers
want to write about things where there's a

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.071
least some documentation. So, in some way,
this book was--I wanted to write a book about,

00:03:54.071 --> 00:04:00.741
you're talking about the Galactus quote about
nameless lives. I wanted to write a book about

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:05.200
this period in the island I came from, the
Dominican Republic, where everybody talks

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.380
about this dictatorship, but nobody actually
says anything. It was like such a weird trauma

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.530
that people would always say,"Oh, and the
time of Trujillo..." But then they won't actually

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.510
say anything. There's no details. And I was
fascinated about how you can hide something

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.340
in plain sight. It's like the dictatorship
is hidden in plain sight. Everybody mentions

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.790
it, but nobody dares actually give any details
about it. And I started doing this about ten

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:43.010
years ago because my grandfather, he's like
an old country guy, real funny dude. He belongs

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.870
to that tradition, which he would like this,
because when he used to work in the Dominican

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.940
Republic, they would have a lector, somebody
who would come and read while they were working.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.240
So, in his mind, this shit would be really
normal. He'd be like, "This is awesome!" Someone

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.590
would always come in and usually read like
communist work, you know? And he told me this

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.720
crazy story about during this dictatorship,
about how he was walking down the street and

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.180
somebody was eating an orange and threw the
peel down. And at this time, they believed

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.810
about 50% of the island were informants for
the dictatorship, which kinda makes East Germany

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.980
look like normal. And somebody threw an orange
peel on the ground and the secret police came

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.310
from all over and arrested the guy who threw
the orange peel and the three nearest people

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.300
who didn't stopped and apprehend the guy who
threw the orange peel and my grandfather was

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.370
number four. And so, the guy in front of him
was arrested and he was like, "Yeah, had I

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.160
been walking any faster I'd have been in prison
for ten years for an orange." And he said

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.160
this story and I have never, ever heard that
things were that crazy over there. So, part

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.850
of this novel is about that, but part of it
is also about growing up in New Jersey, about

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.940
kind of a big dork in New Jersey. Yeah, like
the huge nerds; '80s was like the perfect

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.581
time for nerds, you know? It was like, personal
computing, role playing games; comic books

00:06:14.581 --> 00:06:20.560
became really big. And like video games, yeah?
It was all this perfect storm of nerdery,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.460
so I wanted to write about that. So, I'm just
gonna read a small, little piece and then

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.000
maybe some questions or some comments and
then we can take it from there. All right?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.330
The piece I'm gonna read is from, it's called
"Sentimental Education". There's like a lot

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.710
of voices in this book cause it's-- I always
say, "Have you guys read A Wrinkle in Time?"

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.870
Anybody read "Wrinkle in Time?" Poor Madeleine
L'Engle just died recently. Yeah, "Wrinkle

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.650
in Time" was like, I loved that book. Do you
remember who the bad guy was in "Wrinkle in

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.970
Time?" Does anybody remember that? C'mon,
man, the bad guy was called either "the enemy"

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.800
or he was called "it". They were so afraid
to name him and anyway, for a kid who grew

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.710
up in the shadow of a dictatorship, the "Wrinkle
in Time" really wigged me out because it was

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.080
a dictatorship taken to the extreme. Cause
when the enemy had taken over a planet, do

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.540
you remember what he did and how people acted?
Do you remember that all the kids would come

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.890
out of their houses and bounce the basketball
at the same time? And I was like, "God." And

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.230
I'd always-- for me, struck me, I was like,
"Fuck! That's a dictatorship gone nuts." So,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.960
there's all these voices in this book because
it's an attempt to get away from that single

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.620
voice. And so, this is a kid talking about
his college life and how he meets, how he

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.229
meets the-- the biggest nerd in the world.
But first, he meets his beautiful sister who

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:52.419
he falls in love with. And so the voice is
kinda college-like, in Spanish would be a

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:58.200
"sucio", I guess like a playboy. Dude's got
like, 25 girlfriends, yeah. So, it starts

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200
like this:

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.780
[reads]

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.740
"Sentimental Education: 1988-1992

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:12.870
It started with me. The year before Oscar
fell; I'd suffered some nuttiness of my own.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.660
I got jumped as I was walking home from the
Roxy by this mess of New Brunswick townies;

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:25.600
a bunch of funking morenos. Two AM and I was
on Joyce Kilmer Ave. For no good reason, alone

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.840
and on foot. Why? Because I thought I was
hard; thought I would have no problems walking

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.919
through the thicket of young dudes I saw on
the corner, which was a big mistake. I remember

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:45.241
the smile on this one guys face the rest of
my fucking life, only second to his high school

00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:51.879
ring which plowed a nice furrow into my cheek.
Wish I could say I went down swinging, but

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:58.339
these cats just laid me the fuck out. If it
hadn't been for some Samaritan driving by,

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:03.230
the motherfuckers would probably have killed
me. The old guy who saved me wanted to take

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.009
me to Robertwood Johnson, but I didn't have
any medical insurance and besides, ever since

00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:13.630
my brother had died of leukemia, I had not
been hot on doctors. So, of course, I was

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:22.100
like, 'No, no, no.' And for having just gotten
my ass kicked, I actually felt pretty damn

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:28.660
good. Until the next day when I felt like
I had died. So dizzy, I couldn't stand up

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.869
without puking; my guts feeling like they'd
been taken out of me, beaten with mallets

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:38.730
and then reattached with paper clips. It was
pretty bad and all the friends I had, all

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:46.259
my great, wonderful boys, of all of them only
Lola came through. She heard about the beat

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:53.959
down from my boy, Melvin, and shot over ASAP.
Never so happy to see someone my whole life.

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:59.879
Lola, with her big, innocent teeth. Lola,
who actually cried when she saw the state

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:06.149
I was in. She was the one who took care of
my sorry ass; who cooked and cleaned and picked

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:11.910
up my class work, got me medicine and even
made sure that I showered. In other words,

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:19.470
she sewed my balls back on and not any woman
can do that for a guy, you know? Believe you

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:26.019
me, I could barely stand my head hurt so bad,
but she would wash my back and that was what

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:33.319
I remembered the most about this mess. Her
hand on that sponge and that sponge on me.

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:38.019
Even though I had a girlfriend, it was Lola
who spent those nights with me combing her

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:45.889
hair out, once, twice, thrice before folding
her long self into bed next to me. 'No more

00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:53.009
night walking,' she said, 'Ok Mr. Kung Fu?'
At college, you're not supposed to care about

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:59.110
anything. You're just supposed to fuck around
like crazy. But, believe it or not, I actually

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:06.040
cared about Lola. She was a girl who was easy
to fall in love with. Lola, like the fucking

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.360
opposite of the girls I usually went after.
Bitch was almost six feet tall and no chest

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.850
at all and darker than your darkest grandmother
and she was like two girls in one: the skinniest

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:26.399
upper body married to a pair of Cadillac hips
and an ill donkey. One of those over-achiever

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:32.939
girls who runs all the organizations in college
and wears suits to student meetings. She was

00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:38.540
the president of her sorority, the head of
Salsa and co-chair of Take Back the Night

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:45.869
and she spoke perfect, stuck-up Spanish. We'd
known each other since pre-freshman weekend,

00:11:45.869 --> 00:11:50.959
but it wasn't until a year later, till sophomore
year, when her mother got sick again that

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:57.850
we had our little fling. 'Drive me home, Junot,'
was her opening line and a week later, things

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:03.480
jumped off between us. I remember she was
wearing a pair of Douglas sweats and a tribe

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.429
t-shirt. She took off the ring her boyfriend
had given her and then she kissed me. Her

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:16.980
dark eyes never leaving mine. 'You have great
lips,' she said. And I ask you, how do you

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:24.809
forget a girl like that? Only three nights
we were together before she got all guilty

00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:30.309
about her boyfriend and put an end to it.
And when Lola puts an end to something, she

00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:36.339
puts an end to it hard. Even those nights
after I got jumped, she wouldn't let me steal

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:43.499
on her ass for nothing. 'So,' I said, 'you
can sleep in my bed, but you can't sleep with

00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:51.920
me?' And she laughed. 'Junot,' she said, 'yo
soy brierta pero yo no soy bruta.' Because

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:59.279
she knew exactly what kind of sucio I was.
Two days after we kind of broke up, she saw

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:07.600
me hitting on one of her line sisters at a
party and she turned her long back on me."

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:16.720
So, that's it. It's just a small entry, yeah?
So, I think the best thing to do is to read

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.190
a little bit, yeah? And then maybe take some
questions and I'll just finish off by reading

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:28.889
something else. Or comments, yeah? You guys
can't be any harder or meaner than my kids,

00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:35.649
so I figured anything you wanted to say or
talk about, that'd be cool. It spares you

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:41.540
having to listen to me for another 15 minutes
of reading. So, we can save that for the end.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.540
Yeah?

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.540
[pause]

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.429
Am I blocking my--?

00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:50.079
&gt;&gt;presenter: No, no, no. I just forgot to
mention, anyone wants to ask a question if

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.970
you can line up at the mic so we can get it
on the tape.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.970
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Oh, Lord.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:53.970
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.389
&gt;&gt;Diaz: That's even worse. I'm sorry, guys.

00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:56.389
[laughter]

00:13:56.389 --> 00:14:01.629
It would've been so much easier if you just
said some shit. Ok, we at least have one.

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:02.629
&gt;&gt;member #1: Sure.

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:03.629
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Hi.

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:06.569
&gt;&gt;member #1: Just a quick question, I understand
that this is your first novel, but you've

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:12.259
written fiction for The New Yorker. What inspired
you to, at this point in your life, to take

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:16.240
this leap into writing a novel and this novel?

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.690
&gt;&gt;Diaz: That's a good question. I always was
a, I come from this immigrant, over-achiever

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:28.029
family, my family--you know when you're a
kid and you score well at anything? In my

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:32.940
family, they were so fucking excited. They
were like, "We got one." You know? They were

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.439
like, "Ah, he's gonna be a doctor, he's gonna
be a scientist, he's gonna be whatever." And

00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:39.949
so, I was like really good at scoring those
damn tests that they give you as a kid. I

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:45.899
was always scoring like the 99th percentile
at those stupid, little tests, but I loved

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:51.790
to read. And I kind of screwed my poor parents
who wanted something more professional and

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.410
I became an artist. I wanted to, I loved to
read and I wanted to be a writer like, probably

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.999
since I got into high school, I thought writing
would be cool 'cause I liked to read so much

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:08.279
and it was also kinda reacting to my old man.
My old man was like a military guy, he was

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:13.820
like a boxer. It was like, he got a black
belt in Judo. Every Sunday, the pain in the

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.279
ass would go take us to the rifle range, you
know? And I was like, I didn't want to be

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:22.350
anything that he kind of approved of in a
weird way. And so, being a writer seemed like

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:28.089
a cool thing to do and I got pretty serious
about it 'cause, despite how much I wanna

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:32.959
resist my parents, you have that immigrant
work ethic where if you don't have three jobs

00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:39.720
you're lazy. My mom would be like, 10 p.m.,
she's like "Why aren't you at work?" And the

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.609
commercial would be on, "Do you know where
your children are?" My mom was like, "Oh,

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.930
you better be working."

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.930
[laughter]

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:52.720
So, probably from about college, I started
bringing that weird work ethic into writing

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.679
and I'd been writing for awhile. It's just
that the two books I published were the only

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:03.869
ones that worked. I had written like, three
other books, but they were like really, really

00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:09.689
bad. So, it's like, I'm telling you, if any
of you guys ever want to be artists, I'm a

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:11.570
perfect encouragement. You can't be farther
worse than me.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.059
[laughter]

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:19.179
It's like, three for two-- that's bad, guys.
So, it was a lot of that, but I think like

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:23.459
more fundamentally, growing up, I mean, I'm
older than most of you guys here. It's like

00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:27.720
you guys look like babies to me some of ya'll,
you know? Like, little. But I grew up in the

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:33.350
'80s, yeah? And it was like a weird time to
be poor and Dominican and immigrant cause

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:40.999
the '80s was like, it was crack, it was AIDS,
it was genocidal wars in Central America,

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:45.720
it was voodoo economics, where basically,
that was when they say, "We take all the money

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.009
out of the system and we give it to the rich.
We promise you, it'll trickle down to the

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:55.009
poor." Which, of course, didn't work at all.
And so, all these things were happening and

00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:58.689
as a kid, I was really observant and there
was a part of me that felt that there was

00:16:58.689 --> 00:17:03.929
this vacuum in the historical record. I would
turn on the TV and all these things that I

00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:08.740
saw happening at once, nobody was talking
about. And so, of course, there was this desire

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:14.411
to bear witness. It sounds like kind of lofty,
but as a kid I really did want, I felt like

00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:18.870
I was seeing shit that nobody wanted to talk
about. And there was this desire in me to

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:23.800
know that and that was part of my writing.
I mean, first, all I ever wrote were like

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.380
kinda news reports from my neighborhood; all
the shit that was happening that nobody would

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:37.810
ever care about. It was really weird. So,
I think that was some of it. Yeah. Oh, Lord.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.820
This is a set-up. Sir, if you ask a question,
I'll repeat it so you don't have to get up.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.370
&gt;&gt;member #2: Great [inaudible]. So, based
on what you've said, what I'm reading here

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:52.910
is has like, college in New Jersey. Well,
can you describe the relationship between

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.660
the Trujillo regime and what's the link between
that and this story.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.330
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Yeah, no that's an excellent question
like just from what I was talking about. I

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.520
was talking about a dictatorship and yet the
first thing I read to you is a story about

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.600
being at Rutgers; just running around chasing
chicks. And the real question is that what

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.072
happens when you're a kid like me, who goes
to Rutgers and basically runs around and chase

00:18:17.072 --> 00:18:23.001
chicks and you're, you visit a home where
your parents were like victims of a dictatorship.

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:32.630
Do those histories ever meet and do they actually
ever influence each other? Does one speak

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.910
to the other? Does the fact that I had all
this access to all this privilege-- and I

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.311
thought it was incredible privilege being
at a state school and learning all this stuff--

00:18:40.311 --> 00:18:46.440
did that impact my mom at all? And did the
sorta silence around her personal history

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:52.370
did that have any influence on me? And in
some ways the book is about, I thought, was

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:59.350
about the tyranny of the present. How the
present is such a strong force that it's very

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:04.630
hard to think about the past. It's a lot of
historians talk about this term, "the tyranny

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:09.780
of the present," that it's like the present
is such a force that people don't even wanna

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.230
see old movies; they'd rather see a remake
because they're like, "I don't want really

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:19.870
to do anything with history. I don't want
to think about the past." And the problem

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:26.650
is that it's, we live not only in the present,
we also live in a historical moment. A lot

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.430
of the things that have happened in the past
have very subtle influences on our choices

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:36.250
and our decisions and part of what the book
was about was trying to run these two stories

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:41.910
side by side and see if there was anything
that was happening between the two of them.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:48.970
Is it true that I always felt that even though
I was living in a real contemporary, Jersey,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:55.020
into baseball, into hip-hop, I always felt
the shadow of that past history; it was on

00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:01.130
us? Even though none of my siblings believed
it was. And yet, all of my siblings act the

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:06.670
same way in some ways. I mean, you wouldn't
have to be a super smart person to figure

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:14.070
out that all of us are the children of victims
of a dictatorship. It's like, kids who grew

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:21.430
up in Jersey who seem completely normal, they
never speak in public. It's like my parent's

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:29.070
ability to not to say anything incriminating.
Anybody calls the house, it's like nobody's

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.730
ever home and you've got the wrong house.
When I got accepted to Cornell, it took them

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:39.200
months to track me down because my mother
was like, "Who? Junot? No, he doesn't live

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200
here." Click.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.640
[laughter]

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.910
And so, it seems really minor, but I do think
that there's a tremendous amount of history

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:54.270
that bleeds into the present and has an influence
on us that we don't even understand. And so

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.073
for me, I guess that was the point of the
question. How much of the present, or what

00:20:58.073 --> 00:21:04.780
we call the present, is made up of the past?
And even at an unconscious level, are we influenced

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.240
by-- they talk about the unconscious, it's
like when somebody is cheating on you and

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:15.880
you don't know it; your kinda unconscious
knows it. And they say that that's like real

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.220
common for people's unconscious to know that
somebody's betraying them and their conscious

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:29.700
not to know. And so I've always wondered how
that works. And I was very, very curious about

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:36.640
the link between a pair of parents who grew
up disciplined in a dictatorship and then

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:43.860
how do they raise their kids in their own
house? And yet, you know Rutgers? It seems

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:49.900
so far away. When I was at Rutgers dancing
salsa, Santa Domingo and Secret Police, that

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.460
seemed a million miles away. And yet, I would
go home and see my mom and my mom's back would

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:01.360
be all scarred and it would suddenly be right
there. And I was like, "Hmmm. Is it just that

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.810
I'm pretending that the history's not here?
Or is it really here? We're making it all

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:12.680
up." And I'm not sure that the answer is more
about putting these pieces together and seeing

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.600
if I could generate any conversation. Sir?

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.960
&gt;&gt;member #3: Yeah, I had a question. The first
thing when I read your excerpt in The New

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.280
Yorker that like jumped out at me was like,
"Oh, this character is talking about comics,

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.160
he's talking about video games, he's talking
about all this stuff that I'm into." And then,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.860
as I got into it, there's this brutality and
sadness that comes over you, just in the excerpt

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:44.860
even. And a lot of my friends were talking
about this. It kind of, there's this thing

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.150
that's been happening where these writers
like Jonathan Lethem and Michael Chabon are

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:54.680
getting a lot of praise for breaking genre
and talking about comics as if they're important,

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.480
but a lot of my friends are second generation
immigrants and so they were like, "You have

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.320
to read this. There's a brown nerd in this
story. And I was just curious to hear like,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:11.350
it's only one part of your book, but what
are your thoughts on that whole kind of like

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:18.120
McSweeney's meets Cosmopolitan comics are
a high art thing? That seems to be a lot about

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.480
upper middle-class white dudes talking about
it and just how your book fits into that.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.620
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Hmm. That's in interesting question.
Look, it's, part of this whole thing-- it's

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:32.060
only because the market is rewarding it that
you suddenly see all these "the white guys

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:37.610
suddenly talking about comic books and stuff."
I mean, there's been white guys reading comic

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:42.430
books for a zillion years, but it's only now
the market's beginning to reward those kind

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:50.010
of books. For me, the real question isn't
about whether, the real question is that it

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:57.400
seems that the relationship between high literary
figures and, let's say, comics is unidirectional.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.800
So that Michael Chabon and Lethem can turn
around and they're literary figures even though

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.410
Lethem started in a genre. He started as a
really cool science fiction writer. They can

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:14.100
go and write comic books, but it's sorta like
going slumming; they can always come home

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.970
to that really great suburb called Literary
Fiction. So, they can go dance with the black

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:24.760
girls down in Darkie Town and come back and
they still got their really nice zip code.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:31.130
And my thing is that I feel like things will
change when Michael Chabon is losing a Pulitzer

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:38.710
Prize to the comic book writer of Spiderman.
In other words, it's like the literary figures

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:43.140
can go loot the genres all they want, but
they never have to worry about the people

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:48.180
who are actually genre-practitioners challenging
their literary prerogatives so that the borrowing

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.660
is unidirectional. I don't know if that makes
any sense. I seem like I sound like I'm crazy.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.860
But it's sorta like having an American passport
versus having a Third World passport. I feel

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.730
like the genres, they have passports from
like, North Korea. So, you're not allowed

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:08.720
anywhere. Oh, American Academy of Arts? Sorry,
fool! You write what? Hulk? Nope.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.720
[laughter]

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.350
But Michael Chabon can turn around and write
a Hulk novel and it'd be the best selling

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:19.050
thing. And he'll be like everywhere. And for
me, as a writer of color, one of what it did,

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.640
what's interesting is that in the United States,
if you're a writer of color, no matter what

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:29.610
you write about, you're considered a genre
anyway. You're never accepted in a real literary--

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.370
you know, there's always this bizarre question.
I went to do a book signing earlier and the

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.040
owner of the bookstore said, "Hey, I heard
if you don't speak Spanish you can actually

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:43.340
read your book." I'm like, "Well, it's in
English, so I'm assuming you can fucking read

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.340
the book."

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.340
[laughter]

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:51.080
I'm just like, Jesus, I wonder how many people
who are like--anyway. So, there's this sense

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:57.600
that part of the joke for me was that being
a writer of color, you're already considered

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.330
as bizarrely marginalized. Your passport is
always being checked three times before you

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.030
get let in. You'll get let in, but boy oh
boy, they'll run you through security for

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:13.740
20 minutes. And so, I felt part of the joke
was I can't decide who's more of a genre in

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:19.010
this book. The parts about the Dominican Republic
and the parts about being a Dominican kid

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:24.640
at Rutgers, or the parts about the science
fiction comic books? Like who gets the better

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.330
passport? In fact, I feel like if you're a
Dominican writer in the United States, you

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:35.500
have a lot more in common with somebody writing
The Hulk than Michael Chabon has in common

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.460
with anybody writing Superman. Because, in
the end, both me and the comic book guy, we

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:46.550
go back to our crappy ass neighborhoods; sorta
the neighborhoods where you fit in the art.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:51.580
I mean, these are like generalizations, which,
again, if we had more time there's way more

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:56.621
nuanced ways to talk about this, but it's
always like when you only have 30 minutes

00:26:56.621 --> 00:27:01.900
to talk, you end up having to try to get your
ideas across in the brute and never in the

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:07.240
way that they really deserve to be crossed.
So, in my mind, I always was working in that

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.520
joke. I always felt so separated from all
those dudes who were doing it and were gonna

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:18.920
win the awards because I just felt like, historically,
writers of color in the United States have

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:24.801
been even more marginalized than comic book
writers. I mean, I think about Joseph Campbell,

00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:34.570
No, excuse me, I think about that-- Joseph
Campbell. God, I don't know why it's flying

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.520
out of my name because remember the name of
the science fiction editor who basically put

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:45.170
together the Silver Age Science Fiction? His
last name was Campbell, too. Anyway, he didn't

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:50.030
allow no black writers, Latino writers or
women. He refused to publish them. And if

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:57.111
anyone wrote about a black character, he would
reject it. And so, for 40 years all of the

00:27:57.111 --> 00:28:01.710
main science fiction organs refused to publish
work by anybody of color or who had people

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:08.360
of color in them. This was up to the '70s.
So, I really was interested in that question

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:16.020
as I was writing. It's like, which is more
weird? So, yeah. Madam?

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.970
&gt;&gt;woman #1: My question is--

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.309
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Sorry. Yeah, no. My man got away with
it.

00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:24.309
[laughter]

00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:27.000
I like how you order, you order the youth
around.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.980
[laughter]

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.980
Terrible, the tyranny.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:37.260
&gt;&gt;woman #1: My question is related to what
you were just talking about; writers of color,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:43.370
authors of color. And I find that a lot of
times authors of color or writers of color

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:48.860
are sorta pigeon-holed to be the voice of
their people, right? So, do you find that

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:54.090
people say, "Oh, Junot Diaz, he's the voice
of the Dominican Republicans." Or, "He's the

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:59.470
voice of Latinos." Or, like I find that black
writers, Asian writers, they write a book

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:03.990
and its like, "Oh my God, she's the voice
of Asian Americans." Or, do you ever, do you

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.840
resist that characterization? Is that something
you find kind of offensive? Or, how do you

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.050
feel about that? And if that's something you
don't like, how do you combat that and say,

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:17.870
"This is a book that I've written. Take it
for its merit."

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:23.140
I'm not suddenly representing all the Dominicans
in the US or abroad or whatnot.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.330
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Thank you. It's a really good question.
Yeah, I mean, it's the weirdest thing. One

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.880
of the things again, these are issues which
people tend to be not so comfortable about,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.370
but it's kind of bizarre, man, that if you're
a writer of color in the United States you're

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:44.150
always viewed as a collective. In other words,
you're viewed as somehow an ambassador from

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:49.309
this larger collective. But it's at every
level, at a societal level. You'll even see

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:54.480
it amongst ourselves. I mean, how many people
will tell me they won't date--, an entire

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.670
group of guys-- but always that group of guys
tends to be ethnic. It's like, you're much

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:04.830
more likely to collectivize an ethnic group
cause assume they all share something really

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:10.020
deeply in common. And I think that it's something
that is part of the condition that we're dealing

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:16.400
with. It's like, trying to be simultaneously
viewed as someone who belongs to a community,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:22.350
but also an individual, that's a really good
thing, but most of us are usually viewed just

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:29.809
as a part of a collective. And I am no more
the representative and the spokesperson for

00:30:29.809 --> 00:30:34.610
the Dominican community as I am to the New
Jersey community. I mean, if you wanna understand

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.110
what the Dominican community is, you would
need about ten million novels and then you

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:47.490
would only have the first pass. And I do think
that it's, there's a deep desire in American

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:53.200
culture to have native informants; to have
people who are gonna translate something for

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.860
you. Because it's far easier to have a native
informant explaining to you a larger culture

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:05.380
than it is for you to encounter the stupendous
complexity and diversity of that culture.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:11.420
Like, it's so much nicer to boil down Japan
down to your one JA friend you know and that

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.990
dude probably doesn't like rice. But you're
like, "Yeah, that's Japanese culture."

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.990
[laughter]

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.980
And everyone in Japan, you're like, "Yeah,
yeah, he knows."

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.350
[laughter]

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:25.140
And a lot of us fall into that because it,
it, it's also a weird, we become complicitive

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.510
in that. Cause I have a lot of friends of
mine who, they're like the expert in all things

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:36.150
Korean. I'm like, "Motherfucking, you never
been to Korea. How did you get an expert in

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:41.670
this?" 'Cause his parents are Korean, so I
feel it's, there's a double-sided, as in.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:48.300
As a writer, as an artist, what really matters
to me is that a piece of art is really, in

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:55.750
some ways, a distillation of a single subjectivity
interacting with usually a very random and

00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:02.340
bizarre collective. And if you get the proportion
wrong, you in some way erase what's important

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.300
about a piece of work. If you see a piece
of work only as an example of a larger collective,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:12.760
you've erased that person, that individual
arches and whirls of the thumbprint of the

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:18.050
artist who made it. But if you reduce someone
just as the individual, you lose the fact

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:25.880
that this person came about in a context,
yeah? It's like, Picasso doesn't make sense,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.580
he does not make sense if you don't understand
the context he came out of. There's no way

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.640
an individual makes sense without their context
'cause usually you're reacting and interacting

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:42.150
to it somehow. So, I think that both elements
are vitally important and often the stress

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:47.970
is put on you to be, as a writer of color,
as an artist of color, more towards your collective.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:52.010
But then we take it too far sometimes where
some writers of color are like, "I am the

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:57.860
supreme individual. I want nothing to do with
my community." And that's equally toxic and,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:03.230
I think, misleading. And it's the hardest
thing for all of us is equilibrium.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:12.850
I know the gap while we get to the microphone.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:19.100
I have like, the whitest shoelaces. I'm like,
in envy of you.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.100
[laughter]

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.370
It rocks, man.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:29.350
&gt;&gt;woman #2: I have a few things cause as you
were talking, I'm thinking once I heard Julia

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:35.210
Alvarez speak about how she, her process and
she said something that I thought was very

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:41.520
interesting. She said, "I feel in Spanish,
but I write in English." And so, I was wondering,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:50.210
for you, is there a voice in one language
that comes easier than in another or are they--

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:55.590
whenever I read anything you write, it just
seems like the Spanish comes out at the right

00:33:55.590 --> 00:34:02.320
time to convey something that is really, almost
as if you couldn't say it in English. I don't

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:08.429
know if that's my own interpretation, but
so that's one question. And then I also wanted

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:11.099
to know about your experience teaching at
MIT.

00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:16.669
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Cool. Thank you. I have this bizarre
thing with language. It's like, typical immigrant,

00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:20.740
you come and you have to learn the damn language
and all my siblings learned it within six

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:26.319
months and I had to get put in Special Education
because I couldn't speak it. For some reason,

00:34:26.319 --> 00:34:31.109
English wouldn't come out of my mouth. And
I learned to read English within a few months,

00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:37.700
but I couldn't speak it for a very long time.
So, language has always been tricky in some

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:42.740
ways and then typical adolescent reaction,
you're like, you get that weird self-hate

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.700
period where you hate everything that has
to do with your larger culture. So, I almost

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:53.099
lost all my Spanish in my teens and then I
had to relearn it all. And the thing with

00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:59.250
me is not so much that I have either a Spanish
or an English voice, it's more that I have

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:04.869
those two voices running through my head at
the same time. And sometimes, I'm in my English

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:10.440
self, my English dominant self in a complete
Spanish setting. And so, people are speaking

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.971
in Spanish and I'm translating the Spanish
from my English self. And sometimes, I'm in

00:35:14.971 --> 00:35:19.819
my Spanish dominant self in an English setting
and I'm sitting there listening to everybody

00:35:19.819 --> 00:35:25.239
speaking English and I'm just like, "Oh, brother."
And I'm translating the English to my Spanish

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:32.359
self and the best parts are when my languages
actually coincide. 'Cause it's just whatever

00:35:32.359 --> 00:35:36.559
frame of mind you're in and sometimes you
encounter these worlds. And for me, it's like

00:35:36.559 --> 00:35:43.609
I feel both languages are running simultaneously
and they'll cross at weird moments and when

00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:48.000
I'm writing, I tend to have both of them running
through my head and the one that bullies through

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.541
the most, because English is what I write
in, but Spanish and English are what I think

00:35:54.541 --> 00:36:00.040
and speak in. And so, in my head, Spanish
will always like seize control. It's like

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.520
the really angry driver, like passenger, who
grabs the wheel. So, anytime I'm writing in

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:12.050
English and Spanish is like, "Enough!" Yeah,
[speaking in Spanish] Suddenly, it just, it

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:17.750
comes in. But it's also a process of rewriting.
I don't want you to think that it's completely

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:23.480
this intuitive bizarre relationship to the
linguistics. When you're rewriting, different

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.820
languages begin to help out. Sometimes, I'll
be reading a sentence in English and it's

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.490
not until I read it from the Spanish frame
of mind that I'll understand the way the sentence

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:36.839
works. So, a lot of times I'm doing all of
that and teaching at MIT is really great.

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:40.241
I mean, I dunno guys, being an artist-- to
get medical insurance.

00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:42.960
[laughter]

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.590
Guys, I'm not kidding. I didn't have medical
insurance at the steel mill. So, I was like,

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:53.200
it's awesome, but also I still have the energy
to work with young people, which means you

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.450
can put up with a lot of ridicule and being
completely irrelevant to them. And that requires

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:03.090
a certain kind of constitution and I still
have that and MIT students tend to be like

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:10.180
people who, they tend to be like anyone who's
superlative. You've basically sacrificed a

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:15.210
huge chunk of your childhood to get to this
place, but you didn't get to MIT because you

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.650
went, you got drunk two nights in a row. That
didn't fuckin happen.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:19.650
[laughter]

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:23.010
You know what I'm saying? You didn't do what
I did when I was in high school and got into

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:29.619
MIT. You didn't skip a week of school to watch
the play-offs. Like, that just didn't happen.

00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:34.789
These kids sacrifice an enormous amount of
their childhoods just to get there and so,

00:37:34.789 --> 00:37:39.710
part of what's really cool about it is you're
teaching what everybody teaches at a university.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:43.369
It's how to be more critical minded. Beyond
just the subject you're teaching, if you're

00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:47.160
teaching literature, if you're teaching high
energy physics, you're also teaching that

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.059
component of how to be critical minded. But
the second thing at a place like MIT what

00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:58.650
you're teaching is compassion. It sounds really
like kissy smoochy softy, but those kids have

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.700
like, no compassion. You didn't get into a
top select college because you were a compassionate

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:09.829
person. You're like, "Oh, you failed. I forgive
you." That wasn't you. You got in there because

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:11.529
you got a B. "You fucking suck!"

00:38:11.529 --> 00:38:13.150
[laughter]

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:18.119
And so, one of the weirdest things that I
learned at MIT was that, beyond just teaching

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:23.759
them what I had to teach them, compassion,
which I normally never thought about I had

00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:28.059
to learn how to teach it. Because I would
have kids who, if they would make one error,

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:33.661
they would just be like, you know? I would
be like, "Whoa." You know as an artist, you

00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:41.730
know that errors are the fountain of your
inspiration. It's completely unlike the academic

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.309
process. In an academic process, if you make
a mistake, you're punished whether it's through

00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:51.509
low grade or through, "You don't get the little
golden sticker." But as an artist, your mistakes,

00:38:51.509 --> 00:38:57.390
that's the foundation of your work because
you can't explore without making mistakes

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:03.119
and exploration is the root of all artistic
endeavor. You're taking chances and you're

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:06.339
messing things up. And you mess things up
and that leads you into another direction.

00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:13.509
But in an academic setting, too many mistakes
and you're getting kicked the fuck out. And

00:39:13.509 --> 00:39:19.470
so, it's this weird thing that you're involved
with as a teacher. You're involved with attempting

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:24.400
to make the student know the material, make
them more critical minded, this other aspect,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:30.099
which is compassion and then trying to teach
the ethos of exploration, which is quite different

00:39:30.099 --> 00:39:36.079
from the ethos of approval. Exploration and
approval tend to be two entirely different

00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:43.881
things. So, there's one more question, yeah?
Or, someone, anyone? Sir?

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:55.259
You guys are so good, I'm telling you. In
fact, I make my students come with me sometimes

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:58.700
to do stuff and they are like, so pissed at
me.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.869
&gt;&gt;man #4: You touched earlier on this issue
of high culture and low culture with the literary

00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:08.470
fiction writers kinda adopting comic books.
So, I wonder if you could speak to, I don't

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.690
know what the academic perception for your
work or other similar work has been, but I

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:18.201
wonder if you could speak to the role of the
academy and disseminating this culture and

00:40:18.201 --> 00:40:21.700
what you think it's doing to it? It's sort
of the problem with the Ivory Tower, I guess.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.710
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Yeah, no, that's a really nice question.
I'm, again, my awareness is really limited.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:32.670
There's people who study academia as a subject,
like what's happening at the select colleges,

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:37.460
what's happening at the university press level,
what's happening at the level of the people

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.430
who are getting tenure. And those people tend
to have a much more holistic longitudinal

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:45.700
view of what's going on. So, what I'm gonna
tell you now is completely provisional, episodic

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:54.950
and reveals more of my narrow, my narrow exposure
of than probably any real significant knowledge.

00:40:54.950 --> 00:41:08.030
My sense is always that there's a real tension
between readers-- those of us who love to

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:16.420
read-- and the rest of the critical apparatus.
So that like, readers are a really big part

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:25.249
of what makes this business roll; people who
just love to read. And reading is deeply anti-heirarchical.

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:30.279
If you've ever met a reader, their bookshelves
tend to be wild. They tend to be like, "Yep,

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:38.670
they've got Jude Deveraux right next to William
Gaddis." Or, they'll read like Drizzt, the

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:45.660
crazy, dark elf, Dungeons and Dragons character
dude who has like, 80 novels. And the same,

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:51.039
these same people will talk to you all fuckin
day about how important Tony Morrison is.

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:56.079
Readers are very, very creolized in a way
that's kind of interesting. And the problem

00:41:56.079 --> 00:42:02.059
with academy is not the problem, but its structural
limitation is that it has to create categories,

00:42:02.059 --> 00:42:08.440
it has to create canons and it has to create
hierarchy. There's only so much time in a

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:15.990
class you have to study. And I feel like in
there there's already an implicit, an implicit

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:23.479
opposition so, in a way, I'm always writing
for readers. Cause readers, I feel, are far

00:42:23.479 --> 00:42:29.279
more generous and far more likely to understand
that your work isn't always there for you

00:42:29.279 --> 00:42:35.529
just to give it a decimal point value to it.
It's like, the love you have for a piece of

00:42:35.529 --> 00:42:43.650
crap literature, is it more or less than the
love you have for Dickens? And can you tell?

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:48.690
That's what readers are about. They have this
love that's really hard to quantify and the

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:53.069
thing with canonical work is that it's, I
mean, the thing with academic work is that

00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:58.569
if you're a person that your work is being
picked up for dissertations, that you're work

00:42:58.569 --> 00:43:06.410
is interesting for the current theoretical
apparatus, it's all good. If you're outside

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:17.249
of that purvey, it can be problematic. And
so, there's a sense in my mind that you're

00:43:17.249 --> 00:43:21.979
really dealing with two kinds of legacies.
You're dealing with your legacy among readers

00:43:21.979 --> 00:43:26.900
and you're dealing with your critical legacy.
And both of them are dynamic, both of them

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:32.589
are changeable, both of them are hard to predict
where they're coming from and I'm always way

00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:40.059
more scared of the, I'm always way more scared
of the academic one. Not just because it's

00:43:40.059 --> 00:43:45.529
some anti-intellectual streak in me, is that
there's so much at stake in academia. There's

00:43:45.529 --> 00:43:49.829
tenure, there's your relationship with your
professor, what you're getting published,

00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:57.670
what's the current critical climate. While
readers tend not to have any of those considerations.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:04.089
They tend to be reading far more freely and
far more unencumbered. And so, currently,

00:44:04.089 --> 00:44:09.990
I'm like, as a writer, I could have a dozen
people writing dissertations on you, but it

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:16.160
doesn't mean much other than that you're just,
you're fitting, you're fitting the profile

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:24.249
of what the critics need right now. And yet,
if you're not read, it doesn't mean, either

00:44:24.249 --> 00:44:30.160
because most writers are writing for a future
audience. Few writers are writing for an audience

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.869
that's here now. Most of us are waiting for
an audience to assemble itself that can really

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:40.180
interact with you. And so, I think they're
both kind of sketchy, but I also don't want

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.729
anyone to get a sense that either one of them
is quite evil. I think they just have their

00:44:43.729 --> 00:44:49.509
advantages and disadvantages. But again, both
the academic and the standard reading audience

00:44:49.509 --> 00:44:55.479
are provisional. And as an artist, you're
trying to engage, you're trying to engage

00:44:55.479 --> 00:45:01.339
a kind of a collective over a long term in
an unpredictable way. And neither of those

00:45:01.339 --> 00:45:08.220
can really predict where your work is gonna
end up. So, guys, I thought I would just end,

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.030
I was just gonna read a little footnote to
you cause there's all these little footnotes

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:18.779
in this book; very weird. Again, I, I, the
critics, a lot of the critical responses compared

00:45:18.779 --> 00:45:24.839
these footnotes to David Foster Wallace, which
is so weird because I like, openly and nakedly

00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:30.630
robbed the footnote technique in this book
from a writer from Martinique. His name is

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:36.019
Patrick Chamoiseau, how do you pronounce that
name in French? Anybody? Chamoiseau? Anyway,

00:45:36.019 --> 00:45:42.230
he wrote this incredible novel called "Texaco"
and in "Texaco" he has the most astonishing

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:47.470
footnotes, but unlike sorta the post-modern
white boy writers who use the footnotes to

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:55.230
reinforce authority and reinforce erudition,
Chamoiseau used the footnotes to gossip, to

00:45:55.230 --> 00:46:00.531
get involved in an homonym attacks. To like,
undermine his own authority, he'll be like,

00:46:00.531 --> 00:46:04.190
"Oh, oops. Four pages back I made a mistake.
You're fucked.--

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.420
[laughter]

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.599
"But I don't feel like changing it 'cause
it sounds cute."

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:08.599
[laughter]

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.749
And he was the one, I'm telling you, go read
this novel "Texaco". It's one of the best

00:46:11.749 --> 00:46:18.430
novels I ever read. "Texaco" and then there's
a fantasy novel called "The Etched City".

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:23.519
You guys ever read "The Etched City?" Yo,
"The Etched City" is bananas. It's bananas.

00:46:23.519 --> 00:46:29.050
It's like Cormac McCarthy wrote a love story.
You've gotta check it out. I was like, by

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:35.390
the end of it, my military father would have
been ashamed. I was all tearing up. I was

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.099
like [sniff, sniff]. "I can't believe he fell
in love with the sphinx."

00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:40.519
[laughter]

00:46:40.519 --> 00:46:46.339
This is bananas. Yeah. So, anyway, I just
wanted to read one small footnote and I thought

00:46:46.339 --> 00:46:54.079
I would recommend those two 'cause those are
like, those are really two cool, those are

00:46:54.079 --> 00:47:01.229
really two cool books. And if I can find this
damn thing, I'll be there. So, in the book,

00:47:01.229 --> 00:47:08.509
does anybody speak Spanish? You guys know
what a criada is? What's a criada, culturally?

00:47:08.509 --> 00:47:09.509
Sir, what's a criada?

00:47:09.509 --> 00:47:10.569
&gt;&gt;man #5: A maid?

00:47:10.569 --> 00:47:16.420
&gt;&gt;Diaz: Yeah, like the maid. Yeah, a criada
in Santo Domingo there's like a whole, you

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.650
can tell we're like, you're asking a question
about history. The Dominican Republic the

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:26.269
whole island, we had like 300 years of slavery
plus and there's still a culture in the Dominican

00:47:26.269 --> 00:47:32.499
Republic in Haiti of Restavec, or criadas,
which are children who are given away by their

00:47:32.499 --> 00:47:39.670
families to other families to be the built-in
slave. So basically, maid for life. And their

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.900
just given away. It's usually your excess
child, your youngest child, and it's fucking

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:49.420
bananas. And it's like, common. They believe
like, 20% of the United Nations that are studied,

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.631
20% of all children of the Dominican Republic
have lived in this situation at one time or

00:47:54.631 --> 00:48:00.999
another. And so, this is the narrator talking
about the criada. A criada, and it's a footnote

00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:08.430
and the main, one of the main characters is
sold to be a servant by her step-parents and

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:12.430
then the narrator breaks the narrative to
give this tiny footnote and he says,

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:13.430
[reads]

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:21.009
"I lived in Santo Domingo until I was nine
and even I knew criadas. Two of them lived

00:48:21.009 --> 00:48:26.430
in the Callejón behind our house and these
girls were the most demolished, overworked

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:32.700
human beings I'd known at that time. One of
them, Sobetha, did all the cooking, all the

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.269
cleaning, fetched all the water and took care
of two infants for a family of eight and the

00:48:38.269 --> 00:48:44.359
chicky was only seven years old. She never
went to school and if my brother's first girlfriend,

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:53.329
Johanna, hadn't taken the time to teach her
ABCs, she would not have known nada. Every

00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:58.859
year, I came home from the states it was the
same thing. Quiet, hard working Sobetha would

00:48:58.859 --> 00:49:04.749
stop in for a few seconds to say a word to
my abuelo and my mother before running off

00:49:04.749 --> 00:49:11.400
to finish her next chores. I tried to talk
to her, of course, Mr. Community Activist,

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:17.670
but she would skitter away from my questions,
from my stupid questions. "What can you two

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:24.410
talk about?" my mother demanded. "La pobrecita
can't even write her own name." And then,

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:30.880
when Sobetha was 15, one of the Callejón
idiots knocked her up and now, my mother tells

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:38.789
me, her family has got her kid working for
them, too, bringing in water for his mother."

00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:41.109
Thank you. Thanks so much for sharing this
time, guys.

00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.410
[applause]
