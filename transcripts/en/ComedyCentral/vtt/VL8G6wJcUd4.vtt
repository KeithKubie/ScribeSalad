-(ZIPPER ZIPS)
-MR. PEANUTBUTTER:
I know what's been going on.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.538
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.
I was just taking my penis out.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.373
You've been driving me around,

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.776
but there was something else
happening the whole time.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.778
Uh... What are you
talking about?

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.714
You weren't just working
as my driver, Todd.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:17.417
You were becoming my friend.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.719
Oh, yeah. That was happening.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.854
Well, I could use a friend
right about now.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:23.990
There's something I really
gotta get off my chest,

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:27.560
and if it got out, it could
destroy the whole wedding.

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.929
No, I'm not great
with sensitive information.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.964
I don't know if I'm ready
to get married again.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.934
Don't get me wrong.
I love Diane so much.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.671
I didn't have any doubts
until I realized she had doubts.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.673
Then I figured
she's smarter than I am.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.542
Maybe she knows things I don't.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.611
You are kind of unloading a lot
sensitive information here.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:47.814
The last thing I want to do
is hurt Diane,

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.916
but I keep having this dream
where she's gone.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.684
There's no break-up, no tragedy.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:54.053
She's just gone, and my life
continues without her.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:57.457
Hey, thanks for listening
to all this.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.724
You're a really good friend,
Todd.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.560
(GROANS)

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.528
Since you weren't able
to give me any useful intel,

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:06.566
I had to offer up my restaurant,
but now, we're on my turf.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.570
-Time for operation "I don't."
-Yeah, sounds good.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.940
You know, with my knack
for coming up with plans
and your ability

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:17.043
to hear them
without contributing
more than three words at a time,

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.878
we make a pretty good team,
don't we, Todd?

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.913
-You said it.
-See?

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:23.716
♪ (NEWS THEME PLAYING)

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.185
MALE REPORTER:<i> Beloved character
 actress Margo Martindale
 is in police custody tonight</i>

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:28.588
<i> for her role
 in a failed bank robbery.</i>

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.556
Margo Martindale?

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:33.960
<i> But first, pizza for breakfast?
 The answer might surprise you.</i>

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:37.697
I know her, but how?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.898
Wait.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:40.900
She was at the convenience store

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:44.070
the night I bought
that video game
and ruined my rock opera.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.872
TODD:
<i> She's the one who asked me</i>

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.941
<i> to hand her that tape
 from the 10¢ bin.</i>

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:50.543
(GASPS)

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:53.679
That means Margo Martindale
likes tapes!

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:55.681
And a tape is something
you listen to,

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:59.752
but tape is also a sticky thing
you can use to seal boxes.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.888
Boxes is what cereal comes in.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:06.692
What does it all mean?
Am I just grasping at straws?

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.829
Wait. Straws... that's it.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:13.299
Straws are used
to drink soda or water,

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.234
and plants need water.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:18.638
And BoJack used Margo Martindale

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.140
as a plant at the bank

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:24.343
and the convenience store,

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:27.113
which means-- Ugh!

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.815
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.817
to make me find that video game

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.888
so he could kill my rock opera!

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.091
Aw, dude.
