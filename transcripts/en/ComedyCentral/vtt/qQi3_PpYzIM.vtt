00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.104 align:start position:0%
So what do you want
to do tonight?

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:06.773 align:start position:0%
Like, I was thinking
maybe we could meet up

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.441 align:start position:0%
with Amy and Brad,
and, like, before that,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.043 align:start position:0%
we could go to Angela's,
and before that,

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.310 size:78% position:39%
we could, like, just go--

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.780 align:start size:22% position:78%
Meegan.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.782 align:end position:100%
I have something
to say.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.185 align:start size:53% position:47%
[exhales sharply]

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.020 align:end position:100%
I had to say it
in person

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.758 align:end position:100%
because it's--
it's, like, super important.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.662 align:start position:0%
Okay.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.497 align:start size:16% position:84%
Um...

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.000 align:end position:100%
I know this is sudden,
but, like,

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.336 align:end position:100%
I've been thinking
about this for a while.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.307 align:end position:100%
And I know this is something
that needs to happen.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.675 align:end position:100%
I'm breaking up
with you.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.177 align:start position:0%
Cool.
Love it.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
Totally fine
with that.

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.318
- R-Really?
- Yeah.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.520 align:start size:56% position:44%
'Cause I thought--

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:55.988 align:start size:63% position:38%
I was really worried

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.558 align:end position:100%
that you were
gonna be, like, mad.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.426 align:start position:0%
Mad?
Oh, my God.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.994 align:start position:0%
Are you kidding me?

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:04.564 align:start position:0%
No, of course
I'm not mad.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.232 align:start position:0%
People grow apart.
It happens.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
It's, like,
part of life.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.734 align:start position:0%
No, I'm totally fine.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.004 align:start position:0%
Like, love it,
love it, love it.

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:14.373 align:end position:100%
Um...
[clears throat]

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.876 align:start size:16% position:84%
So...

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.511 align:start size:28% position:72%
Uh, um...

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.847 align:start size:56% position:44%
we had a good run.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.881 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.855 align:end position:100%
And, uh, don't be
a stranger.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.491 align:start position:0%
Can I just--

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.593 align:start position:0%
Can I ask why?

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.895
- Why?
- Yeah, like, whatevs.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.530 align:start position:0%
Like, I'm doing some work
on myself

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.165 align:start position:0%
and, like, trying to grow
as a person,

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:42.101 align:start position:0%
so I'd really, like,
appreciate to know why.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.736 align:start size:34% position:66%
Yeah, um...

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.471 align:end position:100%
Okay, yeah,
that's, like--

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.840 align:end position:100%
You know, I think
that you're kind of, like,

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:50.076 align:start size:41% position:59%
a controlling
person who--

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.444 align:start position:0%
Thank you.
Thank you for that.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:54.413 align:start position:0%
That's nice.
Thank you for that.

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.115 align:end position:100%
Cool.
No problem.

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:58.317 align:start position:0%
So you know what
your problem is, Andre?

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.519 align:start size:16% position:84%
What?

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.622 align:start position:0%
You keep tabs
on people.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.023 align:start position:0%
Every little thing
somebody does,

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:07.593 align:start position:0%
you have to keep
a tab of it.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.596 align:end position:100%
Wait. I-I can't tell
if you're angry or not.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.731 align:start position:0%
I'm not.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
Mm, totally not angry.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.334 align:start position:0%
No, I'm excited.
It's good.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.570 align:start position:0%
It's just, like,
you said your piece,

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:21.073 align:start position:0%
and I just think
that I deserve the human decency

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:22.475 align:start position:0%
to say my piece.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:23.509 align:start size:41% position:59%
Right, right.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.611 align:start position:0%
Is that--
is that not okay?

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.880 align:end position:100%
No, no, no.
It's--

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:30.049 align:start size:66% position:34%
Of course, of course.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:31.851 align:start position:0%
You're a controlling,
manipulative person.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.219 align:start position:0%
Everyone says that.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:34.720 align:end position:100%
I-I don't think
that I am.

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:36.722 align:start position:0%
Yes, you are, Andre.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:40.526 size:84% position:42%
Yes, you motherfucking are.

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.695 align:end position:100%
Okay, now--now,
you sound pretty angry.

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.931 align:start position:0%
I'm not angry!

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.033 align:start position:0%
I'm not angry.
I'm fine.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.034 align:start position:0%
I love it!

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.402 align:start position:0%
I love that you came
to my house,

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.237 align:start position:0%
and you broke up with me
in my space.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
And I'm gonna think about that
every time I'm here.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.807 align:start position:0%
That's great.
That is so perfect for me.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.076 align:start position:0%
[crying]
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.411 align:end position:100%
Where else was
I supposed to do it?

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.745 align:end position:100%
'Cause you won't come
to my house.

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:02.582 align:start position:0%
Oh, here he is.
The puppet master is back.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.317 align:end position:100%
But I'm not--
No, I'm not the puppet master.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
Why are you
doing this to me?

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.286 align:end position:100%
It's true.
You won't come to my house.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.988 align:end position:100%
You said my apartment
looks like two rats

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.523 align:end position:100%
just shit in it
every fucking day.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.525 align:start position:0%
Oh, right,
like, thank you for that.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.826 align:start position:0%
I'm a bitch.
Thank you.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.361 align:end position:100%
I didn't call--
no, I didn't say "bitch."

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:16.462
- I didn't--
- Which is it?

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.797 align:start position:0%
Am I evil,
or am I a bitch?

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.098 align:end position:100%
No, no, you're
not evil, Meegan.

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:20.900 align:start position:0%
Well, then why
are you punishing me?

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:22.935 align:end position:100%
I'm not punishing you.
I'm not--

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:24.103 align:start position:0%
You broke up with me,

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm not supposed
to feel punished.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.074
- Who thinks like that?
- [shouting]

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.109 align:end position:100%
I don't know!
I'm sorry.

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.877 align:end position:100%
I'm sorry,
okay, Meegan?

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.412 align:end position:100%
I guess I didn't think
it through.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:34.747 align:start position:0%
Well, it's, like,
too late now.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.649
- I mean, we're done.
- No, it's not too late.

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.851 align:end position:100%
Meegan, Meegan,
seriously, I just--

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:42.255 align:end position:100%
I-I-I had a feeling
that I thought was true,

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.590 align:end position:100%
and clearly--
clearly it wasn't true.

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.759 align:start position:0%
Like, I'm so confused.

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.094 align:start position:0%
Like, are you
breaking up with me,

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.428 align:start position:0%
or are you not
breaking up with me?

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:52.231 align:end position:100%
Meegan, I'm not
breaking up with you!

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:54.066 align:start position:0%
Okay, cool. So what do you want
to do tonight?

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.668 align:start position:0%
Like, I want to hang out
with Amy and Brad,

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.536 align:start position:0%
but maybe before that,
we can go to Angela's.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.539

â™ª â™ª

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:03.910
What just happened?
