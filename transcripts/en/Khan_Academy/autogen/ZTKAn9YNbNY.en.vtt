00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:03.292
 Flor wants to make tables and chairs. 

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:08.993
 Each chair or table is made with the same number of boards and nails. 

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:14.853
 It has a total of 150 boards and 330 nails. 

00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:17.045
 The following inequality is presented 

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.589
 the number of tables T and the chairs C, 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.246
 which she can do with 150 boards. 

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:26.566
 We see these 150 boards here. 

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:30.919
 It looks like she uses 17 boards for each table, 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.540
 so the total amount of boards 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.420
 to make the masses is 17T. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.380
 It looks like she uses 6 boards for one chair. 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.360
 Put 6 for a chair on the number of chairs. 

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:47.110
 This is the total number of boards, 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.468
 which she uses for the chairs. 

00:00:48.468 --> 00:00:49.373
 Collect them together. 

00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:50.987
 They can not be more than 150. 

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:53.634
 It has only 150 boards. 

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:56.193
 Additionally, the next inequality presents 

00:00:56.193 --> 00:01:00.170
 the number of tables and chairs that she makes with 330 nails. 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.769
 It has a maximum of 330 nails. 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.404
 She seems to use 34 nails for one table, 

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:09.718
 because the total number of nails for the masses is 

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:13.129
 34 nails per table by number of tables. 

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:14.696
 And then it seems that 

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:20.869
 she needs 27 nails for a chair, 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.400
 because the total number of nails he uses for all chairs, 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.200
 is 27 nails per chair according to the number of chairs. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.600
 Is Flor enough enough boards and nails, 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.180
 to make 3 tables and 9 chairs? 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.167
 Let's see, let's look at the number of boards. 

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:45.013
 To make 3 tables and 9 chairs, 

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:48.414
 she will use 17 on T. 

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:49.796
 In this case, it is 3. 

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:54.796
 It will use 17 in 3 tables for the tables. 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.920
 And then he'll use it 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.900
 6 by the number of chairs. 

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.551
 6 in 9 chairs. 

00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:07.047
 6 chair boards for 9 chairs. 

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:08.614
 6 by 9 is the number of boards, 

00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:10.228
 which she will use for the chairs. 

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:12.085
 That will be the same thing 

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:18.980
 like ... 17 at 3 is 51 ... plus ... 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.200
 6 at 9 is 54. 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.472
 So it's 54. 

00:02:24.472 --> 00:02:25.412
 How is this? 

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.367
 Is it less or equal to 150? 

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.524
 Is it less than or equal to 150? 

00:02:30.524 --> 00:02:34.003
 Let's see, 51 plus 54 will be 105. 

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.824
 This is indeed less than or equal to 150. 

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:38.104
 So this is the answer. 

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:40.753
 It has more than enough planks. 

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:42.678
 So she has enough planks. 

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:43.905
 Let me write it down. 

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:45.940
 Sufficient boards. 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.772
 Now let's see if there are enough nails. 

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:49.835
 Let's see if she has ... 

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:50.992
 it became odd ... 

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:52.511
 enough boards. 

00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:54.240
 Let's see if she has enough nails. 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.230
 So for 3 tables you will need 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.110
 34 by 3 nails. 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.969
 34 nails for each table on 3 tables. 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.152
 So we have 34 at 3. 

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.620
 These are the nails we need for all the masses. 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.767
 And then we have plus ... 

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.508
 she will use 27 nails for each chair ... 

00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:14.594
 9 chairs. 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.560
 27 at 9. 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.740
 We have to find 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.070
 whether this is less than or equal to 330. 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.011
 So let's see. 

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.457
 34 at 3, it's 100 ... 

00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:30.930
 No, it's 90 plus 12. 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.729
 So we have 102. 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.954
 And then 27 at 9. 

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:38.313
 Let's see, this will be ... 

00:03:38.313 --> 00:03:41.134
 is this 243? 

00:03:41.134 --> 00:03:44.899
 Yes, so we have plus 243. 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.226
 This is 102 plus 243, 

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:50.733
 is this less than or equal to 330? 

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:56.050
 Let's see, here is the sum of 345. 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.050
 No, it is not less than or equal to 330. 

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:02.284
 This is not so. 

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:06.360
 This is not true. 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:15.520
 She does not have enough nails. 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.363
 And therefore it has enough planks, but there are not enough nails. 

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:20.196
 So if you do not go and buy more nails, 

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:23.431
 she will not be able to make these tables and chairs.
