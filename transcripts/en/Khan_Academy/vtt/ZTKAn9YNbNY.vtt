00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:03.292
- [Voiceover] "Fleur wants
to make tables and chairs.

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:06.860
"Each chair or table is
made with the same number

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.993
"of wooden boards and nails.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:12.223
"She has a total of 150 wooden boards

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:14.853
and 330 nails.

00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:17.045
"The following inequality
represents the number

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.589
"of tables, T, and chairs, C,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.246
"she can make with 150 wooden boards."

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:26.566
So we can see the 150 wooden
boards right over here

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:30.919
and it looks like she uses 17
wooden boards for each table

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.467
so the total amount of
boards from the tables are

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.428
to make the tables is 17 T.

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:41.352
And it looks like she
uses six wooden boards

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:43.348
for each chair and that's why you take

00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:45.368
six per chair times the number of chairs.

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:47.110
This is the total number of wooden boards

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.468
she uses from the chairs.

00:00:48.468 --> 00:00:49.373
And you add them together.

00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:50.987
It can't be anymore than 150.

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:53.634
She only has, I guess 150 wooden boards.

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:56.193
"Additionally, the following
inequality represents

00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:57.593
"the number of tables and chairs

00:00:57.593 --> 00:01:00.170
"she can make with 330 nails."

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.769
So once again, she has
the maximum of 330 nails.

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.404
It looks like she needs 34 nails per table

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:09.718
because the total nails from the tables is

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:13.129
34 nails per table times
the number of tables.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:16.329
And then it looks like she needs 27 nails.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.869
It looks like she needs 27 nails per chair

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.563
because the total nails that she uses

00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:25.180
in all of the chairs
are 27 nails per chair

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.205
times the number of chairs.

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:28.714
"Does Fleur have enough boards

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.755
"and nails to make three tables,

00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:33.695
"to make three,

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:38.175
"to make three tables and nine chairs?

00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:40.253
"And nine chairs?"

00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:43.167
Let's see, let's look
at the number of boards.

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:45.013
To make three tables and nine chairs,

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:48.414
she's going to use 17 times T.

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:49.796
In this case, it's three.

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:54.796
Shes' going to use 17 times
three boards for the tables

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.713
and then she is going to use,

00:01:57.713 --> 00:01:59.048
she is going to use

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:02.914
six times the number of chairs.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.551
So six times nine chairs.

00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:07.047
Six boards per chair times nine chairs.

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:08.614
So six times nine is the number of boards

00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:10.228
she's going to use on the chairs.

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:12.085
So this is going to,
this is the same thing

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:16.868
as 17 times three is 51.

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:19.399
51 plus,

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.199
six times nine is 54.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.472
So this is 54.

00:02:24.472 --> 00:02:25.412
And what is this?

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.367
Is this less than or equal to 150?

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.524
Is that less than or equal to 150?

00:02:30.524 --> 00:02:34.003
Let's see, 51 plus 54 is going to be 105.

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.824
So that indeed is less
than or equal to 150.

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:38.104
So that checks out.

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:40.753
So she has more than enough boards.

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:42.678
So she has enough boards.

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:43.905
Let me write that.

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:45.940
Enough boards.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.772
Now let's see if she has enough nails.

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:49.835
Let's see if she has,

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:50.992
that came out weird,

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:52.511
enough boards.

00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:54.240
Let's see if she has enough nails.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.230
So three tables are going to require

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.110
34 times three nails.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.969
So 34 nails per table times three tables.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.152
So 34 times three.

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.620
That's how many nails
for all of the tables.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.767
And then plus,

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.508
if she is going to use 27 nails per chair

00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:14.594
times the nine chairs.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:17.547
27 times nine.

00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:18.750
We need to figure out,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.070
is this less than or equal to 330?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.011
And so let's see.

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.457
34 times three, that is 100.

00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:30.930
No, that's 90 plus 12.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.729
So that's 102

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.954
and then 27 times nine.

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:38.313
So let's see, that would be,

00:03:38.313 --> 00:03:41.134
was it 243?

00:03:41.134 --> 00:03:44.899
Yep, so plus 243.

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.226
So it's 102 plus 243,

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:50.733
is that less than or equal to 330?

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:52.379
So let's see, this would be,

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.050
this would end up adding up to 345.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.050
No, this is not less than or equal to 330.

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:02.284
This is not the case.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.933
This is not true.

00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:06.545
Not true.

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:09.029
So she does not have enough nails.

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.722
So not enough,

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:14.692
not enough nails.

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:18.363
And so she has enough
boards but not enough nails.

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:20.196
So unless she goes and buys some nails,

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:23.431
she's not going to be able to
make these tables and chairs.
