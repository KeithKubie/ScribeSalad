00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.220
Guys... We're making some nice progress here.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.520
In under 30 hours, we got almost 100,000 comments to the Copyright Office, about how the DMCA is being abused.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.540
That is phenomenal, we cannot begin to say how thankful we are for all of this, and the great news is: It's working.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:26.820
Thanks to your efforts, we have secured two spots for the U.S. Government Round Tables, talking about copyright in the future.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.380
One in New York City on May 2nd and 3rd, and one in San Francisco on May 12th and 13th.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:39.740
The Internet's voice needs to continue to be heard, and at these panels, we can at least let the government know of the abuse that's going on,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.380
And we have you guys to thank for it.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.520
And the other way we know it's working? We're having hit pieces put out against us!

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
The Copyright Alliance released a piece claiming our movement as a "zombie apocalypse".

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.040
That's right! WE'RE the zombies!

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.460
You hear that Markiplier? Jeremy Johns? PeanutButterGamer? Andy Signore? TeamFourStar? I Hate Everything?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.100
And all the other countless people that have been making your voices heard?

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.700
You have no idea what you're talking about!

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.580
You're just mindless zombies because you voiced your opinion!

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.060
Clearly you should be supporting the people that are taking down videos without even having to see them!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.840
But, this video is just a review-
-CLAIM!

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.100
It's protected under fair use, it's totally legal-
-CLAIM!

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.840
Won't you at least WATCH the video before you claim it-
-CLAIM!

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.600
Clearly, they're the ones that know what's going on!

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.500
And the second from the industry called what we did a "cyber attack".

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.700
I can only sum up our "nefarious plans" with this clip from a 1990s movie.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.480
-Hack the planet!

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.760
-Hack the planet!! Hack the planet!

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.420
Yes, "hack the planet" indeed.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.060
So now the public voicing their concerns and their opinions equals a cyberattack.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.840
You couldn't make this up if you tried!

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.320
So, yeah, that uh... Gives you a little bit of an idea about who we're going up against and just how out of touch they are.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.860
But this is the best kind of news you can get because it shows that we're getting to them.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.880
Not only are they getting worried, but they're getting emotional.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.160
Name-calling? Zombies? This is what they got right now!

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.280
But like we said before, we're in it for the long haul, and we need to keep moving forward.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.180
Not only do we need to continue to protect fair use under the DMCA,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:27.440
But make sure that this new policy from the RIAA, pushing for a new amendment of "Take Down, Stay Down", doesn't get any traction.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.260
The recording industry wants to change the DMCA so that when one single upload gets flagged by them,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.240
Any future piece of content using that flagged portion is automatically blocked from a site like YouTube.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.720
So let's say, Fox blocks an upload of their newest X-Men movie on YouTube.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.380
Does that mean any footage used for a review or anything like that is gonna be taken down? It's gonna result in your channel being destroyed?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.360
We don't know!

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.340
It's possible it'll only affect full uploads, which they're in their right to block.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.220
But we're giving these companies that have clearly shown they like to abuse this system even more power, and that's not good.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.920
So, what can you do to help?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.980
Well the cool thing is, "Fight For The Future" has decided to leave the DMCA abuse comments open until these meetings we're going to have wrapped up.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.740
So keep sending your comments and personal stories about the DMCA abuse, and we'll make sure that it gets to the Copyright Office.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:29.400
On top of that, we want to remove one of the counterpoints that the movies and recording industries keep using with no factual evidence, and we gotta prove 'em wrong on this.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.080
They say reviews, parodies, covers, remixes, Let's Plays... Those are hurting their sales.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.820
We know that's not true.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.660
Me and a lot of other producers have gotten countless e-mails of people saying that they've checked out a movie or a TV show based on our material.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.320
Or even that they completely forgot about a movie until it was reviewed.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.900
Lets give 'em some hard numbers.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.900
If you have ever bought a movie, video game, song, television episode or complete season, a piece of software,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.140
Or anything else based upon someone's review, Let's Play, cover, remix, or video on YouTube, let us know.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.280
For example, Greg Sestero, who played Mark in "The Room", he told us that our review of the movie "The Room", actually got a lot of attention on it.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.420
And right now, he's in the process of filming a movie about that movie!

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.800
That's what happens when you get a lot of attention looking at this, it creates new media!

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.440
And it creates jobs that does all these wonderful things, and that's what we gotta get them to know.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.160
Just click the link below and tell us what you bought and what video you saw that inspired you to purchase it.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.860
Guys, we said from the beginning we're in it for the long haul, and it looks like you guys are too.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.980
Honestly, this is probably just the beginning of all this, but already we're making progress.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.320
We're making our voices heard. We are NOT gonna be quiet about this and you guys have made that possible.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.000
And if you're just joining in to all of this, you haven't followed the "Where's The Fair Use" movement or anything like that,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.280
there's links below to show you what we're talking about.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.580
Copyright law is going to be changed. But with your help, we can change it for the better and protect the Internet.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.220
Thanks everybody for your support, and this is Doug Walker still asking:

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.660
"Where's The Fair Use?".
