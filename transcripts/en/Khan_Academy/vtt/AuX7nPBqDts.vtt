00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.730
Welcome to the presentation
on basic addition.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.810
I know what you're thinking,
Sal, addition doesn't

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.260
seem so basic to me.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.940
Well, I apologize.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.170
Hopefully by the end of this
presentation or in a couple

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.840
of weeks it will seem basic.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.990
So let's get started
with, I guess we could

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.390
say, some problems.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.100
Well let's say I start
with an old classic.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.950
1 plus 1.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.440
And I think you already know
how to do this, but I'll kind

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.960
of show you a way of doing this
in case you don't have this

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.050
memorized or you haven't
already mastered this.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.930
You say, well, if I have 1,
let's call that an avocado.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.030
If I have 1 avocado and
then you were to give me

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.870
another avocado, how many
avocados do I now have?

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.340
Well, let's see.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.300
I have 1, 2 avocados.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.740
So 1 plus 1 is equal to 2.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.910
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.390
That was too easy, so let
me give you something a

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.410
little bit more difficult.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.840
I like the avocados.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.130
I might stick with that theme.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.420
What is 3 plus 4?

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.980
This is, I think, a more
difficult problem.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.070
Well, let's stick
with the avocados.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.710
And in case you don't know what
an avocado is, it's actually

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.890
a very delicious fruit.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.210
It's actually the fattiest
of all the fruits.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.340
You probably didn't even
think it was a fruit,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.470
even if you ate one.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.270
Let's say I have 3
avocados-- 1, 2, 3.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.120
And let's say you were to
give me 4 more avocados.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.620
So let me put this 4 in yellow
so you know that these are

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.610
the ones you're giving me.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.780
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.980
So how many total
avocados do I have now?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.790
That's 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7 avocados.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.000
So 3 plus 4 is equal to 7.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.290
And now I'm going to introduce
you to another way of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.070
thinking about this.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.180
It's called the number line.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.490
And actually, I think this is
how I do it in my head when I

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.920
forget-- if I don't
have it memorized.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.450
So number line, I just write
all the numbers in order.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.850
And I go high enough just
so all the numbers I'm

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.470
using are kind of in it.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.000
So you know the first number
is 0, which is nothing.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.020
Maybe you don't know,
but now you know.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:36.250
And then you go to 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.600
Keeps going-- 11.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.360
So we're saying 3 plus 4.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.740
So let's start at 3.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.500
So I have 3 here and we're
going to add 4 to that 3.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.430
So all we do is we go up the
number line, or we go to the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.850
right on the number
line, 4 more.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.130
So we go 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.360
Notice all we did is we just
increased it by one, by

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.610
two, by three, by four.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.090
And then we ended up at 7.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.030
And that was our answer.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.180
We can do a couple
of different ones.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.030
What if I asked you
what 8 plus 1 is?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.960
Well, you might
already know it.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.390
You know, plus 1 is
just the next number.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.225
But if we look at the
number line you start

00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:22.500
at 8 and you add 1.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.340
8 plus 1 is equal to 9.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.445
Let's do some harder problems.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.830
And just so you know, if you're
a little daunted by this

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.550
initially, you can always
draw the circles.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.060
You can always do
the number line.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.670
And eventually, over time, the
more practice you do-- you'll

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.330
hopefully memorize these and
you'll do these problems

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.440
in like half a second.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.240
I promise you.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.250
You just got to
keep practicing.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.380
I want to draw the number line
again, actually, I have a line

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.740
tool, so I should give you
all those ugly looking lines

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.260
that I've been giving you.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.840
Look at that.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.660
That's amazing.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.810
Let me see.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.230
Look at that.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.490
That's a nice looking line.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.650
I'm going to feel bad
to erase it later on.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.920
So let me draw a number line.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:28.590
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.060
So let's do a hard problem.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.290
I'm going to do it in
different colors now.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.550
5 plus 6.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.690
So if you want, you could
pause the video and try this.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.720
You might already
know the answer.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.140
And the reason why I say this
is a hard problem is because

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.660
the answer has more numbers
than figures, so you can't

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.770
necessarily do it
on your fingers.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.980
So let's get started
with this problem.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.780
Actually, my phone is ringing,
but I'm going to ignore the

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.900
phone because you're
more important.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.980
OK, let's start at the 5.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.400
So we start at the 5 and
we're going to add 6 to it.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:13.980
So we go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.640
And we're at 11.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.670
So 5 plus 6 is equal to 11.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.475
Now I'm going to ask you a
question, what is 6 plus 5?

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.540
Well, we're now
going to see that.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.890
Can you switch the two numbers
and get the same answer?

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.260
Well, let's try that.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.600
And I'm going to try it in
a different color so we

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.520
don't get all confused.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.930
So let's start at 6.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.880
Ignore the yellow for
now and add 5 to it.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.040
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040
We get to the same place.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.840
And I think you might want
to try this on a bunch of

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.600
problems and you'll see
it always works out.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.900
That it doesn't matter what
order-- 5 plus 6 is the

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.910
same thing as 6 plus 5.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.670
And that makes sense.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.960
If I have 5 avocados
and you give me 6,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.740
I'm going to have 11.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.845
If I have 6 avocados and
you gave me 5, I'm going

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.350
to have 11 either way.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.190
Since this number line is so
nice, I want to do a few

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.170
more problems using it.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.720
Although as I use it I'm sure
I'll just continue to confuse

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.460
you because I'll write
so much on top of it.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.290
But let's see.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.250
I'll use white now.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.320
What is 8 plus 7?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.830
Well, if you can still read
this, 8 is right here.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.820
We're going to add 7 to it.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:36.910
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.110
We go to 15.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.390
8 plus 7 is 15.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.550
So hopefully that gives
you a sense of how to do

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.200
these types of problems.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.570
I guess this and you're going
to learn multiplication in a

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.880
little bit, but these types of
problems are-- when you're

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.830
getting started off in
mathematics, these kind of

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.390
require the most practice and
to some degree, you have to

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.430
start memorizing them.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.150
But over time, when you look
back, I want you to remember

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.650
how you feel while you're
watching this video right now.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.780
And then I want you to watch
this video in like 3 years and

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.930
remember how you felt when
you're watching it now.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.340
And you're going
to be, oh my God.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.080
This was so easy because you're
going to learn it so fast.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.940
So anyway, I think
you have an idea.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.500
If you don't know the answer to
any of the additional problems

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.735
that we give in the exercises
you can press the hints and

00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:28.560
it'll draw circles and you can
just count up the circles.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.020
Or if you want to do it
on your own so you get

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.260
the problem right, you
could draw the circles.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.370
Or you could draw a number
line like we did in

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.710
this presentation.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.330
I think you might be ready to
tackle the addition problems.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.870
Have fun.
