I don't mind

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
I don't mind
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.600
I don't mind
my name is Emre I had thought I thought

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
my name is Emre I had thought I thought
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.870
my name is Emre I had thought I thought
of a time machine that basically ran on

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880
of a time machine that basically ran on
 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.049
of a time machine that basically ran on
all the data based on your brain so it

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
all the data based on your brain so it
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.689
all the data based on your brain so it
basically calculated all the information

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
basically calculated all the information
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.750
basically calculated all the information
on your brain and all the data in your

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
on your brain and all the data in your
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.620
on your brain and all the data in your
life that would and it would create a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
life that would and it would create a
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.660
life that would and it would create a
vortex which you would go back through

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670
vortex which you would go back through
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.720
vortex which you would go back through
and you would go back in time so it's a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
and you would go back in time so it's a
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.580
and you would go back in time so it's a
time machine

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590
time machine
 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.760
time machine
now I was thinking that if you went back

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
now I was thinking that if you went back
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.920
now I was thinking that if you went back
once you would have the memory of going

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
once you would have the memory of going
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.160
once you would have the memory of going
back so that would create another vortex

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
back so that would create another vortex
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.639
back so that would create another vortex
in which you would go through again and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
in which you would go through again and
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.119
in which you would go through again and
and once you got to the dimension work

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
and once you got to the dimension work
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.819
and once you got to the dimension work
which was in the past the other time

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
which was in the past the other time
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.740
which was in the past the other time
machines with your memory would because

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
machines with your memory would because
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.819
machines with your memory would because
you're the person you it would also form

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
you're the person you it would also form
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.760
you're the person you it would also form
another vortex which would go through

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
another vortex which would go through
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770
another vortex which would go through
and you keep going through infinite

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
and you keep going through infinite
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.260
and you keep going through infinite
vortexes until your husband come in

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270
vortexes until your husband come in
 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.560
vortexes until your husband come in
infinite space and time now I would my

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
infinite space and time now I would my
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.800
infinite space and time now I would my
question is would it be possible to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
question is would it be possible to
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.249
question is would it be possible to
generate enough electricity to be able

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
generate enough electricity to be able
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.609
generate enough electricity to be able
to create another vortex which would

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
to create another vortex which would
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.240
to create another vortex which would
accelerate time and bring you and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250
accelerate time and bring you and
 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.950
accelerate time and bring you and
generate enough power to bring you back

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
generate enough power to bring you back
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.789
generate enough power to bring you back
um that all the way back to your time

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
um that all the way back to your time
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.980
um that all the way back to your time
and and keep it stable with all the with

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
and and keep it stable with all the with
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.789
and and keep it stable with all the with

these guys were in Japan showed that you
could build a time machine if you are

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710
could build a time machine if you are
 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.500
could build a time machine if you are
allowed to travel near the speed of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
allowed to travel near the speed of
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.110
allowed to travel near the speed of

order to go faster or as close to the

order to go faster or as close to the
 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.070
order to go faster or as close to the
speed of light you need enormous amounts

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080
speed of light you need enormous amounts
 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.400
speed of light you need enormous amounts
of energy and it might stretch you where

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
of energy and it might stretch you where

your head is going being accelerated
more than your feet and it would kill

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000
more than your feet and it would kill

you maybe these are great questions and

you maybe these are great questions and
 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.560
you maybe these are great questions and
I noticed you use the word vortex a lot

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570
I noticed you use the word vortex a lot
 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.830
I noticed you use the word vortex a lot
a vortex is a whirlpool like a the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840
a vortex is a whirlpool like a the
 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.460
a vortex is a whirlpool like a the
center of a hurricane is a vortex and

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
center of a hurricane is a vortex and
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.960
center of a hurricane is a vortex and

I appreciate you throwing around the
word vortex but I'm not sure it's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260
word vortex but I'm not sure it's
 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.380

go back in time and change things so

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620
go back in time and change things so
 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.210
go back in time and change things so
that you never existed so it's an old

that you never existed so it's an old
 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.729
that you never existed so it's an old
question in science fiction and it's

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739
question in science fiction and it's
 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.270
question in science fiction and it's
cool but as far as anybody knows time

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280
cool but as far as anybody knows time
 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.479
cool but as far as anybody knows time
only goes one way and as far as anybody

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489
only goes one way and as far as anybody
 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.530
only goes one way and as far as anybody
knows nobody knows why that is going
