00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.290
Today we'll talk about planning. Recall that we had said an intelligent agent

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.750
maps perceptual histories into actions. Planning is a powerful method for

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.040
action selection. We'll use the syntax we learned from logic

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.230
last week to set up the specification of goals and states, and operators, for

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.630
moving between states and achieving goals. We'll see that when

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.640
there are multiple goals, there can be conflicts between them. We'll describe

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.670
a specific technique called partial-order planning that avoids conflict between

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.440
multiple goals. Finally, we'll talk about a representation called

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.570
hierarchical task networks that allows us to make complex hierarchical plans.
