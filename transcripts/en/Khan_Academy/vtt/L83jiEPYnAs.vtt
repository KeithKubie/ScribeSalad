00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.300
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.820
Today, I'm learning
about the 8th Amendment

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.840
to the US Constitution, which
prohibits the government

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.620
from imposing excessive fines and bail,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.110
or inflicting cruel and unusual punishment

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.860
on individuals accused
or convicted of a crime.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.820
But what counts as excessive,
or cruel and unusual?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.240
To learn more, I sought out the help

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.240
of two experts on the 8th Amendment.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.620
John Stinneford is the assistant director

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.400
of the Criminal Justice Center

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.590
at the University of Florida Law School.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.440
John Bessler is an
associate professor of law

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.660
at the University of Baltimore Law School.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.910
So, Professor Bessler,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.090
why were the framers so keen
to include the 8th Amendment?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.200
Why did they wanna protect
these rights in particular?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.630
- [John B.] Well, these
rights were actually enshrined

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.610
in the English Bill of Rights of 1689.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.250
And so, when the Americans
got into the dispute

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.199
with Great Britain,
they decided they wanted

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.580
to have the same rights
that Englishman had.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.090
And so, it was not too surprising that

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.620
when George Mason actually
wrote the Virginia Declaration

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.960
of Rights in 1776, that
he looked to English law

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.420
to see what rights the English had

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.980
because he wanted exactly the same rights.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.740
And so, this 16 words in the
8th Amendment have been subject

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.210
to a lot of controversy over the years,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.930
but, I think, one of the reasons

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.650
that the founders wanted this was that,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.600
like the English would have problems

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600
with the monarch imposing
excessive bail, excessive fines,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.800
inflicting cruel and unusual punishments,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.390
the founders also knew that was a risk

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.970
that there was abuse from the government

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:34.803
in the United States.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.890
And so, they also wanted those rights.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.260
Because, originally, in the Constitution,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.490
these rights were not protected against,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.480
and the Bill of Rights
was ratified in 1791

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.160
which ensured that there
would be protections

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.640
against these cruel and
unusual punishments,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.600
and excessive bail and excessive fines.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.860
- [John S.] If you look
at the 8th Amendment,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.310
there's three clauses, right?

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.560
The excessive bail clause,
the excessive fines clause,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.300
and the cruel and unusual
punishments clause.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.360
And these all have one thing in common,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.640
which is that these are
all penalties, essentially,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.510
that the government
inflicts on people usually

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.810
as the result of either
being accused of crime

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.650
or of being convicted of crime.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.690
So if you've been arrested,
you're waiting for trial,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.090
very often your only way to get out

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.020
of jail before trial is to make bail.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.100
And, of course, after
you've been convicted,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.560
the court might impose a fine on you,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.210
or some other kind of punishment.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.190
And so, the 8th Amendment is designed

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.390
to prevent the government
from doing things

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.170
that are excessive.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.480
When the government punishes a person,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.530
that's the most coercive
thing the government

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.650
does short of war, right?

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.860
Other than shooting you
in battle, picking you up

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.420
and throwing you in a jail cell
is about as bad as it gets.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.520
And so, the framers wanted to make sure

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.630
that we had a constitutional protection

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.740
when it comes to criminal punishment.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.840
- [Kim] So, in a lot of
cases in the Bill of Rights

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.100
you see the framers reacting
to some historical evil

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.140
that they hope to prevent.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.160
For example, the 3rd Amendment says

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.110
you can't quarter soldiers
in private citizens' homes

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.160
because that had been such
a important tipping point

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.710
in the American Revolution.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.230
Was there something that
the framers had in mind

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.410
as a particular historical evil
that they wanted to prevent?

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.710
- [John B.] Well, there
was some historical evils,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.080
and the English Bill of Rights
went into place in 1689,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.690
and when that went into place

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.570
there was actually a
controversy in England

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.530
around a person by the
name of Titus Oates.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.200
Titus Oates was somebody
who had false accusation,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.810
what was had committed
perjury resulted, actually,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.850
that allegation in the
execution of 15 Catholics.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.240
And the plot that he'd alleged

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.690
was one to assassinate
the king of England.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.870
- [John S.] The question is
what to do with Oates, right?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.480
Because as a sort of a moral matter,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.860
he's about as bad as it gets.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.840
In fact, in 2005,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.820
English historians voted
him the worst Briton

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.540
of the 17th century
(Kim laughs)

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.430
and the third worst Briton
of the last 1,000 years,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.263
or something like that.

00:04:10.263 --> 00:04:11.580
So a very bad guy,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.300
you could think of him as
a sort of a serial killer.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.030
But the problem is that the
actual crime he committed

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.180
was the crime of perjury.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.970
And even though his perjury
resulted in the deaths

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.410
of many innocent people,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.430
nonetheless he could only
be convicted of perjury,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.300
which at the time was a misdemeanor.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.590
Which meant that he could not
be executed for his crime.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.460
So when it came time for
his sentencing, the judge,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.010
Chief Justice Jeffreys, who
is a famous hanging judge

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.347
from English history, says to Oates,

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.587
"Well, Oates, we can't take your life,

00:04:43.587 --> 00:04:45.347
"we can't take your limb,

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:48.337
"but we have something
special prepared for you."

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.030
And it turns out that what
they had prepared for him was,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.030
number one, a huge fine, they
fined him like 2,000 marks.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.390
They sentenced that he'd
be dragged across the city

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.640
of London while being flogged,
he was dragged from Aldgate

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.860
to Newgate while being flogged,
and then two days later,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.020
just as the scabs were
starting to form on his wounds,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.690
he's dragged back across the
city of London from Newgate

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.130
to Tyburn, again while being flogged.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.720
Many people think the
hope was that he would die

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.210
from the flogging, but,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.570
like a cockroach in a
nuclear war, he survived.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.660
- [John B.] This punishment was actually

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.620
a very severe punishment,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.813
and after the English Bill of
Rights, it was promulgated.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.030
The Titus Oates' punishment was challenged

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.600
and some of the members
of the House of Lords

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.460
actually called the punishment
barbarous, inhumane,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.040
and unchristian, and contrary
to the English Bill of Rights.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.460
And so, there was no precedence
to warrant the punishments

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.890
of whipping and committing
to prison for life

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.280
for the crime of perjury.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.050
This punishment was eventually remitted,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.350
in the sense that Oates
was later released.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.410
- [John S.] Although, the
House of Lords refused to vote

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.020
to suspend the judgment against Oates

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.377
'cause they hated him so much they said,

00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:59.030
"So ill a man shouldn't get
the benefit of any relief."

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.640
But they all agreed that
the punishment was cruel

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.610
and unusual, and what's
interesting is in the debate

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.147
they say things like,

00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:09.167
"This punishment is contrary
to law and ancient practice.

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:10.777
"It is without precedent,

00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:13.600
"and it'll be a bad
precedent for the future."

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.100
So, in other words, it's cruel

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.950
and the way we know it's cruel is

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.890
because it's so much harsher

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.470
than has previously been inflicted

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.670
for the crime of perjury, right?

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.860
So the Oates case shows us
that when the words cruel

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.200
and unusual were first used,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.940
they were used to describe punishments

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.040
that are harsher than the
Common law would permit,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.093
or harsher than long-standing
prior practice would permit.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.320
And this means that, among other things,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.400
the cruel and unusual
punishments clause is not limited

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.830
to gruesome punishments like torture

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.830
and the rack and all that kind of thing.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.550
Because, in fact, the
punishments inflicted on Oates,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.230
although they were very harsh
for the crime of perjury,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.380
were not as harsh as
some other punishments

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.320
that the Common law permitted
for other crimes like treason.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.270
- [Kim] Wow!

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.830
So that tells us a lot
about the English context

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.780
of cruel and unusual punishment.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.000
Do we know what cruel and unusual meant

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.653
to the framers of the U.S. Bill of Rights?

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.620
- [John S.] So, punishments
were cruel and unusual,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.070
again if they're too harsh in light

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.800
of long-standing prior practice

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.560
for the crime for which they're inflicted.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.540
There's another problem
with statutory law,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.790
or with decisions of a judge or a king

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.850
or a president for that matter,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.100
that's also really relevant

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.830
when we think about the 8th Amendment.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.430
And that is,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.430
sometimes the government
gets really mad at someone.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.440
They either think of a person
as an enemy of the state

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.450
and they wanna inflict the
worst punishment they can

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.360
on that person, or perhaps there's a panic

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.670
about a certain group in society.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.160
So, for example, in
American society recently,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.120
there have been panics about drug crime,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.730
or panics about sex offenses,
and every time that happens,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.270
the government tries to respond
with new forms of punishment

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.580
that are much, much harsher
than what came before.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.750
And so, the insight behind
the 8th Amendment is that

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.780
when the government wants
to inflict a new punishment,

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.760
you have to compare it against
long-standing prior practice,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.670
that is you have to compare it

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.840
against the Common law, right?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.010
So the Common law was called

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.870
the law of custom and long usage, right?

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.170
So, if something comported

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.210
with the Common law, it was usual.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.380
If it was contrary to the Common law,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.210
it was unusual, and that's
where we get the phrase

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.740
cruel and unusual punishments.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.160
It's basically punishments
that are cruel in light of

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.940
or in comparison to
long-standing prior practice.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.330
So the basic point of the 8th Amendment

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.490
from a historical point of view is

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.750
to prohibit the government from innovating

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.210
in a cruel manner, making
up new cruel punishments

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.050
in response to some actual

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.180
or perceived provocation by a criminal.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.120
- [John B.] When the U.S.
Bill of Rights was adopted,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.300
many years later, many decades later,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.170
they had their own issues that
they were struggling with.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.350
And so, the history shows

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.260
that the American founders

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260
probably meant something
different than the English meant

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.180
because it was done over 100 years later,

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.380
but no one knows exactly what was meant

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.240
when they adopted that wording.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.350
To give you an example,

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.940
when the bill was debated in Congress,

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.590
a delegate from South Carolina,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.120
a representative from South Carolina said

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.410
that he objected to the words nor cruel

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.030
and unusual punishments because he said

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.510
the import of them was too indefinite.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.200
And there was another legislator,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.017
Mr. Livermore from New
Hampshire, who said that,

00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:46.207
"The clause seems to express
a great deal of humanity

00:09:46.207 --> 00:09:48.527
"in which account I
have no objection to it,

00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:50.587
"but as it seems to have no meaning in it,

00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:52.700
"I do not think it necessary.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.820
What is meant by the
terms excessive bail?",

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.540
he asked. "Who are to be the judges?",

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.887
he also asked.

00:09:57.887 --> 00:10:00.200
"What is understood by excessive fines?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.350
It lies with the Court to determine."

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.490
And so, that's really where
we are today in a lot of ways,

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.760
the Court is still deciding,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.020
in this case the U.S. Supreme Court,

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.903
is still deciding what
the 8th Amendment line

00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:10.870
what it actually means today.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.950
- [John S.] The modern case law,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.220
especially starting in the 1970s,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.370
revolved a lot around the death penalty.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.860
And so, the question was,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.670
is it still okay to execute people

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.570
for various crimes short of murder?

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.310
Since the 70s, the Court
has continued to do that

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.440
in a number of areas so it's said

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.550
you can't execute the
mentally disabled anymore,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.330
you can't execute minors,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.700
you can't execute anyone
for a non-homicide offense.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.080
Although it's limited the death penalty

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.150
in the name of current
standards of decency,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.940
it's really not clear how
the Court has set about

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.160
to determine whether a punishment

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.060
meets current standards of decency.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.110
When the Court is kind
of on its own saying

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.760
that a punishment violates
current standards of decency,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.720
despite the fact

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.700
that most democratically
elected legislators

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.580
actually approved the practice

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.150
that it looks like the Court's acting

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.850
as sort of a political body.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.450
It sort of led the Court to ignore

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.600
what I think is the
real danger of cruelty,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.930
which is that when there's a public panic

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.690
and the legislature responds
by ratcheting a punishment

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.370
to new and unprecedented
levels of punishment.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.480
And that's actually happened quite a lot

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.040
in the last 40 years.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.850
And every time there's a panic,

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.490
you'll predicatively see
the legislators coming up

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.160
with new punishments that are much,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.550
much harsher than what came before.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.950
And so, for example, with
registered sex offenders,

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.260
there are now a bunch of states

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.840
that actually impose chemical castration

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.530
as a form of punishment for sex offenders.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.300
Now, castration as a form
of punishment fell out

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.960
of usage in the 13th century.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.463
We're literally getting
medieval on sex offenders,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.180
but the Court can't do
anything really to stop it

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.180
or at least hasn't because
these are very popular forms

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.070
of punishment, everyone
hates sex offenders.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.470
- [John B.] The UN has actually decided

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.230
that anything more than 15 days
use of solitary confinement

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.110
should not be permitted.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.700
Justice Anthony Kennedy
actually raised the issue

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.570
of solitary confinement in recent opinion.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.410
He authored for the Supreme Court,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.770
he actually raised the issue on his own,

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.750
had a whole argument at
one point talking about

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.620
how long people actually
spent in solitary confinement

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.180
in American prisons,
including on death row.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.370
And you have cases actually

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.500
where people are spending not just years,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.810
but sometimes decades on death row

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.690
in these kinds of conditions.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.000
Justice Breyer just
wrote a dissent in a case

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.100
where the person had been on death row

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.780
for more than 40 years,
so literally four decades

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.200
in these kinds of very harsh
conditions of confinement.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.250
Other countries have decided
that is not something

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.120
that they want to permit and
they've actually set out a rule

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.530
that anybody that's on death row

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.330
for a certain number
of years, for example,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.760
would have their sentence
commuted to a life sentence

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.600
because of the psychological aspect

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.070
of sorta waiting for one's own death.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.070
- [Kim] In the Bill of Rights,

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.590
this is the last of four
amendments actually,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.700
that are concerned with
protections for the accused.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.850
So, why do you think there's so much

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.100
in the Bill of Rights
about the justice system?

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.970
Were the framers particularly interested

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.720
in making sure that
the accused had rights?

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.820
- [John S.] Yeah, they were.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.160
And, in particular,
Americans were very devoted

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.170
to the idea of the Common law
as a source of rights, right?

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.140
In fact, that's why we had
the American Revolution

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.630
in the first place, was
that England was denying

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.790
to Americans Common law
rights, like the right not

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.450
to be taxed without
representation in parliament,

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.060
but also more specifically
to the criminal law,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.430
they were denying them the right

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.410
to a jury trial in criminal cases.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.910
And so, Americans wanted to make sure that

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.980
when the U.S. Constitution was adopted,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.900
that those Common law rights
that had built up over time

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.150
in England would be preserved

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.060
in the new American constitutional order.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.280
And many of those rights
had to do with criminal law,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.230
both criminal procedures
and, to some degree,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.240
subset of criminal law and, of
course, criminal punishments.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.360
And again, the reason gets back to sort of

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.980
what I said at the beginning,

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.560
which is that when the
government punishes someone,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.990
that's about the worst thing it can do.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.590
And because the early Americans

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.380
who framed the Constitution
were very powerfully concerned

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.880
with liberty, they wanted
to make sure the government

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.780
would preserve their liberty,
protect their liberty,

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.170
and not become tyrannical, right?

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.700
And so, one of the main ways

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.910
that they wanted to
make sure this happened

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.550
was by limiting the
power of the government

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.620
to punish whoever it wanted to

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.340
for any reason that it wanted to.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.860
And so, we have a, really the
majority of the protections

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.870
in the Bill of Rights have to do

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.390
with the protections
for criminal defendants.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.560
- [Kim] What about excessive
bail and excessive fines?

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.130
How can we define

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.850
what kind of,

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.360
financial penalty,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.780
is proportionate to a crime?

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.260
- [John B.] The courts
have said, essentially,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.030
they've looked at dictionary definitions

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.790
that excessive means
more than is necessary.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.430
One of the core principles
actually go back

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.490
to look at Beccaria's work in the 1760s.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.497
He talked about this
idea of a scale of crimes

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:34.670
and a scale of punishments, and he said

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.874
that there should be
proportionality between the two.

00:15:37.874 --> 00:15:39.760
And so, that proportionality
principle is one

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.260
that we're really still
wrestling with today.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.490
- [John S.] Now, the point of
bail is not to punish someone,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.730
but rather just to make sure

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.710
that they will appear at trial, right?

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.640
And so, the amount of
money you have to impose

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.550
for bail doesn't depend so much
on what crime you committed,

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.760
but what your financial
resources are, right?

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.630
It depends partially on the crime too,

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.160
but largely on your financial resources.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.650
So the amount of money
necessary to make sure

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.460
that a poor man appears at trial

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.810
is probably gonna be much lower

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.480
than the amount of money
necessary to make sure

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.650
that a rich man appears at trial.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.680
And so, it's a standard
that depends partly

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.513
on the nature of the crime,

00:16:18.513 --> 00:16:22.470
but also partially on the
nature of the offender.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.120
- [Kim] I imagine that
what seems like cruel

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.120
and unusual punishment in
the 18th century might not be

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.870
what we consider cruel and unusual today.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.670
For example, we don't do
whipping as a punishment anymore.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.940
How has what counts as cruel

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.100
and unusual punishment changed over time?

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.910
- [John B.] The law
really changes gradually

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.070
over time, as you know.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.610
And so, when you look back at history

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.310
they actually had a large collection

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:55.310
of pretty gruesome punishments
back in the 18th century.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.360
And we had non-lethal
corporal punishments,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.990
they used things like branding people,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.410
they, of course, were
whipping slaves back then,

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.060
slavery was still around,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.870
this was well before the Civil War ended,

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.470
the institution of slavery.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.720
And we also had things like ear cropping,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.400
people would get their ears cut off.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.350
In the Crimes Act of 1790,

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.450
which was passed just the
year before the ratification

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.610
of the 8th Amendment,

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.800
the Congress actually
authorized public whipping,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.200
lashing of people, and also
authorized the pillory,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.110
the same punishment that had
been used against Titus Oates.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.510
So, there was these non-lethal
corporal punishments,

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.087
and really the death penalty
is sort of the last vestige

00:17:40.087 --> 00:17:42.287
of bodily punishment
that the 8th Amendment,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.690
the Supreme Court has
read the 8th Amendment

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.540
to allow the use of capital punishment.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.180
That issue is still a very live one

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.080
before the Supreme Court.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.250
We're now seeing challenges

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.470
about lethal injection, protocols.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.700
We saw a challenge to a
protocol in Kentucky in 2008.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.360
We saw one to a protocol
in Oklahoma in 2015.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.233
These, of course, are things

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:06.720
that the founding fathers
would never have envisioned .

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.270
- [John S.] Lethal
injection typically involves

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.820
a three-drug cocktail.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.070
So there's a barbiturate,

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.730
which is supposed to put you to sleep.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.130
There's a paralyzing agent,

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.480
which paralyzes your body

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.300
and also stops your lungs from moving.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.910
And there's a heart-stopping agent.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.810
Give the offender all three

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.320
and they're supposed to
die quickly and painlessly.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.170
But the problem is if
the sedative doesn't put

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.130
you completely, deeply unconscious,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.780
then the other two drugs are likely

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.350
to make you suffer quite
a bit before you die.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.270
And so, the question is
this cruel and unusual,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.370
or is it not cruel and unusual?

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.670
And to date, the Supreme
Court has twice held

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.610
that lethal injection is
not cruel and unusual,

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.080
and their main reason has been

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.200
that the state's not trying
to torture you to death.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.960
And so, if maybe, or
sometimes accidentally,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.750
tortured to death, well,
that's just too bad,

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.700
but it's not a cruel
and unusual punishment.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.533
- [John B.] So, the Supreme Court

00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:05.640
has approved various methods of execution.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.547
At the same time, however,

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:10.300
the 8th Amendment has been
read to protect prisoners.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.400
So, in general,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.330
the 8th Amendment is sort
of a protective shield

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.990
that prohibits prison guards

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.770
from gratuitously beating up inmates.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.770
It requires prisons to provide
some level of healthcare

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.390
to prisoners because they
cannot get it themselves,

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.120
they're sort of wards of the state

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.960
once they're put in prison.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.710
It requires inmates be fed and sheltered.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.690
So, in a lot of ways,

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.700
the 8th Amendment is a protective
shield protecting inmates,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.280
but then in the use of
the capital punishment

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.000
it becomes what I like to call kind of a,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.120
it's kind of a Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde kind of jurisprudence

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.420
that the 8th Amendment has right now.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.020
- [Kim] So we've learned
that the 8th Amendment seeks

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.060
to limit the power of the government

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.040
in meting out punishment to people

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.270
who have been accused
or convicted of a crime.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.340
Although it's hard to tell exactly

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.950
what constitutes excessive fines or bail,

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.360
in general, it's accepted
that those punishments

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.210
should be proportional to
the crimes in question.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.550
Today, one of the biggest
debates concerns whether,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.810
or how, the 8th Amendment
may limit the death penalty.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.490
