00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.290
Milena's town is built
on a grid similar

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.150
to the coordinate plane.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.490
She is riding her bicycle
from her home at point

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.780
negative 3, 4 to the mall at
point negative 3, negative 7.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.720
Each unit on the graph
denotes one city block.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.520
Plot the two points,
and find the distance

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.420
between Milena's
home and the mall.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.700
So let's see, she's
riding her bicycle

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.250
from her home at the
point negative 3, 4.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.110
So let's plot negative 3, 4.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.020
So I'll use this
point right over here.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.960
So negative 3 is
our x-coordinate.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.940
So we're going to go 3 to the
left of the origin 1, 2, 3.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.640
That gets us a negative 3.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.185
And positive 4 is
our y-coordinate.

00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:46.840
So we're going to go
4 above the origin.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.100
Or I should say, we're
going to go 4 up.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.280
So we went negative 3,
or we went 3 to the left.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.950
That's negative 3, positive 4.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.862
Or you could say we went
positive 4, negative 3.

00:00:57.862 --> 00:01:00.070
This tells us what we do in
the horizontal direction.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.880
This tells us what we do
in the vertical direction.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.985
That's where her home is.

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:05.610
Now let's figure out
where the mall is.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.920
It's at the point
negative 3, negative 7.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.480
So negative 3, we
went negative 3

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.880
along the horizontal
direction and then negative 7

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910
along the vertical direction.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.991
So we get to negative 3,
negative 7 right over there.

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.740
And now we need to
figure out the distance

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.310
between her home and the mall.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.470
Now, we could
actually count it out,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.636
or we could just compute it.

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:32.711
If we wanted to count it out,
it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:34.350
10, 11 blocks.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.980
So we could type that in.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.050
And another way to
think about it is they

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.380
have the exact
same x-coordinate.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.960
They're both at the
x-coordinate negative 3.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.690
The only difference
between these two

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.090
is what is happening
in the y-coordinate.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.580
This is at a positive 4.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.980
This is at a negative 7.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.890
Positive 4, negative 7.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.530
So we're really trying to
find the distance between 4

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.850
and negative 7.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.310
So if I were to say
4 minus negative 7,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.950
we would get this
distance right over here.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.890
So we have 4 minus negative 7,
which is the same thing as 4

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.640
plus 7, which is 11.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.430
Let's do a couple more.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.700
Carlos is hanging a
poster in the area

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.050
shown by the red rectangle.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.400
He is placing a nail in the
center of the blue line.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.260
In the second graph, plot the
point where he places the nail.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.520
So he wants to place a nail in
the center of the blue line.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.660
The blue line is 6 units long.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.910
The center is right over here.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.070
That's 3 to the
right, 3 to the left.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.360
So he wants to put the nail
at the point x equals 0,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.120
y is equal to 4.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.150
So he wants to put it at x is
equal to 0, y is equal to 4.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.300
That's this point
right over here.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.850
So let's check our answer.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.780
Let's do one more.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.060
Town A and Town B are
connected by a train that

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.280
has a station at the
point negative 1, 3.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.260
I see that.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.290
The train tracks are in blue.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.460
Fair enough.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.955
Which town is closer to
the station along the train

00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:20.130
route, Town A or Town B?

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.860
So they're not just
asking us what's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.020
the kind of crow's
flight, the distance

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.020
that if you were to fly.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.670
They're saying,
which town is closer

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.650
to the station along
the train route?

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.500
So if you were to follow the
train route just like that.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.610
So the A right over here, A if
you were going along the train

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.030
route, you would have
to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.090
6 in the x-direction,
and then 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.080
5 along the y-direction.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.150
So you'd have to
go a total of 11.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.022
If you're going from B, you're
going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:04.438
8 9, 10, 11 along the
x-direction, and then 1,

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:09.100
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so 6 along
the vertical direction.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.040
So you're going
to go a total 17.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.930
So it's pretty obvious that
A is closer along the tracks.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.320
Now, you could also think about
it in terms of coordinates

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.170
because A is at the
coordinate of negative 7, 8.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.390
And if you were to think
about negative 7, 8,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.220
to get from negative
7 to negative 1

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.070
along the x-coordinate,
you're going to go 6.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.130
And then to go from 8 to 3,
you're going to go 5 more.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.097
So you could also not
necessarily count it out,

00:04:39.097 --> 00:04:41.180
you can actually just think
about the coordinates.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.560
But either way, you see
that town A is closer.
