00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.990
There are many things we want to ask of other people we want to ask for a job

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.139
For money a chance to collaborate a kiss

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.569
But generally we don't ask because of the terror of a no

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.499
Why should a no such a small and Innocuous word?

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.549
Prove quite so painful so hard to hear so much something

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.550
We need to avoid that we'd rather die in Penury ignored and unfulfilled than ever hear it

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:35.948
It's because it's not a case of trying not to hear and know what we're trying to do is avoid hearing something quite different

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.510
that we are

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.410
disgusting all of us have access to a

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.570
Disgusting self-image a repertoire of all the most broken flawed

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.678
Embarrassing and weak sides of who we are and it's precisely this self image that is awoken and engaged

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.479
Whenever people say no to us. We're not hearing no

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.739
We'd be fine if we were we're hearing you're an arrogant laughable Jumped-up Delusional clumsy repulsive Pond life

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.709
No wonder we get reluctant to ask

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.430
But in truth of course others are not remotely saying this to us. They can't guess how we're feeling inside

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.569
It's not written on our forehead and most importantly it's not even true

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.679
We've got some tricky sides of course, but so does everyone else. We're a mixture of good and bad like everyone else

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.379
We're okay, and we deserve to exist

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.670
when people say no

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.239
They're not thinking about us here is the only reason why people ever say no

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.080
And we need this emblazoned on Billboard's so we don't forget it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.329
The real reason people say no is that it doesn't fit in with their plans

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.910
They're not thinking about your stupidest deeds

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.529
The Nicknames people called you at school or of what you get up to late at night? That's in your head, not theirs. They are

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.190
Just worried about their plans

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.379
We're losing out on some consoling insights because we're failing to bring our own experience of what we felt when we said no to people

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.229
We said no not because we hated them. We did it for an obvious now repeated reason

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.239
It didn't fit in with our plans

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.940
But here's the key reason to try asking

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.450
We just don't know where people are with their plans

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.399
And we can be sure of this by looking at our own experience when we think about it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.989
There are actually a surprising number of things that we would theoretically give other people if only they asked we would say yes at many

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.320
Surprising points. We'd be ready to give certain people money time kisses if they asked

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.060
But usually people don't ask because they don't know where we are with our lives

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.169
All of us are fundamentally ignorant of other people's plans

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.459
You just can't really tell whether others might say yes or no because we don't have access to their projects and visions

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.399
We're attempting to overcome our lack of data of here closing in a pessimistic direction

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.540
But we should instead simply try to get more data by asking we should respond to ignorance with curiosity

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.739
not despair

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.699
We should remember too that we can survive and know from a distance we feel it would be a catastrophe

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.159
If it were a no from close up, we can be sure we'd shrug it off in three hours

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.759
We're big people now of course as small children

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.539
We were very vulnerable and perhaps adults that know to us at Key moments

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.019
And it hurt and now we're trying not to get hurt again

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.199
But the mind is slow to realize the time we've grown with perhaps six feet tall now

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.160
We have a bank account perhaps a car

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.899
Maybe children of our own you can survivor no and in any case not asking is not cost-free

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.280
We're avoiding the pain of rejection

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.030
But we're settling for something that is more insidious and just as troubling a lack of opportunity

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.950
Not asking life for something means implicitly asking it for something else

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.670
Familiar from the outset and this is especially sad because life is so very short

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.739
What we should really be scared of is not a no but of reaching our deathbeds

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.669
unfulfilled

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.669
We should ask
