improve the state of the world in 2009
 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.240
improve the state of the world in 2009
quite simply I think the answer to that

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
quite simply I think the answer to that
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.029
quite simply I think the answer to that
is yes but you need to be a bit careful

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
is yes but you need to be a bit careful
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.070
is yes but you need to be a bit careful
with the metrics by which you're going

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
with the metrics by which you're going
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.720
with the metrics by which you're going
to measure success if we set the bar at

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730
to measure success if we set the bar at
 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.400
to measure success if we set the bar at
stemming the rising tide of unemployment

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
stemming the rising tide of unemployment
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.160
stemming the rising tide of unemployment
or putting liquidity back into the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
or putting liquidity back into the
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.650
or putting liquidity back into the
banking system then I think it's still

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
banking system then I think it's still
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.600
banking system then I think it's still
far too early to say with any certainty

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
far too early to say with any certainty
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.049
far too early to say with any certainty
that we're going to see those kinds of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
that we're going to see those kinds of
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.369
that we're going to see those kinds of
events in 2009 on the other hand if you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
events in 2009 on the other hand if you
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.229
events in 2009 on the other hand if you
measure this or if to define success as

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239
measure this or if to define success as
 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.569
measure this or if to define success as
improving the relationship between the

then I think the answer is a bit more

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
then I think the answer is a bit more
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.080
then I think the answer is a bit more
easy and perhaps even self-evident I'm

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
easy and perhaps even self-evident I'm
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149
easy and perhaps even self-evident I'm
optimistic that we are going to sow the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
optimistic that we are going to sow the
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.810
optimistic that we are going to sow the
seeds for improvement in 2009 but I'm

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
seeds for improvement in 2009 but I'm
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270
seeds for improvement in 2009 but I'm
less sure that the world will be in a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
less sure that the world will be in a
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.399
less sure that the world will be in a
position to reap that harvest within

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
position to reap that harvest within
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.060
position to reap that harvest within
just the next 12 or 18 months
