00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.310
So let's subtract 286 from 913.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.840
But first I'm going to do it
in a slightly different way.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.950
I've taken each
of these numbers,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.080
and I've expanded them out.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.960
This 9 in the hundreds
place represents 900.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.950
This 1 in the tens
place represents 10.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.580
This 3 in the ones
place represents 3.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.010
Likewise, 286 is the same
thing as 200 plus 80 plus 6.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.666
So let's try to subtract
going place by place.

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.040
So if we start in
the ones place,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.760
we have a problem immediately.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.570
3 is less than 6.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.530
How do we subtract a larger
number from a smaller number?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.520
We also have a problem
in the tens place,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.730
80 is larger than 10.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.610
How do we subtract a larger
number from a smaller number?

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.540
And you might guess the answer
here is regrouping, sometimes

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.414
called borrowing.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.080
We're going to take
value from one place

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.830
and give it to another.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.220
So let's say this
scenario right over here,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.870
where we have this
3, and we want

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.650
to take some value from
one of the other places.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.300
Well, I could take 10
from the tens place,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.519
so then this is
going to become 0.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.246
And if I give that 10 to the
ones place, so 10 plus 3 is 13.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.700
Notice I haven't
changed the value.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.870
900 plus 0 plus 13 is still 913.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.480
Now, this solved the
problem for the ones place.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.812
I can now subtract 6 from 13.

00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:27.020
But it made the problem in
the tens place even worse.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.110
I now have to
subtract 80 from 0.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.580
What do I do?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.990
Well, luckily, I can go
to the hundreds place.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.150
I could take 100 from 900,
so then I'm left with 800.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810
And I could you give
it to the tens place.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.970
So if I give it to
the tens place, then

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.650
this is going to be 100.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.140
Notice this still
adds up to 913.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.730
800 plus 100 plus 13 is 913.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.000
Why is this valuable?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.367
Well, now in every column, I'm
subtracting a smaller number

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:01.950
from a larger.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.200
You might say, wait, isn't
there a positive sign here?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.950
But we have this
negative out here.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.750
So we're subtracting 6 from 13.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.780
We're subtracting 80 from
100, subtracting 200 from 800.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.740
So let's do it.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.260
13 minus 6 is 7.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.210
100 minus 80 is 20.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.520
800 minus 200 is 600.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.170
So we're left with 600 plus
20 plus 7, which is 627.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960
Now let's do the
exact same thing here,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.290
but we're not going to
expand out the numbers.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.590
So 6 is greater than
3, what do we do?

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.460
Well, we can regroup
from the tens place.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.230
We can take 10 from here
so we're left with 0 tens

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.560
and give that 1 ten
to the ones place.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.460
So you give 10 to
the 3, it becomes 13.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.560
But now we have a problem
in the tens place.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.390
How do we subtract 8 from 0?

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.720
Well, we could take 100
from the hundreds place,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.740
so 900 becomes 800, and give
that 100 to the tens place.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.866
So you give the 100 to the tens
place, 100 plus 0 tens is 100.

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:15.215
100 is the same
thing as 10 tens.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.500
And so now we are
ready to subtract.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.340
13 minus 6 is 7,
10 minus 8 is 2.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.510
Remember, this is really 10
tens minus 8 tens to get 2 tens.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.310
100 minus 80 to get 20.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.380
And then finally, we have 800
minus 200 to get 600-- 627.
