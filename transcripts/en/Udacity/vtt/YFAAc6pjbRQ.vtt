00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.740
Well done.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.680
You've made it through to the end,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.170
and you've learned a lot about
prototyping and user reasearch.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.820
Now that you've learned how to iterate,
how to bring on team members and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.850
how to share your project, you're
ready to do the work on your own app.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.219
Remember that this work can be done many
times over to get yourself to a great

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.590
finished product, and that you should
expect to throw out many early versions

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.090
to find one that resonates
with your users.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.600
Once you've done this work, you'll
still need to actually build your app.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.590
But that part of it will go way more
smoothly with this prep work complete.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.400
By listening to users before
you build the app itself,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.410
you can be sure you're creating
a great experience for them.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.800
Now get out there and start prototyping.
