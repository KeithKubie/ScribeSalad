you not only some of the lessons that

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720
you not only some of the lessons that
 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.020
you not only some of the lessons that
I've learned but a little bit about some

don't focus too much on that focus on

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070
don't focus too much on that focus on
 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.950
don't focus too much on that focus on
the sort of lessons that we learned

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960
the sort of lessons that we learned
 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.230
the sort of lessons that we learned
along the way and I'll give you some

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240
along the way and I'll give you some
 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.770
along the way and I'll give you some
anecdotal evidence

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780
anecdotal evidence

years of teaching we had a
 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.240
years of teaching we had a
cailli meeting and we decided one of our

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.250
cailli meeting and we decided one of our
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.210

perhaps you would like to learn how to
 

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.500
perhaps you would like to learn how to
program a computer yeah I'd love to

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:14.510
program a computer yeah I'd love to
 

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.630
program a computer yeah I'd love to
he said fine I'll come back in the

to me there was this program going on

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:47.300
to me there was this program going on
 

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.850
