00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.809
In a previous project I found a free tv and
turned it into a giant solar scorcher. This

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.949
shoots out a deadly beam of sunlight, that’s
hot enough to abuse food, melt metal and burn

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.889
things you probably shouldn’t.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.230
Today seemed like a good day to play with
my Solar Scorcher. I positioned my frame and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.780
found the focal point, then added some concrete
tiles as a base for my projects. Ok, I've

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.659
got power, and I'll test it out with this
piece of wood and when the light makes contact

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.330
I've got instant fire. The sunlight at this
spot is around 2000 degrees Fahrenheit, enough

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.379
to melt this spot of concrete into a glowing
orange liquid. I'm curious to see what I can

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.899
do with all this heat so I've filled a glass
bottle with water and I'll punch a hole in

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.700
the cap. It's incredible to see that the instant
I focus my lens on the bottle, it starts smoking.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.620
Just a few moments later this water is so
hot it's boiling, and I'm a little nervous

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.289
the bottle might blow. Yep, there it goes.
The glass pieces are melting and that's cool,

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.170
but now I want to try this on some food. I'll
get some hot dogs, and when they hit the beam

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.909
they really do get hot. This might be a little
well done for my taste, and I'm still hungry

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.619
so let's try an egg. The egg is actually working
very well. It's so reflective it doesn't burn

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.659
as fast, and even my wife is interested. A
little salt and pepper and it's tempting to

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.049
try a bite. Ok, so I wasn't actually expecting
to eat this, but it looks safe enough, and

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.319
even my kids are anxious to try. Surprisingly,
it's pretty good. Alright, let's see what

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.889
else this will do. I'll try burning a penny,
and, wow, it melted. How about a stack of

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:50.560
pennies? Yep, they're nothing but liquid metal
now, and I'm thinking that slag in the mixture

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.280
must be what's left of the copper coating.
It's only taking about 4 seconds to melt these,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.829
and melting metal is really great, but now
I want to see something burst. I wonder what

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.149
would happen to this egg? It's spewing some
kind of debris and smoking like crazy. I hear

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.679
some little pops and it's even forming some
interesting growths. huh, Look at that. But

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.630
no explosion. How about if I put a pop top
on this bottle of water and let the pressure

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.409
build up? Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.
Let's do that again. The lid is back on, and

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.510
pressure is building. Awesome! Alright, the
sun is setting and I've re-adjusted my A-frame.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.569
I'm just wondering if this would ignite gasoline.
It does. Hopefully it goes without saying

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.200
that this is very dangerous and you shouldn't
try this at home. Well, I'm convinced there's

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.209
an insane amount of power behind these lenses.
If you'd like to see where I got this one,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.099
take a look at my video on how I hacked it
out of an old TV. This one boiled water in

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.720
less than a minute, welded a nickel to concrete,
and instantly torched any piece of wood in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.680
it's way. Well that was fun, but I'm still
hungry so I'll put everything away and go

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.720
get some real home cooking. That's it for
now. If you liked this project, perhaps you’ll

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.489
like some of my others. Check them out at
