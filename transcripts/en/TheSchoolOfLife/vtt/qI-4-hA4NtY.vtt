00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.670
It descends, normally, between around 5pm
and 7.30pm and can be at its height at six,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.010
especially when the weather is turning and
the last of the daylight has burnished the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.800
sky a shade of crimson pink. The Sunday evening
feeling is ordinarily associated with work,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.519
and the idea of going back to an office after
a pleasant break. But this doesn’t quite

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.909
cover the complexity of what is going on:
it isn’t just that we have some sort of

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:33.870
work to do that is dragging down our mood,
but that we are going back to the wrong sort

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.280
of work even while we are in dire ignorance
of what the right sort of work might actually

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.440
be. We all have inside us what we might term
a true working self, a set of inclinations

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.640
and capacities that long to exert themselves
on the raw material of reality. We want to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.030
turn the vital bits of who we are into jobs,
and ensure that we can see ourselves reflected

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.890
in the services and products we are involved
in turning out. This is what we understand

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.719
by the right job, and the need for one is
as fundamental and as strong in us as the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:19.060
need to love. We can be as broken by a failure
to find our professional destiny as to identify

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.549
an intimate companion. Feeling that we are
in the wrong job, and that our true vocation

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.479
lies undiscovered, is not a minor species
of discomfort: it will be the central existential

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.149
crisis of our lives. We normally manage to
keep the insistent calls of the true working

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.869
self at bay during the week. We are too busy
and too driven by an immediate need for money.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.789
But it reliably comes to trouble us on Sunday
evenings. Like a ghost suspended between two

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.170
worlds, it has not been allowed to live or
to die, and so bangs at the door of consciousness,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.630
requiring resolution. We are sad, or panicked,
because a part of us recognises that time

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.560
is running out and that we are not presently
doing what we should with what remains of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.750
our lives. The anguish of Sunday evening is
our conscience trying to stir us inarticulately

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.800
into making more of ourselves. In this sense,
Sunday evenings have a history. Until recently,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.280
the last hundred years or so, there was – for
most of us – no question of our true working

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.150
selves ever finding expression in our labours.
We worked to survive and would be grateful

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.600
for a minimal income. But such reduced expectations
no longer hold. We know – because there

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.730
are enough visible examples of people who
have done so – that we could harness our

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.830
talents to the engines of commerce. We know
that we don’t have to be unhappy in this

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.400
area, which adds a feeling of particular shame
if we still are. We should not be so hard

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.340
on ourselves. We don’t yet have the mechanisms
in place to reunite ourselves with our purpose.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.550
It is in the nature of our working selves
to be both clear in their dissatisfactions

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.900
and yet maddeningly oblique about their real
direction. We can both be utterly sure that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.600
we are not doing what we should while wholly
at sea about our genuine purpose. The answer

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.600
is patience, structure and steadfast intent.
We need some of the discipline of the detective,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.280
or an archaeologist reassembling the pieces
of a smashed jar. We should not dismiss our

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.330
angst blithely as ‘the Sunday blues’,
to be assuaged with a drink and a film. We

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.720
should see it as belonging to a confused yet
utterly central search for a real self that

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.300
has been buried under a need to please others
and take care of short-term needs for status

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.490
and money. In other words, we should not keep
our Sunday evening feelings simply for Sunday

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.600
evenings. We should place these feelings at
the center of our lives and let them be the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.310
catalysts for a sustained exploration that
continues throughout the week, over months

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.010
and probably years, and that generates conversations
with ourselves, with friends, mentors and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.750
with professionals. Something very serious
is going on when sadness and anxiety descend

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.960
for a few hours on Sunday evenings. We aren’t
a bit bothered to have to end two days of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.650
leisure; we’re being driven usefully to
distraction by a reminder to try to discover

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.500
who we really are – and to do justice to
our true talents – before it is too late.It
