00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:11.230
What Makes a Vowel a Vowel and a Consonant
a Consonant

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.660
You already know that vowels in the English
alphabet are a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.560
y, while the rest of the letters are called
consonants.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.070
But did you ever ask yourself why the letters
were divided into two separate groups?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.170
Basically, a vowel is a sound that is made
with the mouth and throat not closing at any

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.170
point.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.640
In contrast, a consonant is a sound that is
made with the air stopping once or more during

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.930
the vocalization.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.280
That means that at some point, the sound is
stopped by your teeth, tongue, lips, or constriction

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.680
of the vocal cords.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.340
The difference explains why “y” is only
“sometimes” a vowel.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.640
Depending on which word “y” is being used
in, it can represent different sounds.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.660
In words like “myth” or “hymn,” the
letter takes on a sound like a short “i”

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.960
and the mouth and throat don’t close when
the sound is made.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.540
However, in words like “beyond,” it acts
as a bridge between the “e” and the “o,”

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.199
and there is some partial closure, making
“y” a consonant.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.509
Another forgotten letter that has the same
qualities as “y” is “w.”

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.890
While “w” is almost always a consonant,
it is considered a vowel at the end of words

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.090
like “wow” or “how.”

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.329
You can see for yourself when saying these
words that your mouth doesn’t fully close

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.979
while pronouncing the letter.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.850
There are, of course, other differences between
vowels and consonants.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.429
For instance, in English you can have vowels
that are entire words, such as “a” or

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:30.429
“I.”

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.109
You won’t see a consonant that is a word
by itself, however.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.909
Words in English need vowels to break up the
sounds that consonants make.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.780
So, while every word has to have a vowel,
not every word has to have a consonant.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.959
There are strings of consonants that are sometimes
written like full words, like “hmm.”

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.450
However, these are just sounds rather than
actual words.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.439
You will also find that most words in English
won’t have more than three consonants in

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.899
a row, because otherwise it gets to be too
difficult for English-speakers to say it.

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.569
There are exceptions, of course—take the
word “strengths” for example, which has

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.170
a string of five consonants (though it only
has three consonant sounds in a row: ng, th,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.170
and s).

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.750
In other languages, like Polish, long strings
of consonants are more common.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.069
Of course, there are also sounds made by consonants
that can be repeated over and over without

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.100
a vowel sound.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.519
If you were to repeat “z” over and over,
like the sound of a buzzing bee, you would

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.430
find that your mouth remains slightly open
and the sound is seemingly unobstructed—so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.720
shouldn’t it fall under the “vowel”
category?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.390
The letter “z,” along with the letter
“s,” actually fall under a subcategory

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.500
of consonants called “fricatives.”

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.709
Fricatives are sounds you make by pushing
air through a small gap in your teeth.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.200
As you can see, the differences between vowels
and consonants are more complex than you were

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.170
probably taught in elementary school.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.510
It’s less about the letters and more about
how your mouth moves when you’re saying

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.720
them.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.060
Ever wonder why “w” is pronounced “double-u”
and not “double-v?”

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.189
The Roman Latin alphabet was adapted to be
used for Old English.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.160
Old English had a “w” sound, but back
then the alphabet didn’t have a “w.”

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.000
Instead, the “v” sound was pretty close,
so words that required a “w” were often

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.799
represented by a “v” instead.

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.439
In the 7th century, scribes started using
“uu” to represent the “w” sound, which

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.829
is how it got its name.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.209
However, printers used to use “vv” to
represent the sound, which is how it got its

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.209
shape.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.270
There are very few words in the English language
that have two u’s in a row, and the only

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.800
two that are used frequently are “vacuum”
and “continuum.”

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.380
Nearly all of the “double u” words were
adapted from Latin, such as “duumvir,”

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.110
meaning “each of a pair of magistrates holding
joint office in ancient Rome.”

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.569
A few are adapted from other languages, such
as “muumuu,” a loose dress that is traditionally

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:54.310
worn 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.530
in Hawaii.
