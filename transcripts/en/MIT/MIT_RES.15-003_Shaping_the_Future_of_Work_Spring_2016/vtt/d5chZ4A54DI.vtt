00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.400
One of the reasons that high
road companies like Saturn

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.040
and others often
don't get carried on

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.220
is that once the founders leave,
the next generation of leaders

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.280
don't carry on the
same practices,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.150
and so the culture goes back to
more traditional organizations.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.650
But there are ways
to address this issue

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.110
by building commitments
to multiple stakeholders

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.150
right into the bylaws
of the corporation.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.950
Let's look at some examples.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.460
We'll consider three
different models.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.050
First, let's talk about what
we call benefit corporations.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.440
Benefit corporations build
right into their charter three

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.820
different objectives.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.470
First, they say they
are going to commit

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.060
to producing results that are
good for their shareholders,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.560
for their employees,
and for the economy.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.690
Secondly, there are
going to consider

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.790
financial and non-financial
considerations when

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.280
making key decisions
that allow them

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.150
to keep the benefits flowing
to all of these stakeholders.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.440
Third, they agree
to be transparent.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.880
They provide annual reports
on their performance

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.280
and their progress in
addressing the interests

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.530
of these multiple organizations.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.940
One of the best known companies
that is a benefit corporation

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.150
is Patagonia.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.390
Patagonia is this very
famous clothing maker.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.120
And its CEO and
founder, Yvon Chouinard,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.790
says, Patagonia is trying
to build a company that

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.530
could last 100 years.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.060
Benefit corporation legislation
creates the legal framework

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.560
to enable mission driven
companies like Patagonia

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.350
to stay mission driven through
succession, through raising

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.810
capital, through
changes in ownership.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.290
In doing so it institutionalizes
the value, the culture,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530
the processes, and
the high standards

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.870
that are put in place
by these founders.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.590
So by doing this we
get some continuity.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.090
In fact, 22 states
now allow companies

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.290
to incorporate as
benefit corporations

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.000
within their boundaries.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.520
And we have, at this point,
about 786 such companies.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.990
Another option is
employee ownership.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.430
You've probably heard the term
ESOP, employee stock ownership

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.320
programs.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.160
Well, employee
ownership companies

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.240
build a commitment to being
successful financially

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.070
both for traditional investors
and for employee owners right

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.040
into the structure and
governance of the firm.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.910
Employees often
have representatives

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.560
on the corporate
boards of directors,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.380
but the key to success
of these companies

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.870
is to make employees feel
like owners by building

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.460
a culture of engagement, of
ownership, of encouraging

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.970
employees to make
suggestions for improving

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.820
the operations in
the performance

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.570
of the organization,
and therefore aligning

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.770
the incentives
through condensation

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.820
and through the culture
of the organization.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.360
So employee ownership companies
have spread across the country.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.480
There are about 10,000 of them.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.130
And you can find them almost any
industry that you can think of.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.490
The key to employee
ownership, though,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.230
is to make sure
employees are involved,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.230
and to also worry
a bit that they

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.190
don't to put all of
their financial resources

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.890
for retirement into
the same company.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.610
You also want to
spread your investment

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.680
a bit so that you don't come
up short if the company happens

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.350
not to be as successful
as you would like.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.750
There are other kinds of
companies call cooperatives.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.040
A cooperative is
a company that has

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.440
lots of owners that pool their
resources to get some job they

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.250
all need done done together.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.490
So if you happened
to grow up on a farm,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.990
you may have been part
of a milk cooperative

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.000
where farmers pool
their resources

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.420
and create a dairy to take the
milk from their dairy cows.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.870
There are sawmills in Oregon.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.200
Here in Cambridge we have
the MIT coop and the Harvard

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.190
cooperative society, bookstores
that sell books and reference

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.339
material and clothing to our
students and to our faculty.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.600
And then there's my
favorite cooperative,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.100
as my tie suggests, it's
the Green Bay Packers.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.410
Green Bay Packers are a
community own football

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.880
team started in the 1920s.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.150
And how else could you have
a city, Green Bay, Wisconsin,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.690
with only about
100,000 residents

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.460
sustain a very successful,
highly competitive, and often

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.750
championship football team
for all of these years?

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.690
It's because they are
owned by the community

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.550
and they can't be sold
to some higher bidder who

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.880
might make a profit off of it.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.690
You'll also see
some cooperatives

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.860
in other countries.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.410
Probably the most famous
one is the Mondragon set

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.410
of industries, headquartered
in the Basque region of Spain,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.550
with companies that range
from manufacturing, to retail,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.490
to high tech, to
financial institutions.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.040
They have over 81 different
companies at the moment.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.260
So we can build organizations
in different kinds of ways.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.160
And so the takeaway
lesson that I

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.250
hope you will have here
from this conversation

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.150
is that it's possible.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.000
If you are imaginative,
perhaps you

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.780
can invent the new
forms of organizations

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.260
for the future that will
meet the needs of all

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.840
of their stakeholders,
and will be built to last

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.550
for multiple generations.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.070
And in doing so, not only might
you build organizations that

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.630
work for investors,
customers, and employees,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.570
but maybe ones that help
to sustain our planet.
