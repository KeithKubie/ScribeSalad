00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.670
Working together Anya and
Bill stained a large

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.930
porch deck in 8 hours.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.920
Last year Anya stained
the deck by herself.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.550
The year before Bill painted it
by himself, but took twice

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.350
as long as Anya did.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.770
How long did Anya and Bill take
when each was painting

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.960
the deck alone?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.060
So let's define some
variables here.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.440
Let's define A.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.619
Let's define A as number
of hours for

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.310
Anya to paint a deck.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.770
And so we could say that
Anya paints, or has A

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.800
hours for one deck.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
Or we can invert this and
say that she can do

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.910
1/A decks per hour.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.420
Now, let's do another variable
for Bill just like that.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.470
Let's define B as the
number of hours for

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.730
Bill to paint a deck.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.710
And so for Bill, he can paint--
it takes him B hours

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.530
per deck, per one deck.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.440
We could put it over
1 there if we want.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.710
We don't have to.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.650
And this is the same thing as
saying that he can do 1 deck

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.220
per every B hours.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.890
Or another way to think
of it, is he can do

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.280
1/B deck per hour.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.970
Now, when they work together,
Anya and Bill stained a large

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.280
porch deck in 8 hours.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.320
So let's write this down.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.850
Anya plus Bill-- I'll
do it in orange.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.490
Anya and Bill.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.640
This information right here.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.759
Anya and Bill stained a large
porch deck in 8 hours.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.410
So we could say 8
hours per deck.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.510
Or 8 hours per 1 deck, which is
the same thing as saying 1

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.150
deck per 8 hours.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.640
And this is going to be
the combination of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.000
each of their rates.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.020
So this 1 deck of per 8 hours,
this is going to be equal to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:44.290
Anya's rate, 1/A decks per
hour, plus Bill's rate.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.150
Plus-- do that same color.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.880
Plus 1/B decks per hour.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.540
So we have one equation
set up.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.870
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.360
And I won't write the
units any more.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.050
We have 1/8 is equal
to 1/A plus 1/B.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.910
Now, we have two unknowns, so
we need another equation if

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.820
we're going to solve these.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.200
Let's see.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.450
It tells us, it tell this right
here the year before

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.120
Bill painted it by himself,
but took twice as

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.350
long as Anya did.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.160
So the number of hours it takes
Bill to paint the deck

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.720
is twice as long as the number
of hours it takes Anya to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.560
paint a deck.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.360
So B is equal to 2A.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.260
The number of hours Bill takes
is twice as the number of

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.010
hours Anya takes per deck.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.340
So B is equal to 2A.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.250
So we can rewrite this equation
as-- I'll stick to

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.140
the colors for now.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.660
We could say 1/8 is equal
to 1 over Anya.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.650
Instead of writing 1 over Bill
we would write, so plus 1 over

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.460
Bill is 2 times Anya.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.210
The number of hours Bill takes
is two times the number of

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.970
hours Anya takes.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.290
So 2 times Anya.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.050
And now we have one equation
and one unknown.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.170
And we can solve for A.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.150
And the easiest way to solve for
A right here is if we just

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.040
multiply both sides of
the equation by 2A.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.890
So let's multiply both
sides of this by 2A.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.920
Multiply the left side by 2A.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.380
Actually, let's multiply both
sides by 8A, so we get rid of

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.630
this 1/8 as well.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.610
And then multiply the right-hand
side by 8A as well.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.050
The left-hand side, 8A divided
by 8 is just A.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.060
A is equal to-- 1/A times 8A
is just going to be 8.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.340
1/2A times 8A.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.930
8A divided by 2A is 4.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.930
So A, the number of hours it
takes Anya to paint a deck--

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.290
and I made it lowercase, which
I shouldn't have. Well, these

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.650
should all be capital A's.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.270
This is A is equal to
8A over A is 8.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.810
8A over 2A is 4.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.390
So the number of hours it takes
Anya to paint a deck, or

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.050
A, is 12 hours.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.300
Now what are they asking
over here?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.940
They're asking, how long did
Anya and Bill take when each

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.810
was painting alone?

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.650
So we figured out Anya.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.100
It takes her 8 hours.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.360
And then we know that it takes
Bill twice as long as Anya.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.170
Bill is two times A.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.120
So bill is going to
be 2 times 12.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.020
So Bill is equal to 2 times
Anya, which is equal to 2

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.350
times 12 hours.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.190
Which is equal to 24 hours.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.430
So when they're alone it would
take Anya 12 hours, it would

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.720
take Bill 24 hours.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.580
When they do it combined,
it takes 8 hours.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.710
Which makes sense.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.200
Because if Bill took 12 hours
by himself, combined they

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.940
would take 6 hours, they would
take half as long.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.690
But Bill isn't that efficient.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.840
He's not as efficient as
Anya, so it takes them

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.590
a little bit longer.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.560
Takes them 8 hours.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.590
But it makes sense that combined
they're going to take

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.920
less time than individually.
