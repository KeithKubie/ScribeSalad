00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.330
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning,
and welcome to Talks at google

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.060
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.260
Today, it's my great pleasure to
introduce Dr. Angelo Volandes.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.850
He joins us today to discuss his
new book, "The Conversation-- A

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.640
Revolutionary Plan
For End-of-Life Care."

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.170
Dr. Volandes believes
that a life well

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.210
lived deserves a good ending.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.550
Through the stories of seven
patients with very different

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.870
end-of-life experiences,
he demonstrates

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.830
that what seriously
ill people who

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.670
are approaching the
end of their lives

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.560
need most is not
new technologies,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.270
but one simple thing,
"the conversation."

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.880
He argues for a
radical re-envisioning

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.420
of the patient-doctor
relationship,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.660
and offers ways for
patients and their families

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.360
to talk about this
difficult issue

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.960
to ensure that patients
will be in charge

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.300
of their medical care.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.270
Dr. Volandes is a
physician and researcher

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.820
at Harvard Medical School
and Mass General Hospital.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.400
He's the Co-founder of Advanced
Care Planning Decisions,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.950
a nonprofit organization devoted
to encouraging the conversation

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.810
through the use of videos.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.875
Please join me in
welcoming Dr. Volandes.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.250
ANGELO VOLANDES:
So good morning.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.250
Thanks a lot for coming.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.590
I really appreciate it.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.700
It's a real privilege to present
some of the work that I do,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.720
and especially here at
Google, because you all

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.980
tackle some of the most
difficult problems facing

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.200
our society.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.880
And what I'm going
to talk about today

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.280
is what I feel is the most
urgent problem in health care

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.780
today.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.740
So maybe you can help
me think about it.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.560
When we asked most people
where do they want to die,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.925
where do they tell us?

00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:56.550
AUDIENCE: Home.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.950
ANGELO VOLANDES: Home.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.040
Most Americans want
to die at home.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.560
In fact, in the latest
survey, 86% of Americans

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.910
want to die at home,
surrounded by their loved ones,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.919
and in comfort.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.310
But what are the facts?

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.806
Where do most people die
in our country today?

00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:13.760
AUDIENCE: Hospitals.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.210
ANGELO VOLANDES: Hospitals.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.440
People over the age
of 65, 2/3 of them

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.280
will die in a
hospital or nursing

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.820
home, often tethered to a
machine and in a good deal

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.080
of pain and suffering.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.200
This misalignment between the
type of medical care people

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.150
want and the type of
medical care they end up

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.350
getting in our health
care system today

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.860
is what I feel is the most
urgent problem in health care.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.760
Now, you've all been
reading about it.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760
On the front page of
"The New York Times"

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.940
there's been a story
about the problem.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.810
And we usually talk about
it in terms of cost.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.800
Yes, end-of-life care
is, indeed, costly.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.270
But by the end of
our time together, I

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.410
hope to throw in two other
phrases, two other lenses

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.960
from which to
understand this problem.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.230
When Americans get
care in hospitals

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.500
that if they were more
informed they would not want,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.120
let's call it for what it
is-- it's unwanted care.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.150
And when people get unwanted
care in our health care system

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.950
today, it's truly
a medical error.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.760
It's no different than
a surgeon operating

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.710
on the wrong side of the body,
or an ICU doctor not following

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.180
a checklist for a patient
on a breathing machine.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.180
But we don't want to
just talk about problems.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.860
What are some
potential solutions?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.800
For me, I feel that
the primary reason

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.480
why people get unwanted care
in our health care system today

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.930
is because doctors are not
slowing down, sitting down,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.110
and having the conversation--
an honest and frank discussion

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.080
with patients and family members
about what's important to them.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.900
But, you know, today we live
in a visually-literate society.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.790
We're a YouTube generation,
and that's true of all ages.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.540
And sometimes words
are not enough.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.579
Sometimes we need images to
help people better understand

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.709
their options.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.300
So I'm also going
to talk about how

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.110
to enhance those
conversations with videos.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.390
But before I get
started, I thought

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.280
I'd begin with a story-- this
is, after all, a book reading.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.460
Meet Professor Helen Thompson.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.940
Helen Thompson was one of
the foremost literary critics

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.440
on the poetry of Walt Whitman.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.640
How many of you are
familiar with the poetry

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.240
of Walt Whitman?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.320
Great.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.640
So there's definitely a
generational gap there.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.690
I was born and bred in
Brooklyn, New York-- you'll

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.740
hear my accent occasionally--
where Walt Whitman spent

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.480
the first half of his life.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.340
So every other street corner
had a Whitman Elementary School,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.270
and all the pupils
were forced to memorize

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.110
the opening lines of
Whitman's magnum opus,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.040
"The Leaves of Grass."

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.860
So Professor Thompson
and I hit it off

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.440
because we could both
recite those lines.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.390
"I celebrate myself
and sing myself.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.070
And what I assume
you shall assume,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.710
for every atom belonging to
me as good, belongs to you."

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.570
Now, you may be
asking yourself why

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.430
I'm telling you about Helen
Thompson or the poetry of Walt

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.480
Whitman.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.720
Well, what I haven't told
you is that Helen Thompson

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.180
was my patient a few years ago.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.760
What I haven't told you
is that Helen Thompson

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.120
was a 56-year-old female with
brain cancer being admitted

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.220
to my hospital service.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.110
What I haven't told you is
that Helen Thompson was dying.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.110
And so I conducted a history.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.150
I did my physical exam.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.860
And then I got to
that point where

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.400
doctors get a little
bit uncomfortable with,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.170
where the words of Whitman
metamorphosed into other words.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:14.550
Words like CPR, ventilators,
the ICU, goals of care, hospice.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.790
In other words,
the vocabulary of

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.410
shared decision-making
at the end of life.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.040
And I looked at the professor
and I said, "Professor,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.360
you've seen scores
of doctors since you

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.460
were diagnosed, and by the
time that you're seeing me.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.610
Have you ever had the
conversation with them?"

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.800
And she gave me
that blank stare.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.430
And so I proceeded to
ask her those questions.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.210
What's important to you?

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.370
What's a good day for you?

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.740
Where did you want to spend
whatever remaining time you

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.960
have?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.221
Where are you on this
journey with your illness?

00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:52.470
And then she looked at me
and give me that blank stare

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.250
that I think a lot of
patients give doctors when

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.270
they have this conversation.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.390
And so I naively asked
her, I said, "Professor,

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.420
would you take a walk with
me to the Intensive Care Unit

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.840
so I can actually show
you some of these things?"

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.230
Of course she obliged.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.910
We didn't walk to the ICU.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.760
I put her in a wheelchair
and rolled her down

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.950
to the Intensive Care Unit.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.340
I got to show her a ventilator.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.096
I got to show her a patient
on a breathing machine.

00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:22.720
There were a couple
of residents there.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.430
One was performing
a lumbar puncture,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.070
another one was
inserting a central line.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.280
And what the professor
was able to do

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.250
was to get a sense of the
place-- hear the beeps

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.860
and buzzes, see the
colorful monitors,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.860
to feel the rhythm of
the Intensive Care Unit.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.240
Now, as fate would have it-- I
obviously did not plan on this,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.970
but there was a code blue in
the ICU while we were there,

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.670
and I immediately brought her
out of the Intensive Care Unit,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.430
but not before she caught
a few glimpses of CPR.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.370
When we went back to her
room, she looked at me

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.260
and said, "Words, words, words.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.030
Angelo, I understood
every single word

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.090
that you said before.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.000
CPR, breathing
machines, comfort care.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.680
I am, after all, a
professor of English.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.150
But I had no idea that's
what you were talking about.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.210
It doesn't look like
that on television."

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.740
And that's when
it occurred to me,

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.580
so often health care, we're
having these conversations

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.110
with our patients
and family members,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.070
but they're thinking about
what's on the television

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.480
and that CPR works all the
time, and that everybody

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.370
looks like George Clooney
on a breathing machine.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.179
The clinical reality
is very different.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:45.240
So what I decided to do was to
take my next six patients, all

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.350
with a serious illness,
and their families

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.970
on their own personal
tour of our hospital.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.090
Some patients I brought to
our Intensive Care Unit.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.680
Other patients and families I
brought to our dialysis unit.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.970
And what every
person told me was

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.880
that this was the most powerful
and empowering experience

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.320
that they had ever had.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.030
That they couldn't
imagine making

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.460
a decision about end-of-life
care without this tour.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.500
Now, although the
nurses loved what

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.070
I was doing-- they could see
the educational value in it--

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.560
they quickly put an end
to my tour business.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.450
Because they knew I was breaking
patient confidentiality.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.580
So here's the conundrum
that I was left with.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.590
How could I recreate this
powerful and empowering

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.140
experience for both
patients and families,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.860
and yet not break
patient confidentiality?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.960
And that's when I came
up with the idea--

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.650
why not create short films
to help people better

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.240
understand their options.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.830
So it's not just me.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.250
It's a group of
around 100 of us.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.400
We are 100 doctors,
nurses, patients, families,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.190
and video artists from 10
academic medical centers

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.150
who create these short videos.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.490
But we don't just
create them, we actually

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.450
study them in rigorous,
randomized control trials.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.800
And there's three
things that we find.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.520
First, for patients who
have a serious illness

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.940
and watch a video, they're more
informed about their options.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.090
They have much more knowledge
with which to understand

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.830
their medical options.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.720
The second thing
is that for people

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.450
who have a serious illness
who have a conversation

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.390
and use a video,
they actually tend

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.160
to want more
comfort-oriented care.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.230
They make decisions
that lead them

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.240
to end-of-life care
outside of the hospital,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.770
not tethered to
machines, and not

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.280
in our Intensive Care Units.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.740
And the third thing is
when we asked people,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.550
are you comfortable watching
a video about goals of care

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.720
at the end-of-life, people are
overwhelmingly comfortable.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.830
We truly are a YouTube
generation where

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.130
people expect these images.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.160
If a picture speaks
thousand words,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.880
videos speak hundreds
of thousands of words.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.470
So what I thought I'd do is
show you one of our studies.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.020
And it was actually our
first study done right here

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.800
at Massachusetts General
Hospital with patients

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.250
who had advanced cancer.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.940
So what we did is we
took 50 patients, all

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.640
with advanced cancer, and
we randomized the group

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.650
into two groups.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.880
The first group had
a verbal discussion

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.990
about what sort of medical
care they wanted now

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.320
that they had advanced cancer.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.950
We asked them, what
would you want now

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.920
that you have advanced cancer,
and we gave them three options.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.780
The other half of the group
had the same verbal discussion,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.650
but then they saw a short
video that actually showed them

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.950
what each of their
goals of care entailed.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.840
Now, I know most of you
are not clinicians, but let

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.310
me just give you the general
flavor of the goals of care.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.410
This is available
anywhere in America today.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.420
You generally have
three options.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.510
Life-prolonging care, limited
care, and comfort care.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.620
And I'll briefly
review each one.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.200
With life-prolonging care,
the goal is to prolong life.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.720
It includes anything available
in a modern day hospital--

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.520
CPR, breathing machines,
the Intensive Care Unit.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.780
The middle category,
limited care,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:27.700
is essentially hospitalization
without the ICU, without CPR.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.050
And the third
category, comfort care,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.890
is essentially symptom relief,
really hospice level care.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.610
So those are the options
that all 50 patients had.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.850
But for the patients that
were randomized to the video,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.790
they got to see
visual images of each

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.310
of those categories of care.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.100
Now, the particular video that
we created for these patients

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.960
was a seven minute video, and
it was filmed and developed

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.810
with an expert panel
of over 50 oncologists,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.210
intensivists, palliative
care doctors, nurses,

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.710
social workers, chaplains,
patients with advanced cancer,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.000
and the families of patients
with advanced cancer.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.320
We wanted to make
sure that we offered

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.970
a fair and impartial
portrayal of what

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.360
the options were for patients.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.720
Now, dealing with 50 people,
we bent over backwards

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.110
to make sure that we
addressed everybody's concern.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.770
But you know the joke about
getting a bunch of oncologists

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.110
together and asking them
an opinion on a patient,

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.960
you'll get 50
different opinions.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.110
This video took us
two years to make.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.370
Steven Spielberg makes probably
five films in two years.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.080
But we wanted to make sure that
patients and providers felt

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.430
that this was a fair
and impartial portrayal.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:55.200

-I'm Angelo Volandes, a
Physician at Harvard Medical

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.490
School.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.370
Thank you for taking the time
to read "THE Conversation."

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.710
It's been a privilege
caring for patients.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.110
Thank you for hearing their
stories and bearing witness.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.600
In this video I'll be
covering some of the topics

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.490
that I touch on in
the book, so make

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.840
sure to refer to the book for
more details and information.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.080
Talking about medical
care at the end of life

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.380
can sometimes be
difficult, but it doesn't

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.470
have to be a sad conversation.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.640
There's a common three-step
approach to do it well.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.620
The three steps are
start the process

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.740
and have the conversation.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.990
Talk to your loved
ones about your values

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.720
and what's important to you.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.000
And then talk to
your health care team

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.270
about your medical choices.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.130
Let's review each
one of these steps

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.490
so you can make sure you get
the right care at the right time

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.960
and on your own terms.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.980
Don't wait for your doctor
to start the conversation.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.490
Start the discussion on your
own with family and friends.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.240
Here are four questions that
can help start the process.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.390
What kinds of things are
most important to you?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.080
What concerns do you have
about getting sick or needing

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.250
medical care?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.850
If you were very sick, are there
any specific medical treatments

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.350
that might be too much for you?

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.120
And finally, what
are your spiritual,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.180
philosophical, religious,
or cultural beliefs

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.250
that would influence
your medical decisions?

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.400
Considering these questions
is only the beginning.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.240
These reflections are not a
one-time event, but a process

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.030
that you should
return to over time.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.180
After you've thought about
your values and wishes,

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.513
it's important to share your
information with your loved

00:15:44.513 --> 00:15:45.110
ones.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.130
Holidays are a good time to
start having these discussions

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.570
with the people you
would want to be around

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.700
if you became very sick.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.947
Pick a calm and
quiet place to talk.

00:15:54.947 --> 00:15:57.030
The talk doesn't have to
have a certain structure,

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.900
let it just happen.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.650
And you don't need to
establish everything

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.750
with one conversation.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.330
After the conversation
I often tell my patients

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.400
to use their cell phone or
tablet to film themselves

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.920
telling their loved ones what
is most important in their lives

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.670
regarding medical care.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.380
They can then send
the video to them.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.130
And if you are ready,
complete the appropriate legal

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.520
paperwork.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.370
Now you're ready to complete
the last step, talking

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.495
with your health care team.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.130
Talking with your
doctor is vital,

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.970
since he or she will know
your medical condition best

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.440
and will be able
to help translate

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.134
your preferences into an
actionable medical plan.

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:42.550
There are three
general approaches

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.590
to medical care for
people who are very sick.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.710
They are life-prolonging
care, limited medical care

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.850
and comfort care.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.850
The first approach is
life-prolonging care.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.880
With this option the
focus is to lengthen life.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.280
This includes all medical
care that is available

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.470
in the hospital like
CPR, breathing machines,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.750
and treatments in the ICU.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.609
For healthy people, CPR has
a good chance of success

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.290
and has improved over time.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.260
However, for people with
an advanced illness,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.069
CPR's overall
effectiveness is not high.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.480
It's important to
ask your doctor

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.760
what the chances are that CPR
will work in someone like you.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.420
Sometimes people decide to try
life-prolonging interventions

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.320
for a short period of time.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.680
And if the interventions
are not successful

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.910
they move to the next
option, limited medical care.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.110
With limited medical
care, the focus

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.860
is to take care of
treatable problems.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.890
People who choose this
approach want medical care that

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.560
will help restore their health.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.990
My father received
limited medical care.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.710
He had IV medications
with careful monitoring.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.430
But he did not want any
life-prolonging interventions

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.200
like CPR and breathing machines.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.380
He chose to avoid
these procedures,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.770
even though he might
have died without them.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.380
The third approach
is comfort care.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.860
With comfort care, the main
goal is to be comfortable.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.090
Treatments are only used if they
help make people feel better

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.649
and improve their
quality of life.

00:18:22.649 --> 00:18:24.440
People who choose this
approach are usually

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:30.160
treated at home, in hospice,
or sometimes in a nursing home.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.590
Talk to your doctor
and your loved ones.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.290
If you let them
know your choices,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.960
they can help make
sure that you are

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.950
at the center of and in
control of your care.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.830
Thank you for taking
this journey with me

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.650
and hearing the lives of
some extraordinary people.

those 50 patients, what

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.200
were their decisions?

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.320
So let's take a look
at the group that

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.500
only had a verbal discussion.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.870
In yellow we have
life-prolonging care.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.910
In blue we have limited care.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.540
And in green we
have comfort care.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.180
So why don't you take a guess
of what you think people wanted.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.455

people in the verbal arm felt?

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:26.371
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

ANGELO VOLANDES: What percentage
wanted life-prolonging care?

00:19:32.716 --> 00:19:34.470
AUDIENCE: About 65%.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.210
ANGELO VOLANDES: 65% wanted
life-prolonging care.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.230
This is what we found.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.060
26% in yellow wanted
life-prolonging care.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.030
52% in blue wanted limited care.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.180
And 22% wanted
comfort-oriented care.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.950
I'll be honest.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.420
I admit these patients to
the hospital all the time.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.130
I wasn't surprised by this.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.110
The patients that I admit to the
hospital with advanced cancer,

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.340
I'd say a quarter want
life-prolonging care,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.830
a quarter want
comfort-oriented care.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.790
Half the people are
somewhere in between.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.400
Well, what happened to the group
that actually saw the video?

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.290
The gentleman with the green
t-shirt, what do you think?

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.162
AUDIENCE: A sharp
decline in life

00:20:16.162 --> 00:20:20.245
prolonging care and shifting
down to comfort care,

00:20:20.245 --> 00:20:25.730
so call it 10, 40 and 50.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.580
ANGELO VOLANDES: A sharp
decline in life prolonging care,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.910
an increase in comfort care,
10% life prolonging care,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.340
40% limited care, and
the rest comfort care.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.465
Well, let's take a look at
what our patients chose.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.790
A dramatic difference.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.150
The interesting thing was that
the people who saw the video

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.280
also had more knowledge.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.550
We actually quizzed them
and they answered many more

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.940
questions correctly after
watching the video compared

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.690
to patients who did
not watch the video.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.650
So what this told us was
if you saw the video,

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.380
you had more
knowledge and you were

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.040
more likely to choose
comfort oriented care.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.690
Now to be clear, when we have
verbal discussions today,

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.600
what happens?

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.780
Most people still end up
dying in our hospitals.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.220
2/3 of folks are dying
in our hospitals.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.190
That's what's going on today.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.630
But can we imagine a time when
people are more informed, where

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.660
they had the
conversation, they have

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.200
a video that explains
their options

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.430
and standardizes the process.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.860
What happens then?

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.600
Most people die outside
of the health care system,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.200
surrounded by their loved
ones and in comfort.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.030
This is the medical emergency of
our lifetime in the health care

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.440
system today.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.950
We are delivering unwanted
care every single day

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.860
in our hospitals and nursing
homes across the country.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.990
It's a medical error.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.670
So this study was done close
to the seven, eight years ago.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.270
Since then we've
done many studies

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.690
and the interesting thing is
we're seeing the same things.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.400
So I'm just going to give
you a quick glimpse of what

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.290
some of our other work shows.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.590
We asked 200 elderly
people what sort of medical

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.260
care they would want if they had
advanced Alzheimer's disease.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.750
And we did the same study.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.440
Randomized control trial.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.370
Half of them had a
verbal description.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.940
The other half had a verbal
description plus saw a video.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.800
Here's what the group that
only had a verbal description,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.340
this is what they told us.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.960
19% wanted life prolonging care.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.220
17% wanted limited care.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.580
And 64% in green
wanted comfort care.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.360
What happened to the group that
had the same verbal description

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.600
and then saw a video?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.020
A very different
picture emerges.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.330
86% of people wanted
comfort oriented care.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.220
We even went to a
primary care clinic

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.840
and did the same
study asking people,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.010
if you had a serious illness,
what sort of medical care would

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.960
you want?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.410
In the group that only
had a verbal discussion,

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.530
72% of people wanted
comfort oriented care.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.280
Add the video and
all of a sudden, that

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.110
jumps up to 91% of people.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.940
Not a single person
wanted aggressive life

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.680
prolonging care.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.760
We even went to nursing homes.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.360
And this is something really
near and dear to my heart

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.940
because I'm not
only a doctor, I'm

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.980
also a son who's dealing
with this with his parents

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.226
as we speak.

00:23:35.226 --> 00:23:36.850
So let's take a look
at a nursing home.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.780
Same study.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.464
Half of people were
asked, how do you want,

00:23:40.464 --> 00:23:41.630
what are your goals of care?

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.546
How do you want to spend
the end of your life?

00:23:43.546 --> 00:23:45.650
In a skilled nursing
facility, right here--

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.650
these were two facilities
right here in Boston-- 57%

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.810
wanted comfort oriented care.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.920
What happens when
people actually

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.730
watch a video that explains to
them what their options are?

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.730
That number increases to 80%.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.370
But even that wasn't enough.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.730
We went to our medical ICU right
here at Massachusetts General

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.980
Hospital and we asked,
not the patients

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.130
because they were
too sick, in fact,

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.040
all the patients were intubated.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.550
They were on a
breathing machine.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:18.440
So we asked their families
to make a decision about CPR.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.570
And these were all
critically ill patients

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.420
who had a terminal diagnosis.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.020
And this is what
the families told us

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.580
about CPR when we described
to them the procedure.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:33.370
78% of people in red wanted CPR
attempted on their loved ones.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:37.440
What happens when you actually
show people what CPR involves?

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.570
That number drops to 41%.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.470
We live in the
health care system

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.350
that does not do a good
job of communicating

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.390
with patients and families.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.530
And we've now done trials
in over 2,000 people

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.145
all across the country.

00:24:53.145 --> 00:24:55.590
But it's not enough
to show that people

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.100
are more informed
with videos or to show

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.050
that they make decisions
about comfort oriented care.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.300
You have to show that people
actually like the videos.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.790
So we asked all
2,000 subjects, what

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.240
did you think about the video?

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.470
This is what people told us.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:15.276
90% of people who viewed
the video found it helpful.

00:25:15.276 --> 00:25:17.150
But were they comfortable
watching the video?

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:21.760
93% of people were very
comfortable watching the video.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.570
And then I think the
gold standard question

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:27.310
as a doctor is asking my
patient who has seen the video,

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.390
would you recommend
this to your mom or dad

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.840
or to a sibling who has to
make a similar decision?

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.310
97% of people said they would.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.880
When did 97% of patients
ever agree on anything?

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.110
These are really high
numbers, as you can imagine.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.260
I think it just
speaks to the fact

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.070
that we are a visually
literate society.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.350
Our patients and families
are now expecting this.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:56.510
So I could have stopped
and done my research.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.510
I would've gotten on my
way to getting tenured

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.640
at Harvard Medical School.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.180
Wonderful.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.810
Sit on my derriere at
Massachusetts General Hospital.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:09.010
But our group didn't want
to just make publications.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.050
We didn't want to have this
work really just in libraries

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.320
and read by a bunch of doctors.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.340
We are interested in
transforming health care.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.690
So three years ago,
I co-founded along

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.190
with another colleague who's
both a doctor and a lawyer,

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.010
we co-founded a
nonprofit foundation

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.310
whose mission is to transform
health care across the country

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.110
by using videos.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:38.900
And as of today, there are
200 hospitals, clinics,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.910
nursing homes, hospices,
and health care systems

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.790
across the country
in nearly 25 states

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:50.620
who use our videos to
transform the medical culture

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.740
in their health care system.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.220
Think Khan Academy
but for medicine.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.080
And it's probably the
most exciting work

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.880
that I do because for
too long we've just

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.530
been talking about the problem.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.380
We haven't been posing
solutions to what

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.760
to do about this unwanted
care in our health care system

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.740
today.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.260
Now our library of
videos has exploded.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.200
We have over 60 videos
because we not only make

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.790
videos for the leading
causes of death,

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:23.680
cancer, heart failure, dementia,
but also in all the languages

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.080
that represent our
diverse community.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.710
So we have videos and Spanish,
Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese,

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.710
Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog,
Ilokano, Marshallese,

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.020
even Samoan because
what we're trying to do

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.400
is to meet people
where they're at.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.320
Our latest series of videos
are actually in Persian

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.790
because we found a great
need in the Persian community

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.260
to actually make sure people
understand their options.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.380
But I know we're at Google
and it's all about data.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.020
So we are also
interested in big data.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.710
And what we wanted to ask
is do these videos actually

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.200
make a large difference?

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.100
Sure, you could try to attack
200 hospitals and clinics

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.290
across the country,
but what about

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.090
an entire geographic area.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.300
So our nonprofit is
now involved in one

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.320
of the largest
projects in America

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.420
when it comes to
end of life care.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.320
And what we've decided is
to blanket an entire state,

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.350
the wonderful Aloha
state of Hawaii,

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:29.640
where all 1.4 million
residents have access

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.680
to all of our videos.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.370
Over the course of three
years-- we're about halfway

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.160
through-- every single
resident of Hawaii

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.090
has access to the videos.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:44.220
15 hospitals, 50 skilled
nursing facilities, 10 hospices,

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.260
over 600 providers,
regardless of your insurance,

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.330
regardless of where you're
seen in the entire state,

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.550
you have access to a
video, in your language,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.390
that will allow you to
understand your options.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.720
And what we're doing is
using very large databases

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.710
to see, over the course
of three years, what

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.010
happens to hospitalizations.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.550
What happens to the number
of deaths in the hospital?

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.420
What happens to number of days
in the ICU before people die?

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.720
And we're going to use those
metrics to see, can a video

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.510
and prioritizing the
conversation at an entire state

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.010
wide level, can you really
transform health care?

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.190
We've already started
getting the data

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.370
and I'm pleased to
say that indeed, we're

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.010
seeing transformation already.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.900
In fact, four other
very large states

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.940
are interested in replicating
what we're doing in Hawaii.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.750
Because that's what
this is all about.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.720
It's making sure
that patients get

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.860
the right care at the right
time, but on their terms.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.110
Today, although we say we live
in a patient centered health

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.750
care system, I think
many of you know

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.810
we don't live in a patient
centered health care system.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.240
We live in a clinician
centric health care

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.010
system, where people
end up getting

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.320
"care," that if they were more
informed, they wouldn't want.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.030
Now before I end, I
thought I would tell you

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:16.730
about my own journey
to this work.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:20.420
And so I thought I just
take a 10 minute book

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.190
reading, since we are
at a book reading,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.900
of telling you about
my very first patient.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.690
Taras Skripchenko was a living
part of American history.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.970
As I later found out, Taras
was an ethnic Ukrainian

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.050
who had emigrated to the United
States from the Soviet Union

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:40.820
as an adolescent.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.520
He was one of the
lucky few who escaped

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.570
the chaos that took over during
the months before World War II.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.630
Taras wanted to start over,
to rewrite the opening

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.190
chapters of his life.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.840
At 18, he found a new home
in a Ukrainian enclave

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.470
in one of the mining
towns of Appalachia

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.490
and quickly found labor
in the coal mines.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.660
For years he led a life of
unremitting physical toil,

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.850
working 12 hour shifts,
six days a week.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.580
Unfortunately for Taras,
a lot of the detritus

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.940
from smashing coal
dug its way deep

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.240
into the lining of his
lungs, plugging the airways.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.050
It would also plant the creeping
cancer that would devastate him

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.070
decades later.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.430
This once hulking
mine worker had

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.770
dwindled to a mere whisper
of his former muscular self.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.180
This frail,
bed-bound 78-year-old

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.470
with inoperable lung cancer was
admitted to my medical service

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.660
during my first year
of residency training.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.940
Slowly suffocating to
death, he experienced

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.420
both transient moments
of hallucinatory

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.240
joy and unconscious,
yet peaceful somnolence

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.180
on the oncology ward.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.630
Taras was too confused to
have a lucid conversation

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.820
and lacked family members to
guide his decision making,

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.680
so his medical plan was
the default approach

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.480
for all patients.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.740
Do everything.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.630
Despite my efforts to come
up with a plan for Taras,

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.010
I knew that his cancer
surely had a plan of its own.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.320
Doctors can fool
themselves into thinking

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.950
that they are in charge, even
when disease and pathology are

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.570
in the driver's seat.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:39.280
Frequently, we are only
along for the ride.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.360
Taras was dying.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.920
I knew it and the
nurses knew it.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.790
But as far as the medical
team was concerned,

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.820
Taras was a full code.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.290
If his heart or lungs
stopped working,

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:56.070
we would attempt CPR and place
him on a breathing machine.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.880
Exhausted from a long day, I
paged the overnight resident

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.440
to meet me in the cafeteria
to review my patients before I

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.850
signed out.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.770
The overnight doctor was a
senior resident named Edward

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:11.370
and I was glad an
experienced resident was

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:12.880
on call that night.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.760
I told the resident
to keep a close watch

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.700
on Taras Skripchenko.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.520
He's a Ukrainian gentleman.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.970
He worked in the coal
mines of Appalachia.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.410
About eight months ago,
he started having a cough.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:29.100
He saw as primary care doctor
who ordered a chest x-ray.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.720
Stop right there, Edward said.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.820
Start again.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.590
Start with initials
and then in one line,

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.300
give me the pertinent info.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.590
Less is more.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.990
I have 30 other patients
to cover tonight.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.990
When a resident is responsible
for 30 patients at night,

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:50.780
too many personal details
can muddle one's thinking.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:56.340
TS is a 78-year-old male patient
with metastatic lung cancer who

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.750
presented with shortness
of breath and delirium,

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:03.130
I said, he's really sick.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.960
Modern medicine
can be dehumanizing

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.320
and the first step
in that process

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.030
is to remove all the
individualized details.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.280
To obliterate personhood
and replace it

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.889
with patienthood, where
two letters are a patient's

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:25.110
diagnosis, treatment,
and prognosis.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:25.889
Code blue.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.280
Code blue.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.340
Edward and I sprinted
towards the oncology ward,

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.940
racing through the
obstacle course

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.810
of stretchers and patients.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.420
We finally arrived, out of
breath, at Taras's room.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.300
I was always taught
to hope for the best

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.159
but prepare for the worst before
entering a patient's room.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:48.130
But it's not always clear
how to define the worst.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.920
The gathered nurses who
had ordered the code blue

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.630
had already started CPR.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.070
I clumsily jammed my hands
into a pair of rubber gloves

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.330
and joined the
ritual, relieving one

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.620
of the nurses doing
chest compressions, which

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.770
is far more physically
demanding and brutal than what

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.940
is portrayed on television.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.530
My clasped hands pressed hard
against Taras's frail chest

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.080
and all I could here and feel
were the cracking of his ribs

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.800
with practically each
chest compression.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.160
The rhythmic pumping on his
chest eerily emitted a coarse.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.460
Velcro like sound.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.820
Edward stood at
the foot of the bed

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.770
and took charge,
directing what was

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.200
likely to be Taras's
passage from life.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.070
I searched for a
pulse on Taras's neck.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.740
Any fat had melted
away long ago and all

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.230
I could feel was
cartilage and wind pipe.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.500
It's an eerie feeling,
sliding bloody gloved fingers

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.760
along the skin, searching
for signs of life.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.180
Shockingly, I found
only a thready pulse,

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.550
one that lacked vigor.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.580
Taras was stabilized.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.530
He was connected to
a breathing machine

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:01.020
and had a pulse with
a normal rhythm.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.150
The team had saved
the patient and now it

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:07.290
was time to transfer
him to the ICU.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.260
Edward and I bundled Taras
and his machines onto a gurney

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.000
and navigated the labyrinth
of hallways to the elevator.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.380
We squeezed into
the narrow elevator.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:22.070
As the doors closed, I kept my
hand on Taras's carotid artery,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.610
making sure to feel
for a pulse until I

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.000
realized he no longer had one.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.270
There was no space
alongside the gurney,

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.950
so I jumped on, straddled
him, and started

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.280
performing chest compressions.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.200
In all likelihood, the cancer
had spread to the thin sack

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.260
around his heart, allowing
blood and fluid to seep in

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.830
and surround the vigorously
pumping heart muscle.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.410
To get the heart
beating again, a doctor

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:53.450
must emergently stick a large
needle into the patient's chest

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.550
and draw out the fluid.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.920
We needed to move fast.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.860
Do you feel
comfortable doing this?

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.160
Edward asked.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.180
I told him that I had
performed the procedure

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.650
on a cadaver in anatomy
class, but I'd only

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.300
seen one on a patient.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.910
See one, do one, teach one.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.750
Here's your chance
on a warm body,

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.180
he rejoined, as
the elevator doors

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.820
opened to a crowd of
nurses ready to wheel

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.890
the patient towards the ICU.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.830
I descended from the gurney.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.650
Edward handed me a large
syringe, attached to a needle

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.730
the length of my ring finger.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.590
I stared at the needle.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:32.530
My hands were shaking,
not surprising

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:36.720
since I was about to poke around
a man's heart with a needle.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.930
You don't know how deep to
slide the needle into the body

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.060
in order to draw out the
fluid from the sac surrounding

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.150
the heart.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.730
Every body is different.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.510
Some are fatter
than others and some

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.110
are more muscular than fat.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.580
I pierced Taras's skin
just below the sternum

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.150
and carefully pushed the
needle through the skin,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.270
simultaneously pulling
back on the syringe,

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.540
hoping to see fluid.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.730
No luck.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.860
The tremulousness in my hands
worsened and beads of sweat

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.410
trickled down my forehead,
falling onto the syringe.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:16.200
I advanced the needle a
little more, but no luck.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.320
I pulled needle out and tried
again and again and again.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.800
By the fourth time, I gave up.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.790
Residents are usually
allowed three strikes

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.030
before being asked to stop.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.100
Edward gave me a fourth
since this was my patient.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.870
I probably should have
stopped after the third.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:44.750
Taras's ribcage had become a pin
cushion from all my attempts.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.130
As soon as we entered
the ICU, Edward

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.260
filled in the medical
team as they took over,

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.720
using the ultrasound machine to
remove the liquid surrounding

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.040
his heart.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.670
Taras's once flailing
heart could beat again.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.060
He had a pulse.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.430
Taras's care was now being
managed by the ICU team,

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.310
so Edward and I headed
back to the cafeteria

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.120
to grab some coffee.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.460
After every code blue,
the team is expected

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.710
to review what transpired.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:19.590
It's a ritualized moment
to grapple with the trauma

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.490
surrounding a full on code.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.360
Debriefings are always
difficult moments

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.140
as each of us dials down the
rapid pace of a code blue

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.090
to digest the events that
have just transpired.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.900
We sat quietly
for a few minutes.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.080
We reviewed the
running of the code,

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.400
how each team member had
performed his or her duties,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.470
we replayed each of
the interventions

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.570
I had performed and
discussed how I could improve

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.080
my technique for the next time.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.070
Silence settled again once
the routine items were out

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.240
of the way.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.270
But there was more to be said.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.930
We just completed
by the book code

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.330
but I wonder if we
did them right thing,

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:05.940
I said, needing to tell
Edward what was on my mind.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.500
Perhaps it was because
I was a young doctor

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.610
and I had not yet been numbed to
the brutal experience of caring

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.380
for hundreds of patients.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.300
I hoped Edward, a
more seasoned doctor,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.990
would have a better perspective.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.020
We did exactly what
we were taught to do.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.670
Everything was by the book.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.950
Look, this is the system.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:29.700
We have a job to do, he said.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.570
But I could see a slight
unease in his face,

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.570
a hint of upheaval.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.770
We both knew something
was not right.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.300
I can't believe we
just did all that

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.070
to a man who has one foot
in the grave, I pushed,

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.700
not mincing my words.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.310
Would he have
wanted any of this?

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.400
Would you have
wanted any of this?

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.130
Would you do this to your dad?

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.410
Something is wrong
with a health care

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:59.130
system that puts terminal
cancer patients through torture.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.590
Edward put a hand
on my shoulder.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.030
It's going to be all right.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.640
You're still new at this.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.370
You'll get used to it.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.420
Get some sleep and
page me tomorrow.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.460
Get used to this?

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.130
Is one supposed to
get used to this?

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:18.870
Over the next two
days, Edward and I

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:21.980
followed Taras every
few hours in the ICU.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.020
He was no longer our
patient but we could not

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.640
let go of him either.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.400
By the following morning,
he had a tube or catheter

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.420
in almost every
part of his body.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:38.550
A grand total of eight plastic
intrusions, Taras was fixed.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.730
Doctors like to tackle
problems and fix them.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.730
And it is truly amazing
what modern medicine

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.180
has achieved in a relatively
brief span of time.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.470
The tougher issue,
however, is when

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.700
to recognize that the
small fixes do not

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.800
change the larger picture.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.510
To recognize that fixing
specific problems may not

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.770
fix the whole patient.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:05.510
This is medicine's
version of not seeing

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.200
the forest for the trees.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.320
Doctors always search
for the next fix.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.620
But we need to know when to
use or not to use our growing

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.220
toolkit of fixes.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.750
Taras's heart had
stopped three more times

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:27.520
and miraculously, the ICU team
had brought him back each time.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.240
But not surprisingly, a
patient in the late stages

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.440
of terminal cancer
succumbed to his disease.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.900
Whatever the next new
fixes, nature eventually

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.810
takes her inexorable course.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:47.030
Taras died 48 hours after
that initial code blue.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:54.350
Americans receive some of the
best health care money can buy.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.610
They also experience some of the
worst deaths in the developed

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.050
world.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.240
The primary reason we
experience such horrible deaths

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.850
is doctors' failure to
openly discuss medical care

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.290
with seriously ill patients.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:16.590
Taras Skripchenko
died 15 years ago.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:21.330
I have since witnessed
hundreds of deaths

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.760
but his, which I experienced
during the formative years

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.640
of my medical
residency, haunted me

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.310
for the first decade of my
life as a young physician.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.820
So too did that
conversation with Edward,

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.630
as we both struggled to
make sense of the drama that

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.670
had just unfolded before us.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.680
Today I am a full
fledged medical doctor,

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.260
a senior physician,
and teacher of others,

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.560
yet I still think about Taras
each time I meet a new patient.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:01.275
A new beginning, a clean
slate, but also a potential TS.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.220
Thank you very much.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.974
So we have allowed
some time for Q&amp;A.

00:44:14.974 --> 00:44:16.390
And what I was
encouraged to do is

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.870
to have you come on
up to the microphones

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.440
because this is being recorded.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.610
Yes.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you for doing
this very important work.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.750
I could ask a lot of
questions but let me ask one

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:32.700
about data, basically.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.860
I am interested in
how you're actually

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:41.940
measuring the outcomes of
your video intervention.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.230
In the first series of
studies you described,

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.060
you described those
as randomized trials

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.220
but the outcome you were
measuring there was simply,

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:56.240
as I understand it, just
that people then told you

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.840
what they would prefer.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.900
Now in your Hawaii study,
which you mentioned,

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.560
obviously a much
more massive study,

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.590
you clearly are aiming to
measure actual outcomes

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.200
in terms of what kind of
care these people got,

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.940
but from the way
you described it,

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.520
it sounds like you're using
more of an epidemiological model

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.630
that there is not a
randomization component there.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.490
So I'm curious about
how you're going

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:24.090
to extricate the effects
of your intervention

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:25.370
from all the other stuff.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.340
Are you just going to use
standard statistical techniques

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:32.930
to do that or do you have an
actual randomized component

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.510
somewhere where you're
actually looking

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:39.610
at what the outcomes were and
not just what people told you

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:40.990
at the end of the studies.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.781
ANGELO VOLANDES: What
a wonderful question.

00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:45.550
I wish I had more time to tell
you about all of our studies,

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.210
but let me tell you about three
that address that exact point.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.680
So just last week a
study was published

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.440
in the "Journal of General
Internal Medicine" where

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.780
we not only looked at
what people told us,

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.760
we actually looked at
what happened over time

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.550
through the electronic
medical record.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.790
And we found three things
which were fascinating.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.310
Again, same thing,
randomized control trial.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:08.820
Half of people got the
usual care at our hospital.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:12.260
The other half of people had
usual care plus the video.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.130
And we actually found
the following abstracted

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.000
from the electronic
medical record.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.970
People actually
made real decisions

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.930
after watching
the video that was

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:25.450
for not having the aggressive
life prolonging interventions.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:29.160
The other thing we found, what
there was actual documentation

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.750
of doctors having
the conversation

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.030
and stating that they
had the conversation.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.550
Written documentation.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.860
But we went even
one step further.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.550
We actually followed
people for one year

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:44.870
and what we found was that
patients in both arms,

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:49.840
the first group that did not
watch the video-- I forgot

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.050
the number of people, maybe
40 or something people--

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.960
were readmitted to the hospital.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.410
And what we found was
that 22% of people

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:00.760
ended up getting an intervention
that they never wanted,

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.610
that they actually told us.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.560
What percentage do
you think in the arm

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.390
that saw the video got
something that they didn't want?

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.300
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.880
ANGELO VOLANDES: 2%.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.200
And that person was
actually someone

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.620
who had a procedure done and
it was temporarily reversed.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.220
So what we have
for the first time

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.780
is hard data of real decisions
of people showing exactly

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.590
what the previous study shows.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:30.510
But that's not enough.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:31.051
I'm with you.

00:47:31.051 --> 00:47:33.390
That's a small study
at two hospitals.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.860
What we're doing in
Hawaii is the next step,

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.050
which is we're doing
a natural experiment.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:41.030
We actually know when
we started in Hawaii

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.570
in terms of the videos.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:46.180
So what we're doing at time 0
when the videos were started

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.680
and we know the
penetration rates.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.360
It's not like all of
a sudden everybody

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.030
and Hawaii is
watching the videos.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.880
It's graduated over time.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.700
So over the course
of three years--

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.160
three years is our
point-- at that point,

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.070
we're actually going to compare
hospitalization rates, hospital

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:04.430
deaths, ICU deaths,
chemotherapy in the last life,

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:09.200
compared to three years
before we started in Hawaii.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.740
Furthermore, we know what's
going on in the state.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.610
So we will account for those
through statistical methods.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.970
But even that is not enough.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:20.660
Our biggest project today,
which I didn't mention,

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.800
is looking at a randomized
cluster trial, which

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.530
is called a pragmatic trial.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.700
This is all fancy words of just
saying, instead of randomizing

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.990
by the unit of the patient,
why not randomize 600 nursing

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.300
homes all across the country.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.490
Half of the nursing
homes get usual care.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.550
That data is collected through
a large database called MDS.

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:47.050
And then the other
half of nursing homes,

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.430
the other few
hundred, will actually

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.010
get to use the videos
after being trained

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.530
and however they wish.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:57.090
And what we're going to
do is to see over time

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.240
those hard outcomes
that we talked about.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.990
That's truly the
randomized control trial

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.300
that you're asking about.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.220
But we've moved beyond
the data that I've

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.720
shown which is more of what do
people tell us to hard data.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.990
What happens.

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.660
Because we feel that this
work will truly transform care

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.010
where using large
databases now we

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.760
have the opportunity to do that.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.260
And I should mention that the
nursing home study is actually

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.390
funded by the NIH, the
National Institutes of Health.

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.570
Thank you for that
great question.

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:27.700
Yes.

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.380
So when you talked
about the video

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:38.410
showing the comfort
level, when you

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.910
talk with people in
nursing homes about that,

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.590
how does that-- they're in
a nursing home, which is not

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:46.645
at home with family and things.

00:49:46.645 --> 00:49:48.200
Do you adjust that?

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.820
Or how is that
presented to them?

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.320
ANGELO VOLANDES:
Wonderful question.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.160
And in fact, we
developed a video

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.050
for that study with the nursing
homes, just on this point.

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:59.114
People don't realize just
because you live in a nursing

00:49:59.114 --> 00:50:01.030
home, in a skilled nursing
facility, if you're

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.860
a resident there, what is the
assumption of most people?

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.300
I get sick, I'm going to
go back to the hospital.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.202
That's not true.

00:50:08.202 --> 00:50:09.660
There are many
things that could be

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.450
done focused on quality of
life and comfort oriented care

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:15.140
right there in the nursing home.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:19.110
And so people actually do have
the option of hospice care

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:20.890
at a nursing facility.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:23.260
It's one of the
newer waves of what

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.490
we're seeing in skilled
nursing facilities

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:27.530
because let me tell
you, as a doctor

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.800
and what I see here all
the time is the revolving

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.360
door of the hospital.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.030
We get a frail
elderly person who's

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.570
admitted to the nursing home.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.610
No one has had the conversation.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.840
No one has started
the process of talking

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.470
with the family, what's
important to them,

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:45.130
what do they want to focus on.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:48.070
And as soon as they
get a fever, as soon

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:50.680
as they become
delirious, they're just,

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.890
and I hate to use the word--
shipped to the hospital.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:55.720
Call 911 at the nursing home.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.140
The ambulance comes.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.010
Nobody has asked the patient
or the family what they want

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.840
and they're brought
to the hospital.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.180
That fix that we do in
the hospital, antibiotics,

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.220
get the patient back
to where they were,

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.110
and then they're shipped right
back to the nursing home.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.950
It happens thousands
of times a day.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:15.050
And it's because in
nursing facilities,

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:17.090
we're not having
the conversation.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:19.640
No one's explaining to people
what their options are.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.390
And that's that sort
of disruptive nature

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:22.490
of the videos.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.735
The idea behind the videos is
that today, I'm the doctor,

00:51:25.735 --> 00:51:27.174
I have all the power.

00:51:27.174 --> 00:51:28.590
If we're going to
talk about this,

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.700
it's only because
I raise this issue.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.090
And most of the time, I'm
not raising this issue.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:36.360
What we're hoping the videos
do is empower patients

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.454
and families so they know
what their options are.

00:51:38.454 --> 00:51:40.120
So that they know
what are the questions

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.720
they should be
asking themselves.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.490
This way we're not relying
on the health care system

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:45.930
to bring up these questions.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.550
Patients and families are
bringing up this question.

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:50.300
And, in fact, that
study that I mentioned,

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.110
what we found was that
patients indeed were asking

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.930
their doctors, hey, I
just saw a video that

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.530
mentioned my options for care.

00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:59.410
I want to talk
about this with you.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.490
I have much more
faith in relying

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.050
on patients and families
to raise this question

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.240
by empowering them
with videos than I

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.200
do on the health care system.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.970
It's disruptive because
it flips the power dynamic

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:13.240
and I hope that the video,
which is on YouTube,

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.410
it's at theconversationbook.org.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.890
I hope that people use
it to empower themselves.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:19.965
Yes.

00:52:19.965 --> 00:52:21.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you
also for your work.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:22.757
Four really short questions.

00:52:22.757 --> 00:52:24.631
ANGELO VOLANDES: Four
really short questions.

00:52:24.631 --> 00:52:25.510
Let's go one by one.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:26.343
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:27.590
Where can we get the videos?

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:29.220
Can we get them online?

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.655
Two does it make a difference--

00:52:30.655 --> 00:52:32.280
ANGELO VOLANDES: So
the first question,

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.240
theconversationbook.org.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.180
It's a short video.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.740
It tells you through all your
questions and your options.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.010
Your second question.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.530
AUDIENCE: Is the video without
the conversation as effective

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:43.120
as the video with
the conversation?

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.453
ANGELO VOLANDES: Great question.

00:52:44.453 --> 00:52:46.490
What we've done in
all of our studies

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:49.740
is not only done the
video in isolation.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.200
This is meant to supplement
"The Conversation."

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.990
So it's always been
Conversation, Conversation

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.950
plus video.

00:52:55.950 --> 00:53:00.780
And I truly feel that at the end
of the day, videos are a tool.

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.680
The answer and the solution
is having that conversation

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.740
with your clinician.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.490
It's just that videos help
spark the conversation

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:08.494
as we saw in our study.

00:53:08.494 --> 00:53:11.160
AUDIENCE: But you don't have any
data on whether the video alone

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.800
is as effective or close to.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.610
ANGELO VOLANDES: So we don't do
that intentionally because we

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.844
don't want people to
say, I could envision,

00:53:18.844 --> 00:53:20.760
my worst nightmare, what
keeps me up at night,

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.340
is a surgeon-- I hate to
say surgeon-- who says, hey,

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.200
go watch this video.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.380
Tell me what you want.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:26.590
I don't want that.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.240
I got into medicine because
I love talking to patients.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.860
I hope my colleagues
feel the same.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:31.720
Your other question.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.261
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:32.261 --> 00:53:35.110
The third question is
so do you routinely

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:37.410
have the conversation
at the revolving door

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:38.425
now in your practice?

00:53:38.425 --> 00:53:40.740
ANGELO VOLANDES: In my
practice, absolutely.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.800
And what's remarkable is
that it's not just me.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.550
I'm proud to say that not only
in our health care system,

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.990
but all around the
country, what we see--

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:50.490
and this is the
work that the profit

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:52.930
does-- is people are
making this routine.

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.990
It's changing the
culture where part

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:57.340
of the responsibility
of being a good doctor,

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.340
a good clinician, is not only
asking what medications are you

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.220
on, what are your allergies,
and your past medical history,

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.110
but let's sit down and talk
about honoring and respecting

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:08.217
your choices if you
have a serious illness.

00:54:08.217 --> 00:54:09.050
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:11.800
And the last question is
did Edward change his mind

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.490
about following the book?

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.950
Did he question the book ever?

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:19.030
ANGELO VOLANDES: So that's
a wonderful question.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.590
Edward is a dear friend of mine.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.640
Edward and I have both grown
through that experience.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.180
In fact, part of our subsequent
code because we had many codes

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.800
together, Edward and I looked
at each other and we said,

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.090
you know what, we're both
committed to changing health

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:37.660
care.

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:39.740
And I'm very happy
to say that Edward

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.780
is one of our big supporters
in our nonprofit work

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.680
and actually has transformed
care in the city that he's at.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.240
Thank you.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.050
AUDIENCE: You talked
about measuring

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.780
the effects this has on
what choices people made

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.280
and figuring out whether those
choices are followed through

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:56.910
on.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:01.390
Did you also measure how
that actually affects

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.300
length of life,
quality of life, how

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.089
their friends and family feel
about what happened, and so on.

00:55:06.089 --> 00:55:08.130
ANGELO VOLANDES: Yeah,
what a wonderful question.

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.880
So we are actually now,
with our other studies,

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.260
looking at those very
important questions.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:17.660
What was the bereavement
experience for the family?

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.700
We often focus what's happening
on the patient but remember,

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.300
when the patient dies, it's
the family that experiences

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.800
that moment over and over.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.590
So we are looking at things
like anxiety and depression

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:34.140
on family members, what we call
the bereavement experience.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.840
And the other ones
that you wanted?

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.800
AUDIENCE: What effects
it has on the patient's

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.987
both length of life
and quality of life

00:55:40.987 --> 00:55:42.570
and how they feel
about what happened.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:43.695
ANGELO VOLANDES: Wonderful.

00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:47.680
So we actually are
looking at survival.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.220
Slowly we're seeing research.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:53.200
In fact, one of the
big papers on this

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.430
came out in Mass General
Hospital and my colleagues

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:57.320
there, where they
looked at people

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.880
who chose early hospice care.

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.050
And what they found
in a randomized trial

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:04.470
compared to people who did
not choose hospice care,

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:08.070
was they actually lived longer.

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:09.430
That's a new finding.

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.590
And that's something
we are publicizing.

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:13.030
And what's happening
is-- this is

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:14.720
what we think is
going on-- people

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.719
actually live longer when
they feel that they're

00:56:16.719 --> 00:56:18.220
in control of what's going on.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:22.880
But going to the hospital
might be bad for you.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.780
Medical errors that we
have in our health care

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.800
system, whether it's infection
rates or procedures that

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.160
are performed on people who
are critically ill, actually

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.800
might lead to earlier deaths.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.760
This is a very
controversial thing

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.610
that we're trying
to publicize about.

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:43.110
And we tell people, do you
know that in numerous studies

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:45.470
now, people who choose
more comfort oriented

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:48.660
care with a life limiting
illness actually live longer.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.200
And so we are looking at
that with our studies.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.990
What happens to survival rates?

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:56.530
What happens to those
600 nursing homes?

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.740
What happens to folks
who decide I'd rather

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.030
stay in the nursing home.

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:05.360
I'd rather not get CPR or not
get aggressive life prolonging

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.410
interventions.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:07.700
I want aggressive care.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.760
But I want aggressive
care focused on my quality

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.320
of life and comfort.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.390
We'll be following
that and it's really

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:17.760
transforming what's going
on in health care today.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.260
Thank you.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.260
Yes.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.660
AUDIENCE: You stopped
short of any discussion

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:26.410
of actually assisting patients
in their death process.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:27.610
Can you discuss that issue?

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.430
ANGELO VOLANDES: Why does
this question always come up?

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:30.800
AUDIENCE: Because there's
always someone like me.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.880
ANGELO VOLANDES: There's
always someone like you.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.590
OK.

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:35.990
So let's be clear.

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:38.840
The book's about
advance care planning.

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.640
It's about what affects every
single person in our country

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.590
today.

00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:44.320
It's about making
sure we're honoring

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.680
and respecting people's wishes.

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:50.380
The issue of-- I'm going to call
it for the variety of things--

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.780
today it's aid in dying.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.300
Euthanasia, passive
assisted suicide,

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:59.430
whatever phrase you
want to call it,

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:01.700
is something
incredibly different.

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.160
I'm not a policy wonk.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.740
I don't understand
all the issues.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.890
But I will say two things
because this issue,

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:12.800
this question always comes up.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.010
It's complicated.

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:16.570
It's really complicated.

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:21.030
And I will say first, in
our health care system

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.490
today, for the vast
majority of Americans,

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:28.950
we are not meeting their
needs for suffering and pain

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:31.450
and control of their illness.

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:34.010
And so the amount
of resources that we

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.910
have for hospice and
palliative care services

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:40.640
across the country is
clearly inadequate.

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.070
And so I'm really
focusing on trying

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:46.700
to make sure we have those
resources because the question

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.160
that I always have is if
we actually meet people

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.780
where they're at, if we actually
gave them control to not

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.120
be in pain and suffering, where
they feel that they are truly

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.930
at the center of care, I feel
that a lot of the issues that

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:04.340
come up during the debate about
aid in dying will disappear.

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.410
That's my personal opinion.

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:10.590
But I think the issue of aid
in dying is so complicated.

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:11.930
I'm not an expert on that.

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:13.180
I don't cover it in the book.

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.320
I'm sorry.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.860
But I try my best to make
sure that people understand

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:21.140
that we do a horrible job
in health care today on just

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.640
meeting people where
they're at when

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.889
it comes to end of life care.

00:59:23.889 --> 00:59:25.430
Because it's not
just-- even though I

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.240
call it end of life care,
it's not end of life care.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.320
It's about good care.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:29.970
It's not about a good death.

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:30.972
It's about good life.

00:59:30.972 --> 00:59:31.930
We're all going to die.

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:33.240
I'm going to die some day.

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.220
And every good life
deserves a good ending.

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.890
So that's where I
want to meet people at

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:40.950
and I know that's an
unsatisfactory answer.

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:42.970
I'm asked it all the time.

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:44.610
And I try not to
deflect it too much

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:46.610
but I think it's complicated.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:50.200
I honor and respect
people who debate

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.280
with me about this
question because I think

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.930
every patient has a story.

00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:55.800
And I've been on
this book tour now

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.360
for a few weeks and
there's a lot of pain

00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:59.360
and suffering out there.

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.660
And it's patients but
it's also family members

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.740
and everybody deserves
to have their voice.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.240
We're just hoping
"The Conversation"

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.827
and the videos help everybody
have a voice at the table.

01:00:09.827 --> 01:00:10.660
Thank you very much.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.790
I really appreciate your time.
