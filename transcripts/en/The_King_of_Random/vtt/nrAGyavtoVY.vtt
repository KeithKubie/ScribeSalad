00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
Dang that was awesome. Hey, what's up guys welcome back to the workshop in honor of the holidays

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.489
I thought it'd be fun for this video to jump back into some pyrotechnics

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.380
Now if you saw yesterday's video you'll remember that we tried taking fireworks and dipping them into liquid, nitrogen

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.889
And we had some very interesting results this one here was one of the casualties

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.820
It is a six shot aerial firework that shoots flaming balls

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.910
No joke now only one of these things actually went off

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
Which means the other five are still packed loaded and ready to go so for this video?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.689
I thought it'd be fun to repurpose these into some other kind of improvised

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.009
Pyrotechnic to celebrate freedom the inspiration for today's project comes out of the comments from Andrea flowers who says for the fourth of July you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.010
Should try and make homemade fireworks, so we're kind of doing that today, Andrea?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.230
And we're doing it for you now for this experiment. There are some inherent dangers that we should probably discuss first namely

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.059
We're dealing with pyrotechnics that means we want to have some kind of fire suppression system nearby in this case

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.000
I've got a 20 pound

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.180
Co2 tank if anything happens at all this sucker should be able to put out our fire because this liquid carbon dioxide

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.539
And it won't make a mess

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.069
I've also got some cardboard down on the table to help us clean up the mess a little bit easier

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.709
And I'm also using these black rubber gloves to help suppress any static electric shock because when dealing with black powder the last thing you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.489
Want is to have it go off prematurely now? Here's the basic idea of our experiment today?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.559
We're going to take these aerial shells that didn't fire yesterday

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
and we're gonna crack them open and salvage the black powder and the sparkly stars inside and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.099
Transfer them all into one large container like this you probably recognize these things these are the shells that come inside

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.000
Kinder surprise eggs, and I brought these ones back with me after my last trip to Canada

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.000
So first things first, let's go ahead and crack these things open and see just how much powder we're actually working with

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.039
All right guys cracked open five aerial shells and that's what we've got some good fine black powder

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.320
Some of these little round balls there are stars

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.569
Those are the things that make it crackle and pop when it explodes

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.080
And we've got a couple of Kinder Surprise

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.330
Egg containers that we can use we could go with a small one and fill it completely full or it can fill at the bottom

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.239
Section of the bigger one and in this case I think bigger is gonna be better

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.789
So let's just go ahead and do it even though it won't be completely full

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.599
Okay, so guys quick update. I've gone ahead, and I've made the transfer

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.959
This is our five Ariel shells transfer it into the big Kinder Surprise egg

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.029
But unless it really doesn't take up much of the volume at all

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.720
We've only got about three-quarters of an inch of a layer on the bottom there just for good measure

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.160
I'm gonna take all these extra pink fuses here that didn't get used I'm gonna throw those in as well

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.099
But now the question comes what do you think would work better one of these things filled up completely full of powder or one of?

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.268
These things that would just filled up three quarters of an inch now since we have it. I'm going bigger

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.979
I'm going to just put this top on drill a small hole on the top and stick a fuse down inside then we can take

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.980
This thing outside and light it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.659
Beautiful so here. We are guys

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.779
We have our Kinder Surprise egg with a nice fuse coming to the top and inside it's packed with black powder and Ariel shale stars

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.129
for one final effect

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.819
I think will be fun to wrap this up in a little bit of

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.419
Aluminum foil that would just allow the reaction to build up a little more pressure before it explodes should make it that much more exciting

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.840
Success guys

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.159
we have done it we put on about three layers of aluminum foil the idea being it will hold things together a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.030
Fraction of a second longer helped build a little more pressure, this is the moment of truth?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.259
This is where we find out what our improvised celebratory firework. Looks like let's head outside

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.369
So here we are guys. We just stepped outside to test this thing out. It is broad daylight

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.609
I know this would work a lot better at night. We'd see a lot more effect. However

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.269
I don't really want to store this thing in my house for the rest of the day, so we're gonna set this thing off

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.729
We're gonna see how it reacts and we're gonna do it in slow-mo

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.179
I've been saying this a lot lately that this project is about to be lit

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.860
Wow

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.009
Dang that was awesome crackly ball explosion boom crackle spark fantastic. Let's go see the damage. Oh

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.068
Oh the kinder egg is actually on fire the plastic is burning if you look down inside there

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.139
You can see there's a hole right in the bottom

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.799
Where all that gunpowder was it's absolutely shredded the tinfoil here. This looks like layers of lettuce just peeled back

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.409
And you can see how soft

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.449
This plastic is right now

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.169
It's on fire. It's very hot it's gonna pull that out

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.969
Try not to let it stick to my fingers, but look at that that is going down in no time flat

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.550
That was a pretty cool show

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.810
Where did the other part go whoa that thing is completely melted now. It is just melted down to a little puddle of plastic

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.099
Which is really interesting it almost looks horrible like could you take a Kinder Surprise?

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.489
Egg plastic melt it down and repour it into something else

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.359
That might have to be we try it in a future video because that looks

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.949
Very interesting there's our this lid doesn't have a whole lot of damage

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.189
You can see where the fuse went in it kind of burned that hole and made a little bit bigger

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.629
But other than that it just popped right off the top. It's really intact. It's just a little bit warm

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.079
It's a little bit flimsy not quite as hard as it typically is when it's cool

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.000
So you can definitely see it was weakest at the top the top blew off. That's burning my fingers oh

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.579
Let's go ahead and fold that in on itself to put out the flames

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.179
Now we can cool this thing down and dispose of our garbage

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.919
If you look down the road where this thing was you can see the different spots. Where all the sparkle balls went off

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.019
They actually left little scratch marks on the asphalt

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.069
Very typical of what you'd find from a normal fireworks show as well

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.028
The interesting thing is some of them leave a gray ash and some of them are a little bit darker

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.089
Not sure what the difference is, but that's going to come off with one rain falls disappear completely

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.339
It's slo-mo time. Let's see we got so here's what's interesting the top of the cap goes flying off

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.949
We got a big fireball that stretches out in both directions

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.249
You can see little tiny sparks flying off to the upper right corner

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.800
and

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.250
Then it turns into this giant mushroom cloud that just starts building out white smoke if you look down at the bottom

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.209
Now you can see flames shooting up and all these little tiny crackly balls

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:01.349
Just start sparking, which makes it look very very majestic that right there looks absolutely fantastic. It's great. I don't know how you describe

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:03.349
It's very magical

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.759
Flashes of light all over the place, and if you look down at the bottom

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.279
Those flashes are going crazy sparks everywhere

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.929
And of course at the end here all we're left with is a giant white cloud hovering at the top of the frame

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.060
So that was pretty cool all right guys

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.960
I'm calling that a success and here's why

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.380
We used kinder surprise eggs as the containers and filled it up from all the powder from our aerial shells that didn't ignite

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.579
We stuck a hole in the top insert a fuse and wrap the whole thing in aluminum foil to get a little bit more durability

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.009
Then we lit it off in the middle of the street in controlled

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:33.568
Circumstances and even though we test it out here in broad daylight the results were still fantastic

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:36.479
We saw explosions fireballs mushroom clouds

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.429
We saw sparks flying in every direction and pops and crackles going off which were very very satisfying

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.979
And a big shout out to Andrea flowers for suggesting homemade fireworks for the 4th of July Andrea go check your youtube inbox

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.419
I'm sending in 25 bucks now of course I do have to step in here and say that fireworks manufacturers

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:55.859
Do not want you modifying their product any modifications that you make to fireworks can be very dangerous

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:02.580
They go against manufacturer recommendations, and you can cause serious injury and/or death to you or anyone around you so stay safe

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.609
Let me take these risks for you, and I'll see you in the next video. Talk to you then

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.990
Where's the blowtorch when you need it

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
You
