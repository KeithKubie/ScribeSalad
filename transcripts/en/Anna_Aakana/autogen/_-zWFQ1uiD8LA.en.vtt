00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.402
Recently I was talking to a friend

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.644
who said that she knew "the perfect guy"
for me.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.010
Because all he dates are Asians.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.103
Anna: What?
Friend: Yeah, he totes has yellow fever~!

00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:14.042
She said it like it was a good thing,
which it's not!

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:18.925
Men with "yellow fever" look at you and
they only see schoolgirls or sexual geishas.

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:21.602
They hide samurai sword collections in
their closet,

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.664
and they learn how to speak an Asian
language and only talk to you

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:26.132
IN THAT FREAKING LANGUAGE!

00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:30.709
Guy(Japanese): Good morning. Are you well?

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:33.918
Uh..English is my first language.

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:35.949
Guy(Japanese): Is that so?

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.602
I..I would really prefer if we spoke English.

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.633
Cause you know. This is America..
You're white..?

00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:51.603
Guy(Japanese): Ah, but, Japanese is so
beautiful, isn't it?

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:53.542
Okay.

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:57.071
(Guy bows)
Anna: Stop it.

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.758
These men, the problem with them..

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:03.016
is that they don't give a fuck about who
you really are.

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:05.393
The idea of you is enough.

00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:10.741
I don't understand why, why you would
romantisize an entire race as being

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:13.710
submissive or weak or docile or delicate
or fragile

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.133
or whatever the FUCK is the allure of
Asian women!

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.863
Oh, I'm sorry, but do

00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:22.545
these GUNS look like they're very
"submissive" to you?

00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:25.040
No? Okay.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.073
Well how about these?

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:29.164
And yet the exact opposite happens to
Asian men.

00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:33.487
They have such a terrible history of being
emasculated. Sorry bro.

00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:37.362
Now look, there's nothing wrong with having
a type. Having a type, knowing what you like,

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.950
what you're attracted to,
THAT'S FINE!

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.393
But yellow fever..

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.739
is when the only prerequisite for me to
become your potiential partner is the

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.134
color of my skin?

00:01:47.602 --> 00:01:51.418
That's cheap. That's offensive. You're
an asshole. Go away.

00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:52.862
Pisses me off so much.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:56.210
Men come up and they're like,
"All my ex-girlfriends are Asian."

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.043
Like what the fuck does that mean to me?
That doesn't mean shit to me!

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:00.950
That just means you're a racist asshole!

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.833
You might as well come up to me and be
like, "I'm a racist asshole."

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:06.395
Because then at least I'll be like, "Oh,
he's honest! That's cool!"

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:11.208
Oh my GOD! OKAY!
Stay awesome, Gotham! I'll see you next week!

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:12.949
It's been a crazy week..

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.012
Oh, just a quick update on the short films.

00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:18.395
So sorry that I'm behind on my 12 of the
year, the breakup and the move and all

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:22.573
that stuff kinda like, made me fall behind.
But I've got two beauty pageant ones

00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:28.480
coming out. One is a fantasy,
post-apocalyptic-y beauty pageant

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.678
that Megan wrote, it's about a
contestant who keeps having strange visions.

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:36.017
And then I have an intergalactic
beauty pageant, which I wrote,

00:02:36.017 --> 00:02:40.518
coming out in collaboration with
Ron Howard's studio, New Form Digital.

00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:44.393
Then I'm also working on a puppet one, and
a dance one, and I'm just working working

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:47.102
working working, keep calm, work hard,
work smart, and you can do what--

00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:49.455
I had coffee clearly today. YEAH!

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:53.938
I've been talking for a long time.
Alright, for real! Bye! EUGH!

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:54.438
