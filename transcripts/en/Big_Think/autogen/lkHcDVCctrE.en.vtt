we find is that males can force

we find is that males can force
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.430
we find is that males can force
themselves on females because they're

that she specifically rejected which
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.100

not the social partner what that means
 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.769
not the social partner what that means
is that females have a 98% successful

right that's like FDA approval right and
 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.240
right that's like FDA approval right and
what that shows is the power of female

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250
what that shows is the power of female
 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.279

individual females one of the
interesting things we learned from

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930
interesting things we learned from
 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.760
interesting things we learned from
examining sexual conflict in Docs is

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770
examining sexual conflict in Docs is
 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.080
examining sexual conflict in Docs is
that the genital arms race between males

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090
that the genital arms race between males
 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.120
that the genital arms race between males
and females is not really a fair fight

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130
and females is not really a fair fight
 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.059
and females is not really a fair fight
in fact the advances in beat and mail

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069
in fact the advances in beat and mail
 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.730
in fact the advances in beat and mail
coercive capacity are really about

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740
coercive capacity are really about
 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.460
coercive capacity are really about
control over female outcomes

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470
control over female outcomes
 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.650
control over female outcomes
right there about controlling physically

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660
right there about controlling physically
 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.260
right there about controlling physically
controlling fertilization

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270
controlling fertilization
 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.690
controlling fertilization
however the countermeasures that females

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700
however the countermeasures that females
 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.570
however the countermeasures that females
evolve are not actually about power or

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580
evolve are not actually about power or
 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.520
evolve are not actually about power or
control they merely re-establish the the

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.160

the freedom of choice if you will the

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170
the freedom of choice if you will the
 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.140
the freedom of choice if you will the
flat playing field in which individuals

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150
flat playing field in which individuals
 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.660
flat playing field in which individuals
are free to choose who they like right

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670
are free to choose who they like right
 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:09.180
are free to choose who they like right
now this this sexual autonomy is not

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190
now this this sexual autonomy is not
 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.720
now this this sexual autonomy is not
actually about control or control over

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730
actually about control or control over
 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.290

sexual outcomes that's fascinating

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:18.760
sexual outcomes that's fascinating
 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.050
sexual outcomes that's fascinating
because this this asymmetry between male

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060
because this this asymmetry between male
 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.030

sex has really fascinating parallels to

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040
sex has really fascinating parallels to
 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.620
sex has really fascinating parallels to
a patriarchy and feminism in cultures

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.630
a patriarchy and feminism in cultures
 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.580
a patriarchy and feminism in cultures
today so for example patriarchy is

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590
today so for example patriarchy is
 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.680
today so for example patriarchy is
historically and even in a modern sense

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:40.690
historically and even in a modern sense
 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.670
historically and even in a modern sense
about coercive control over female

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680
about coercive control over female
 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.740
about coercive control over female
reproductive autonomy

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.750
reproductive autonomy
 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.520
reproductive autonomy
whereas feminism is really an ideology

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:50.530
whereas feminism is really an ideology
 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.640
whereas feminism is really an ideology
of freedom of choice right and that's so

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:53.650
of freedom of choice right and that's so
 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.530
of freedom of choice right and that's so
that same asymmetry between male power

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:55.540
that same asymmetry between male power
 

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.220
that same asymmetry between male power
and and freedom of choice is elaborate

00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.230
and and freedom of choice is elaborate
 

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.380
and and freedom of choice is elaborate
and present today and we can see this

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:01.390
and present today and we can see this
 

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.650
and present today and we can see this
explicitly because patriarchy and men's

freedom to be rejected which is a lesson
 

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.350

that we learn from duck sex

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360
