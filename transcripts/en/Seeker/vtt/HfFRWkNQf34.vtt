00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.020
Tensions are rising between the U.S. and Russia
over the Ukraine crisis.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.500
So what happens if Russia decides it's not
in it's best interest to bring American ISS

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.809
astronauts home?

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.060
Welcome to DNews everyone, I'm Trace and this
is your Weekly Space Update.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.670
First, I want to say, the conflict between
Russia and Ukraine is something NASA is monitoring

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.290
and our contacts there say that the landing
on March 10 and the launch on March 25 are

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.509
both on schedule.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.020
Since the NASA space shuttle program is over,
the US pays Russia to take American astronauts

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.090
into space.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.320
As of August last year the price was $70 million
per seat -- which is a lot.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.280
What if Russia decided to just say "screw
this."?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.910
How will our space nerds get our astronauts
back to Earth?

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.050
On the International Space Station, there
are always two Soyuz spacecraft ready to be

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.450
used as lifeboats -- but since this is hypothetical,
let's say they can't use those.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.500
How would some of the more creative, scientific,
minds of our time envision getting an astronaut

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.430
from space back to Earth in a.... how shall
I...

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.920
Non-Traditional sense?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.500
Lucky for us, during the early days of the
space program, engineers and scientists worked

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.990
on this exact problem.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.820
Back in the late-1960s, scientists at General
Electric came up with the MOOSE -- Man Out

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.850
Of Space Easiest or Manned Orbital Operations
Safety Equipment.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.970
As reported in a 1966 issue of Popular Mechanics,
the astronaut bails out of the spacecraft

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.040
and into the MOOSE where foam fills up what
looks like a life-raft and after the heat

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.660
of reentry, the parachute opens and a beacon
is activated.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.890
It was tested by Mercury astronauts, but never
used or purchased, because... well, look at

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.500
it: It's a foamy raft thing in space.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.100
There were other systems too, like the Paracone
or the Cocoon, both designed to be transported

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.530
up deflated and then inflated in case of emergency.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.850
The Douglas Paracone was a ballistic cone,
basically a pilotable heat shield with a rocket

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.350
engine for re-entry alignment.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.870
It didn't have a parachute, and would just
crush part of it on landing... the '60s were

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.870
crazy!

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.230
The Goodyear Airmat was an inflatable cocoon
ball for two space station-based astronauts.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.010
The ball would be the heat shield, but they
never quite figured it out.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.060
Rockwell proposed a giant balloon, not unlike
the space jump from a couple years ago.The

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.870
SAVER would have a small heat shield behind
the astronaut and a giant balloon in front.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.470
Once in the atmosphere the balloon would inflate
and bam, the slow descent could start.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.060
There were SO MANY designs, escape pods and
manned vehicles -- some were ruled out because

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.540
of weight limits, others because of cost to
develop the technology.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.520
In the end, none of these designs were implemented,
or needed.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.480
Ejection seats at space shuttle speeds would
tear humans apart -- so astronauts simply

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.349
accepted the danger as part of the risk of
space travel.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.349
According to my sources at NASA, at the moment,
we've got no contingency plan to bring our

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.220
astronauts home, because we don't really need
one.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.489
The space agencies of Russia and the United
States have always worked together outside

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.989
of their political differences.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.710
Let's hope it all works out, because in the
end, space exploration benefits all of mankind.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.710
Nerds don't care.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.710
They got science to do!

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.220
Are ANY of these enticing to you?

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.500
Or do you have a better idea?
