00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.150
We learned several videos ago
that if I had an infinite

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.284
uniformly charged plane-- let me
draw one right here, and I

00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:09.960
won't draw it infinite and
I'll tell you why in a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.450
second-- that if we had an
infinite uniformly charged

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.600
plane, and let's say this
one's positive, that the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.935
electric field generated
by it is constant.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.290
Those are the field lines.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.890
They should all be
the same size.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.210
And the strength of the field,
or the magnitude of the field,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.820
is equal to 2 times Coulomb's
constant times pi times the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.750
charge density of the plate.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.130
So if this is infinite-- so
what was charge density?

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.450
We defined it when we proved
that this truly is a uniform

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.140
electric field, but what
is charge density?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.280
Charge density is just the total
amount of charge divided

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.290
by the area, or charge
per area.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.560
Well, if we have an infinite
plane, the area's going to be

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.110
infinite, and so if this is a
constant number, this is also

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.740
going to be infinite, so it's
kind of hard to work with.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.350
But what we also know is that
when we have a non-infinite

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.210
plane that has some finite area,
that near the center of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.250
it and fairly close to it, it
approximates an infinite

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.780
uniformly charged plane.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.180
So with that said, let's see if
we can figure out some of

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.830
the properties of the voltage
and how the voltage relates to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.350
the charge.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.130
If we were to have two
parallel-- let me draw it

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.040
before I say it, because I
think saying it'll just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.850
confuse it.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:02.350
So let's say I have two plates,
that plate-- and then

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.290
I'll do this one in a different
color-- and I have

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.650
that plate, and let's say
they're the same size and they

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.470
both have area A.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.860
Let's say that I place plus
Q worth of charges here.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.460
So this is plus Q so this is
positively charged, right?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.010
I could draw a bunch
of charges here.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.590
Let's say this is minus Q, so
this is negatively charged.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.860
So what's the electric field
going to look like

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.730
between these two?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.070
Well, it's essentially going to
be the combination of the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.400
electric field generated by
this plate on top of the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
electric field generated
by this plate.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.290
And they're both going to be
constant close to the center,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.970
assuming that they're
reasonably-- and let's say

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.220
that they're d apart.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.140
Assuming that d isn't too big,
near the center we're going to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.660
have a constant electric
field.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.070
For example, this green one is
going to be generating-- its

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.470
field lines are going to look
something like this.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.200
Near the center,
it's constant.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.450
These are meant to
look constant.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.250
Near the center, it'll look like
that, and it'll start to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.250
bulge out when you
get to the edges.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.440
Once again, near the center,
it's constant.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.635
That one should've
been at an angle.

00:03:19.635 --> 00:03:22.330
They start to bulge out,
and it'll look

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.830
something like that.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.120
And similarly, this purple plate
will generate a constant

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.630
electric field, and since it's
negatively charged, the field

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.470
lines will be going towards it,
not away from it, so its

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.020
field lines are going to look
something like this.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.890
Near the center, they'll be
constant, and its field lines

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.140
are going to look something
like that.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.380
As you can see, they're going
to be of the same magnitude

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.730
and in the same direction,
and they also

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.820
will bulge out there.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.090
So the big picture is that you
just kind of have twice the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.530
electric field as you would have
if you just had one of

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.920
these plates.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.690
So let's say we're operating
near the center of these,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.940
where we have roughly a constant
electric field and

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.620
see if we can figure out the
relationship between the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.760
voltage across these two plates
and the area, and maybe

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.120
the distance between
the two plates.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.260
So we know that the electric
field generated by any one of

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.100
these charge plates-- I'll do it
in the blue of this color.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.190
So for the bottom plate right
here, what is the electric

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.810
field generated?

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.930
It's 2K pi times sigma.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.270
Sigma is just the total charge
divided by the area.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.640
So Q/A, right?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.570
And we know that the total
electric field generated by

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.890
this one is going to be
essentially the same thing.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.370
I mean, we could say it's a
minus, a negative, because

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.110
it's going towards it, but it's

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.140
essentially the same thing.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.800
Because we see that they overlap
just drawing the field

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.750
line, so the electric field
from that one, and we know

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.570
that they go in the
same direction.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.155
If this was somehow-- well, this
is negative, so the field

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:08.850
lines go towards it.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.300
So plus 2K pi and this is Q/A.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.640
We could have said minus and
then had a minus Q/A, but we

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.730
know that they go into same
direction, so we know that

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.820
they're going to be additive.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.950
And so we know that the total
electric field is

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.625
going to be 4K pi Q/A.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.320
So now we know the
exact strength of

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.490
the electric field.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.220
Let's see if we can figure out
the voltage difference between

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.850
this point and this point.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.420
What was voltage difference,
just as a review?

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.680
Well, voltage difference is
the electrical potential

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.200
energy per charge if the charge
was here versus here.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.500
So how much more potential
energy per coulomb is there

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.390
for a charge to be here
relative to here?

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.220
So another way to view it is a
charge here, a positive charge

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.170
here, because by default we're
always assuming a positive

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.100
charge when we talk about
positive numbers and the

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.820
direction of the field lines
or what the positive

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.840
charge would do.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.180
So by default, a positive charge
here really wants to go

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.500
up to this negative plate,
although we later learned that

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.500
most of the movement in
electronics and electricity,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.080
it's actually the negative
charge that's moving.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.385
It's the electrons moving.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.370
But let's say we did
have a positive ion

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.500
or a positive charge.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.170
The voltage is a measure of if
any charge is here, how badly

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.550
does it want to move to this
point if it has a way to move?

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.500
If we have air here or if we
have a vacuum here, it might

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.740
be difficult or impossible
for it to move up here.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.310
But maybe if we were to connect
a wire where the

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.360
charges could freely conduct,
then it will move.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.420
And the voltage is just
kind of how badly

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.210
does it want to move?

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.990
You could almost view it
as electrical pressure.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.290
And maybe I'll do a whole video
on trying to get an

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.330
intuitive understanding of
voltage, because that really

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.040
is probably the most important
thing to get an intuitive

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.240
understanding of, if you ever
want to study electrical

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.900
engineering or whatever.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.190
But anyway, back
to the problem.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.060
We know that the combined
electric field is this, right?

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.590
It goes upwards in
that direction.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.840
So what is the electric
potential at this point

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.430
relative to this point or
the potential difference

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.380
from here to here?

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.220
Well, that's the amount of
energy per charge it would

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:42.650
take to move a positive charge
from here to there, right?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.810
Remember, electric potential
energy is the amount of work

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.210
necessary to move a charge from
there to there, and then

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.810
the voltage is how much
to do it per charge.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.910
Let me write that down.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.730
So the work necessary to move a
charge from there to there--

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:07.010
let's say a 1-coulomb charge, it
will be 1 coulomb times the

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.060
electric field, because we're
always going to have to be

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.660
going against the
electric field.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.260
So we have to apply an equal
and opposite force.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.360
So the force that is going to
be the electric field-- so

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.750
far, this just generates this
force. coulomb times electric

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.430
field, charge times electric
field, tells us the force on

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.200
the charge, right?

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.410
That's force, and
then we have to

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.380
multiply that times distance.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.020
Force times distance.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.590
So we see the work necessary
is going to be the electric

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:42.929
field times d joules-- the J is
joules-- and so what is the

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:48.210
voltage difference or the
electric potential difference

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.560
between this point
and this point?

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.720
Let's call that point a.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.450
Let's call that point b.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:03.040
So Va minus Vb, which is the
voltage difference, that's

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.000
essentially the electric
potential energy difference

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.580
divided by the charge.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.330
Or, per charge.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.900
Well, here, the charge was just
1, so we can just divide

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:18.380
by 1, and we see that it is
equal to the electric field

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.410
times the distance.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.200
And the units are going to be
joules because we divided both

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.570
sides by charge joules per
coulomb, or volts, right?

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.600
That's just the units.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.380
So what does that equal?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:36.250
So the voltage difference-- so
we can say change in voltage.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.130
The voltage difference is equal
to the electric field,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:51.720
which we know is constant 4K
pi Q over A times distance.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.020
Or we could rewrite this.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:10:00.300
Let's see if we could write
Q as a function of V.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.220
So if we just do a little bit of
algebraic manipulation, we

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.110
can get Q is equal to what?

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:13.800
We would essentially divide
both sides by 4 pi Kd and

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.350
multiply both sides by
A, so we would get A

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:29.680
over 4K pi d voltage.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.960
And why is this interesting?

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.030
Why did I go through all of
this work to get this

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.870
relationship?

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.780
Well, what it shows you, if you
look at this, if we assume

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.150
that the area of the plates
aren't changing-- that's a

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.630
constant; this is definitely a
constant-- and if we assume

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.980
that the distance between the
plates don't change, what we

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.690
see is that there's a
proportional difference

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:54.910
between the voltage and the
amount of the combined charge

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.080
in the plates.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.680
And that's interesting because,
before doing this,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.240
maybe voltage is somehow
proportional to the square of

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.435
the charges or to the square
root, but now we know that

00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:08.280
it's directly proportionally.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.430
And actually, this term right
here has a name, and it is

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.290
called capacitance.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.220
And so another way of rewriting
this, if we divide

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:33.660
both sides by voltage, we get
Q/V is equal to 1 over 4K pi

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.270
area over distance.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.340
And so what it essentially says
is that the amount of

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.730
energy that-- well, actually,
I don't want to

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.520
go into that yet.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.630
But for a given configuration,
and the configuration is

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:53.030
defined by the area of the
plates and the distance-- for

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.890
a given configuration, if I know
the amount of charge that

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.000
I put onto the plates, if I did
a minus Q here and a plus

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.900
Q here, I know the voltage
across the

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.875
plates or vice versa.

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:05.090
If I know the voltage across
the plates and I know its

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.300
configuration, I know how much
charge there is, and this is

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.010
called capacitance, and the
unit for capacitance

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.990
is called the Farad.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.590
And if you become an electrical
engineer or even

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.350
take a couple of electrical
engineering courses, you'll

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.370
become very familiar
with this.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.650
And one other thing to point
out; this term right here,

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.200
just so you know a little
bit of terminology.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.360
This term right here.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:36.630
This 1 over 4K pi, this is often
called epsilon nought,

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.220
or just epsilon, and that's
called the permittivity of

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.560
free space or permittivity
of the vacuum.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.460
And maybe in a future lecture
or a future video, I'll talk

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.010
more about why it's
called that.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.910
But anyway, I'm already well
over the time limit.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:55.260
So I just wanted to give you a
sense of, one, that you can

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.230
calculate the voltage across
what we call, in

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.600
this case, a capacitor.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.430
It has capacitance.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.385
That voltage, you can
kind of view it as

00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:04.170
the electric pressure.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.800
How bad does the charge here
want to move here?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.750
And if you put a wire here,
you'll learn in a second-- not

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.380
in a second, in several
videos-- that

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.575
that charge will flow.

00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:15.610
Or actually the negative charges
will flow this way and

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.310
generate current.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.780
And we'll do that when we start
learning a little bit

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.360
more about electricity.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.120
For any given configuration,
it has a corresponding

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.030
capacitance, and then given
that capacitance, if I put

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.910
some amount of charge, I can
figure out the voltage, or if

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.070
I know there's some voltage, I
can figure out the charge.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.350
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.
