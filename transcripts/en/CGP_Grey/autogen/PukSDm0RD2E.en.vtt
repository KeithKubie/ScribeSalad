imagine you're in charge of government

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530
imagine you're in charge of government
 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.560
imagine you're in charge of government
and you decide that it's time to take

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570
and you decide that it's time to take
 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.329
and you decide that it's time to take
your existing jungle Council and you're

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
your existing jungle Council and you're
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.210
your existing jungle Council and you're
going to switch it over to STV one of

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
going to switch it over to STV one of
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.919
going to switch it over to STV one of
the things that is an option is because

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
the things that is an option is because
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.560
the things that is an option is because
STV requires there to be more than one

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
STV requires there to be more than one
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.350
STV requires there to be more than one
representative per range you can either

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
representative per range you can either
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.200
representative per range you can either
triple at a bare minimum or quintuple

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
triple at a bare minimum or quintuple
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.510
triple at a bare minimum or quintuple
the number of politicians you have which

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
the number of politicians you have which
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.580
the number of politicians you have which
might be something you want to do but

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
might be something you want to do but
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.170
might be something you want to do but
there are many good reasons why you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
there are many good reasons why you
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359
there are many good reasons why you
might not want to do that here's a more

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
might not want to do that here's a more
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.800
might not want to do that here's a more
reasonable way in which you actually

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
reasonable way in which you actually
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.470
reasonable way in which you actually
switch over a country to STV here's a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
switch over a country to STV here's a
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.229
switch over a country to STV here's a
map of our current electoral ranges each

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
map of our current electoral ranges each
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389
map of our current electoral ranges each
of which sends one representative so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
of which sends one representative so
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.709
of which sends one representative so
step one is we're going to get rid of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
step one is we're going to get rid of
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209
step one is we're going to get rid of
all of these ranges and we're going to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
all of these ranges and we're going to
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979
all of these ranges and we're going to
redraw the boundary so instead of

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
redraw the boundary so instead of
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.720
redraw the boundary so instead of
everybody getting elected from one range

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
everybody getting elected from one range
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.340
everybody getting elected from one range
we're going to draw ranges that have

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
we're going to draw ranges that have
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799
we're going to draw ranges that have
five representatives in each now if

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
five representatives in each now if
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.389
five representatives in each now if
local representation means anything

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
local representation means anything
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.770
local representation means anything
you're probably going to want to try to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
you're probably going to want to try to
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900
you're probably going to want to try to
draw these boundaries in meaningful ways

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
draw these boundaries in meaningful ways
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.420
draw these boundaries in meaningful ways
in your country so they follow natural

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
in your country so they follow natural
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.889
in your country so they follow natural
boundaries or they follow town

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
boundaries or they follow town
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569
boundaries or they follow town
boundaries or historical boundaries

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
boundaries or historical boundaries
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.740
boundaries or historical boundaries
you're going to want to try to match

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
you're going to want to try to match
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.930
you're going to want to try to match
those as close as you reasonably can but

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
those as close as you reasonably can but
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.040
those as close as you reasonably can but
an important thing to realize is that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
an important thing to realize is that
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.049
an important thing to realize is that
you do not have to have all of the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
you do not have to have all of the
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.810
you do not have to have all of the
ranges be the exact same size in terms

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
ranges be the exact same size in terms
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030
ranges be the exact same size in terms
of Representatives so in the bottom

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
of Representatives so in the bottom
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620
of Representatives so in the bottom
corner of the map over here you can see

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
corner of the map over here you can see
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450
corner of the map over here you can see
we have a kind of animal city and so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
we have a kind of animal city and so
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770
we have a kind of animal city and so
what you can do is instead of trying to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
what you can do is instead of trying to
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200
what you can do is instead of trying to
divide that up into a bunch of five

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
divide that up into a bunch of five
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940
divide that up into a bunch of five
representative ranges you can take it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
representative ranges you can take it
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.260
representative ranges you can take it
and say no we're just going to cut it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
and say no we're just going to cut it
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420
and say no we're just going to cut it
into two there's the North half of the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
into two there's the North half of the
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.800
into two there's the North half of the
city and there's the South half of the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
city and there's the South half of the
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.990
city and there's the South half of the
city and that's two ranges with nine

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
city and that's two ranges with nine
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880
city and that's two ranges with nine
representatives each now you may be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
representatives each now you may be
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.679
representatives each now you may be
asking why don't you just make it one

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689
asking why don't you just make it one
 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.929
asking why don't you just make it one
range with eighteen representatives the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
range with eighteen representatives the
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730
range with eighteen representatives the
answer is there's a kind of trade-off

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
answer is there's a kind of trade-off
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.550
answer is there's a kind of trade-off
for making larger ranges the larger the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
for making larger ranges the larger the
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.740
for making larger ranges the larger the
ranges you have a benefit in that it is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
ranges you have a benefit in that it is
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.870
ranges you have a benefit in that it is
going to be more representative of the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
going to be more representative of the
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270
going to be more representative of the
local population so in theory arranged

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
local population so in theory arranged
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880
local population so in theory arranged
with 40 or 50 representatives would be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
with 40 or 50 representatives would be
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160
with 40 or 50 representatives would be
even better than a range with just say

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
even better than a range with just say
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620
even better than a range with just say
five but the price you pay for a bigger

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
five but the price you pay for a bigger
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.319
five but the price you pay for a bigger
range is a more complicated election

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
range is a more complicated election
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.139
range is a more complicated election
because if there are say nine seats open

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
because if there are say nine seats open
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.760
because if there are say nine seats open
you're probably going to have at least

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
you're probably going to have at least
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.980
you're probably going to have at least
twenty candidates running so if you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
twenty candidates running so if you
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.380
twenty candidates running so if you
actually have a range that has eighteen

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
actually have a range that has eighteen
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.600
actually have a range that has eighteen
seats available you're probably looking

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
seats available you're probably looking
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.459
seats available you're probably looking
at an election that's going to have 40

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
at an election that's going to have 40
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.160
at an election that's going to have 40
or 50 candidates which is a little bit

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
or 50 candidates which is a little bit
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.199
or 50 candidates which is a little bit
beyond what you can expect a reasonable

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
beyond what you can expect a reasonable
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.300
beyond what you can expect a reasonable
person to be able to distinguish among

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
person to be able to distinguish among
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.160
person to be able to distinguish among
even eighteen is getting a bit up there

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
even eighteen is getting a bit up there
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.730
even eighteen is getting a bit up there
which is what

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
which is what
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.910
which is what
reasonable STV systems allow you to just

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
reasonable STV systems allow you to just
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.950
reasonable STV systems allow you to just
list your favorites as far as you care

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960
list your favorites as far as you care
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.650
list your favorites as far as you care
to go say one through five and then just

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
to go say one through five and then just
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.420
to go say one through five and then just
not fill in the ballot anymore because

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
not fill in the ballot anymore because
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.410
not fill in the ballot anymore because
you don't care anymore

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
you don't care anymore
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.060
you don't care anymore
now the flipside to this problem is when

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070
now the flipside to this problem is when
 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.740
now the flipside to this problem is when
you have a very sparsely populated

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
you have a very sparsely populated
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.350
you have a very sparsely populated
region as we have in the upper left here

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360
region as we have in the upper left here
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.480
region as we have in the upper left here
many countries have their own version of

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490
many countries have their own version of
 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.730
many countries have their own version of
flyover regions where the population is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740
flyover regions where the population is
 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.850
flyover regions where the population is
widely widely distributed and very thin

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
widely widely distributed and very thin
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.950
widely widely distributed and very thin
in that case trying to draw a range that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960
in that case trying to draw a range that
 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.080
in that case trying to draw a range that
had five representatives might just be

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
had five representatives might just be
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.020
had five representatives might just be
comically large so big as to just make a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
comically large so big as to just make a
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.850
comically large so big as to just make a
mockery of the very notion that these

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860
mockery of the very notion that these
 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.520
mockery of the very notion that these
representatives are local in any sense

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
representatives are local in any sense
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.500
representatives are local in any sense
of that word so if you have a very

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510
of that word so if you have a very
 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.780
of that word so if you have a very
sparsely populated region you can have a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
sparsely populated region you can have a
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.240
sparsely populated region you can have a
smaller range as well so in this case

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
smaller range as well so in this case
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.070
smaller range as well so in this case
we're going to make one range with three

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
we're going to make one range with three
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.990
we're going to make one range with three
representatives in the corner now as

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
representatives in the corner now as
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.700
representatives in the corner now as
before the advantage you get with a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710
before the advantage you get with a
 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.920
before the advantage you get with a
smaller election is that it is easier to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930
smaller election is that it is easier to
 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.210
smaller election is that it is easier to
follow they're going to be fewer

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
follow they're going to be fewer
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.180
follow they're going to be fewer
candidates running however smaller

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
candidates running however smaller
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.780
