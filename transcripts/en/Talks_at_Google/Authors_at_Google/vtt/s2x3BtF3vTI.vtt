00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.275
GARTH NIX: I'm going to
talk for a little bit.

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:14.200
I'm going to read a
couple of short things,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.930
and I'm very happy
to take questions.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.110
I often think that you'll
get more out of the questions

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.145
anyway, and I will discover
what you actually want to know,

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:26.844
as opposed to me just talking.

00:00:26.844 --> 00:00:29.254
Stefan asked me about
the origin of my name,

00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:32.320
so I thought I would address
that very quickly, because it

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.642
is, in fact, the question
I get asked the most.

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:38.230
It is not the question
that always get

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.500
asked, which is, where
do you get your ideas?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.767
That actually comes second for
me, because the question I get

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:47.270
asked the most is, "Is
Garth Nix your real name?"

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.344
Because it sounds
like the perfect name

00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:51.315
for a writer, particularly
a writer of fantasy,

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:54.070
so everyone always presumes
it must be a pseudonym.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.944
I must have made it up.

00:00:55.944 --> 00:00:57.402
Other authors,
particularly, assume

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.860
it must be a pseudonym
because it sounds so right.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.780
And it's short.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.050
It fits very nicely
on the books.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.360
It's in the middle
of the alphabet.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.200
There's a whole science
of picking pseudonyms.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.978
Authors like to talk
about what pseudonyms

00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:15.882
they'll need to adopt at
some point in their career,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.262
or want to adopt.

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:19.387
And one of the theories is
that you should always--

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:21.930
and this is, I guess, an
all time theory, really.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.720
Obviously less relevant now.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.322
But you should choose a
surname which is roughly

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:27.571
in the middle of the alphabet.

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.595
Because when the books are
on bookshelf, bookstore,

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.097
and they go A from the
top left corner down to Z

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:35.180
in the bottom right, you're
roughly in the middle.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.882
You'll be at eye
height, and your books

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:39.480
will be even more prominent.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.482
Doesn't work so well in this
era of online selling and so on.

00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:44.883
But Nix, roughly in the middle.

00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:47.220
People assume it
must be a pseudonym.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.770
It is, in fact, my real name.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.695
It is my real name.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:54.520
My parents claim I was not named
after the comic book "Garth."

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.040
I don't know if many of you
know that comic series which

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.466
ran in the '50s and the '60s and
the '70s in "The Daily Mail,"

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.140
I think, in the United Kingdom.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.410
But it also did run
in the "Herald Sun"

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.860
in Melbourne, where
I was born, so I'm

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.837
deeply suspicious about
my parents' claims

00:02:11.837 --> 00:02:15.024
that I was not named after
Garth, who was a super hero who

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:19.955
could travel back in time and
has adventures in many places.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:21.950
And my family always
found it very amusing

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.300
that the super hero Garth has
an enormously muscled body

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.360
and a very small head.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.740
Whereas I'm quite the reverse.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.910
I have a very large head
and am not so muscle bodied.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.400
So it is my real name.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.160
It is the perfect name
for a writer of fantasy.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.650
I think it's also the perfect
name for a writer in general,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.130
in part because
you can find both

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.526
my names in the dictionary.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:47.390
So I'm always very
pleased about that.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.180
Both my names actually
have other meanings

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.620
that aren't just names.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.744
A "garth," of course,
is a walled garden

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:53.660
or a walled courtyard.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.240
Like a cloister
garden in a church.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.260
"Nix," on of the meanings
of nix is, of course,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.200
nothing, which I
prefer to ignore.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.220
Mr. Nothing.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.215
Hi, Garth Nothing here.

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:05.110
Not so good.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.910
But much, much,
more appropriately

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.665
for a writer of
fantasy, it is also

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.830
a very old word from
Germanic mythology that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.960
means a merman or
a water sprite.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.070
I love the definition
of Britannica,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.835
"Encyclopedia
Britannica," the best.

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:23.135
It has a really great
light on what Nix is.

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.720
[INAUDIBLE] dot com
has it and so on.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.240
And according to myth, a nix
is a creature half human,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.335
half fish, that lives in
beautiful underwater palaces.

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:37.230
And they're able to
assume human form.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.035
And typically, they
assume the form

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:44.260
of an aged crone, a young
maiden, or Australian author.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.490
And I've always loved the
idea that perhaps long ago,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.180
one of these mythological
nixes interact

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.190
with humans in two ways.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.660
That they don't have a
great range of feeling.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.970
They only interact in two ones.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.560
One, is they like to lure
humans to death by drowning.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.880
Not so positive.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.450
And the other one
is they marry them.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.640
It's like one or the other.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.970
It's death or marriage.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.120
Not a lot of choice.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.660
You can't be friends, it seems.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.490
But I like to think
maybe a long time ago,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.490
there was one of these
mythological Nixes, chose

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.390
marriage, and maybe
I'm a descendant

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.680
from a mythological
creature as well.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.519
So absolutely perfect
for a fantasy writer.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.235
So that's my name.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:24.978
That's my name in a nutshell.

00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:28.230
I thought I'd read a couple
different little things today.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.120
The first thing I thought
I would read, just

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.260
to give you a basis
for comparison,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.420
is, in fact, from my very,
very first published book.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.700
Admittedly, self-published
book, because here it is.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.300
"Stories" by Garth Nix.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.205
And I made this little book when
I was seven or eight years old.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.110
And I wanted to tell stories.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.359
And obviously, I was also
thinking about publishing.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.733
I was a long way ahead of the
whole self-publishing thing

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.670
that goes on now.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.620
It was easier back
then, of course.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.680
You just folded up
a piece of paper.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.600
So I want to read you a story
from "Stories" by Garth Nix,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.410
and you can see if I'm
improved over the years.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.080
If you tell me this is the
best thing I've ever written

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.395
and it's been downhill ever
since, I'll be disappointed.

00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:16.940
So this is a little story.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.370
I wrote it when I
was seven or eight.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.240
It is quite long.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.380
So settle back.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.350
You can relax and
I'll read it to you.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.480
It's called "The Coin Shower."

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.940
"A boy went outside.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.130
It started raining coins.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.332
He picked them up.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.450
The end."

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.505
So it's not that long.

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.160
But one of the things I
like about this little story

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.579
is that it shows that even
back when I was seven or eight,

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:44.495
I was thinking about the
structure of stories.

00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:46.890
Because that has a very
classical story structure.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.440
It has a beginning
where a character

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.330
is introduced in a setting.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.194
There's a boy who went outside.

00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:54.360
Then there's a middle, where
there's a complication.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.004
It started raining coins.

00:05:56.004 --> 00:05:58.420
And then there's the end, where
I resolve the complication

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.750
that I've set up.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.140
He picked them up.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.206
So even back then,
obviously from the books

00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:05.580
that I'd been reading, from
the stories I'd been reading,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.266
I was instinctively absorbing
the structure of stories.

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:13.800
This isn't the actual "Stories"
by Garth Nix, by the way.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.210
Because the real one is in the
National Library of Australia.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.080
Not really.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.100
The real one is back home.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.354
My younger brother
actually found it.

00:06:24.354 --> 00:06:26.385
About for years ago,
my parents moved.

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.188
My mother rang me
up and said, you've

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.222
got to come and help us pack up.

00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:32.850
But most of all, you've
got to come take away,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.055
or organize to take away,
all your boxes of books

00:06:35.055 --> 00:06:37.150
that you have underneath house.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.037
And I hadn't lived there for
25 years or possibly longer.

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:44.482
I thought, boxes of
books under the house?

00:06:44.482 --> 00:06:46.275
I said, well, what
are we talking about?

00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:49.372
Because I could remember
three or four boxes of books.

00:06:49.372 --> 00:06:52.490
And my mother said, 21.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.780
I was like, oh.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.525
Whoa.

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:55.025
21.

00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:56.310
I wonder what's in there.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.570
And so I went down.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.760
And, in fact, there
were 22 boxes of books

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.640
that I had to remove.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.056
And while we were
helping pack up,

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:05.232
my younger brother
found this little book,

00:07:05.232 --> 00:07:06.732
or the original of
this little book.

00:07:06.732 --> 00:07:08.565
And he got it out while
we were having lunch

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.710
and he started reading some
of the stories from it.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.332
And I thought that he'd made
it, just to make fun of my.

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:14.690
My brother.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.310
So he was just poking fun at me.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.750
You're the author.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.846
He just wanted you to see
some of your early rubbish.

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:22.730
But my parents didn't
know, that actually is.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.960
That's a real thing.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.430
He hadn't made it up.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.900
It was a real little book.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.615
But I couldn't
remember exactly when

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.090
I made it, when I
was seven or eight.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.970
Something like that.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.872
So even very early
on, I was obviously

00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:37.730
thinking about being a writer
and planning to be published,

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.380
but I had to do
it myself or not.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.278
So "The Coin Shower" is
very early Garth Nix.

00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:45.152
And I thought I might
read your something now

00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:49.150
from "Clariel," much
more recently, of course.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.350
"Clariel" is a return
to the Old Kingdom.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.320
It's a return to the setting
of "Sabriel," "Lirael,"

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.524
and "Aborsen," and a couple
of the longer short stories

00:07:58.524 --> 00:08:01.730
that relate to
that world as well.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.360
But it's a very
different Old Kingdom.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.438
The world of the Old Kingdom in
"Sabriel," of course, the Old

00:08:08.438 --> 00:08:11.190
Kingdom is shattered and broken.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.550
The dead have come back from
death all over the place.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.975
There are Free Magic
creatures on the rampage.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.450
Everything is in big trouble.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.790
But in "Clariel," it's
going back 600 years

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.760
before the events of "Sabriel."

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.860
And the Old Kingdom is,
in fact, very peaceful.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.145
It's very settled.

00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:30.170
It's rich.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.350
There's no trouble,
no apparent trouble.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.909
Because of this,
people have largely

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.860
forgotten about the danger
presented by the dead,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.049
by the ability of things
to come out of death.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.090
They've forgotten about
the Free Magic creatures.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.173
There hasn't been any
trouble for such a long time

00:08:46.173 --> 00:08:50.279
that everyone's got
used to being peaceful.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.165
And as a consequence
of this, the Abhorsens,

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:56.370
the family whose job it is to
keep the dead down, to deal

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.760
with the Free Magic
[INAUDIBLE] and so on,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.200
have become much less important.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.080
People don't think of
them as important anymore.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.724
Charter magic itself has become
something that people are not

00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:08.395
so interested in
because it's hard.

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:09.395
It's difficult to learn.

00:09:09.395 --> 00:09:11.186
So it's something that
you get other people

00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:12.845
to do rather than
learning it yourself.

00:09:12.845 --> 00:09:15.770
It's something for service
that you pay to do.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.520
So it's a different world.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.760
And "Clariel" is the story of
a young woman called Clariel

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.320
who has grown up
in a small town.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.710
And who is a loner.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.220
And she's solitary.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.715
She loves the forest.

00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:32.010
She wants to be a hunter.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.830
She's 17.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.220
Her idea of her future
is to live by herself

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.180
in the Great Forest.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.430
Perhaps to become a
border, one of the people

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.630
who patrol the forests and
make sure that all is well.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.450
But it's still an essentially
solitary occupation.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.270
But she's forced to move to
the capitol city, Belisaere,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.740
by her parents.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.500
Her mother, Jaciel,
is a goldsmith.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.660
A very, very talented
goldsmith who was given

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.450
the opportunity to join the
high guild of goldsmiths

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.200
in Belisaere, the capitol city.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.115
And, in fact, there's
a very nice new map

00:10:05.115 --> 00:10:08.790
of Belisaere in "Clariel."

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.060
It's always nice to have to a
new map in any fantasy novel.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.710
This one actually has
the old maps, as well.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.180
So it has three maps.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.950
Any fantasy novel
with three maps,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.302
it must be three times as
good as one with only one map.

00:10:21.302 --> 00:10:25.005
And possibly 30 times as
good as one with no maps.

00:10:25.005 --> 00:10:26.921
That probably
doesn't really work,

00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:28.765
but it's a very nice new map.

00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:32.060
So she's forced to go to
Belisaere with her parents.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.126
Her mother makes her go.

00:10:34.126 --> 00:10:36.600
She hasn't been in the
city very long before she

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.780
realizes that she has to escape.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.680
She has to get out.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.120
She feels crammed with
the walls, the people.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.270
She's disconnected from
the life she really,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.990
really wants to lead.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.380
So she decides
she'll do whatever

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.350
is necessary to escape the
city, get away from her parents.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.850
And her parents are powerful.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.890
Her mother is a
cousin of the King,

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.680
as well as being high on
the goldsmiths' guild.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.255
She's also the daughter
of the current Abhorsen.

00:11:03.255 --> 00:11:05.763
Clariel is the granddaughter
of the current Abhorsen.

00:11:05.763 --> 00:11:07.721
But they are estranged
from the Abhorsen family

00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:11.330
for reasons that become
clear in the story.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.830
So Clariel has a lot
arrayed against her.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.130
Her parents have
particular plans for her.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.350
They all involve being stuck in
the city, surrounded by stone.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.260
She can't get out under the sky.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.360
And she decides to do
whatever it takes to get out.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.150
And one of the opportunities
that presents itself to her

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.982
is that if she can help a small
group of people do something,

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.650
they will help her.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.740
And what this group of
people wants her to do

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.192
is to help them track what they
think is a Free Magic creature.

00:11:39.192 --> 00:11:41.650
They think there's a Free Magic
creature on a little island

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.010
just outside the city, which
is getting into the city.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.740
They want to know
what it's up to.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.692
This is a small group.

00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:49.250
They're among the few
people who are actually

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.186
concerned about such
things in this current era.

00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:55.160
So Sabriel-- Sabriel.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.692
I've been on the
road for a month.

00:11:56.692 --> 00:11:58.150
I'm getting a bit
tired, obviously.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.866
If I start talking
absolute rubbish,

00:12:00.866 --> 00:12:05.017
I'm sure I'll be taken
away and wet cloths will

00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:06.740
be applied until I
made sense again.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.430
Clariel agrees to help
them, not really fully

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.030
understanding what she's doing.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.430
They think that because she's
the Abhorsen's granddaughter,

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.370
and the Abhorsens
are very deeply

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.576
connected with the
Charter of Free Magic,

00:12:19.576 --> 00:12:23.048
that she can be used
like a tethered goat

00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:25.540
to draw the Free
Magic creature out,

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.235
which is, of course, a much,
much more dangerous thing

00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:30.039
than she really knows.

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:32.080
I'm going to read a little
passage to you where's

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.660
she gone with this
group of people

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.690
to this little rocky
islet to try and lure out

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.788
this Free Magic creature.

00:12:39.788 --> 00:12:44.805
And, of course, things
don't go exactly as planned.

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:47.435
So I'm going to read a
little sequence to you.

00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:51.235
"'Lady Clariel,' a human
shout, followed by the rush

00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:53.116
of footsteps on stone.

00:12:53.116 --> 00:12:56.055
Roban came charging up
the steps, sword in hand,

00:12:56.055 --> 00:12:58.310
silver fire leaping
along the blade.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.525
At the same time, something else
rose up out of the very rock,

00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:04.532
almost under Clariel's feet.

00:13:04.532 --> 00:13:07.796
At night, from a distance, it
might be confused for a woman,

00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:10.918
for it was vaguely
feminine in shape.

00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:13.829
But this close, it could be
seen that the slender legs ended

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:16.500
not in feet, but
narrowed to become sharp,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.350
burning blades the
color of yellow teeth.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.740
"Its arms had two elbows
a hand's width apart.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.124
And its spade-like hands
had too many fingers,

00:13:25.124 --> 00:13:28.110
each ending in a
curved back claw.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.590
Its hair was not
hair, but a mass

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.325
of brilliant tendrils
of white light

00:13:32.325 --> 00:13:34.807
that flowed around its
head and cascaded down

00:13:34.807 --> 00:13:36.030
its shoulders and back.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.770
And its face, if it
had one, was an absence

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.200
of light in the middle.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.350
A dark, oval void without
features of any kind.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.645
"Below its shining
head, its skin

00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:51.210
was entirely the color
of old, dried blood.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.425
Claws raked at Roban.

00:13:52.425 --> 00:13:56.830
He parried, [INAUDIBLE] blazing
on his sword, sparks flying.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.590
But the creature
was far stronger.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.910
Roban was forced back and
then flung down the steps.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.608
Swatted like a fly, he
disappeared into the shadows

00:14:04.608 --> 00:14:06.512
as if he had never been.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:10.320
"As Roban fell, Clariel swung
her [INAUDIBLE] two-handed

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.094
at the creature's back.

00:14:12.094 --> 00:14:13.510
But the steel could
not even break

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.615
that strange, blood red skin.

00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:18.890
It melted as it hit, the
metal rolling in molten

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.420
drops as if Clariel had
cast a cup of quicksilver

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.090
against the creature
rather than struck it

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.655
with a finely tended blade.

00:14:26.655 --> 00:14:31.230
The creature turned and
tilted its head quizzically.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.102
"'Not even a sorcerer's sword.

00:14:33.102 --> 00:14:34.520
[INAUDIBLE] true.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.660
You do not need such things.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.960
Let me show you how to find
the power within yourself.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.790
I will guide you.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.610
But first, let me dispose of
this small Aborsen.' It strode

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.005
over to where Bel lay
half in the fire pit,

00:14:49.005 --> 00:14:52.520
its blade feet striking sparks
from the stone as it trod.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.070
It raised on of those
feet above Bel's head,

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.190
and was about to bring it down
when Clariel screamed and dived

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.930
forward, grabbing that unearthly
spiked foot with both hands

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.697
to hold back the killing blow.

00:15:04.697 --> 00:15:06.530
"The moment she touched
it, she felt a shock

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.525
through her whole body.

00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:10.920
Her heart raced in panic
as some unseen force

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.990
flowed from the
creature into her.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.027
It entered her mind, exerting
a sudden mental pressure that

00:15:16.027 --> 00:15:19.030
made her want to let
go, to open her hands

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.650
and let the spike drive down.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.550
To help it strike.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.630
"'No trick, Clariel.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.130
No.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.410
I won't let you.' It took all
her willpower to keep her hands

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.160
closed, and all her strength
to stop the spiked foot.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.920
Yet despite everything
she could do,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.370
it kept pressing down,
coming closer and closer

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.150
to Bel's forehead,
and the Charter

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.246
mark there, as if that was
the spot where the young man's

00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:44.570
skull was thinnest.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.690
"'You are strong,' said the
voice inside Clariel's head.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.492
'But not strong enough.'"

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:54.469
There's a little
sample of "Clariel."

00:15:54.469 --> 00:15:55.885
We'll go to questions
in a moment,

00:15:55.885 --> 00:15:58.070
but shortly before I do
that, I might just quickly

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.010
mention something about
the virtue of persistence.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.705
And I guess why I'm here
today talking about my books.

00:16:05.705 --> 00:16:09.540
And also because I want to
show off an incredibly low tech

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.770
speaking aid which it
amuses me to do in Google.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.930
This is my very first
book, "The Ragwitch."

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.082
It was published when I was 26.

00:16:20.082 --> 00:16:21.540
And like a lot of
people, I thought

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.780
when this book came out,
it would change my life.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.486
It would sell lots and
lots and lots of copies

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.420
and I could just write books,
and I could give up my day job.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.887
But it didn't, actually.

00:16:30.887 --> 00:16:33.495
I mean, it did change
my life, but not

00:16:33.495 --> 00:16:35.400
in the ways that I
expected, I guess.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.733
I thought it would have a
much greater and more dramatic

00:16:37.733 --> 00:16:38.233
change.

00:16:38.233 --> 00:16:39.200
Because it did OK.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.190
It got good reviews.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:40.917
Sold a bit.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.000
Sold out its first print
run, but it didn't really

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.500
do anything.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.772
I certainly couldn't
give up my day job.

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:47.600
And after I wrote
"The Ragwitch,"

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.870
I wrote another book called
"The Clearing House," which

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.655
you will not find in
my Wikipedia entry.

00:16:53.655 --> 00:16:55.580
No one's ever heard of.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.895
And even after my first
novel was published,

00:16:57.895 --> 00:17:00.376
I couldn't get my
next novel published.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.787
I thought it was
a wonderful idea.

00:17:04.787 --> 00:17:07.078
Everyone else thought it was
an incredibly stupid idea,

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:07.842
unfortunately.

00:17:07.842 --> 00:17:10.680
And I could easily have
given up at that point.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.099
And, in fact, I did consider.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.045
I thought, oh, well.

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:13.753
I've written one.

00:17:13.753 --> 00:17:14.464
It got published.

00:17:14.464 --> 00:17:15.380
Nothing much happened.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.075
I've written a second one.

00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:19.397
It's obviously
not going to work.

00:17:19.397 --> 00:17:21.230
It was a bit like that
"Monty Python" sketch

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.345
about I built a castle and
it sank into the swamp.

00:17:23.345 --> 00:17:25.395
I built another castle,
it sank into the swamp.

00:17:25.395 --> 00:17:27.650
I built a third
castle, it burned down

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.190
and sank into the swamp.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.400
But he built a fourth castle.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.012
And, of course,
I did keep going.

00:17:33.012 --> 00:17:34.970
Partially I kept going
because a friend of mine

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.730
said to me, well, Garth.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.564
I guess you're just
a one book wonder.

00:17:39.564 --> 00:17:42.973
He's a good friend,
surprisingly enough.

00:17:42.973 --> 00:17:44.432
And I thought to
myself, I really

00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:46.227
don't want to be
a one-book wonder.

00:17:46.227 --> 00:17:48.060
I'm going to keep
writing, because you never

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.374
know what can happen.

00:17:49.374 --> 00:17:50.542
And I did keep writing.

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:54.180
And my next book was "Sabriel."

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.250
And "Sabriel," actually,
was also not immediately

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.245
an enormous success.

00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.120
But it kept on going.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.760
It got very good reviews
and people liked it.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.730
But it was not a best seller.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.522
In fact, "Sabriel"
by itself has never

00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:09.870
been on any best
seller lists by itself.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.125
But it's sold the most copies
of any of my books by far.

00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:16.020
But just over a
long period of time.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.135
The series as a whole has
been on the best seller lists.

00:18:19.135 --> 00:18:20.985
And, in fact, back on
"The New York Times"

00:18:20.985 --> 00:18:25.132
list this Sunday, which I'm
incredibly pleased about.

00:18:25.132 --> 00:18:28.486
So even then, "Sabriel"
was not a big success.

00:18:28.486 --> 00:18:30.258
I had to keep my day job.

00:18:30.258 --> 00:18:31.894
But I kept on going.

00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:33.810
So I could have given
up after "The Ragwitch,"

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.990
but I kept going.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.890
And I kept going.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.142
And I kept going.

00:18:40.142 --> 00:18:42.632
Can I get you to hold this?

00:18:42.632 --> 00:18:44.126
That's very kind.

00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:45.122
I kept going.

00:18:45.122 --> 00:18:46.616
And I kept going.

00:18:46.616 --> 00:18:50.526
And through the Old Kingdom
books, "Shade's Children,"

00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:53.440
"Keys to the Kingdom,"
"Seventh Tower," then the Keys.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.626
I kept going.

00:18:54.626 --> 00:18:55.602
I kept going.

00:18:55.602 --> 00:18:58.530
I'm probably causing--
but I kept going.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.994
And I kept going.

00:18:59.994 --> 00:19:01.458
And I kept going.

00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:03.898
I'm causing technical
difficulty now.

00:19:03.898 --> 00:19:06.826
And I kept going.

00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:08.072
And thank you, Stefan.

00:19:08.072 --> 00:19:08.780
And I kept going.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.560
Normally I just lay
this on the floor.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.046
And I kept going to
"Clariel," of course,

00:19:13.046 --> 00:19:14.744
the most recent book.

00:19:14.744 --> 00:19:16.160
I've cheated
slightly, because you

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.085
may notice I've used some double
covers here and there to make

00:19:19.085 --> 00:19:21.005
this look even more impressive.

00:19:21.005 --> 00:19:25.450
But I like to think, when I look
at this big chain of covers,

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.455
that it could all
have stopped back

00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:29.280
at "The Ragwitch,"
if I'd given up.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.030
Every book is a new possibility.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.270
Every book offers the
opportunity for something

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.270
to happen.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:39.400
And keeping going
potentially opens new doors.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.810
You never know what will
happen if you persevere.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.540
So I like to show this
whole line of books

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.840
off, because they easily, so
easily, have stopped early.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.352
And the other reason I made
this is because one day I'm

00:19:50.352 --> 00:19:52.426
going to take it to
my friend who told me

00:19:52.426 --> 00:19:57.150
I was a one book wonder, and I'm
going to strangle him with it.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.580
Of course, that might
be too easy to work out

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.990
who exactly did it.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.990
And, of course, it's also
a very low-tech speaking

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.730
aid which can work anywhere.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.350
So I like to show it off.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.995
And this is probably a good
spot to go to questions.

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:14.900
Thank you very much.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.641
I folded it wrong again.

00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:20.563
So even though it's low-tech,
I have difficulties with it.

00:20:23.485 --> 00:20:24.459
There we go.

00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:30.800
Thank you very much.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800
So, questions?

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.960
We've got a microphone.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.117
Might just grab my water.

00:20:36.117 --> 00:20:38.650
Of course, the Australian
in the room has to be first,

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.870
is that right?

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:40.912
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:20:40.912 --> 00:20:44.920
You collaborated with Sean
Williams quite recently.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.400
[INAUDIBLE] why, I
guess, recently you

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.160
have the ability to?

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.600
GARTH NIX: Sure.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.196
I've written four books with
my friend Sean Williams,

00:20:55.196 --> 00:20:56.564
the "Troubletwisters" series.

00:20:56.564 --> 00:20:58.740
And we're going to
write some more.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.726
Not "Troubletwisters,"
which is complete.

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:03.210
We're going to write
some other stories.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.210
It actually came
about because Sean

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.170
and I have been friends
for a very long time.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.452
We met at the Brisbane Writers'
Festival, where we bonded over

00:21:12.452 --> 00:21:15.190
a disturbing
incident in one panel

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:21.880
we were on, where a very
unsettled person suddenly

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.410
started raving at the audience
about being captured by aliens.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.190
And we were science
fiction writers,

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.690
so it was somehow our fault.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.190
And he had a huge
green bag which

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.340
looked like it was full of guns.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.670
And we were actually
quite disturbed.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.082
Luckily, he just stopped
mid-rant and left, much

00:21:39.082 --> 00:21:41.510
to relief of everyone
in the audience.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.625
So we bonded back then.

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.958
And we had actually been
talking about writing something

00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:48.490
together for years
and years and years,

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.698
just because it would be fun.

00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:52.070
Because writing is
a solitary activity.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.880
You need to be OK with that.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.890
You need to be able to
work by yourself on things.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.890
I think many authors
like the idea

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.180
of working with somebody
else because it would be fun.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.430
And we talked about lots and
lots of different things.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.971
And, in fact, at
different times have

00:22:07.971 --> 00:22:10.550
kicked around different ideas.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.376
We looked at a couple
of screenplay ideas.

00:22:13.376 --> 00:22:15.570
We looked at some
other story ideas

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.236
before we were at a
writers' festival together.

00:22:20.236 --> 00:22:22.736
I think it was in Melbourne,
but I can't be absolutely sure.

00:22:22.736 --> 00:22:27.370
It may have been a world fantasy
convention somewhere entirely

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.900
not in Australia.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.626
And I had a very basic idea
for a children's story.

00:22:32.626 --> 00:22:34.835
And I was telling him
about it, and then he

00:22:34.835 --> 00:22:36.420
said, well, Garth,
you could do this.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.480
You could do that.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.330
We started talking.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.320
Or this could happen.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.330
And within two or three
hours and a few Guinnesses,

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.860
we'd worked out the
story to a basic degree.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.650
But we decided, yeah,
let's write this together.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.666
So it really came
about because we

00:22:53.666 --> 00:22:55.290
thought it'd be fun
to write something.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.462
And it has been.

00:22:56.462 --> 00:22:57.420
It's been a lot of fun.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:05.138
And it makes a nice change from
just working on our own books.

00:23:05.138 --> 00:23:07.400
But that said, I think it's
actually very important

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.630
that we also have our own books
and that that team writing

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.929
project is not our
total investment.

00:23:13.929 --> 00:23:14.970
It's not the whole thing.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.400
Because that raises all kinds
of other issues, I think.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.134
Where if all your
energies, all your identity

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:24.995
is fixed in your dual
writing team stuff,

00:23:24.995 --> 00:23:28.430
I think that's considerably
harder than where

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.590
it's something you do as
well as your other books.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.890
And we also, from
the very beginning.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.850
also worked out
how it would work.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.910
We had a writing
agreement in place.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.258
I worked in publishing for
a long time in parallel

00:23:41.258 --> 00:23:42.216
with being a writer.

00:23:42.216 --> 00:23:46.048
I was an editor and I was
an agent for a long time.

00:23:46.048 --> 00:23:50.320
I'm still, in fact, a
shareholder in an agency.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.230
So I'm very aware
of how things can

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.740
go wrong with writing
duos or writing groups.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.850
And one of the key
principles, of course,

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.240
is always to make
sure that you have

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.130
an agreement from the very
beginning which sets out

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.250
how the business would work.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.920
What the shares are.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.810
Who will have the final say
if you can't agree on things,

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.250
both in terms of the writing
and in terms of the business.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.090
Always [INAUDIBLE] going
with your eyes open.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.713
AUDIENCE: So I've
always been confused

00:24:22.713 --> 00:24:25.260
about the "Confusion
of Princes."

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.470
It's not like you're known
for princes at this time.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.185
So where did the
"Confusion" come from?

00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:33.860
GARTH NIX: The "Confusion
of Princes," I think,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.510
comes from-- that's
my space opera novel.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.712
I love space operas.

00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:40.990
I wanted to write one.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:45.090
It's because there are so many
princes that they-- I mean,

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.213
partly it's just because
I really liked the title.

00:24:47.213 --> 00:24:52.530
And I think it's not meant to
have a literal interpretation.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:58.740
But in that particular universe,
there are 10 million princes.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.881
So there could
easily be a confusion

00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:03.335
over any particular prince.

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:06.239
There's no specific confusion.

00:25:06.239 --> 00:25:08.030
I think if you have
got 10 million princes,

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.660
I think a confusion would
be a collective noun.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.540
I think it could become
a collective noun.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.420
If you had 10 million
princes, I think

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.770
that would be fair enough.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.390
I hope that kind of
answers, or dodges

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.150
the question
sufficiently to move on.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.116
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:25.565
GARTH NIX: Thank you.

00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:27.497
AUDIENCE: I have a
very small question.

00:25:27.497 --> 00:25:29.912
You have many, many
awesome characters.

00:25:29.912 --> 00:25:31.361
But my favorite is Yrael.

00:25:31.361 --> 00:25:32.327
GARTH NIX: Thank you.

00:25:32.327 --> 00:25:33.776
AUDIENCE: Do you have a cat now?

00:25:33.776 --> 00:25:35.225
GARTH NIX: I don't
have a cat now.

00:25:35.225 --> 00:25:38.210
In fact, when people
ask me about Mogget,

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.678
I always say,
Mogget is, in fact,

00:25:40.678 --> 00:25:43.610
based upon all the
cats I've ever known.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.742
Whereas the Disreputable
Dog in Lirael Abhorsen,

00:25:47.742 --> 00:25:50.240
her dog-like characteristics
are very specifically

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.031
based upon one particular
dog, my parents' dog

00:25:54.031 --> 00:25:56.938
and thus a family
dog called Bytenix.

00:25:56.938 --> 00:26:00.690
And "Lirael" is, in fact,
dedicated to Bytenix.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.582
So I took very specific
dog-like characteristics

00:26:03.582 --> 00:26:06.136
for Disreputable Dog from
one dog in particular.

00:26:06.136 --> 00:26:10.212
But Mogget is all the cats.

00:26:10.212 --> 00:26:13.621
We had a cat called Jimmy, for
example, when I was a child.

00:26:13.621 --> 00:26:16.299
And Jimmy probably
actually was an influence,

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:17.690
because he thought he was human.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:18.980
He didn't think he was a cat.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.435
He thought he was a human
and behaved accordingly.

00:26:21.435 --> 00:26:24.872
So I'm sure that actually
had some influence

00:26:24.872 --> 00:26:27.494
as well to the
character of Mogget.

00:26:27.494 --> 00:26:29.160
Because, of course,
he's not just a cat.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.826
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:26:29.826 --> 00:26:33.960
GARTH NIX: He's also an
element of power, basically.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.360
AUDIENCE: I just
wondered, did you

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.740
have a really bad
experience with a cat?

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.358
Like, you got to get
this into a book.

00:26:42.358 --> 00:26:45.422
GARTH NIX: Well, I think
seriously he is all the cats.

00:26:45.422 --> 00:26:46.660
So Jimmy, my childhood cat.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.930
We had a black cat we adopted
for a while-- it was very sad,

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.332
he'd run over-- who was
completely wild that

00:26:54.332 --> 00:26:57.530
was coming to eat
every now and again.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:02.920
When I first moved to Sydney,
there was a neighboring cat.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.650
It was actually a grown cat
that looked like a kitten.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:06.920
He was incredibly cute.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.140
And it used to come visit us.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.730
And we worked it
much later on, it

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.815
visited three or
four houses along

00:27:12.815 --> 00:27:14.518
and be fed in all of the houses.

00:27:14.518 --> 00:27:18.720
And also he used to
smell of wood smoke.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.870
And was called Little Puss.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.032
Little Puss would come in.

00:27:23.032 --> 00:27:23.998
Oh, it's wood smoke.

00:27:23.998 --> 00:27:25.447
The cat smells of wood smoke.

00:27:25.447 --> 00:27:28.215
And we worked out that's because
he spent most of the day lying

00:27:28.215 --> 00:27:30.048
next to the fire at the
neighbor's, a couple

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:31.411
of doors down during winter.

00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:32.872
AUDIENCE: Smart cat.

00:27:32.872 --> 00:27:34.340
GARTH NIX: Yeah.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.420
Cats work out.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.130
They work out where the
best deal is, and they go.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.334
So all those cats.

00:27:40.334 --> 00:27:41.792
All those cats had
input, I'm sure.

00:27:42.435 --> 00:27:43.268
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:43.268 --> 00:27:44.143
GARTH NIX: Thank you.

00:27:46.712 --> 00:27:49.418
AUDIENCE: In "Keys to the
Kingdom," the mundane setting

00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:52.616
is the quarantine and a
military intervention.

00:27:52.616 --> 00:27:57.372
And that seems like a very dark
focus on the mundane setting as

00:27:57.372 --> 00:27:59.504
opposed to a magic setting.

00:27:59.504 --> 00:28:01.472
What inspired that?

00:28:01.472 --> 00:28:06.884
[INAUDIBLE] setting for
even mundane aspects?

00:28:06.884 --> 00:28:08.780
GARTH NIX: That's
a good question.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:15.230
I'm not entirely sure,
except that, of course,

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.586
I get ideas from
history and from what's

00:28:17.586 --> 00:28:19.836
happening in the world and
what's happening around me,

00:28:19.836 --> 00:28:21.270
and from the natural world.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.660
There's all these
different inputs

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.575
into the reservoir in my head.

00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:28.644
And I think probably
I was thinking,

00:28:28.644 --> 00:28:31.250
I was writing those
books around the time,

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.730
I think, the whole
bird flu scare.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.230
Before then, actually.

00:28:40.084 --> 00:28:41.950
I guess I've always
been fascinated

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.446
and afraid of that kind of
viral outbreak situation,

00:28:45.446 --> 00:28:48.595
and so I just wanted
to put it into a book.

00:28:48.595 --> 00:28:52.523
But I'm not exactly sure why.

00:28:52.523 --> 00:28:53.996
I don't always know.

00:28:53.996 --> 00:28:57.187
And, in fact, I generally don't
know where ideas come from

00:28:57.187 --> 00:29:00.620
or why I put things in books
except that it's instinct.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.943
I start thinking
about something.

00:29:02.943 --> 00:29:06.804
I think, what would be
happening in this world?

00:29:06.804 --> 00:29:08.628
And in the case
there, what would

00:29:08.628 --> 00:29:11.070
be happening in the real world?

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.368
And I also wanted it
to be near future,

00:29:14.368 --> 00:29:17.850
and that was something that came
to mind as a marker of that,

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.180
perhaps.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.190
But I'm driven by story.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.215
I thought it was
right for the story.

00:29:24.215 --> 00:29:26.560
It seemed cool for the story.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.305
So I wanted to put it in.

00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:32.040
And I guess also,
probably I was thinking

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.980
about the impingement
of different worlds

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.110
and how that would
bring in diseases.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.095
And going all the way back to
the commentary theory of where

00:29:41.095 --> 00:29:43.515
viruses come from, some of
which are scientifically,

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:44.880
I think, very unsound.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.370
But for stories, it's great.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.680
So I think that's
where it came from.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.560
But like almost everything
I do, it's really,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.910
will it work for the story?

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.210
If it'll make the story
work, make the story better,

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.720
then it stays in.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.839
And if I try something and
it doesn't, then it goes out.

00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:06.672
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:06.672 --> 00:30:09.083
GARTH NIX: Thank you.

00:30:09.083 --> 00:30:09.624
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:10.749
GARTH NIX: Hi, how are you?

00:30:10.749 --> 00:30:11.600
AUDIENCE: Very good.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.322
A lot of time has gone by
since "Abhorsen" came out.

00:30:14.322 --> 00:30:17.724
And obviously you've been very
busy with many other projects.

00:30:17.724 --> 00:30:21.612
What inspired you to come
back to the series now?

00:30:21.612 --> 00:30:23.070
GARTH NIX: Sure.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.176
That's an interesting
question, because people

00:30:25.176 --> 00:30:27.930
say to me, what's it like to
come back to the Old Kingdom

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.860
after 10 years or 11 years.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.435
But to me, I never left
because these ideas

00:30:33.435 --> 00:30:35.740
have been in my head
for a very long time.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:41.150
And, in fact, "Clariel"
stems from the basic question

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.600
I asked myself when I
was writing "Lirael."

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.835
And I write-- I particularly
used to write-- long hand.

00:30:47.835 --> 00:30:50.520
So I'd write a chapter long
hand and then type it up

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.920
in black and red
notebooks like this.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.604
This is, in fact, the
"Mr. Monday" notebook.

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:58.500
And one of the things I do
is I keep track of my word

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.700
count each time
I'll type a chapter.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.830
So I'll write it
longhand, type it up.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.081
As I type it, I'll
change it and correct it.

00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:06.580
So the first version
on the computer

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.290
would, in fact,
be a second draft.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.769
And I keep track
of the word count

00:31:10.769 --> 00:31:12.060
and I write the date and so on.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.750
So you can see
here, "Mr. Monday,"

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.593
I started on the
13th of April, 2002.

00:31:16.593 --> 00:31:21.885
And finished on the 10 of
September, 2002, at 12:55 AM.

00:31:21.885 --> 00:31:24.200
Quite handy to know.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.440
There's probably something here
about the viruses and so on.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.960
But I went back and
I had a look to see--

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.285
I remembered I'd written a
question to myself about one

00:31:34.285 --> 00:31:36.495
of the characters
in "Lirael," which

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:39.380
was part of the
idea for "Clariel."

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.890
And I went back
and I had a look.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.190
And I saw that I'd written
a question in, I think,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.480
September 1998.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.920
So the seed of the idea
was there from 1998.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.920
And like all my books, I
spend quite a long time

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.465
thinking about them
before I wrote them.

00:31:55.465 --> 00:31:57.195
And because I'm always
writing something,

00:31:57.195 --> 00:32:02.490
I end up having a queue of
ideas forming, ideas forming up,

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.656
things where I've written
quite a lot of notes which

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.150
are progressing towards
becoming novels.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:07.970
Or not, sometimes.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.522
Sometimes they're just sitting
there in a holding pattern.

00:32:10.522 --> 00:32:14.840
And then there's the big thing,
which is a crude enough idea

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.880
mess that I have to abandon
it and get on with it

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.299
and write it.

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:21.290
And "Clariel" was
moving up that queue

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.880
and gathering bits
and pieces of ideas

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.020
and joining together, up until
about three or four years ago.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.894
It actually got a full place
in the queue where I was like,

00:32:32.894 --> 00:32:36.060
this is what I'm going to
do after the book I was then

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.920
writing.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.525
So to me, I was with
it the whole time.

00:32:39.525 --> 00:32:42.520
But, of course, to readers,
it's been a long time

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:48.020
for which I apologize for
those who felt it was too long.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.900
But that's just the
way that I work.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.375
So the idea for it, the basic
seed for it is very old.

00:32:55.375 --> 00:32:57.890
It goes back 16 years.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.010
But just the time to write
it where it was formed enough

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.970
was more recent.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:03.470
Yeah.

00:33:06.914 --> 00:33:10.358
AUDIENCE: At least you're
not Isobelle Carmody.

00:33:10.358 --> 00:33:11.834
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:11.834 --> 00:33:13.966
GARTH NIX: Isobelle Carmody
is an Australian author

00:33:13.966 --> 00:33:16.260
who's been writing a
series that I think

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.656
began around the same time
as "Sabriel," actually.

00:33:19.656 --> 00:33:23.718
So we're talking in
Australia, 20 years ago.

00:33:23.718 --> 00:33:26.013
In fact, she might have
been a bit earlier.

00:33:26.013 --> 00:33:27.390
22, 23 years ago.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.740
And has still not
written the last book.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.370
Giving George R.R. Martin
a run for his money.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.340
I should tell him that.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.295
AUDIENCE: So I started reading
your books, the "Seventh Tower"

00:33:40.295 --> 00:33:40.795
books.

00:33:40.795 --> 00:33:43.765
And that was very quick to the
"Keys to the Kingdom" books.

00:33:43.765 --> 00:33:48.715
You [INAUDIBLE] at first and
haven't really expanded on it.

00:33:48.715 --> 00:33:51.190
So I guess this is
a two part question.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.665
First, do you think you'll
expand those worlds as well

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:55.150
in the future?

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.110
And second, is there just
something about the Sabriel

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:03.317
Lirael world that compels
you to expand and return

00:34:03.317 --> 00:34:05.050
to those books instead?

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.050
GARTH NIX: Sure.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.830
The "Seventh Tower"
books were, in fact,

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.350
commissioned by LucasFilm.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.219
They own them.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:13.679
LucasFilm own the
books completely,

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.664
which means Disney now
own the books completely.

00:34:16.664 --> 00:34:18.806
So there's an
extremely slim chance

00:34:18.806 --> 00:34:22.199
I'll ever do anything
again with those books,

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.925
unless I can somehow
wrest them back,

00:34:23.925 --> 00:34:28.139
which is incredibly unlikely
considering who owns them.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:32.370
So the "Seventh Tower,"
I think it's always

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.070
impossible I would
ever go back to that.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:38.029
The "Keys to the Kingdom"
in my mind is complete.

00:34:38.029 --> 00:34:39.710
It's a complete story.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.730
It's a complete big story.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.670
That said, I'm always very
reluctant to say I definitely

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.942
won't go back, because
you never know.

00:34:47.942 --> 00:34:50.437
I think it's unlikely.

00:34:50.437 --> 00:34:52.547
There's nothing in
the queue in my head

00:34:52.547 --> 00:34:54.199
that is related to those books.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.116
But it's a big world.

00:34:56.116 --> 00:34:57.604
Potentially I
could do something.

00:34:57.604 --> 00:35:01.570
The Houses is a huge thing.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.880
I could easily find
spaces to write stories.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.676
If the right thing came along,
I might well do something.

00:35:06.676 --> 00:35:10.120
But I have no plans at
present to go back to it.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:14.550
And the second part of
question-- my tired brain's

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.390
quite just managed to hold
on to those two questions.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.110
That's as much as I
can hold in my head.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:24.465
The Old Kingdom
and Ancelstierre,

00:35:24.465 --> 00:35:28.850
there's [INAUDIBLE] to
the south of the Wall.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.620
They both offer lots and
lots of room for stories.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.965
And I really like going
back into that world

00:35:35.965 --> 00:35:37.745
and discovering
different things myself.

00:35:37.745 --> 00:35:40.370
Because I'm the kind
of fantasy writer

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.800
that I work things
out as I go along.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.970
I discover the world
as I write the story.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:49.206
So I'm not one of the writers
who works out the whole world

00:35:49.206 --> 00:35:51.438
beforehand, who
plans all the history

00:35:51.438 --> 00:35:53.670
and the languages
and the geography.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.640
I just work up what I need and
a little bit more as I go along.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.980
What I need for the story.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.470
I've very story focused.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.566
So for me, going
into the Old Kingdom

00:36:02.566 --> 00:36:06.892
is also a voyage of
discovery for me writing it.

00:36:06.892 --> 00:36:08.776
So I always really enjoy that.

00:36:08.776 --> 00:36:13.082
And, in fact, I am writing
another one right now.

00:36:13.082 --> 00:36:16.004
So there will be another Old
Kingdom novel, which hopefully

00:36:16.004 --> 00:36:17.680
will be out the year after next.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.790
Again, I'm reluctant
to say for sure.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.248
It won't be 11 years.

00:36:22.248 --> 00:36:25.080
Touch whatever this material is.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.940
This opposite.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.340
And that book picks up
from the end of Abhorsen

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.820
and from the
Creature in the Case.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.120
So it has Nicholas
and Lirael in it.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.620
But it also connects back to
some of the things in "Clariel"

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:45.810
as well, because it's a big
world which has a cosmology.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:49.790
So there's lots of
opportunities to write stories

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.337
that connect back in
with everything that's

00:36:52.337 --> 00:36:56.420
happened before in
some ways, while still

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.740
being self-contained stories.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.160
So I'm writing an
Old Kingdom novel.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.360
The next Old Kingdom
story, in fact,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.580
will be out in my next
short story collection which

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.370
comes out in May, which is
called "To Hold the Bridge."

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.030
And the lead story in that
is an Old Kingdom novelette

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.660
called "To Hold the
Bridge," funnily enough.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.187
But it also has stories--
it has a story set

00:37:18.187 --> 00:37:19.850
in the world of
"Shade's Children"

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:23.150
called "You Won't Feel a
Thing," which is possibly

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.445
the only story
completely worked up

00:37:25.445 --> 00:37:30.329
whilst having a root canal
in the endodontist's chair.

00:37:30.329 --> 00:37:31.370
No pain, I'm glad to say.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.285
I mean, really, I was super
impressed with modern dentistry

00:37:35.285 --> 00:37:39.260
that-- everyone kept telling
me about how painful a root

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.055
canal would be.

00:37:40.055 --> 00:37:42.295
And I was quite
worried about this.

00:37:42.295 --> 00:37:43.390
But there was no pain.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:44.800
It's just weird.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.480
I was slightly concerned when
the endodontist said to me,

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.911
looking at the
x-rays of my tooth.

00:37:49.911 --> 00:37:51.715
And she was looking
and she said,

00:37:51.715 --> 00:37:53.340
you have very, very long roots.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.846
They're almost off the
bottom of the x-ray.

00:37:55.846 --> 00:37:59.466
I'm going to have to borrow
a longer needle from the vet.

00:37:59.466 --> 00:38:00.912
She was joking.

00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:04.158
But just for a moment, I
had that moment of, oh no.

00:38:04.158 --> 00:38:06.210
She's got to get a what?

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:08.000
And that actually
sparked off this story.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.550
And, in fact, that
story is about teeth

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.420
with really, really long roots.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.273
Which, of course, in the world
of "Shade's Children," which

00:38:15.273 --> 00:38:17.540
is very much a dystopian,
horrendous world,

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.556
is a much, much
more horrible thing

00:38:20.556 --> 00:38:22.770
than it is in this current era.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.870
And it also has a story in
"A Confusion of Princes"

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.062
world too, called "Master
Haddad's Holiday,"

00:38:29.062 --> 00:38:31.846
as well as lots of other
collected short fiction

00:38:31.846 --> 00:38:33.427
from the last five
or six years which

00:38:33.427 --> 00:38:35.620
has been published in
various anthologies.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.712
So the Old Kingdom,
Ancelstierre,

00:38:37.712 --> 00:38:39.495
there's a lot of room.

00:38:39.495 --> 00:38:41.851
And I've got lots
of ideas for stories

00:38:41.851 --> 00:38:44.797
to write in that world, some
of which will be short stories.

00:38:44.797 --> 00:38:46.270
Some will be novels.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.707
I hope I get to
write them and I hope

00:38:49.707 --> 00:38:51.671
that you will keep reading them.

00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:53.317
Thank you.

00:38:53.317 --> 00:38:54.983
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions, but I'll

00:38:54.983 --> 00:38:56.090
give them to you one at a time.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.072
GARTH NIX: Thank you.

00:38:57.072 --> 00:38:58.545
Thank you for your
consideration.

00:38:58.545 --> 00:39:00.086
AUDIENCE: First
question is, is there

00:39:00.086 --> 00:39:01.982
any possibility of
a movie coming out

00:39:01.982 --> 00:39:03.490
about any of your books?

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.190
GARTH NIX: Sure.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:07.740
There's been lots of
backwards and forwards stuff

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.620
over the years.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.850
With "Sabriel," I took
a particular approach,

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:21.237
which is possibly a much higher
stakes approach in the sense

00:39:21.237 --> 00:39:23.952
that I wouldn't just sell
an option on the book.

00:39:23.952 --> 00:39:29.710
I wanted to be involved more
heavily, because I wanted--

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:32.478
you can't ever ensure
that it'll be a good film,

00:39:32.478 --> 00:39:35.782
but the only control you have is
who you sell it to, basically.

00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:39.355
So try and work with people
and hope for the best.

00:39:39.355 --> 00:39:41.380
So I went down
the path of trying

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:46.717
to find people, put together
a package of people,

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:49.595
which I did back in 2009.

00:39:49.595 --> 00:39:51.786
And so we did the
rounds in Hollywood

00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:55.174
with-- it was actually
Brad Pitt's company-- Plan

00:39:55.174 --> 00:39:59.046
B. And a bridge director.

00:39:59.046 --> 00:40:02.192
And I was going to carry out
the screenplay with an Oscar

00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:04.500
nominated screenwriter,
great writer.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.074
So it looked great.

00:40:06.074 --> 00:40:08.559
It was like we
had a good chance.

00:40:08.559 --> 00:40:11.541
And we did the whole go
around the studios thing.

00:40:11.541 --> 00:40:12.630
It was 2009.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.930
Interestingly,
almost everybody we

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:18.180
met including the female
heads of the studios,

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.870
had a problem with it
being a female protagonist.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.450
And there was a lot of,
when can the guy come in?

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.014
You make Touchstone
come in on page five.

00:40:27.014 --> 00:40:29.790
When can we bring
him in earlier?

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:34.445
And ultimately, that
was almost set up.

00:40:34.445 --> 00:40:37.112
There was a couple places it
went on to quite a long time.

00:40:37.112 --> 00:40:38.570
It was like it was
going to happen.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.962
And then it didn't.

00:40:39.962 --> 00:40:41.354
Who knows for what reasons.

00:40:41.354 --> 00:40:42.746
There's all kinds of reasons.

00:40:42.746 --> 00:40:44.579
And then about a year
and a half after that,

00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:46.376
it was actually set
up again pretty much

00:40:46.376 --> 00:40:48.308
with that same team,
another partner.

00:40:48.308 --> 00:40:50.240
It was actually
[INAUDIBLE] Australia,

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.689
using Australian tax credits.

00:40:51.689 --> 00:40:54.104
And then the Australian
dollar went up.

00:40:54.104 --> 00:40:57.630
And there was a question of
whether the tax offset would

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.130
apply.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:01.214
If the tax offset went away,
then $20 million in the budget

00:41:01.214 --> 00:41:01.730
went away.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.038
So the whole thing went away.

00:41:04.038 --> 00:41:05.439
Which is that world.

00:41:05.439 --> 00:41:09.268
That world works like that.

00:41:09.268 --> 00:41:12.726
After that, I actually
wrote a screenplay for it.

00:41:12.726 --> 00:41:14.404
It was the guy I was
going to write it

00:41:14.404 --> 00:41:16.184
with ended up writing a
couple of television shows,

00:41:16.184 --> 00:41:17.172
being super successful.

00:41:17.172 --> 00:41:19.148
He had no time.

00:41:19.148 --> 00:41:23.594
But I talked about it
enough, I wanted to do it.

00:41:23.594 --> 00:41:26.558
I hoped that would
help move things along.

00:41:26.558 --> 00:41:29.454
So there was a
screenplay of "Sabriel."

00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:31.745
At different times, there's
been different combinations

00:41:31.745 --> 00:41:33.980
of people trying to set it up.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.367
Right at the moment, there's
an attempt to set it up again.

00:41:38.367 --> 00:41:40.331
But who knows.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.873
It's like a lot of books.

00:41:41.873 --> 00:41:43.801
Some of them never
get made into films.

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:47.791
Some get made into films 30
years later or 50 years later.

00:41:47.791 --> 00:41:48.957
I would love to see it made.

00:41:48.957 --> 00:41:53.165
I'd love to see it made
by really good people.

00:41:53.165 --> 00:41:54.650
It's out of my control.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:56.534
I've done everything I can.

00:41:56.534 --> 00:41:57.950
On "Shade's
Children," people have

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.600
been trying to set it
up for a long time.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.016
There's a New
Zealand horror movie

00:42:01.016 --> 00:42:02.570
director who wants to do it.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:06.227
There's a guy, actually,
a Chinese special effects

00:42:06.227 --> 00:42:07.643
guy who wants to
make it in China,

00:42:07.643 --> 00:42:09.500
which I think could be amazing.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.470
But he can't get the
money together either.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.955
It's always about money.

00:42:13.955 --> 00:42:16.925
Always.

00:42:16.925 --> 00:42:19.895
They're not drawing
room comedies

00:42:19.895 --> 00:42:21.875
you can make very cheaply.

00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:24.845
Though, of course, you can make
them more cheaply now than you

00:42:24.845 --> 00:42:26.825
could at one time.

00:42:26.825 --> 00:42:29.300
"Keys to the Kingdom" has
been television people

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.790
trying to set that up.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:33.756
So I have a long
history of things

00:42:33.756 --> 00:42:36.630
not working out in that regard.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.030
I mean, I often say that
I'm a successful novelist,

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.428
but I'm a very
unsuccessful screenwriter.

00:42:41.428 --> 00:42:44.392
Because I've also written
original screenplays

00:42:44.392 --> 00:42:48.050
that I've tried to set up
which have not, as yet, gotten

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.550
set up.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:49.383
But fingers crossed.

00:42:49.383 --> 00:42:52.162
You never know.

00:42:52.162 --> 00:42:54.572
I guess one of my
little daydreams

00:42:54.572 --> 00:43:00.436
is that somebody who
loved the books growing up

00:43:00.436 --> 00:43:04.409
is even now becoming a
great director whose films I

00:43:04.409 --> 00:43:04.909
will love.

00:43:04.909 --> 00:43:07.394
And, in turn, they
love my books.

00:43:07.394 --> 00:43:10.287
And they'll be so powerful
that the studio will go, yes.

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:11.370
Whatever you want to make.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:12.605
You want to make "Sabriel."

00:43:12.605 --> 00:43:13.855
You loved it when you were 12.

00:43:13.855 --> 00:43:14.355
Sure.

00:43:14.355 --> 00:43:15.296
Go for it.

00:43:15.296 --> 00:43:16.837
And I'll be like,
I love their films.

00:43:16.837 --> 00:43:17.831
This is fantastic.

00:43:17.831 --> 00:43:20.813
So that could happen.

00:43:20.813 --> 00:43:21.807
It's a daydream.

00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:24.284
A good daydream. [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:24.284 --> 00:43:25.783
AUDIENCE: I hope
that does work out.

00:43:25.783 --> 00:43:26.777
My second question.

00:43:26.777 --> 00:43:30.093
So I read "Sabriel"
at a very young age.

00:43:30.093 --> 00:43:32.558
And it ruined me.

00:43:32.558 --> 00:43:34.530
It set the bar so high.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:35.516
And so--

00:43:35.516 --> 00:43:37.974
GARTH NIX: I'm not sure if I
should apologize [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:37.974 --> 00:43:38.474
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:38.474 --> 00:43:40.939
AUDIENCE: But as obviously a
writer of excellent fantasy,

00:43:40.939 --> 00:43:43.420
who do you like to read?

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.716
GARTH NIX: Sure.

00:43:44.716 --> 00:43:46.208
Well, I read all kinds.

00:43:46.208 --> 00:43:47.874
I mean, I do read
fantasy but I probably

00:43:47.874 --> 00:43:51.526
read more other stuff,
particularly now.

00:43:51.526 --> 00:43:55.510
And that's just how things
have developed, I suppose.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.502
I do go through periods
of reading fantasy,

00:43:57.502 --> 00:43:58.498
trying to catch up.

00:43:58.498 --> 00:44:02.482
Which is impossible, of course.

00:44:02.482 --> 00:44:03.976
So I read a lot of non-fiction.

00:44:03.976 --> 00:44:06.458
I read a lot of other
kinds of fiction.

00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:08.458
I read a lot of thrillers
and historical novels.

00:44:08.458 --> 00:44:09.840
And I re-read a lot.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.984
I love re-reading.

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:17.956
But in terms of fantasy,
one of my big favorite

00:44:17.956 --> 00:44:19.956
contemporary fantasy
writers is Guy Gavriel Kay.

00:44:19.956 --> 00:44:23.940
I've just re-read
his "River of Stars,"

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.932
which is a wonderful,
wonderful novel.

00:44:25.932 --> 00:44:28.920
I've not read anything
else, but anyone else

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.912
could easily read it, of course.

00:44:30.912 --> 00:44:37.386
I mean, my books, I think, are
not necessarily [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:37.386 --> 00:44:42.117
Publisher categorization is not
really what books are about.

00:44:42.117 --> 00:44:44.358
It's where it's most
convenient to sell them.

00:44:44.358 --> 00:44:47.595
And so Guy Gavriel Kay's--
almost any of his books.

00:44:47.595 --> 00:44:51.330
But "Under Heaven"
and "River of Stars."

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.326
He just gets better.

00:44:52.326 --> 00:44:53.992
He's one of those
really annoying people

00:44:53.992 --> 00:44:56.808
who just gets better and better.

00:44:56.808 --> 00:44:59.860
I mean that in a good way.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.722
So I love his fantasy works.

00:45:03.722 --> 00:45:04.696
Holly Black.

00:45:04.696 --> 00:45:06.644
I just read "The Coldest
Girl in Coldtown."

00:45:06.644 --> 00:45:09.079
I like that quite a lot.

00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:12.975
Who else have I read
recently in the genre.

00:45:12.975 --> 00:45:15.897
Maggie Stiefvater's
"The Scorpio Races,"

00:45:15.897 --> 00:45:20.124
which is a really good book, and
very different kind of fantasy.

00:45:20.124 --> 00:45:23.603
It's really interesting.

00:45:23.603 --> 00:45:27.827
But I think going back, there's
many classic fantasy writers

00:45:27.827 --> 00:45:28.573
I love.

00:45:28.573 --> 00:45:30.561
And particularly some
of the influences

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:34.537
on "Sabriel," I
think, which deserve

00:45:34.537 --> 00:45:37.849
looking at, like Robin McKinley,
"The Blue Sword" and "The Hero

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:40.004
and the Crown," I think,
were a big influence.

00:45:40.004 --> 00:45:42.489
Ursula Le Guin, of course.

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:45.968
"Wizard of Earthsea" and
"The Tombs of Atuan,"

00:45:45.968 --> 00:45:47.459
perhaps even more so.

00:45:47.459 --> 00:45:51.435
Susan Cooper. "The Dark
is Rising," her books.

00:45:51.435 --> 00:45:54.914
Alan Garner, a British
fantasy writer [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:54.914 --> 00:45:56.930
which I read very often.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:46:00.024
And his book, "The Owl
Service." "The Owl Service"

00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:02.008
is such a strange fantasy.

00:46:02.008 --> 00:46:05.480
It's so powerful,
and it's so lyrical.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.753
And I've often said if I could
write anything half the way

00:46:08.753 --> 00:46:11.928
as good as the last 3
pages of "The Owl Service,"

00:46:11.928 --> 00:46:15.400
I'll be a very,
very, happy writer.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.880
That's the bar
really high, I think.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.360
That's the bar
really, really high.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.013
But there's so many.

00:46:22.013 --> 00:46:23.832
I mean, what are some
of your favorites?

00:46:23.832 --> 00:46:25.320
AUDIENCE: You named a couple.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.630
I like Diana Wynne Jones.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:28.296
GARTH NIX: Oh, I love
Diana Wynne Jones.

00:46:28.296 --> 00:46:28.792
AUDIENCE: Contemporary.

00:46:28.792 --> 00:46:29.458
GARTH NIX: Yeah.

00:46:29.458 --> 00:46:31.437
In fact, I just
read the last book

00:46:31.437 --> 00:46:35.240
which her sister finished,
"The Islands of Chaldea."

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:39.208
It just came Ursula Jones, which
is very interesting because you

00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:42.018
can't tell where her sister
took over, which I think

00:46:42.018 --> 00:46:44.168
is a testament to both of them.

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:47.474
But yeah, I loved
her stuff growing up.

00:46:47.474 --> 00:46:49.128
I love re-reading it now.

00:46:49.128 --> 00:46:50.616
Who else?

00:46:50.616 --> 00:46:51.608
AUDIENCE: Oh, boy.

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:54.118
Of course, Ursula Le Guin.

00:46:54.118 --> 00:46:55.576
GARTH NIX: Putting
you on the spot.

00:46:55.576 --> 00:46:56.816
AUDIENCE: You are
putting me on the spot.

00:46:56.816 --> 00:46:58.056
I didn't expect this.

00:46:58.056 --> 00:46:59.275
GARTH NIX: When you
ask em these questions,

00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.691
my mind goes
completely blank even

00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:03.626
though I've been
asked quite often.

00:47:03.626 --> 00:47:04.590
There's so many.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.036
AUDIENCE: There are too many.

00:47:06.036 --> 00:47:08.830
GARTH NIX: Lloyd
Alexander is a great name.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:09.826
Again, going back.

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:14.806
But there's many fantastic
contemporary writers as well.

00:47:14.806 --> 00:47:17.794
There's always so many
good books around.

00:47:17.794 --> 00:47:22.276
Old ones, new ones, one that
will come out next week.

00:47:22.276 --> 00:47:25.138
We're lucky to have such a--
there are ones that are not

00:47:25.138 --> 00:47:29.746
so good as well, of course--
but there are so many good ones.

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:30.655
So much to read.

00:47:30.655 --> 00:47:31.738
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:47:31.738 --> 00:47:34.222
GARTH NIX: Thank you.

00:47:34.222 --> 00:47:35.722
AUDIENCE: Earlier
this week, we were

00:47:35.722 --> 00:47:38.710
joined by Chris Baty, who's
the founder of National Novel

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.947
Writing Month, in which
people will try and write

00:47:41.947 --> 00:47:43.690
a novel during November.

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.258
I was wondering, of
that mind, if you

00:47:45.258 --> 00:47:47.508
could talk a little bit about
your own writing process

00:47:47.508 --> 00:47:49.996
and maybe offer some advice
for a budding novelist.

00:47:49.996 --> 00:47:50.662
GARTH NIX: Sure.

00:47:50.662 --> 00:47:51.658
Sure.

00:47:51.658 --> 00:47:56.140
Well, I think NaNoWriMo's
a great thing to do.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.124
And it seems to help a lot of
people break out of some habits

00:48:00.124 --> 00:48:04.455
and so on, and find new habits.

00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:07.740
In terms of my own writing,
I write half my novel,

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.630
the first dozen or so
novels that I wrote,

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.975
I wrote while I had
a very busy day job.

00:48:12.975 --> 00:48:17.430
And I would write just a couple
of hours two nights a week.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:19.410
And I would try and
write three or four

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.370
hours on the Saturday or Sunday.

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.370
And I would try to be
quite [INAUDIBLE] about it

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:25.350
and really keep
to that schedule.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.465
If do that, in a year
or a year and a half,

00:48:27.465 --> 00:48:28.890
you can write a book.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.740
Sometimes writers
get up and they say,

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.780
this is how you write a novel.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.114
And it's how they write a novel.

00:48:34.114 --> 00:48:35.779
Or it's how they wrote
their last novel.

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:37.170
It may not actually
apply to you.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.575
So I always recommend
to people, take anything

00:48:39.575 --> 00:48:41.460
a writer says with
a grain of salt.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.000
It may or may not apply
to your own writing.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.275
I think it's important to
always bear that in mind.

00:48:48.275 --> 00:48:50.370
So if you do something
which is exactly

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:54.215
the opposite of what
someone has told you to do,

00:48:54.215 --> 00:48:55.900
that may actually be fine.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.725
So whatever works.

00:48:57.725 --> 00:48:58.985
And try different things.

00:48:58.985 --> 00:49:01.360
Try different ways of writing.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.680
I do think finding a routine
of some kind is good,

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.055
but it doesn't have
to be get up at 4 AM

00:49:08.055 --> 00:49:09.055
and write for two hours.

00:49:09.055 --> 00:49:11.180
That's the only way.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.040
Or write two nights a week.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.810
It could be, I don't know.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:16.816
You could work it out.

00:49:16.816 --> 00:49:18.704
But then since I've
been a full time writer,

00:49:18.704 --> 00:49:20.467
I've flipped that
around and I actually

00:49:20.467 --> 00:49:21.550
write during office hours.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.760
I have a separate office.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.240
I had two separate offices
in a different home--

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.615
I also worked at
home and I still

00:49:27.615 --> 00:49:29.900
work at home to some
degree, in the spare bedroom

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.355
in the corner, as
was as in my office.

00:49:33.355 --> 00:49:35.270
And what I try to
do is I don't set

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:40.818
myself word count targets,
though I do keep track of them,

00:49:40.818 --> 00:49:42.690
like in "Mr. Monday."

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.382
I will keep track
of each chapter

00:49:44.382 --> 00:49:47.710
as the first draft is finished.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.250
Particularly I do like looking
at the numbers going up.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.990
It's encouraging.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.660
And also one of the
things i do is I never

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.680
tell myself I'm writing a novel.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.830
I never tell myself, right.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:00.236
Today I sit down and I
write 100,000 word novel,

00:50:00.236 --> 00:50:01.673
because that's a lot of words.

00:50:01.673 --> 00:50:04.068
I say, I'm going
to write a chapter.

00:50:04.068 --> 00:50:06.470
A chapter is two or
three or maybe 4,000.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.220
And that's doable.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.560
It feels to me that's
a discrete task.

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.676
I won't try to do
it all in one go.

00:50:13.676 --> 00:50:16.592
Some people say, you
have to do 1,000 words

00:50:16.592 --> 00:50:19.030
before you can get up and go
have a coffee or whatever.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.780
I don't do that.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:24.865
But when I do sit down to
write in my writing routine,

00:50:24.865 --> 00:50:28.487
I try and write a sizable
chunk of something.

00:50:28.487 --> 00:50:30.320
And then when I feel
like it's time to stop,

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.485
I make myself do
a little bit more.

00:50:32.485 --> 00:50:35.870
I make myself write a bit more
than the first time I decided,

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.920
oh, I've had enough of this.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.983
And I also sometimes
do-- there's

00:50:39.983 --> 00:50:42.250
another technique
people always recommend,

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.805
which is never get up when
you've finished a chapter

00:50:45.805 --> 00:50:50.485
or finished a discrete piece of
writing, a scene or a sequence

00:50:50.485 --> 00:50:51.520
in a screenplay.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.540
Never get up and say
whoa, I'm done with that

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.950
and get up straightaway
and start drinking

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:57.870
or whatever you do.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:59.971
But actually write a little
bit of the next thing.

00:50:59.971 --> 00:51:02.345
So if you've written a chapter,
write the first paragraph

00:51:02.345 --> 00:51:04.456
of the next chapter
and then get up

00:51:04.456 --> 00:51:07.000
and do whatever you have to do.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.194
And then when you
come back to it,

00:51:09.194 --> 00:51:10.735
you've already got
something started.

00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:13.779
You don't have to say,
well, what do I do now?

00:51:13.779 --> 00:51:14.570
It's already there.

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:15.445
It's already started.

00:51:15.445 --> 00:51:19.960
And you've also done it in
the flow of the momentum

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.410
that you built up
writing before.

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.826
So I think that's a little
trick that can be very helpful.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.884
And I think there are
issues with momentum.

00:51:28.884 --> 00:51:31.144
The more you do, the
more you will do.

00:51:31.144 --> 00:51:34.290
The more you've written,
the faster it gets.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:38.210
And the other thing I'll say
is that I typically really hate

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:43.750
my books around about halfway
through, sometimes earlier.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.930
And this is quite normal.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:47.980
Almost every writer
I know, in fact,

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.720
hates their books
at different times.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.095
And often it's
around the middle.

00:51:51.095 --> 00:51:54.870
And so I will complain to
my wife, who's a publisher.

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.400
So it's very unfair
having a [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.240
author at home as
well as at work.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.680
And I'll say, ah.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.644
I really hate this book.

00:52:02.644 --> 00:52:04.025
And I've forgotten how to write.

00:52:04.025 --> 00:52:04.836
I don't know.

00:52:04.836 --> 00:52:07.621
How did I write
those other books?

00:52:07.621 --> 00:52:09.954
Whatever I used to be able
to do, I can't do it anymore.

00:52:09.954 --> 00:52:10.950
It's hopeless.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.436
This whole book sucks.

00:52:14.436 --> 00:52:16.940
I can't go on.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.860
And then if I complain
to her, she'll

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.956
remind me that I always do this.

00:52:20.956 --> 00:52:23.090
When she's not around,
I'm just doing it myself.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.868
I'll remind myself that
I always feel like this.

00:52:25.868 --> 00:52:29.200
And the only answer to it is
ti go back and keep going.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.955
And typically you look back and
it's not as bad as you think,

00:52:32.955 --> 00:52:35.348
and also you can fix it up.

00:52:35.348 --> 00:52:37.056
Because revision's
such an important part

00:52:37.056 --> 00:52:38.934
of the whole writing process.

00:52:38.934 --> 00:52:40.350
Even when you've
written something

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:44.430
that you think is great and
you're really happy about it,

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:46.301
it's always worth
going back to it.

00:52:46.301 --> 00:52:48.342
It's always worth going
back to it at some point.

00:52:48.342 --> 00:52:50.383
And typically what happens
is you write something

00:52:50.383 --> 00:52:52.540
and you think it's really
terrible and you hate it.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.990
Or you think it's really
great and you love it.

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:57.286
Probably neither of those
things is entirely true.

00:52:57.286 --> 00:52:59.570
So it's always
important to go back.

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.130
Revise.

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:02.890
Sometimes you have
to go back a lot.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.660
What i often do-- another
little technique that I do.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.640
Again, this may or may not work.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.950
Is that I typically will read
what I wrote the day before,

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.970
before I start
writing the next bit.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:16.650
And as I'm reading it,
I will also revise it.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:18.640
So my first chapters
are typically

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.362
revised as many
chapters there are

00:53:21.362 --> 00:53:23.314
chapters in the book, at least.

00:53:23.314 --> 00:53:25.432
SO if it's a 35 chapter
book, the first chapter

00:53:25.432 --> 00:53:27.486
will have been revised 35 times.

00:53:27.486 --> 00:53:31.150
And the last chapter, it won't
have been revised only once.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:33.460
But it will have been
revised two or three times.

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:36.465
Partially, that's because
the momentum build

00:53:36.465 --> 00:53:39.230
and I get faster
and more assured.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:42.210
And I know the story
better, and my excitement

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:44.605
builds up as I get
towards the end.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.830
Again, I can look back
on my [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:50.772
It's "Grim Tuesday" in the back.

00:53:50.772 --> 00:53:53.530
And I can see looking
at that, that I wrote

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:57.030
the first-- it's
got 23 chapters.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:05.350
I wrote the first
half in six months,

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.970
and I wrote the second
half in 5 weeks.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:10.570
So momentum builds.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:14.682
So forcing yourself
back to work,

00:54:14.682 --> 00:54:17.300
or looking at what you've
written and carrying on,

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.860
always going a bit further
than you think you need to.

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.484
All those things, I
think, work very well.

00:54:23.484 --> 00:54:25.814
And I think NaNoWriMo
is a great thing to do.

00:54:25.814 --> 00:54:29.100
And you never know if you can
write a novel until you try.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.565
And a lot more people,
I think, can write.

00:54:32.565 --> 00:54:34.990
A lot of people think they
can't because it's too long.

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:36.709
But they've never
actually tried.

00:54:36.709 --> 00:54:38.617
I think if you try,
you never know.

00:54:38.617 --> 00:54:41.200
Unless you've written, you never
know what can happen as well.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.196
Every new book is
a new opportunity.

00:54:43.196 --> 00:54:44.194
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:44.194 --> 00:54:44.693
GARTH NIX: Thank you.

00:54:44.693 --> 00:54:45.025
Good luck.

00:54:45.025 --> 00:54:45.691
Are you doing NaNoWriMo?

00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.695
AUDIENCE: I am, yes.

00:54:46.695 --> 00:54:47.570
GARTH NIX: Good luck.

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:49.050
Read Scott
Westerfeld's book, too,

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:54.010
"Afterworlds,"
which is quite new.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:58.226
It's all about writing
novels and the first novel.

00:54:58.226 --> 00:54:59.280
It's a story.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:54:59.850
It's a novel.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:03.100
But it's in that world, writing
novels and NaNoWriMo and stuff.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:03.992
AUDIENCE: Good to know.

00:55:03.992 --> 00:55:04.090
Thanks.

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:04.756
GARTH NIX: Yeah.

00:55:04.756 --> 00:55:05.560
Cheers.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.530
AUDIENCE: I was
just curious where

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.752
the inspiration for
the names-- like,

00:55:10.752 --> 00:55:13.348
Sabriel, Lirael, Clariel--
there's clearly a theme there.

00:55:13.348 --> 00:55:17.140
But how do you come up with
the names for your characters?

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:17.980
GARTH NIX: Sure.

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:23.334
Well Sabriel, Clariel, Lirael,
and so on, they deliberately

00:55:23.334 --> 00:55:26.320
hearken back and resonate
with angels' names.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:31.330
They use the Hebrew "ael"
"iel" endings recursively.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:35.600
Sabriel, when I was
making up that name,

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:39.026
I did probably 20 or 30
different combinations,

00:55:39.026 --> 00:55:40.980
different word combinations.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.535
And what I'm
normally looking for

00:55:42.535 --> 00:55:45.520
is something that resonates
in a particular way.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.923
And whether the reader's
aware of it or not,

00:55:47.923 --> 00:55:49.546
it will suggest
to them something.

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:58.075
And, of course, using those
Hebrew word components

00:55:58.075 --> 00:56:00.420
of angels' names
actually suggests

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.110
something mysterious
and powerful.

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.080
It sounds like an angel's name.

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.000
Angels are mysterious
and powerful.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.630
These connections are
made inside of your head.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:12.140
And you may or may
not be aware of it.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.850
So that's a very
deliberate choice.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:17.870
But I spent a lot of time
combining different pieces

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:21.660
of words to make names that not
only have the right resonance,

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.500
but also sound right.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.000
So I'll say them
aloud a lot until I

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.358
find a name that works for
me, and it feels right.

00:56:29.358 --> 00:56:32.966
It feels like it
carries the right weight

00:56:32.966 --> 00:56:35.456
for who the character will be.

00:56:35.456 --> 00:56:36.950
So that's how I
make up the names.

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:39.880
But I will say, I steal names.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.635
Abhorsen comes from Shakespeare.

00:56:42.635 --> 00:56:45.510
Abhorsen in "Measure for
Measure" is an executioner.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:49.790
And when I was looking for
the name of the family,

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:53.520
Sabriel's family, and I
wanted an executioner's name.

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.110
I was looking back
through history and myth,

00:56:56.110 --> 00:57:00.170
and looking for different
names of famous executioners.

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:03.350
And I couldn't find
one that worked for me.

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.487
And then quite accidentally,
I was reading "Measure

00:57:05.487 --> 00:57:08.520
for Measure" and there was
Abhorsen, an executioner.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.560
And I thought, there's the name.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.970
Shakespeare stole a
name, so I can do it too.

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:14.930
Thank you.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:23.070
Any more questions, or
are all done for now?

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:24.060
Thank you very much.
