00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.270
So I came across this
idea the other day,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.186
I think it was Aristotle
who put it out there,

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:24.730
but it was this notion
that human beings

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.550
don't care about spectacle.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.740
What they care about is
ecstatic understanding.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.540
Understanding, comprehension.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.090
In other words,
cognitive ecstasy

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.930
defined as an
exhilarating neuro storm

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.110
of intense
intellectual pleasure.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.515
The book "The Ravenous
Brain" talks about this idea,

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.810
that consciousness is
obsessed with pattern.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.170
Pattern is structure,
structure amidst

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.900
the chaos, a signal
in the noise.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.670
And when we find patterns,
when we connect the dots,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.000
we experience this cognitive
ecstasy, this exhilarating

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.030
neuro storm.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.373
And we get children,
they're young,

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:07.956
they're learning all
the time, they're

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:09.025
creating new
synaptic connections.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:11.470
They experience this cognitive
ecstasy, this curiosity.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.705
This insatiable drive to
understand is on fire,

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:19.250
is fervor, is [? feral ?]
in little kids.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.390
Imagine the first time
you look at a microscope.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.210
You see that cosmos--
revealed for the first time--

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.490
of the microscopic.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.440
When you look
through a telescope,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.420
and you all of a sudden see
the cosmos of the macroscopic.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.170
Perhaps the best line was
Ross Anderson's description

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.050
of the ontological awakening
provided by the Hubble Space

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.130
telescope's images
of the deep field.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.890
He said, "Through the
sheer aesthetic force

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.070
of its discoveries,
the Hubble distilled

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.110
the complex abstractions
of astrophysics

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.140
into singular expressions
of color and light,"

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.280
vindicating Keats'
famous couplet,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.309
"Beauty is truth, truth beauty."

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:09.100
The sad part, as Sir
Kenneth Robinson says,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.780
is that we lose
this as we grow up.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.620
Our educational
institutions are failing us,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.620
they're not providing the
context for this curiosity

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.560
to explode, to continue
to emerge indefinitely.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.760
Instead we slowly die.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.110
And I think our goal
is to create media,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.950
to create content,
to create spaces

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.460
that allow us to stay
curious, to stay alive,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.270
to awaken the wonder
junkie in all of us,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.770
to unleash the brave,
reckless gods within us all.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.210
That is my goal.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.470
That is why we make
[? Shots of All ?], that

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.100
is why I love the
TED conference, that

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.460
is why we're here, that
is what we live for.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.100
Ahhhhh.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.030
Moves me every day.
