I think we should be very concerned with
the youth unemployment crisis at the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569
the youth unemployment crisis at the
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.110
the youth unemployment crisis at the
moment because we are actually in danger

further and solve some of the crises
that we are seeing at the moment one of

that we are seeing at the moment one of
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779
that we are seeing at the moment one of
the things that I'm doing here at the

World Economic Forum is to talk about
the multiple crises to say we're not

the multiple crises to say we're not
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.740
the multiple crises to say we're not
only experiencing an economic and

financial crisis we also seeing a
 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.490
financial crisis we also seeing a
resource and climate crisis that is very

resource and climate crisis that is very
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.280
resource and climate crisis that is very
severe and that the crises are

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
severe and that the crises are
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.160
severe and that the crises are
interlinked which means that one of the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
interlinked which means that one of the
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.229
interlinked which means that one of the

are going up and becoming both rising in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
are going up and becoming both rising in
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640
are going up and becoming both rising in
a large speed but also becoming a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
a large speed but also becoming a
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.429
a large speed but also becoming a
volatile so we are in a new situation

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
volatile so we are in a new situation
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.620
volatile so we are in a new situation
that's a game-changer there's really a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
that's a game-changer there's really a
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.010
that's a game-changer there's really a
new paradigm shift of the basis of our

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
new paradigm shift of the basis of our
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.319
new paradigm shift of the basis of our
economies that the resources have risen

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
economies that the resources have risen
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.560
economies that the resources have risen
in this way so if we want to solve that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
in this way so if we want to solve that
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690
in this way so if we want to solve that
problem together with the economic and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
problem together with the economic and
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.999
problem together with the economic and
financial crisis we should look at all

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
financial crisis we should look at all
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460
financial crisis we should look at all
the new innovation that can help us

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
the new innovation that can help us
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.859
the new innovation that can help us
become more resource-efficient that can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
become more resource-efficient that can
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.740
become more resource-efficient that can
help us handle the the natural resources

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
help us handle the the natural resources
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.319
help us handle the the natural resources
in a more intelligent way getting more

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
in a more intelligent way getting more

just came out with some figures on how

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
just came out with some figures on how
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.309
just came out with some figures on how
many jobs new jobs can be created

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
many jobs new jobs can be created
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.930
many jobs new jobs can be created
worldwide if we were to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940
worldwide if we were to
 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.850
worldwide if we were to
really take this problem serious and try

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
really take this problem serious and try
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.130
really take this problem serious and try
and solve the the resource crisis and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
and solve the the resource crisis and
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.210
and solve the the resource crisis and
they point to 15 to 60 million jobs new

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220
they point to 15 to 60 million jobs new
 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.150
they point to 15 to 60 million jobs new
jobs created worldwide in just handling

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
jobs created worldwide in just handling
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.790
jobs created worldwide in just handling
the the resource crisis and trying to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800
the the resource crisis and trying to
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.220
the the resource crisis and trying to
get more out of less so I see this as a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230
get more out of less so I see this as a
 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.990
get more out of less so I see this as a
big opportunity of creating some of the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
big opportunity of creating some of the
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.210
big opportunity of creating some of the
new jobs so that we're not just sending

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
new jobs so that we're not just sending
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.010
new jobs so that we're not just sending
what jobs from one part of the world to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020
what jobs from one part of the world to
 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.890
what jobs from one part of the world to
the other but actually creating new jobs

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
the other but actually creating new jobs
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.270
the other but actually creating new jobs
another last figure that I would like to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280
another last figure that I would like to
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.990
another last figure that I would like to
point to is a figure saying that we

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
point to is a figure saying that we
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.580
point to is a figure saying that we
could save around 2.9 trillion dollars a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590
could save around 2.9 trillion dollars a
 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.140
could save around 2.9 trillion dollars a
year in 2030 if we manage resources more

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
year in 2030 if we manage resources more
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.330
year in 2030 if we manage resources more
in challenges it's intelligently and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
in challenges it's intelligently and
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.840
in challenges it's intelligently and
save resources and really try to make

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850
save resources and really try to make
 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.640
save resources and really try to make
this shift towards a circular economy

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
this shift towards a circular economy
 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.890
this shift towards a circular economy
where the resources are being circulated

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
where the resources are being circulated
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.040
where the resources are being circulated
over and over again and where we protect

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050
over and over again and where we protect
 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.280
over and over again and where we protect
our oceans our forests our air our water

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
our oceans our forests our air our water
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.750
our oceans our forests our air our water
all the things that are the basis of our

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760
all the things that are the basis of our
 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.540
all the things that are the basis of our
lives and our economy then we will have

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550
lives and our economy then we will have
 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.520
lives and our economy then we will have
huge savings and they would of course be

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
huge savings and they would of course be
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.250
huge savings and they would of course be
a large business opportunity connected

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260
a large business opportunity connected
 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.310
a large business opportunity connected
to this agenda so let's solve all three

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
to this agenda so let's solve all three
 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.820
to this agenda so let's solve all three
crises at the same time
