00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.480
 Have you ever felt so in your stomach that a decision may be wrong or true? But you do not realize why? 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.520
 Our intuition has always been a mystery related to risk and obsession, but is there a science behind the subject? 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.540
 Do you have to trust your inner strength? 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.440
 To understand something immediately without logical thinking has nothing to do with seeing the future and has more to do with identifying patterns. 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.680
 If this patch shows you a real chess game for five seconds, can you rearrange it? 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.380
 Studies tell us that most chess beginners can rearrange twenty-five percent of them, 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.960
 While chess masters can rearrange 95% of them. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:45.400
 But if the test is re-tested completely, both beginners and experts will remember 25 percent of them. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.600
 Experts do not have a photographic memory - they simply use their knowledge and intuition 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.750
 Based on patterns that have passed through years of practice! 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.910
 Our brain processes information through both slow and rapid thinking as an example, 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.090
 This exercise will cause stress as a reaction, and your mind will enter the process of slow thinking to solve it, 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 But this picture requires quick thinking, because understanding feelings of sadness 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.820
 It is an immediate response of the brain, and there is a sense of rapid thinking. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.200
 In a similar study on the game "Shogi" Japanese, asked the contestants to like 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.509
 The last movement leads to a loss, within one second. With no time for conscious analysis, the brain scan did not appear 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.169
 Any activity in the cortex in the professional players in the "Shogi", which is responsible for conscious thinking in the brain. 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.620
 In contrast, the basal contract - part of the brain - is responsible for the formation of habits and spontaneous behaviors. 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.060
 Interestingly, when it comes to a complex decision as buying a home, many believe 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.140
 That thinking carefully with a list of pros and cons is the best, but one study actually found that the participants 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.740
 Choose the best option when they turn to the quick decision, 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.700
 It turns out that we take into account only a subset of the right information that may lead us to weigh the false significance of each feature. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.300
 The study also showed that those who trust his intuition 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.370
 Was more satisfied with his long-term decision than with those who carefully thought about the process. 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.939
 However, when you buy simple things like toothpaste 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.199
 Where diversity is not as complex, studies have found that thought-based decisions are more useful. 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.640
 Do you think you can recognize your own voice? Amazing that after listening subscribers 

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:20.841
 In a study of several consecutive recordings including their own voices, seventy-five percent of them made a mistake in distinguishing their own voices, 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.440
 But the really amazing part is that by measuring the skin's mobility too, 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.660
 Response levels were higher when they heard their own voice, although they did not consciously distinguish it, 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.580
 Indicating that they had ignored their inner intuition, which knew the correct answer first. 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.340
 The phenomenon is repeated in a card game that uses 4 distributions of paper. 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.440
 Participants choose any card from any group, which may be either good or bad. Without their knowledge 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.360
 Initially, the first two groups "A" and "B" contain more bad cards, while "c" and "d where good cards more. After selecting ten 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.159
 Cards The participants had no idea what was going on, but after 50 cards, the majority suspected 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.819
 Some distributions were better than others. In the end, after 80 cards, they were able to determine 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.340
 The two groups "A" and "B" were Saitin, and the two groups, "c" and "d" competently, but once again, before we know the idea consciously, 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.010
 Their skin reaction levels rose early during the first 10 cards in reaction 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.050
 When approaching group "A" and "B". Their skin was already making unconscious signals about 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.500
 The correct choice before they do their consciousness, of course, the skin did not realize the correct answer 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.260
 But their unconscious mind began to understand the pattern before their conscious mind. 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.739
 If you follow your instincts is always the optimal way? It turns out that it is not the case in cases of sympathy. 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.760
 It turned out from a study involving more than nine hundred common, that when it comes to interpretation and understanding 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.500
 Others did the right thing, organized thinking and careful analysis 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.740
 The information available before making any decision was more successful than relying on the sense of what is true. 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.860
 Relying on our previous experience is the basic way of how our inner intuition has been, and has helped 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.269
 Our ancestors distinguish the friend from the enemy. But we gave two systems to think - fast 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.429
 And slow, we recommend following both.

 audible.com/asap. This day we want to nominate you the book "Khorzmiyat to live by" 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.040
 It's an exciting look at how computer algorithms can apply to our daily lives
