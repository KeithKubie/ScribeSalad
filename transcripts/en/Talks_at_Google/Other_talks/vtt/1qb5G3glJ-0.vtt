00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.670
Chris: Welcome to our sort of Electronics
People at Google Talks.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.900
Today, we have Nathan Seidle. Sigh. Duh. Sigh.
Duh.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.710
He said, "Just say 'Sigh' and then say, 'duh.'"
And so, I'm trying to do what he said.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.289
Nathan started SparkFun -- how many years
ago?

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.859
Four years? Seven years ago.
It's an overnight sensation.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.259
And he's going to tell you all about that.
I gave away Arduino boards to the first 29

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.820
of you.
Thank you for coming early.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.620
I'm sorry I don't have more for you.
I'm sure that your managers will help you

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.990
expense anything you want to buy from SparkFun.
So, with no further ado, Nathan.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.030
&gt;&gt; [applause]

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.039
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Excellent. Thank you, Chris.
Yeah, so Nathan Seidle.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.359
How many of you have heard of SparkFun before
I came?

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.339
Oh, fabulous. Okay.
And how many of you were at Maker Faire over

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.560
the weekend?
Oh, fabulous. You guys know what I'm going

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.499
to talk about then.
This is pretty straightforward.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.000
I just got done with two days of Maker Faire.
I think there was like 60 or 70,000 people

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.560
there.
It was a ton of fun.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.290
We ran a bunch of people through our booth
teaching them how to solder.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.890
And so, we're just going to talk about where
SparkFun came from and some of the stuff we

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.460
do there.
So do I have to stand here or can I walk over

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.400
there?
You probably won't hear me if I walk over

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.990
there.
Okay, fine. So this is me.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.670
A quick background -- please stop me at any
time.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.450
This is not a presentation. This is more of
a conversation.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.270
So if you guys have a question or something
doesn't make sense, please interrupt me and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.380
ask.
And I'll -- if I don't know the answer, I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.600
usually make one up.
University of Colorado in 2004, so I haven't

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.500
been out of college that long.
I did not take this class in college, right?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920
In business, I actually don't know what I'm
doing.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.630
I got an electrical engineering degree.
And so, most of what we do is engineering,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.310
but there's a lot of business that goes on
in the background.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.500
That's me with the red hair about the third
from the left on the rowing team shortly after

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.890
Halloween a couple years ago.
Why that's important is because I was working

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.320
in the dorms.
I was working at the Olympics. I was on the

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.229
club team.
And when I graduated college, I realized that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.220
all I had to do was work.
That's fabulous. I can do that, right? Yes,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.220
sir.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.550
&gt;&gt;male audience #1: [inaudible] Was your hair
redder than it is now?

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.260
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: A little runner, yeah, that
was like bright red after Halloween.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.390
28 years old.
I come from Oklahoma, which is a state there

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.060
in the middle somewhere -- not that important.
And no other family experience in business.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.870
This is sort of the first hack at it.
So we've been in -- in the beginning -- in

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.920
2003, whenever I first started the company
 -- we were in bedrooms and basements for

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.540
the first three years.
This is actually a picture of my bedroom with

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.590
about five days worth of orders on it.
So, you can see it was really quite small

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.500
to begin with.
We've grown quite large.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.790
But you've got to realize that, in the beginning,
when we were doing business -- I say "we"

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.010
a lot, right?
That's the proverbial "we."

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.630
Because we didn't want people knowing -- would
you feel comfortable purchasing stuff from

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.600
somebody's bedroom that looked like that,
right?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.540
Not really, right?
We've made ourselves look bigger than we really

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.170
were.
Whenever we answered the phone, we said, "Oh,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.459
I'm really sorry.
I'll talk to shipping for you.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.020
I'll make sure that that never happens again."
Well, I sit down on my bed and cut open the

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.740
box and fix whatever order I had just messed
up.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.209
So, in the beginning, we weren't really sure
how many orders we were going to get.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.150
And I was pretty surprised to see that the
first order came through in seven hours.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.680
I had spent about a month or two putting the
website together and getting inventory up

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.500
and taking pictures.
And when the first order came through, I went,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.040
"Oh, I guess I need a box." [laughter] Right?
Starting a business, you don't really think

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.050
about all the aspects including order fulfillment.
And, as an engineer, I kind of had to fumble

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.180
through that.
When I started the business, I assumed I would

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.120
be selling to my friends at CU.
I would be selling to folks in Colorado.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.050
And when the third order came through from
France, I realized that I had grossly underestimated

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.989
the size of our market.
It was pretty fabulous.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.169
And, on top of that, how do you ship to France?
I had no idea.

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.819
So every day is a new day in business.
And you know when the order comes through

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.319
from France, you go, "Okay, well.
I guess I'll figure out how to ship this to

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.499
France." So the hundred percent Paypal for
three months -- that was important, because

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:35.599
in 2002-2003, it was difficult to accept credit
cards.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.330
Now, it's pretty common place and pretty easy
to set up, but back then, you had to do something

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.719
called a "merchant account."
And a merchant account is this application.

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.680
You answer a bunch of very hard questions,
weird questions.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.039
You give them about 100 to 110 dollars for
the application fee.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.319
And so, I filled all this out, and a couple
days later, I get a FedEx envelope, right?

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:00.340
And inside the FedEx envelope is a disposable
camera with five pictures on it, right?

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.059
I'm going, "Why in the world did they send
me a FedEx?"

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:06.069
So, from the shipping label, I realize that
it came from the merchant service people.

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.680
So I call them up, and I say, "Hey, I just
gave you a hundred bucks and wanted a merchant

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.110
account and you guys sent me this disposable
camera.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.800
That's not really what I was looking for.
What's going on?"

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.580
And they said, "Oh, no problem.
We sometimes have a problem with fraud.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.020
And so, we need for you to take a picture
of your inventory.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.249
Take a picture of your shipping department,
and take a picture of the outside of your

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.539
facility." [laughter] Right?
I say, "Well, ma'am, that's fine, but that's

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.939
the inside of my bedroom, the inside of my
bedroom, and the outside of my bedroom."

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.289
And she said, "Oh, that's fine."
"Okay."

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.289
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.759
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: So, I took these
pictures and FedExe'd it back to them, and

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.370
they approved that. [laughter]
So I don't know how bad it has to be not to

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.249
get approved, but at least in 2002, that was
enough.

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:58.339
So we were very lucky.
Manufacturing -- in the beginning, I had absolutely

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.639
no money for capital.
And so, the way that we did manufacturing

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.770
 -- normally, you do that with very large
machines and millions of dollars for the capital.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.349
We didn't have that.
And we couldn't borrow and we couldn't raise

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.770
it.
And so, we -- necessity is the mother of all

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.689
need, right?
Or, whatever it is.

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:18.659
We figured out how to do manufacturing with
a $40 hot plate, right?

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:26.339
We had to create ways of building electronics,
because we had no other way of doing it.

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.419
So lots of tutorials online about that.
We kind of share everything that we do -- very

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.420
transparent about it.
And in three years -- the first three years

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.849
of business, we did 10,000 orders.
That's important, because we're currently

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.949
doing 10,000 orders a month.
So, in seven years, we've grown to that magnitude

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:49.319
where things have gotten pretty crazy.
And here we are -- 87 employees.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:56.039
We ship to 170 countries and counting, and
we did 10 million in revenue in 2009, so.

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.000
I'd never dreamed it would get this big.
I thought we were going to plateau at five

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.319
employees and a million a year.
And then, here we are at 10 million, and there's

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.160
no end in sight.
So we are in a very, very happy time right

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.649
now in the expansion of electronics and building
stuff, right?

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:18.399
We all want to hack.
So, how far do people remember back in electronics?

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:25.669
When I was an engineering student in 2002-2003,
this is sort of what the websites looked like.

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.969
If you're an engineering student and you needed
parts -- if it was surface mount, it was incredibly

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:34.129
hard to access because you had to learn how
to solder that stuff and the breakout boards

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.460
weren't really available and the technology
was really hard to access.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.800
Of course, Radio Shack. I mean, they're awesome.
They've been extremely successful, but now,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.389
they just kind of sell cell phone chargers,
right? [laughter]

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.639
And so, to get access to those electronics,
it isn't just around the corner anymore.

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.159
We now have to go to these big, thick, printed
catalogs.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:58.949
And what they did with those catalogs in roughly
2000 is, they chopped them up, and they put

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:01.800
them online.
And this is what you get.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.189
I don't know what a Quad 2-input NAND gate
is -- that first line right there -- and it's

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:10.189
40 cents, but where's the picture?
Where's the data sheet? Where's how I hook

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.379
that up?
Give me an example of how I would use this

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:15.139
part.
This isn't rocket science, right? But this

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:19.719
is in 2002.
And they really had really poor websites.

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:23.580
So, in 2002, I thought I could do better.
I knew that if I was having these problems,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:29.050
other folks were too.
And in 2002, I was programming PIC micro-controllers.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.440
I had a programmer. I set it down on some
bits of wire.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.631
And that programmer cost me $200.
And when I set it down on those bits of wire,

00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:42.140
there was a spark.
And some smoke came up, and I fried my $200

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.800
programmer in a couple seconds.
I was a poor student.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.600
I didn't have the money to begin with for
that $200 programmer.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.811
And here I am burning it up.
So the only way I could afford another one

00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.779
was finding the cheapest thing I could online.
And where I found it -- this company called

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:01.050
Olimex kept popping up.
And I don't know about you, but that's still

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.399
how their website looks today and that doesn't
really instill shopper experience to me.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:10.910
They don't have online checkout.
To this day, the way that you buy -- they're

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.829
really good programmers, and they're very
inexpensive, but you have to send them an

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:19.250
e-mail say, "Hey, I'd like to buy this."
And they e-mail you back with the form, and

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.629
they say, "Oh, no problem.
It's 35 bucks plus $7 for shipping.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:26.610
Please fill out this form with your credit
card information and fax it back to Bulgaria."

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:32.570
[laughter]
I don't really know how to fax to Bulgaria,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.420
and I'm not really cool with that.
So let's try to do something better.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.589
And so, that's where I saw the void, because
I said, "Maybe I can do better."

00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:46.620
And so, I started importing these parts from
Bulgaria back in 2003 just as a distributorship.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.980
Just saying, "Hey, this is really cool stuff,
but I bet I can make it a little bit easier

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.370
for folks to buy."
And here we are.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.930
This isn't rocket science, right?
It's Add to Your Cart. Here's a picture of

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.540
it.
But back in 2002-2003, this was groundbreaking

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.690
to have a close-up picture of electronics?
I thought it was simple, but for a lot of

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.920
folks, it was completely wild.
And this has taken seven years to get here

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.029
and a lot of IT and a lot of marketing and
communications layout and all that fun stuff,

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:19.690
but yep, now we have a website that sells
stuff. Cool.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.750
Most of you folks -- if you know about Maker
Faire, if you know about SparkFun, you know

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.040
what these electronics are.
You know about hardware.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:32.500
But I just want to give you a quick breakdown.
That black chip -- top, left picture is a

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.399
microcontroller. What is it?
It's a $2 computer that can run at 20 million

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:40.610
things a second. Okay, cool.
So I program it in whatever language I can

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.610
find -- basic, C -- I've seen some stuff in
Java.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.600
It's pretty powerful stuff, right? You load
your code on to that.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.370
And every time I turn it on, it does one really
simple thing. Okay?

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:56.199
So if we use the microcontroller to talk to
 -- the picture directly below it on the left

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:59.650
is a motion sensor.
I'm looking around the room. You guys don't

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.060
have any motion sensors.
Most security systems have the little thing

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.069
in the corner of the room so that when you
walk around, it detects that motion.

00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:09.589
And so, it can tell presence in the room,
okay?

00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:15.660
That's a motion sensor -- ten bucks, okay?
So top and to the right is a Servo.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.440
What can I do with a Servo?
Well, you control the Servo. It's an output.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.850
So, with the microcontroller checking to see
if somebody is in the room or there's some

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.220
sort of movement, we can then control the
motor to do something.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.709
The best application I've seen of this, right?
It's 15, 20 bucks worth of parts.

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:35.490
It's -- the Servo was connected to the power
button on a blender.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:41.399
Why would I need to connect a motion sensor
to a microcontroller to a blender?

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:47.240
Because of the website.
Let's see if we can bring it up running. BlenderDefender.com.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.589
[laughter]
This gentleman had a problem with his cat

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:57.639
jumping onto the counter. [laughter]
And the way that you take care of that, and

00:11:57.639 --> 00:12:02.050
you know -- you scare the cat off the counter.
And it doesn't hurt the cat.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.690
The cat learns over time to keep off the counter.
[laughter]

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:10.519
But it was a problem that he had.
With very inexpensive electronics.

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:13.089
A very simple thing.
Will it ever be a consumer product? Probably

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:17.970
not. [laughter]
But did he take care of the problem? Absolutely.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:23.060
So, just interesting applications of very
common electronics.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.389
And then, over to the right, the thing that
says XBee is a Wireless Module.

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:30.370
Very simple to pass stuff back and forth.
Directly below that is the Arduino board.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:35.209
I'm sure most of you have heard of the Arduino.
But it's a rather inexpensive development

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:39.480
platform -- has a microcontroller on board.
It's all open source.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.709
Uses a form of C and processing and some other
open source languages.

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:47.960
Very low barrier to get started.
So, the Arduino board is slowly but surely

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.681
taking over the world.
I heard they've shipped over 150,000 units.

00:12:51.681 --> 00:12:56.640
That's a lot of Arduino boards.
Lots of instructors, lots of artists using

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.750
it.
Really interesting board.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.800
And then, just to the left of that, it says
BMP085 breakout.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.990
It's a barometric pressure sensor so sensitive
that it can detect the difference between

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.449
30 centimeters of air.
So if I hold it here, I get a reading.

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:15.709
If I hold it here, I get a different reading.
It's that sensitive. Okay?

00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:19.699
That sensor -- and this is the secret sauce
to SparkFun, by the way.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:23.810
That sensor was developed by Bosch.
They probably spent 5 to 10 million dollars

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.339
developing that, tuning it, producing it,
figuring out manufacturability, getting reliability

00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:32.279
down, and what does SparkFun do?
Well, we came along and we bought that sensor,

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.889
and we soldered it to a board.
And look at how much bigger it is.

00:13:34.889 --> 00:13:39.839
It's about ten times the size of that sensor.
Well, that sensor is really cool, but you

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.560
can't use it.
It's surface mount. It's difficult to use.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.350
So, what SparkFun does -- the secret sauce
 -- is, we break it out.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.310
We solder it to a board. We make it a little
bit bigger.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:52.089
And we test it to make sure that it works.
And we provide you with example code.

00:13:52.089 --> 00:13:56.360
What is it? It's a shortcut.
Yeah, you could lay out your own board.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.660
You could solder it yourself.
We show you how to do all that.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.699
But, really, if your project is to get into
some barometric pressure reading project,

00:14:03.699 --> 00:14:07.589
let us sell you the breakout that works and
you get on to your project.

00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:11.069
So that's all we do is we make things more
accessible.

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:16.230
Any questions, by the way? Anything? Cool.
We'll keep [inaudible]script.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:21.240
So, a lot of people ask and are surprised
by where SparkFun gets its stuff.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.430
We do a lot of manufacturing in-house.
We're based out of Boulder, Colorado.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.720
And we have about 1500, 1600 skewSKUs at this
time.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.829
1600 different things that you can buy on
the website -- 300 of those things are designed

00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:38.260
and built in-house, okay?
Let's see, so on the left, we've got what's

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:44.110
called a Pick and Place Robot.
Those things cost us about $50,000. It sounds

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.139
like a lot.
They're actually quite cheap in comparison.

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:52.210
Well, you at home -- and we show you on our
website how you can build surface mount electronics

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.720
 -- you can build them by hand.
You can build them with a $40 hot plate.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.019
And we did that for years.
You get a Pick and Place Robot not because

00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:05.019
you need it to build electronics.
You need it whenever you need to build 500

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:09.449
of something.
A human -- I can myself build 20 or 30 of

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:13.279
an item, but when we need 50, when we need
a hundred, when we need 500.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:19.220
That's when we finally get to the output or
the scale where these machines are necessary.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.259
And we partner with unique innovators worldwide.
We collaborate with a lot of different folks.

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:29.749
I don't have a lot of passion for -- I don't
know -- bicycle electronics, okay?

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:33.680
But there's some folks out there that live
and breathe and die by bicycle electronics.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.699
And so, they are the best at creating this
bicycle lamp.

00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:41.970
I may not be, but they are.
And so, we team up with them and help them

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.930
build the widget that they need built.
Okay. So we team up with folks that are truly

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.100
innovative in their field and work best at
building and laying out PCBs.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.430
So we kind of share the innovation.
And finally, relationships with reliable global

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.790
manufacturers.
If we're not best at creating USB cables,

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.629
let's find the person that is and buy USB
cables from them.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:07.740
Let's find the person that's best at creating
the little bits and pieces that everybody's

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.930
going to need -- wall adaptors and all these
different things.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:14.699
And we import them.
And I'm kind of happy -- I was in Shen Zzhen

00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:18.180
February of last year.
Just mind boggling amounts of electronics.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.670
It's like a kid in a candy store.
It's so much fun, like the crazy stuff over

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.709
there.
But this is a brand that I thought was really

00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:25.709
interesting.
I don't know if you can read.

00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:30.550
It's like a green laser projector.
It comes from a newish brand.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.290
It's the brand written on there.
Doesn't that really make you want to buy it?

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:42.379
It's not new. It's newish. It's almost new.
Yeah. Looks like it actually worked it just

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:48.300
said.
I thought it was kind of fun.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.209
The elevator speech for SparkFun.
And this is the best analogy that I've heard.

00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:55.249
It comes from a friend of mine who works at
a company called Acroname.

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:56.990
And we were talking over lunch one day, and
he's like, "You know what?

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.569
SparkFun is like Home Depot."
I was like, "Oh, that's kind of interesting,"

00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:03.470
right?
You go to Home Depot, and you walk down the

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.339
store and there's wood and there's screws
and there's plaster there.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.930
But you don't expect to see a bathroom on
the shelf that you can just pick up and put

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.420
in your cart, right?
They may have demos.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.650
They may have different things showing you
how you could redo your bathroom, but they

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.030
don't sell you the bathroom.
That's how it works at SparkFun, right?

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.810
We don't sell you a cell phone. We don't sell
you a laser pointer.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:27.330
We show you the bits and pieces that you could
string together to build something interesting,

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.100
and that's -- and we educate you how to do
it.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.770
And we encourage people to do it themselves.
Soldering are in there in the corner.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.950
And then, down below was a Halloween project,
okay?

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.950
So I wanted to show folks how to use electroluminescent
wire -- EL wire.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.160
It's kind of bendable plastic stuff that's
got phosphorescent built inside.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.910
So when you expose it to high voltage, it
lights up these brilliant colors, okay?

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.600
It's also called "cold neon," because it's
like neon light, but it's flexible.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.120
So what I did is -- just for the fun value
 -- I went online and found a site called

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.680
"LuckyMonkey Dragon," -- and bought a straightjacket.
Really good like canvas-like restricting straightjacket.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.480
And on the front of it, I put a blue heart
in EL wire.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.800
And I put another one and another one and
another one, right?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.420
And they were individually controlled by a
microcontroller -- an Arduino -- a high voltage

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.330
source and a lithium forpolymer battery, so
you can walk around in a straightjacket and

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:25.610
have a beating heart, right?
And people really thought this was a deep

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.500
piece of art installation.
They were like, "Oh, my God. It's like love

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.940
ties you up," and all this stuff.
I just bought a straightjacket and put some

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.860
electronics in it, [laughter] but they thought
it had really deep meaning.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.250
So, lots of tutorials online to show you how
to hook stuff up.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.900
Again, is this ever going to be a consumer
product? I hope not.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:50.550
But it should show you how you could do your
own EL wire project.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.810
We never expected the number of communities
to come out of this, okay?

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.720
We knew that there was going to be hobbyists.
We knew that there was going to be engineers

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.290
working on stuff in their garage and all these
different things.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:04.390
And over time, we keep getting these e-mails
from people doing like bird migration.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.340
You know, RFID in nests, and trying to figure
out how much they weigh when birds come and

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.890
go.
And "Wow, our stuff is in there? That's crazy."

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.590
Car modification. Atmospheric research.
So this is one that I'm currently really into.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.720
I'm hoping to launch in a couple of weeks.
But it's helium balloons seven feet in diameter.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.330
You let them go, and they pop at 110,000 feet,
okay?

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.220
You got about four pounds that you can lift
to 110,000 feet.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:35.820
So what do you do? You take pictures.
That's an amateur Canon camera at 110,000

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.320
feet taking a picture of the curvature of
the earth. That's amazing.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.670
And we couldn't do that 10 years ago, right?
It took a military budget.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.070
It took a government grant to pull off some
of this stuff.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:51.570
And now, we can launch it in our own backyard.
Kinesiology -- measuring how the body responds

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.070
to things.
We have a guy who's using our accelerometers

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.000
to measure base jumping, right?
He jumps off of things, and he was wondering

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.190
why his neck hurt so bad, right?
[laughter]

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.280
And you look at the accelerations.
When his parachute pops, they pack this thing

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.940
so tight that it actually -- it's the equivalent
of a mild rear-end collision, right?

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.650
So there's a lot of deceleration and forces
acting on the human body.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:20.860
And so, some of our sensors help detect that.
Aerospace. And, of course, burning man, right?

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.840
We all need blinky stuff for burning man.
So I like to think that there's some of our

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.890
stuff out there.
So we're going to talk about couple of examples.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.620
Wearable electronics.
So the one on the left has what's called the

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.690
"LilyPad."
Some really interesting embedded electronics

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.250
developed by Dr. Leah Buechley.
She's in the media lab now.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.470
You sew with conductive thread, right?
And you can put this into your clothing.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.570
And you can connect different parts of your
clothing and have them talk to each other

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.430
using conductive thread.
Then, there's the musical group, OK Go, doing

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.830
a lot with music and lighting and some really
interesting YouTube videos.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:05.580
And, of course, everything needs to Twitter.
Everything.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:13.260
So, top right corner is the -- what it does
is, it measures soil water content, okay?

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.320
So let me know whenever my plant is getting
thirsty.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.440
Except put sort of a snark to it.
So it sends you some really mad and evil Twitters

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.070
whenever you don't water your plant.
[laughter]

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.190
And then, I don't know if you can tell, but
in the bottom left, there's a methane sensor

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:33.660
in his chair, right? [laughter]
So it Twitters every time someone's -- yeah.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.250
And then, up in the top left is -- you put
a band across a pregnant woman and it Twitters

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.630
every time it feels baby movement.
Kind of interesting.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.450
And then, there in the middle, of course,
we have the SparkFun tweeting kegerator.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.420
So every time you take a beer, it tells us
what the weight contents of the keg is so

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:59.360
that we try to never run out.
You guys have any questions? No? Cool.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.990
This was Halloween last year.
A gentleman ran a pumpkin patch.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:10.580
And he told us that he had a pumpkin trebuchet.
And we said, "Wow, that's really cool."

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.900
So we decided to team up with him, and we
stuck a bunch of electronics inside of a pumpkin.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:21.250
And it was amazing.
There's a bunch of things.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:31.660
That where it hit the ground, right?
We hit like nearly 30 g's as that pumpkin

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:37.390
like destroyed the surface of the earth.
We broke an axis on one of our accelerometers.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.570
So it threw this pumpkin like 300 yards down
the corn field.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.590
This thing was amazing and scary to stand
next to.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.300
Why do this? Just because it's fun.
Just because you get to throw electronics

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:55.390
down a corn field.
The data nowanalysis, if you zoom in on some

00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:00.700
of the acceleration data.
You see the little blips along the curves.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.670
What is that going up? What is that little
thing? Exactly.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.320
It's the rotation of the pumpkin.
We figured out the pumpkin was spinning at

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:13.720
about 7 Hertz.
You might be able to design a better trebuchet

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.660
using this information.
I don't know, but it's fun to look at the

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:26.830
data and figure out how things affect the
world with electronics and monitoring stuff.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.740
The good, the bad, and the ugly.
So I don't know if you guys saw this home

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.510
page -- electronics, right?
Everything we build can be used for good and

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.780
for bad.
And so, a couple of months ago -- we generally

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.120
post good stuff on our home page.
"Hey, check it out -- pumpkin throwing, model

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.540
rocketry, kids soldering."
All sorts of things like that.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.901
We got an e-mail from a customer who said,
"You know, I want you to know -- I don't want

00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:52.070
to make it public.
Just wanted you guys to know in a private

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:59.190
e-mail that on the front cover of the Waterloo
News in Canada was this article," right?

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.670
It's a gentleman holding up electronics and
everything is kind of fuzzy and the only thing

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:11.020
that you can see in focus is SparkFun.com
[laughter] written across this hunk of electronics."

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.730
And what it was, was -- in Canada, you go
to grocery store, you buy all your stuff,

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:19.600
at checkout, they hand you this little piece
of electronics, you swipe your credit card,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.260
type in your pin number, and hand it back
to the person checking you out, okay?

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.490
Well, this had been going on for awhile and
something had broken, so that hand-held device

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:32.370
went in for repair.
And when they opened it up, there was a bunch

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.461
of extra electronics that shouldn't have been
there, right?

00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:40.870
And it said, "SparkFun" -- uh, oh. [laughter]
So, what they had done is, they had been modifying

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.920
these to log the credit card numbers.
And then, they would walk into the grocery

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.880
store with their cell phone and, over bluetooth,
download all the credit card numbers, right?

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.420
So, this is a very bad application of electronics,
right?

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.120
This is using electronics for bad.
But is it going to happen? Yes.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.730
Should we stop selling that bluetooth module
because of it? I don't think so.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.990
We sell thousands and thousands of those bluetooth
modules.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.210
I saw one being used earlier today to control
robots over cell phone and do all sorts of

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.580
cool stuff with electronics, right?
So, bad things happen.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.960
And so, we need to sort of be aware of that
and try as a community to sort of direct that

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:25.120
away and do good things with electronics.
And then -- I don't know if you guys saw -- it's

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:33.310
on Adult Swim -- the LED Mooninite.
It's a Mooninite, yes.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:39.590
So, it was a marketing stunt for Comedy Central.
A PR firm put together some LED signs, and

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:44.730
that is a character from that series.
And they put these signs up around Boston.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:51.020
Well, Boston PD didn't think too highly of
us, and described them as "bombs," thought

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.771
that they were they were terrorist activity.
And the PR firm and everybody got in a lot

00:25:55.771 --> 00:25:58.700
of trouble.
It's an LED, right?

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.890
How can we educate the community to know the
difference between safe electronics and unsafe

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.780
electronics?
This is just a sign.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.710
So I thought that that was kind of interesting.
And then, that's just TJ in receiving, and

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:16.400
he's very helpfulugly.
The guys at SparkFun -- we do all of our internal.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.910
We do our product shoots.
We take photos of all of our products and

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:24.230
give them a little freedom and creativity,
and [mumbling]they get kind of wild. So those

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:29.850
are our new lab coats.
So, with the good, the bad, the ugly, right?

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.630
We sort of described what the new rules of
electronics are.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.600
And this goes back to when I was an electrical
engineer.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.780
I was made afraid of hooking stuff up.
"Are you absolutely sure that it's correct?

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.340
Have you got it hooked up backwards?
Have you got the right voltage?" All these

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.560
things.
And I never really got to tinker much.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.410
I was always going through the steps [inaudible]and
doing these different things.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:51.000
What I learned is that you really just have
to plug it in, right?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.250
And if something goes wrong, unplug it, right?
It's not the end of the world.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.440
It's actually kind of hard to destroy an 18
ATmega.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.190
It's kind of hard to destroy an Arduino.
There's thousands of them out there, and those

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.020
things are rock solid.
The worst thing that you do is reverse power

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.440
on something.
You go, "Ooh. Oh, shoot! I hooked it up wrong."

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.610
You pull it back, you plug it in the right
way -- it'll probably still work.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.220
Electronics are being built more and more
robust every day.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.710
So don't worry about it. If it sparks, unplug
it, right?

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:23.020
That was kind of fun actually, right?
I've learned a lot whenever stuff sparks,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.320
right?
You learn a lot from your failures.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.040
If it smokes, "Man, that was fun." Turn it
off.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.860
If it heats up, check it and plug it back
in, right?

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.020
Some things need to heat up.
Yes, sir.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.670
&gt;&gt;male audience #2: [inaudible]You had the
blender example at the beginning and said

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.680
you sell stuff that integrate electronics
with high power equipment like 120 volts and

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680
[inaudible].

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.920
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Good question.
So how do you interface to like main power

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:50.210
 -- 120 volt / 220 volt -- stuff like that.
As an embedded engineer that does most of

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.870
his stuff with batteries, 120 volts scares
me -- 110 volts, stuff like that.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.530
We do have some high power relays. We do have
some tutorials.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:06.270
The reflow toaster controller is one where
we try to turn on and off a toaster oven to

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.360
help with reflow.
We also have some other products that now

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:15.550
allow you from a 5-volt pin to turn on and
off a very good extension cord effectively.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.470
So, that is a big problem to turn on and off
blenders, but there's lots of ways to hack

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.740
it.
Be safe. If you're messing with 120, be very

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.780
safe.
But if you're messing with batteries, especially

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.540
alkalines, they'll internally limit themselves
and shut themselves down.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.920
Any other questions? Cool.
And don't with afraid of trying something

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.600
new.
That's where I was with SparkFun electronics.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.260
Whenever I was trying something new -- I was
working on that microcontroller -- that's

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.150
when my programmer sparked, but that's when
I was having the most fun, right?

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.000
So it's when you're right out there on the
edge, when you're having the most fun.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.680
This is the GPS wall clock.
At SparkFun, we were selling GPS modules.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.040
And I wanted to show people that GPS gives
you longitude and latitude.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.300
But a lot of folks didn't realize that it's
very accurate time.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.540
So I went to Home Depot, and I bought a bunch
of materials.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.700
And, you know, you could build a clock, right?
With little 7-secondgment displays.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:12.260
Or you could build a 24 inch per segment 12
foot long GPS clock, right?

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:17.600
Bigger, it lights up the office green.
And the best part was when, we had just put

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.240
this up.
I don't know if you can tell, but there's

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.080
an LCD monitor sitting right underneath it.
That was Eric's desk back in the day.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.300
He was one of the employees at SparkFun.
So he's working there on the computer.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.930
And Pete, one of the jokers in the office
would walk by and say, "Hey, Eric!"

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.560
And Eric would turn around, "Yeah, Pete."
Pete would go, "Hey, Eric -- do you have the

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.290
time?"
Eric would go [looking down]. "Yeah," Pete's

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:42.150
like, "3:15."
"Oh, thanks."

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.650
Pete would walk back by. "Hey, Eric. Do you
know what time it is?"

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.730
"Dude, it's like 3:45."
It's a giant clock behind him, right?

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.440
And just kept pulling Eric's leg -- had no
idea.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.590
So, GPS wall clock. It's a tutorial now.
And Google -- we love Google and Google loves

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.850
us, right?
We like to be seen as a resource.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.580
We like to be seen as a place that you can
go to get information.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.920
And, because of that, we were ranked very
well.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.470
So when you Google "GPS clock," we show up
second or third behind Wikipedia, behind some

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:16.740
very -- much better resource sites.
But this tutorial pops up very high which

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.940
educates people and then drives traffic to
our website.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:24.610
So that's a lot of how we get our traffic,
new customers.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.700
And so, that's effectively it.
Trevor, could you give me a buzz?

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.060
And so, this was a project that we did like
couple years ago.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:39.030
This was one of our first tutorials.
This was like 2004, I think, when the Motorolla

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:43.250
Razr had just come out.
And the Motorolla Razr was the smallest like,

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:48.360
the lightest -- the weirdest thing.
[phone rings]

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.950
So my friends and I had a bar bet about Who
could build the biggest, noisiest, heaviest

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.430
phone? [phone rings]
And so, we all joked about it.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.760
Who could build -- and I was like, "Ah, that'd
be really funny if it was this giant thing

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.620
or whatever."
And, the back of my mind, I went home thinking,

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.480
"Oh, maybe I could pull that off."
So I jumped on Ebay.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.960
And where do you find the biggest, heaviest
rotary phones?

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.630
Of course, on Ebay. I didn't have one sitting
around.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:15.411
And it took a couple weeks.
Tore out all the insides. Put in a cell phone

00:31:15.411 --> 00:31:18.980
module.
And now, we have a rotary cellular phone,

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.630
okay? [laughter]
I get really funny looks from bouncers taking

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:27.880
this out to bars. [laughter] Right?
They say, "What are you doing with that?"

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.090
"It's my cell phone."
"No, it's not.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.310
What are you doing with that?"
They're afraid I'm going to hit somebody with

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.381
it, right?
And so, big, heavy, rotary phone.

00:31:36.381 --> 00:31:38.970
We didwrote a tutorial about it.
We said, "Hey, this is what we did."

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.370
We tore out the insides.
You can actually dial out on it.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.860
So there's a microcontroller inside that looks
at the switches.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.670
There's a technical write up about how you
decode the rotary.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.650
Oh, it's got a touch interface by the way,
right?

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.110
Sorry, bad joke. [laughter]
So it works pretty well.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.520
We wrote the tutorial, and the next couple
of days, our site went down.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:03.060
There was so much traffic from all these different
sources, and we got written up in the New

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.060
York Times, right?
That's an article.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.930
People went crazy over this retro effectthing.
And we got hundreds of e-mails asking, "Oh,

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:13.030
my God, where can I buy one?"
And we said, "No, no, no. It's a tutorial.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.960
It's there to show you how to build it yourself."
And, you know, that wasn't enough.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.940
We kept getting e-mails. And "Okay, fine."
I had the parts to build two of these.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.823
One was built -- worked kind of okay.
And I had the parts to build another one.

00:32:24.823 --> 00:32:28.600
So I said, "Well, the parts cost me 150 bucks."
Maybe we could sell it for 200 bucks and make

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.430
some profit.
"No, no -- let's make it 300.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:34.780
Let's make it $400 so that nobody buys one."
[Laughter]

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.990
Well, we've been selling them ever since.
[laughter]

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.940
So, it was very cool.
So now, when you Google "rotary phone," I

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.580
like to brag that we still show up second
behind Wikipedia, right?

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.480
And that's exactly where we should be, right?
We're not -- Wikipedia is the real resource.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.110
Man, there's this weird tutorial that everybody
links to about this rotary phone hack.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:33:01.650
So that's where SparkFun islives.
And then, if -- one more slide because I was

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.500
told to kind of add it in.
We had a SparkFun free day.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.960
I don't know -- have you guys have heard about
this? Cool. Yeah.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.012
Hopefully, you guys got to hear about it.
And hopefully, you participated in it, and

00:33:13.012 --> 00:33:17.140
you got a free $100 order.
But I had this crazy idea of giving away a

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.410
hundred thousand dollars.
Anyways, we didn't know what we were getting

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:24.360
ourselves into.
So, if you see the big spike we had -- I don't

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.590
know -- five, eight, ten times the amount
of traffic that we used to.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:33.060
And we brought on sort of a maelstrom.
But the badge of honor for our IT group was,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:39.300
for about an hour on that day, we were the
number one, most-searched term on Google.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.440
And that was a really, really big deal to
us, right?

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.330
That's the badge of honor for our IT guys.
And we think it was the number one search

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.500
term because our site was down.
So everybody was wondering.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.280
They were searching about it rather than actually
being able to get to the site.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.470
But that's okay.
So that was Free Day, and that's sort of SparkFun

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.610
and that's our market.
Do you guys have any kind of questions about

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.390
what we do and what we build?
Yes, sir.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:12.552
&gt;&gt;male audience #3: Do you have a favorite
new product on the SparkFun website or something

00:34:12.552 --> 00:34:13.552
up-and-coming?[inaudible]

00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:14.552
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Do I have a favorite up-and-coming
product?

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.552
Is there something coming that

00:34:15.552 --> 00:34:19.820
&gt;&gt;male audience #3: Or just something that's
on there now that has you really excited.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.370
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: -- great question.
Stuff that has me really excited?

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:29.139
I don't know. I'm kind of a sensor guy.
So that the new sensors that are coming out

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.120
that have -- first it was the Triple Axis
Accelerometer.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.830
Now, that has completely been monecommoditized
by the wiWii.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:37.960
Inside the wiWii, there's a Triple Axis Accelerometer,
right?great.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.380
And now, there's Dual Axis Gyros and the first
Triple Axis Gyros are just coming out.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.700
And what this means is, you have now a single
sensor that can detect three axes of rotational

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.710
speed.
The next chips to come out in the next six

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.440
months or a year -- I'm predicting -- are
the combination cellsstuff.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.690
So you have a single chip that has triple
axis accel, triple axis gyro.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.980
What that means is, we get really interesting
tracking.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.060
Okay, you can do all sorts of crazy dead reckoning.
Whenever GPS goes away, and you walk into

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:08.400
a building, you then start to calculate, "Okay,
what's going on?" And so, we get indoor tracking

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.860
a lot better than what we had.
It's not perfect, but it's better.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:16.060
So that's not something we're selling, but
that's something I'm hoping that those big

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.880
chip foundries will spend lots and lots of
money developing.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.280
And then, we'll break out, and get to play
with.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.351
&gt;&gt;male audience #4: Will it fit on a cat collar?
[inaudible]

00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:24.351
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Will it fit
on a cat collar?

00:35:24.351 --> 00:35:27.970
Cat tracking is actually one of my highest
priority projects.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.580
There's some really interesting stuff out
there with cats.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:36.920
That's sort of the overall size comparison.
If it's small enough to go onto a cat, then

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.381
we're getting to the size that we can start
tracking some really interesting stuff.

00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:41.381
Yes, sir.

00:35:41.381 --> 00:35:43.650
&gt;&gt;male audience #1: Do you still run this?
[inaudible]

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.321
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Good question,
so -- Am I still doing some of the business

00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:50.030
stuff or have we hired somebody to help me
do it?

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:54.640
I am still under the delusion that I can handle
it.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.160
It's going pretty well so far.
One of the problems is that I haven't gotten

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:05.450
to do as much engineering as I'd like to do.
And yeah, there's really only one project.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:07.960
I've given up all the projects to our engineering
group.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.380
The only project that I work on now is this
data logger called "OpenLog."

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.600
And I get to spend four or five hours a week
working on that.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.120
And so, that's the project that keeps me sane.
I really have to carve out that time and keep

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.150
it my own.
The business stuff, I'm hacking my way through

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:27.240
it and sort of learning from everybody I can.
But I realize that there is going to come

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:34.030
a point where we are going to have to hire
somebody else to do the business aspect of

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.030
it.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.030
&gt;&gt;male audience #5: [inaudible]Can you talk
about the cease and desist?

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.030
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Oh, the cease
and desist.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.590
Yeah. GI'm good friends with Sun Microsystems
now.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.300
So, we got a cease and desist letter.
I don't know if you guys read on the website.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.520
So, SparkFun was running for about six-and-a-half
 -- seven -- years, and we get our first cease

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.920
and desist letter that says, "Please take
steps to immediately turn over the SparkFun.com

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.630
domain."
Are you kidding?

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.820
I'm like "No, that's going straight for the
throat."

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.700
And it came from K&amp;L Gates, which is a big
law firm here in California.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.870
And they represented SPARC International.
I don't know if you remember SPARC servers

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:10.460
from the late 90s, early 2000s -- SPARC with
a C.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:15.640
And we had just filed for the SparkFun trademark,
and that's where the cease and desist came

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.140
from is that SPARC had to defend their trademark
against the SparkFun trademark.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.821
Long story short. Did a home page post about
it.

00:37:21.821 --> 00:37:25.860
They get a lot of phone calls about it.
And we have signed a coexistence letter so

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.510
that everybody seems to be pretty happy.
But it was just sort of -- what do you call

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:34.500
it -- like a belt mark or belt tab along the
way of this SparkFun history.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.290
We got our first cease and desist. We learned
what it meant.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.840
And we now know how to sort of deal with law
issues in the future.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.201
Second one? No, that was our first cease and
desist.

00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:49.980
It's the first and only, yep.
We're very lucky. We're very, very lucky.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.980
Yes, sir.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.900
&gt;&gt;male audience #6: Do you have analytics
on your customers that shows -–what's their

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:02.190
life cycle if they buy an Arduino one month,
how many more months before they are buying

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.955
better, cooler stuff? Can you tell me the
life cycle of your customers?[inaudible]

00:38:03.955 --> 00:38:06.720
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Really good
question. We've done some preliminary analytics.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.370
Sort of a hack job. Trying to figure out what's
going on.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.960
It's kind of hard to tell, because you can't
tell -- if we get an order from Google, is

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.610
Google doing something or are the engineers
at Google having it sent to Google and doing

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.390
it at home?
So what's the male/female ratio? What's the

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.690
age group? All that fun stuff.
What we found -- to answer your question about

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:29.790
 -- we see customers, and they come in and
they buy 30 or 40 or 50 dollars worth of stuff,

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.550
okay?
And then, six weeks later, we see another

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.510
order for 80 or 90.
And then, a couple of months later it's a

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:38.200
hundred bucks, a hundred bucks.
And then, it trails off.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.530
And what we think is happening is we're educating.
We're showing folks that, "Hey, here's a microcontroller.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.930
It's 30 bucks."
And then, over time you learn, "Oh wait -- that

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.650
chip is just two bucks?
I don't need to buy the $30 Arduino.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:53.730
And now, I figured out how to navigate the
digikey search engine, right?

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:56.340
I'm not as scared of this big, scary digikey
site.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.070
SparkFun, you were great. You helped me find
the stuff I needed."

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:03.030
And we educate them to the point -- we share
with them enough information -- that they

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.080
go off and sort of do their own thing.
So they buy less from us.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.261
And we're pretty okay with that.
It's just more people doing more cool stuff

00:39:09.261 --> 00:39:10.261
out there.

00:39:10.261 --> 00:39:11.970
&gt;&gt;male audience #6: So you're a gateway drug.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.600
We're kind of a gateway dropug, yeah.
Yes, sir.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.460
&gt;&gt;male audience #7: Can you solder stainless
to an O2 Sensor? [inaudible]

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.510
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: The question was whether
or not you can solder to stainless steel wire

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.510
 --

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.800
&gt;&gt;male audience #7: On a Bosch Oxygen Sensor.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.220
&gt;&gt;Nathan: on a Bosch Oxygen Sensor.
Have you tried?

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.560
&gt;&gt;male audience #7: No. , I haven't tried.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.040
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Let me know
when you do.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.370
&gt;&gt; male audience #7: I will. [laughter]

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:32.040
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: I really don't know.
I have tried to solder to something called

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.450
nichrome wire.
And I was trying to use it for my balloon

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.970
set thing, and I couldn't physically solder
to it.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.100
And I don't know the chemical properties of
the make up of the metal or why it wasn't

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:47.170
working, but I can tell you it didn't work.
So I don't know the reasons behind why they

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:50.840
don't want you to do that.
I wonder if it's a physical thing or if it's

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.780
going to affect the actual sensing.
So, don't really know.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:00.700
Good luck, though. That sounds cool.
Yes, sir.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:10.200
&gt;&gt;male audience #8: Speaking of sensors, when
do we get our hands on something cheap that

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.520
rRaman?
Raman spectroscopy.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:18.250
I've been looking like around the hardware,
you know, like everything is in the multi-thousand

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:23.340
dollar range.
It looks as if like there's a prism inside

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.480
that's the expensive part, but I have no idea.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.250
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: I'm sorry, I
didn't hear -- what type of a sensor is it?

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:33.630
&gt;&gt;male audience #8: It's a Raman spectroscopy
device.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:39.280
So you touch something, and it'll tell you
the composition of it.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.120
If you touch like a glass bottle with fluid
inside, it can tell you whether it's beer

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:48.070
inside or I don't know.
But it's very interesting, but it's multi-thousand

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.860
dollars.
I've seen devices that being set, where it's

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:57.580
like a key chain.
It can be mass produced obviously for a single

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.890
or a specific frequency.
So they have devices which will detect -- I

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.070
don't know -- rotten food or something like
that by the presence of a specific marker.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:09.920
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: I don't know that instance
specifically, but I have seen a lot of open

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:16.450
source efforts where they say, "Hey, this
prism-based spectroscopy unit is extremely

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:20.590
accurate and works very, very well, but I
don't need that level of accuracy.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:25.841
I need a couple of orders of magnitude less.
And so, can I reduce the cost down to hundreds

00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:26.841
of thousands of dollars instead of hundred
thousand dollars."

00:41:26.841 --> 00:41:33.230
One of the best applications I saw was a water
testing unit and they shine -- they have an

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.150
RGB LED.
They had a UV LED and they had an infrared

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.920
LED.
So you could kind of get the spectrum.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.020
And then, they had a sensor on the opposite
side.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:46.030
And you put a sample of water in between.
And, based upon what wavelengths were absorbed

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:51.040
and detected, you could or maybe detect what's
in the water -- biological matter -- and all

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:56.310
they were going for was, Can I drink the water?
Red light, green light. So if I fly into a

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.710
country.
So it doesn't answer your spectroscopy question,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.770
but I see there's two approaches -- one on
the really cheap level, so.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:07.790
&gt;&gt;male audience #8: Or pesticides in beer
for that matter [laughter]

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.900
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Other questions? Yes, sir.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.130
&gt;&gt;male audience #9: So you were mentioning
when you got started you started by importing

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.170
stuff from Bulgaria.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.170
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Yes.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.290
&gt;&gt;male audience #9: Was that really complicated?
Like, was it hard?

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.480
You know, I've thought of business idea before
that involves importing stuff from other countries,

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.850
but it seems like I don't know customs and
taxes and things would be weird.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.961
Was that hard for you, or was it just like,
"Oh, just order a bunch of stuff and have

00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:30.961
it come to my house?"

00:42:30.961 --> 00:42:33.400
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: It's a little different every
day, right?

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.540
So when I first started importing stuff from
Bulgaria, the first shipment went surprisingly

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:41.540
well. Surprisingly easy.
A couple shipments into it, it got held up,

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.930
because they really wanted to make sure that
those items didn't contain RAM.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:50.640
Because if they did contain RAM, then it fell
into a different tariff code that got taxed

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.621
differently, okay?
So the customs people don't really know.

00:42:53.621 --> 00:42:57.400
They just read the product description.
They go, "Okay, how do I categorize this?"

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:04.020
It's actually quite easy to import goods and
different things from across the world.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.880
It's just that they have to be properly recorded.
And then, you need to know what to expect

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:14.400
importwise.
My best advice is to always try it and you're

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.310
just going to learn over time.
Each day is going to be a little bit different.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.040
And, in the end, you'll learn very quickly.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.050
&gt;&gt;male audience #9: Cool thanks.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.790
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Mm-hmm. Any
other questions?

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:25.700
Yes, sir.
&gt;&gt;male audience #10: Can you talk about batchpcb?

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.650
Have you started that up?[inaudible]

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:33.560
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Yeah, so batchpcb
is sort of the side service that we offer.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.920
We, as engineers -- I don't know if you guys
have ever laid out a printed circuit board.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.390
Every printed circuit board I lay out is wrong
in some way.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:45.300
It's broken in some way.
And so, there's a lot of fabrication companies

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.590
out there that say, "Oh, no problem.
You only have to order five copies of your

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.040
design."
Well, I don't want five copies.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.980
I just want one, because I know it's probably
going to be messed up.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:44:00.130
And so, batchpcb was an effort to work with
our pcb fabrication house at Gold, Phoenix,

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.440
and say, "Hey, we're going to fill up this
panel.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.300
We get 15 x 10 square inches.
And we put the engineers' designs there.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.300
And then, we had some open space.
And we said, "Well, if we're not going to

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.590
use that space, maybe we can sell it to our
customers."

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.810
And so, our customers then began buying space
in that panel.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.720
So batchpcb is just the service we offer to
get pcb's fabricated.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.600
Does that answer your question?

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:26.970
&gt;&gt;male audience #10: I've used the service.
I like it. I just thought you might have something

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.840
to say about it. [inaudible]

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.570
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Works really
well.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:35.740
I can't wait for my pcb's to come in.
They're supposed to be here any day now.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.250
Yeah, we're waiting for a new controller for
my balloon satellite project.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.300
Any other questions?
Yes, sir.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:47.470
&gt;&gt;male audience #11: What are your thoughts
on the high power devices like 32-bit FLs

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:51.990
and the next generation of what's coming down
the line. [inaudible]

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:55.240
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Fabulous question.
So the question was what do we think about

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.480
32-bit processors and new stuff coming ondown
the line.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.200
An ARM 7 and ARM 9 -- the things that run
our cell phones -- are tremendously powerful.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.300
I have more computing power in my Nexus One
than like anything.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:12.850
It's incredible how low power and fast things
are becoming.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.630
And I had this debate with my director of
engineering yesterday.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:20.100
Sort of two camps.
I think that 90 percent of the blender defender

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.619
projects out there -- right? -- need an 8-bit
microcontroller.

00:45:23.619 --> 00:45:29.580
You don't need an ARM 7 to tackle a lot of
the small projects out there; an 8-bit microcontroller

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.990
does it.
Now, if you're doing graphical user interfaces

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.810
and you're doing sort of heavy computing,
absolutely.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:38.119
But, in general, I think an 8-bit microcontroller
can go a long way.

00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:41.180
So I think 8-bit will be around for a long
time.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.560
You had a question sir.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.470
&gt;&gt;male audience #12: [inaudible]

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:50.520
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: So, the question
I heard was "How do we decide new products

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.140
to sell and how do we decide what to carry?"

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:59.350
&gt;&gt;male audience #12: [inaudible]Yeah, are
you reselling things that were made in someone's

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:00.350
garage?

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:04.960
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Yes. So some
of the way that we look at a product is -- when

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:10.330
we decide whether or not to carry it on the
SparkFun site is -- Is it really cool?

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.960
Does it fill a void? Is it reasonably priced?
Right?

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.420
There's a bunch of criteria.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.700
&gt;&gt;male audience #12: [inaudible]

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.280
Nathan Seidle&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: No, no. Usually
we start with five or ten units and see how

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.290
those sell.
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:28.930
We -- at SparkFun, we don't build a thousand
of anything.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:33.490
We build ten, and we see how they sell and
same goes for the other products.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:37.740
That usually means that initially we're out
of stock of the really cool stuff, but then

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.510
we very quickly try to get back in stock.
Yes, sir.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:45.530
&gt;&gt; male audience #13:When you send a helium
balloon up with a camera, how do you get the

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:46.530
camera back?[inaudible]

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.090
&gt;&gt;Nathan Seidle: Great question. Very carefully.
How do you get the camera back from the helium

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:53.030
balloon project?
It's easy to send the camera up; it's hard

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.590
to get it back.
We had a lot of electronics that transmit

00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:00.330
GPS location.
So you're actually actively chasing it in

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:05.160
a car listening to the GPS longitude and latitude,
and then, try to recover it.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.990
And then, you hope that it doesn't break,
because if it goes black, you'll probably

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:13.410
never find it out in a field somewhere.
So, yeah. It's pretty hard to recover, and

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.050
it's a lot of fun whatever you do.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.910
&gt;&gt; male audience #13: Avoid the jet stream.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.450
Avoid the jet stream. And yep, luckily we're
in Colorado.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:24.740
I know a lot of folks on the East Coast have
to worry about it blowing into the Atlantic

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:29.340
Ocean or so.
Yeah, we don't have that problem. Cool.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.200
Very much. Well, thank you very much for having
me.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:31.290
&gt;&gt; [applause]
