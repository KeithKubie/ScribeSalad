Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Oh, that's why I made a tweet. Somebody posted before, like I'm just saying how Cory steady dropping down the rankings when you got guys like diamond race, he beat Volkow who is four and everybody say he lost that fight but he's Volcom was six actually sound like that. He lost that fight. But he jumped up there for like, how does he want off decision? Like oh it's cause you lose or win on decision. They don't move rankings up for decision. Then he won off decision. He went up to number four and somebody said, how did that even possible? I said, it's to the point now I can't worry about fighting hoopers and charge the rankings and my opponent. Cause if I worry about both of them, I'm not focused on something. I was worried about the opponent. I'm going to keep beating whoever they put in front of me and eventually had to keep trying to put these guys at the fight.

Speaker 1:          00:38          John like off knockout. So you said Andrea Smith. He knocked out Rashad, uh, shogun and then choked out Vulcan. He went up there to UFC John and he had an underground. All the extra stuff is good when you're knocking guys out. And I think it's gonna be, same thing with Santo. He known for knocking guys out, but his losses, um, an 85 other than branch, he also Eric Spicy on the ground. John is good on the ground. John's going to take them down as soon as you can run to me, you hit him one shot, I'm gonna take you down and you ain't gonna have no answer. Right. You know what I mean? If you don't have everything tested by the time when it's time to go to the championship fight, if you gained, do on striking is over. Tiago to me seems like, I mean, he's a very dangerous guy, but almost like so aggressive that he's almost like a kamikaze guy.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Like he's do or die, like kill or be killed. He comes in just swinging and throwing hammers and if he connects, it's dangerous. If you can act is bad for everybody, but it might not connect, you know? I mean, that's kind of how he is. He's, he's a, he's a a wild card. That's the best way to put it. Like he could connect on John if John fucks around and I don't think he will. I think, I mean he hasn't ever before except for the Gustafson fight. I don't think he was prepared as much as he should have. And we saw that in the second fight where he just dominated him. But I think that if he makes a mistake, Tiago could shut the lights out on anybody. That guy of swings, he throws like it's less sledgehammer. Even rose is not trying to make it to the final round.

Speaker 1:          02:02          He's not pacing himself, does none of that. That dude, he comes out hard. But it's like I think about him as my fight. We are literally Chiefy going into that fight. We, I knew 100% now there. He's going to try the rest of me. If he can't take me now, everything is going to be haymakers cause he seen me get touched in the chin and go down a robble. So as long as I keep moving, if I make him miss, he's going to get tired. And he's going to stop throwing those big haymakers and sometimes when he's swinging, he missed. He almost falls over and it gives you like the counter or to take down. Yeah, that's thing in our division. There's so many people not right. More like rock 'em sock 'em robots I think cause they got their hands up and they blocking and it's like, oh he's not hitting the but with four ounce gloves.

Speaker 1:          02:38          I guess I'll put like I was caged Safa Ryan Bader in John Anthony Johnson Bader had his hands up but Rumba was hit his hand so hard. Also you see his hands just drop, he was out. It doesn't matter if you let them hit, you get a chance to still getting wobbled. And I think with John, John's good at evading punches. Most guys stand our block and counter back or try to take a punch and hit you back. Like take a punch to give a punch. Yeah. It's not that kind of, he's going to move, move, move and you swing. He so long he can put his hands out and keep your distance and hit you with those quick, fast, long kicks and stuff and I just, like you said, I don't see John Messing around. He knows is dangerous. He's smart. I will say John's not only the best fighter if he's pot and mentally as a mixed martial artist, he sees what's going on really well.

Speaker 1:          03:21          He knows how to adapt. He can go out there and try tricky stuff at times when he know I can try some stuff right here and get away with it cause I'm home. Yeah. I could show gun fight. He went out there and showed up jumping knees, jumped with the kicks because Shogun was so short. Yeah, he knew. He said, I'm a different breed. I'm longer on fast and tricky, but I think we'll come. A guy like Gus, he didn't do all that stuff, but he knew he had to stay long in the vape punches and kit to take down and hit him when you can. Yeah. The Gospel fight. He showed his metal, right. It showed that he could take it and then winning the championship rounds, even in a fight that he wasn't really properly prepared for. He showed that in the Vito Belfort fight too, when he got caught up with that arm bar, he overcomes adversity. He's not just a hammer. He knows how to be the nail. He knows how to do it.
