00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:07.106
&gt;&gt;Most of us grew up, classic
American education, you know.

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:09.616
You can go through a unit where
these was math, social studies

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:11.726
or English, and at the end
of the unit, you had a test.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:15.446
Then you moved onto the next
unit, because you had to get

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:18.596
through all the chapters by
the end of the school year.

00:00:18.596 --> 00:00:21.096
And some kids would do
well, some wouldn't.

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:23.566
Some kids got good
grades and some didn't.

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.736
&gt;&gt;In the past, we would just
move on to the next chapter

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:27.856
in the book, and sorry
if you didn't get that.

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.526
Maybe at the end
of the year review,

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.446
we'll try and touch on that.

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.716
We wanted to get away
from that practice.

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:36.216
We made sure that we
had a time in the day

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:38.786
where if students did
not master the skill

00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:42.526
that was previously taught, we
gave them time to master that.

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:47.036
&gt;&gt;So these formatives are a
way of assessing everything

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:49.236
that you have learned about
prime and composite numbers.

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:52.886
&gt;&gt;So we're gonna go ahead
and get up our math offices.

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:56.886
Put your first, last
name on this test.

00:00:57.386 --> 00:00:59.736
&gt;&gt;Nancy: Is this a test that
you have to take really fast?

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:00.976
&gt;&gt;Everybody: No.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:02.986
&gt;&gt;Katie: What we do is
we teach an objective,

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.436
and that objective is
calendared out for us.

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:07.736
And at the end of
teaching that objective,

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:09.386
we would give a formative
assessment,

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:10.736
which is usually on Friday.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:13.016
Objectives usually
last about a week.

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:15.396
And based on the results of
that formative assessment,

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.696
we know if students have
mastered that concept

00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:20.926
or if they have not
mastered that.

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:24.306
Then what teachers do is, they
get together as a grade level

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:26.736
and they look at their
formatives, and they look

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:29.676
at what students mastered that
formative and which didn't,

00:01:29.676 --> 00:01:32.196
and they divide students
into the reteach group

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.056
and into the enrich group.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.876
&gt;&gt;Nancy: And so how many
reteaches are you looking at?

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:40.016
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: I'm looking
at five I reteach, yep.

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:41.116
&gt;&gt;Nancy: Crystal, do you
have your number yet?

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:41.966
&gt;Crystal: Yes, nine.

00:01:42.196 --> 00:01:43.096
&gt;&gt;Matt, what were your numbers?

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:43.836
&gt;Matt: Eight.

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:47.206
&gt;&gt;Katie: One of the things that
we found through our experience

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.816
with reteach and enrich
is that the teacher

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:52.416
who had a very good turnout
on that formative assessment,

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.906
they did something
right in that classroom.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:55.726
They did something right

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.266
with their instruction
on that objective.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.996
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Is it safe to say
a composite number is a number

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.736
that has more than two factors?

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:01.906
[Everybody:] Yes.

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:02.566
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Very good.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.676
All right, that's what
we're gonna write down.

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:07.756
&gt;&gt;Katie: So we felt that that
teacher would be the most

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:10.246
appropriate person to
teach the reteach group.

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:11.896
&gt;&gt;Nancy: I think they just
need a little more time

00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:12.996
on this is what it looks like.

00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:13.486
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Exactly.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:16.046
Well, I'm open to doing
reteach for prime and composite.

00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:17.976
&gt;&gt;Nancy: What about what
you've got planned, Matt?

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:19.646
You had some enrichments
planned, didn't you?

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:22.326
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah, I did, I put
three enrich programs together

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:23.216
and three activities.

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:25.966
I took what you had and
I took what you had,

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:28.156
and I took a sample
on Marilyn Burns,

00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:31.256
and I just kinda read all
three of them and I redid them

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:33.706
on my board, on one
of the poster boards.

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:35.826
And I wrote it in like a child
friendly version of it...

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:36.506
[Cheryl:] Of the
divisibility rules?

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:38.766
&gt;&gt;Yeah. And I gave an
example underneath each one.

00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:41.176
&gt;&gt;Nancy: All right,
so are we all set?

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:42.136
Everybody feel comfy?

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:42.976
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Sounds good to me.

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:43.956
&gt;Cheryl: Yeah, I think so.

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:46.406
&gt;&gt;Katie: That following
week, every day,

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:49.146
Monday through Friday, from
twelve thirty to one o'clock,

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:52.086
we have reteach and enrich
going on school wide.

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.356
So the teachers that
are teaching reteach,

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:56.916
they have that reteach group
and they stay with that group

00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:58.376
of students for that
entire week.

00:02:58.376 --> 00:03:02.266
The enrichment students, they're
split up and they would rotate

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.246
between all of the other
teachers in that grade level.

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:08.256
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Today in reteach,
we're going to be going

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:10.606
over prime and composite
numbers.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:12.976
&gt;&gt;I think reteach
is kind of nice

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.826
because if you don't understand
something, you won't go

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:19.266
on until you understand it,
so you won't be confused

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:21.866
with anything else, and
the teachers do help you.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.636
I realize that it's
not really bad.

00:03:24.086 --> 00:03:26.426
It's just that you just need a
little bit more help with it.

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:29.756
&gt;&gt;Matt: You guys did really
well on your formative last week

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:33.156
and so today's your chance
to do an enrichment portion.

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:34.236
I really wanna challenge you.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:35.206
I'm giving you that option.

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:38.166
Do you wanna do prime and
composite, zero to a hundred,

00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:40.216
or do you wanna try
prime and composite,

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:42.566
zero to two hundred,
using those digits?

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:44.146
With a thumbs up, how many

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:46.336
of you guys wanna do a
hundred to two hundred?

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:48.326
All right.

00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:51.736
I'm gonna go for the two hundred
too and I'll help you out

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:53.976
and I'll help you out as well.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:57.046
&gt;&gt;Katie: We knew that it
worked because the very year

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:59.906
that we took our AIMs or
our standardized test,

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.606
our school became
an excelling school.

00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:04.166
Our achievement is the highest
in the state of Arizona,

00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:06.166
so that's something that
we're very proud of.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:09.756
&gt;&gt;When we hold students
accountable

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:15.766
for very specific standards, and
we expect all of them to know

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:19.926
that standard, then we
hold ourselves accountable

00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:21.096
for getting that job done.

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:26.026
And that is a very significant
shift from simply saying,

00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:28.876
'You know what, I made it all
the way through the textbook.'
