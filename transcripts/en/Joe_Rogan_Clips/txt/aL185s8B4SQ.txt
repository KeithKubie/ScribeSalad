Speaker 1:          00:00          For me, the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along with me. The only thing that grows along with me, my experiences, my family, my marriage, my mistakes, my ups, my downs. Those are the things that I can talk about forever because as you get older, things change. Shit gets different. But it's all coming from my personal opinion of me, my view on me and how I see life. You can't lose material in a state. That's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after awhile for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should kind of, well, politics, I don't joke. And the politics, I don't, I don't joke. And anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities, I don't do anything divisive.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Good for you. That's my, that's my biggest thing. And you know, uh, this past year was, was one that got a little weird because I was like, Yo, I've really dedicated myself to bringing people together. Like, um, I love, that was my, my goal. That's my priority at Damn Shadow. That's what I was doing on a global scale. Everybody, all races, shapes, sizes, whoever you are, whatever you are, you can come to a Kevin Hart show and have a good time. So when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive, that was tough. You're talking about the Oscars Oscar Shit. Yeah, like this

Speaker 2:          01:34          time where people were just looking to be upset about things 100% they're not looking to looking at you, Kevin Hart as just a human being, like what? What? Who is he overall super positive. They're not even concentrating on that. I mean, think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what, nine years ago?

Speaker 1:          01:52          It was a, it's a, it's a wake up call of understanding the towns, but then more importantly, you know, for me it was okay, I went through it. I made sure that the people of the Lgbtq community really understand that, hey guys, I apologize before, but I'm apologizing again. I'm sorry I'm not that guy. I don't want you to think I'm that guy. Then it just became the constant conversation that never happened. It just became a constant conversation. And, and now it is guys. I'm not only sorry, I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody. This is no longer a conversation. So guys, I'm going to stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into what I'm not. I, I know I'm not the world in public should understand and know to them that because over this time period I've shown that I'm not.

Speaker 1:          02:51          So the apology, once again, I'm sorry, genuinely, I'm sorry, but it just kept, it just, it never stopped. And at that point I just made a decision and I'm like, guys, at this point, I just am making a decision to not talk about it anymore. That doesn't mean to them being disrespectful to anybody. That doesn't mean to them shutting down anything. It means that for me, I'm going to stop talking about it because at this point I don't know what to do. At this point. I thought, I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do. I do. Uh, I made sure that you understand it. I'm not a hateful person. I don't get, don't hate. I did that. I stepped down. So I don't take attention off of that night. And those people that are there to be celebrated, I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me.

Speaker 1:          03:40          I stepped down. Everything I did was for the better of good. I'm, I'm stepping away guys, because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing. And then it still became a conversation. So I waited for it to die down. I went on my radio show, gave another public apology. May should have he understand and I'm sorry, I hope these words didn't hurt anybody. I once again apologize. I don't condone hate to anyone. I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of all. So now I say, if you don't understand and that you don't believe it, I don't know what else to give. I don't know what else to do. There's nothing else you can do that's very wise of you. Nothing that's very wisely to step away, locked up. Because if you didn't, they would probably pursue it forever.

Speaker 1:          04:29          But I mean, it becomes a point of attention. That's all it is. They just decide that this is something that they're going to focus on. What a, I had a, I had a good talk, and I'm talking about this for a minute. Friend of mine, Lee Daniels, you know, me and Lee Daniels, uh, Lee called me, told me where to talk to them. You know, Lou Daniel's is director, a producer, the show empires, this biggest shows, um, you know, so he calls me, he's like, Kevin won't talk to you. And, and us talking, he's like, look, this is a time where you could speak up and talk about, you know, the community that's been affected by hatred and you know, hateful crimes. You can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't, uh, stand with any type of hate or whatever. You can take that stage and do that.

Speaker 1:          05:26          And I said, Lee, I said, let's understand what you're saying. I said, well, why did you expect me to know what's been happening within this community in regards to hate and crimes? I said, I, I'm not aware. I said, some people can just not be aware. I'm not in the know. I have no idea what's going on. I have no idea. Community within that community, I have no idea. When you tell me this, I'm now educated and I understand, so it's easy to simply inform, right? Information is key. When people get information, they process the information. When you can process the information, you go, oh, wait a minute. That makes sense. Hey, if you guys think that I can, don't hate, wait a minute, I don't in anybody that does, fuck you, man, as bad you shouldn't. I can say that, but instead when this happened, it was become an ally, become a voice and that's, that's where there was just a miscommunication. That's where a back and forth kind of was establish that I think people just started to take things and run with it, and I'm just not, I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation. Yes. Yeah. When I'm, when I'm trying my best to, it was becoming tablet bullshit pretty much took a real discussion, clickbait, clickbait.
