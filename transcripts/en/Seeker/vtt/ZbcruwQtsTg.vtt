Good evening friends, welcome to the DNews
Netflix Screening Room, I'm Trace.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.080
This week I popped into Netflix on my iPad
and Chomecasted to a TV at work to watch The

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.289
Act of Killing, which is nominated for an
Oscar this year.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.780
If you'd like to watch this movie, and I'd
highly recommend it -- you can pick up Netflix

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.830
for yourself FREE for a month by going to
Netflix.com/dnews and signing up.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.480
You could be streaming TV and movies to all
your devices in no time!

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.640
Plus, it helps support us here at DNews.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.770
20th century Indonesia was a rough place.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.980
There were political battles between the right
and left wings, with the right finally coming

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.039
together and killing thousands of communists.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.190
The Act of Killing follows the stories of
some of the top death-squad leaders and allows

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.120
them a forum to relive their glory days.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.429
It's very difficult to watch them joking about
how they killed people, explaining why the

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.559
used this method or that -- For example: they
preferred to strangle people with wire, because

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.870
beating them to death was too slow and the
blood would make the room smell.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.909
It was a simple, logical decision for them,
but a horrendous one for humankind.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.610
Psychotherapists and neurologists identify
the traits of a psychopath as having superficial

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.720
charm, lack of remorse, and an impersonal
sex life, whereas sociopaths have a lack of

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.190
empathy -- or the inability to understand
the emotional responses of others.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.880
The men featured by the documentary likely
would fall into BOTH of these.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.380
These murderers lied to the public, and killed
the communist sympathizers for trumped-up

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.760
offenses, or sometimes just for associating
with the wrong people.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.430
A reasonable person would ask, how could they
be so inhumane?

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.140
A study in the journal Brain, researched the
ability of psychopaths to experience empathy

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.730
and found their brains were able to flip a
switch turn it on or off.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.000
This study suggests these men can still EXPERIENCE
or UNDERSTAND empathy and morality the same

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.260
as anyone else, but may have simply flipped
it off.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.740
Watching the movie, you see some shadows of
their inner torture, but only with some of

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.740
them.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.510
These death-squad leaders describe what they've
done with smiles on their faces the way you

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.680
or I would describe a weekend away with friends.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.959
Their nostalgia and camaraderie is both banal
and shocking.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.180
They relive these terrible experiences with
laughter, punctuated by discussions of politics,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.560
morality, and ethics.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.140
Strangely, as a group their discussions seem
more apologetic, but alone their true feelings

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.820
range from tortured to defiant.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.970
It's really jaw-dropping.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.510
The scene where former death-squad leader
Anwar Congo describes how he killed people

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.790
by strangling them with wire is super crazy.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.800
He laughs while demonstrating the method by
wrapping a wire around a pole, and then his

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800
friends neck.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.430
Then he leans away pulling the wire taut and
looks at the camera with a smile.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.510
Moments later, his face pulls as he recalls
the numbing of these painful memories with

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.190
alcohol, drugs and sex.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.070
You want to hate him and what he did in the
name of politics and hatred, but you also

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.340
see him as an old man with regrets.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.480
It's an emotional ride, for sure.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.950
I'd highly recommend this powerful film, but
you're probably gonna need a hug after.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.210
