[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:09.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:13.552
ERIC IDLE: Hey.

00:00:13.552 --> 00:00:14.040
Hello.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.760
YIGAL PETREANU: Hello.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.210
ERIC IDLE: Hello.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.709
Thank you.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.921
Thank you, everybody.

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:17.420
Hello.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.045
Good afternoon.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:18.607
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:20.068
ERIC IDLE: Hi.

00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:22.117
[SIGHS] Well, that went well.

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:22.950
YIGAL PETREANU: Yep.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.846
Yep.

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:25.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.156
ERIC IDLE: What are
these, hamsters?

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:29.010
What are they?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.119
Are they Google things?

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.910
What are-- are they
sort of the set design?

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.800
YIGAL PETREANU: They
record whatever you say.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.040
ERIC IDLE: Oh, they're--

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.060
YIGAL PETREANU: They'll
use it against you.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.300
Oh.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.470
Oh, dear.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.969
Sorry.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:37.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.710
ERIC IDLE: Yeah.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.600
YIGAL PETREANU: OK, so what
are we going to do today?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
So many people are here.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.380
So in my opinion, you are
truly a Renaissance man.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.019
You did everything.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.435
ERIC IDLE: You mean I've been
dead since the 15th century?

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:51.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:54.150
YIGAL PETREANU:
So what I decided

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.370
to do, again, over the
last couple of weeks,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.380
I asked for people
to send me questions.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.850
And I got piles of questions.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.910
I felt like Ringo Starr
receiving all these mails

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.150
with questions.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.900
And I divided them
into different topics.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.540
Some of them I just threw away.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.790
I'm taking credit for all
the questions, by the way.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.150
ERIC IDLE: Excellent.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.710
That's less for the
tech world we know.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.380
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah, so, again,
you wrote somewhere-- again,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.190
regretfully at some
point I'll read quotes

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.360
that you made back to you.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.560
I hope it's OK with you.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.070
So you wrote in the book
that there is nothing funnier

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.585
than no one laughing.

00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:32.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.860
So I'll try to provide
the part in this talk.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.860
And you can make them
laugh as much as you want.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.984
If this is OK with you.

00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:39.900
ERIC IDLE: OK, OK, OK.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.880
I mean, that was
specifically about when

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.800
you mean to be funny, and
there's an audience, you know?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.760
And then it happened to us
once on "Python," when we were

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.090
on "The Tonight Show" in 1973.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.932
And we'd just toured
Canada, and they

00:01:53.932 --> 00:01:55.140
laughed at everything we did.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.450
If we went on stage and farted,
they applauded and stood up.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.450
But we were in America, And
we were on "The Tonight Show,"

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.160
and we started off by
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) "Hello,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.710
Mrs. Thing.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.660
Hello, Mrs. Entity."

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.050
and the audience was like this.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.100
And we had half an
hour's material--

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.450
we did it in 20 minutes.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.740
And then we all ran outside in
Burbank and lay on the ground

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.180
and laughed our asses off,
because it was just so funny.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.370
It was just really funny.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:22.350
That's what I meant by that.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.200
YIGAL PETREANU: Anyway,
so let's talk about music,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.399
if you don't mind, one
of our mutual loves.

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.440
[PHONE RINGS IN AUDIENCE]

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.827
Like many English teenagers
who grew up in the '50s--

00:02:30.827 --> 00:02:32.160
ERIC IDLE: That's the president.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:37.740
YIGAL PETREANU: --the
crucial liberating moment

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.650
was watching Elvis and
hearing "Heartbreak Hotel."

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.700
And can you recall
what you really

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.460
felt when you first saw Elvis?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.750
And did you ever manage to meet
him in person later on in life?

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.560
ERIC IDLE: I never
met him, but I was 14.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.936
It's 1957, so he was everywhere.
(SINGING IN ELVIS VOICE)

00:02:57.936 --> 00:02:59.970
Well, since my baby
left me, you know?

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.320
And we never see him.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.170
He was on television
eventually, but they'd only

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.460
shoot him below the waist.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.900
Yeah.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.340
American television, they're
very prurient about that,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.765
because he was jiggling about.

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:12.948
Eh-- above the waist, sorry.

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:13.565
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:14.940
YIGAL PETREANU:
It's even better.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.879
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.420
ERIC IDLE: That was
a different film.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.919
I'm sorry.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.002
I'm so sorry.

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:21.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.410
As I said, we were
14, you know, so we

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.170
were very interested in what
went on below the waist.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.370
But then eventually I found
out, to my complete and total--

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.990
I still can't come
to terms with it--

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.630
that he was an
enormous "Python" fan.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.960
And he had all the
tapes on his plane.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.350
And he called everybody squire,
after my "Nudge Nudge" sketch.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.980
Which was absolutely
mind-blowing to me

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.390
until I met Linda Thompson, who
was his penultimate girlfriend.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.572
And she said that, in
Nashville, at night

00:03:53.572 --> 00:03:55.280
when the television
went off at 2 o'clock

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.140
or 3:00 in the
morning, Elvis would

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.560
make her sit up in bed with
her and do "Python" sketches.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.032
And not just any
"Python" sketches,

00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:06.990
it was (HIGH-PITCHED
VOICE) "Hello, Mrs. Thing.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.370
I need a new brain."

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.277
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:09.277 --> 00:04:11.360
Now, I don't know if you
can imagine Elvis sitting

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.810
in bed doing that, but
apparently that's what

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.240
he did with Linda Thompson.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.434
So I just-- it's still
mind-blowing, isn't it?

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:21.350
I mean, it's boggling.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.870
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah,
anyway, moving from

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.960
the '50s to the '60s--

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.470
OK, if you don't mind--

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.580
Python are often referred
to as the Beatles of comedy.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.450
So my question to you is, did
you really meet the Beatles,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.760
the Stones, the Who, the
Kinks, all those great bands

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.109
in the '60s in real
life, in real time.

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:41.900
ERIC IDLE: Yeah, I
mean, we did, but that's

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.640
because we are all
the same generation.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.800
We all came out of
the War, or born

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.430
at the end of World War II, and
into this horrible world which

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
was rationing and
bomb sites everywhere.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.150
And that generation
sort of invented--

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.400
it was actually a Renaissance.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.480
They invented everything.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.450
They invented rock
and roll, they--

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.920
photography, couture, fashion.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.254
It was just because
there was nobody there.

00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:08.420
Everybody was in the forces.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.885
So we were the ones
who did comedy.

00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:14.060
And we were on television, but
there wasn't anybody before us,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.620
because there wasn't television.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.490
So we were very fortunate
to go into a blank field.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.400
And if you can find a blank
field in any part of the world,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.889
that's really a
good place to be,

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.180
because nobody's done anything.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.670
So you can hit all
the spots first.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.600
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah, so again,
we move into the '70s, and--

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.800
Very fast.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.550
We don't have a lot of time,
so we have to move very fast.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.150
You were a distinguished
member of the Rutles.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.220
But but before the singles,
and records, and movies,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.080
and Rutlemania, and
everything, there

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.540
was this "Rutland
Weekend Television."

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.250
Can you tell us a
little bit about it?

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.320
And why did you
decide, for example,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.140
that there should
be no live audience

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.454
for this specific show?

00:05:53.454 --> 00:05:55.370
ERIC IDLE: Well, it was
after Python finished.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.140
And I sort of hadn't--

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.800
I still liked writing sketches.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.310
So I got my own little
television series

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.670
from the BBC called "Rutland
Weekend Television."

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.190
And Rutland is the
smallest county in England.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.030
And actually they've
made it extinct,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.590
so I liked the idea of being
their television station.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.570
And it was Cleese's title--

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.520
I paid him a pound for it.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.850
And we did it from a tiny
little studio, which is really

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.140
the weather forecast studio.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.150
And we had to lift
all the sets upstage.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.840
It was made--

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.470
I think the whole series
cost 30,000 pounds.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.310
But from that came a joke
I wrote about the Rutles,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.010
because they were the Rutland
version of the Beatles.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.400
And so I took that to "Saturday
Night Live" when I was hosting,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.750
and they put it on TV.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.910
And people wrote to the Rutles.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.930
It was amazing.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.217
So then we made the full
documentary for NBC.

00:06:45.217 --> 00:06:47.300
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah, and
this was a huge success.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.450
And why did you choose
to play Dirk McQuickly?

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.820
Originally it was George, but
then you switched to Paul.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.440
ERIC IDLE: In the original
one on our TV show,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.690
I played the George character.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.400
But I couldn't find anybody--
because Neil Innes played

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.280
Lennon, and he did
him really great.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.920
And I couldn't find
anybody to balance Neil.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.170
So I had to sort of do that
role, because I was really

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.300
playing the interviewer all
the time, which was fun.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.950
But then I sort of
I thought, well,

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.865
I've got to play
Dirk McQuickly, which

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:16.490
is quite nice, because
then I came face

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.260
to face with Paul McCartney
just after I'd played him.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.830
And he was with his wife,
Linda, and she really loved it.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.940
And he wasn't quite sure--

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.218
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:29.690
--because I was mocking
his lovely little eyes

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.212
that he would do.

00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:34.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.980
But he's good friends now.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.780
They all like the Rutles now.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.280
George would only--

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.023
Harrison-- would only refer
to the Beatles as the Rutles,

00:07:43.023 --> 00:07:43.810
from them.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.420
And yeah, he would always
talk about the Rutles, what

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.620
we're doing now, the Rutles.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.495
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah.

00:07:49.495 --> 00:07:52.220
And there's also a story
about George and Ringo

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.420
actually playing a Rutles song.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.130
ERIC IDLE: Yeah.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.910
We were visiting-- my daughter
and I-- she was a wee one.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.500
We were visiting
Friar Park, which

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.020
is an extraordinary house in
Henley where George lives,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.580
this Gothic place.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.230
And Ringo was there.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.050
And they both picked
up guitars and started

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.990
to sing "Ouch," which is the
parody of "Help" in the Rutles.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.580
And it was like the world
had just turned upside down.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.455
This is really bizarre.

00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:20.580
YIGAL PETREANU: Moving on--

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.700
This is my job here.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.050
ERIC IDLE: It's all right.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.380
YIGAL PETREANU: I must move on.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.320
ERIC IDLE: No,
you're doing good.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:25.810
You're doing good.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.393
YIGAL PETREANU: OK,
OK, OK, thank you.

00:08:27.393 --> 00:08:29.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.539
You have achieved
some unprecedented act

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:37.429
by singing the opening track
on a Harry Nilsson album.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:43.020
Moreover, you are the
you're co-creditor of a song

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.410
together-- there's a
song by Harrison/Idle

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.850
named "The Pirate Song."

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.090
So I wonder, how does it
feel to really collaborate

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.790
with culture heroes
that turned to be

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.744
your friends at some point?

00:08:54.744 --> 00:08:56.160
ERIC IDLE: Well,
that's two parts.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.951
But I don't know whether
people-- do people

00:08:57.951 --> 00:08:59.322
know Harry Nilsson these days?

00:08:59.322 --> 00:09:01.030
YIGAL PETREANU:
Everybody knows him, yes.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.910
ERIC IDLE: Really?

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:02.720
Not everybody.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.310
I mean, he was great
and a wonderful man.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.180
But the George one was because
he came on my show "Rutland

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.530
Weekend Television."

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.860
And I persuaded him to
be my special guest.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.730
And it was a Christmas show of
"Rutland Weekend Television."

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.080
And he came lurching on, and
he said, dressed as a pirate,

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.580
all right, I'm ready
for the sketch.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.663
I said, well, what sketch?

00:09:25.663 --> 00:09:26.870
He said, the pirate sketch.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.332
And they said, well, actually,
there isn't a pirate sketch.

00:09:29.332 --> 00:09:31.290
He said, no, there's got
to be a pirate sketch.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.822
They said, no, no, we want
you to sing "My Sweet Lord."

00:09:34.822 --> 00:09:35.780
Oh, I'm not doing that.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.980
I want a pirate sketch.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.630
And I said, well,
I'm sorry there is no

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.740
pirate s-- well, up you, then.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.500
And off he went.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.540
And then at the end of the
show, we cut this big set,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.700
and it says, George
Harrison Sings.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.080
And George came down, and he
had the white suit on and the 12

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.950
string playing
[MIMICS "MY SWEET LORD"]..

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.450
And he played all
that introduction,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.440
then he went (singing)
I want to be a pirate.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.470
A pirate's life for me.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.400
All my friends are pirates,
and they sail the BBC.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.290
So we wrote that.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.210
So that, you know--

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.030
You know, it's almost as good as
Lennon and McCartney, I think.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.280
YIGAL PETREANU:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.295
Sounds very good.

00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:14.670
ERIC IDLE: Really?

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.044
YIGAL PETREANU:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:16.044 --> 00:10:19.680
So we'll have to move on.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.090
Your "Hey Jude" will
forever be "Always

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.010
Look on the Bright
Side of Life."

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.710
And of course, again,
can you tell us a little

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.130
bit how it came to be, where
the optimism come from?

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.020
And how come-- did you really
imagine that by 2018 people

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.477
will still sing this song with
so much spirit and vengeance?

00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:41.810
ERIC IDLE: Well, yes, of course.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.160
I knew all about that.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.619
I'd also imagined
Google back then.

00:10:45.619 --> 00:10:46.826
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah, I know.

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:48.892
ERIC IDLE: Nobody
believed me at the time.

00:10:48.892 --> 00:10:51.810
No, I mean, the fact was we were
writing the "Life of Brian,"

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.410
and what we got to--
as far as the end.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.660
And all of our characters
were headed for crucifixion.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.622
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:57.622 --> 00:10:59.330
Well, now we have to
figure out how we're

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.100
going to end the damn movie.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.984
So I said, well,
let's end with a song.

00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:05.150
And they said, oh, yeah,
that's kind of a nice idea.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.340
I said, we can be
being crucified

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.540
and sing from the crosses.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.081
And they said, oh,
that's really bad.

00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:11.630
Yeah, we'll do that.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.390
And then Gilliam said, and
we could dance as well.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.860
So I said, but it has to be a
ridiculously optimistic song,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.430
like looking on the bright side.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.630
And it should be
like a Disney song.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.092
It should have a little whistle.

00:11:24.092 --> 00:11:25.800
And so they said, oh,
that's really good.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.500
And they put it in the script,
said we can stop for the day

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.040
now.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.760
And I went home and
wrote it, very quickly,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.260
and brought it back
in the next day.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.610
And they hated it--
no, they liked it.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.540
And I mean, when
you think about it,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.850
it is a parody of
an optimistic song,

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.130
because they're being crucified.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.170
There's not a lot
to look forward to.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.350
You've got about 25
minutes if you're lucky.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.276
But then it made a real
nice ending for the film,

00:11:53.276 --> 00:11:54.400
and people really liked it.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.190
Harry Nilsson recorded it,
actually, on one of his albums.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.780
But yeah, so then
about 15 years later,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.790
I had a friend who was
an English football

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.460
player called Gary Lineker,
who was my neighbor.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.900
And he said, they're singing
your song on the terraces.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.040
I said, what do you mean.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.180
He said, well, whenever a
team's losing very badly--

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.190
--all the fans sing
(SINGING) always look

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.320
on the bright side of life.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.552
Da da, da-da, da-da, da-da.

00:12:23.552 --> 00:12:27.650
And it was going around all
the stadiums in England--

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.390
caught on like wildfire.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.005
They re-released the song, and
it went to number one in one

00:12:32.005 --> 00:12:32.630
of the charts--

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.470
amazing.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.910
So that was kind of weird.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.810
And it developed his
own life after that.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.610
I mean, during
the Falklands War,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.660
the HMS Sheffield
was hit by an Exocet.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.940
And all the sailors
sat on the deck

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.130
waiting for rescue
for three hours,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.950
singing "Always Look on
the Bright Side of Life."

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.640
And now, so it became
something that-- we English

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.990
are very good at irony.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.156
I mean, that's probably all
they're good at, really.

00:12:59.156 --> 00:13:00.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.000
But now it's the number one song
requested at British funerals.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.950
Seriously.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.290
I mean, for the last 10
years it has been that,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.062
replacing "My Way,"
I'm happy to say.

00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:15.530
[LAUGHTER] And I like that.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.940
I think it's very--

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.760
it sort of shows, because it
is ridiculously optimistic,

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.570
but it also says "always look
on the bright side of death,"

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.310
which is one of the lines in it.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.070
"Just before you draw
your terminal breath.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.060
Life's a piece of shit
when you look at it."

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.490
And so I love the fact
that people go to funerals,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.690
and they sing it.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.820
And of course, what
you need at a funeral

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.530
is always a good laugh.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.780
That's the most important
thing, because it's

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.420
the only thing that shakes
you back into reality.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.700
So I'm kind of proud of that.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.710
I think that's nice.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:47.060
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.643
And by the way, in
front of the queen,

00:13:48.643 --> 00:13:50.156
you changed the
"shit" to "spit."

00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:51.530
ERIC IDLE: Apparently
I did, yes.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.190
I think life's a piece of spit.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.010
But not in front of
Prince Charles, and not

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.040
at the Olympic Games.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.065
They let me say "shit"
on the Olympic Games.

00:13:59.065 --> 00:14:01.190
YIGAL PETREANU: So only
the queen was quite strict.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.356
ERIC IDLE: Well, you have
respect Her Majesty, and--

00:14:03.356 --> 00:14:06.921
[LAUGHS LOUDLY]

00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.170
YIGAL PETREANU: OK, so I
think that we wrapped up very

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.500
quickly the topic of music.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.370
Let's move to--

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.930
Come on.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.790
Give me a chance.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.387
We'll move to comedy.

00:14:18.387 --> 00:14:19.470
ERIC IDLE: If you want to.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.580
YIGAL PETREANU: OK,
good, thank you.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.350
ERIC IDLE: I've got, you know--

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.980
I'm here.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.130
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.060
OK, good.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.400
OK, so again, in
your book, you write

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.740
that you spent 12 years
in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.330
which is a combination
of an army and a prison.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.710
This is how you mentioned.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.100
And my question is,
again, and you've

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.670
said that it was a perfect
training for Python.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.990
So is becoming a comedian mostly
the result of circumstances,

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.720
as in your case, or is
there a comic gene, as you

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.865
refer in one of your books?

00:14:49.865 --> 00:14:51.740
ERIC IDLE: I'm not sure
about the comic gene.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.370
But I do like the
fact that you read it.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.500
Yeah, I mean, I was--

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.980
the great irony of my life is
I was-- my dad was in the RAF

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.960
from 1941.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.010
And he was actually killed
in an accident hitchhiking

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.440
home for Christmas in 1945.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.740
So having been in the Lancaster
bomber all those years

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.520
as a rear gunner, that's really
kind of ironic, and sort of,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.300
kind of funny if you're not--

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.910
you know, I was only 2 and 1/2.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.350
But the result of that was
the RAF paid for my education.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.350
And they put me in-- we
were in a boarding school,

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.330
and it had been an orphanage.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.310
But the war gave it a
shot in the arm, which

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.630
is kind of good for business,
because I went to this boarding

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.540
school in Wolverhampton, which
is not the end of the world.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.790
But you can see it from there.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:46.700
And I was there 12
years, from seven to 19.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.140
And all the boys in my class
and in all that school all

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.850
had lost their
fathers in the war.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.270
So psychologically it's
very interesting, I think.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.410
We'll get to it later.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.480
So it was like you
had to manufacture

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.320
all your good times.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.160
So you learn how to be funny
at the expense of authority,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.100
not that they knew, and
then go over the wall

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.870
to get beer, and meet girls, and
do the normal things in life.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.340
And also sort of
various privations--

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.400
I mean, they put you in
the army once a week.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.890
So we'd have to march
up and down the square

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.030
from the age of 12.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.110
And I think, by 14, I could
strip a Bren gun blindfold

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.400
and reassemble it.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.070
And they do adventure
training courses

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.100
in Wales, where they
send you with a compass,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.700
and a piece of cheese, and a
map reference over Snowdonia.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.330
And so, you know, that's
quite tough, really.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.840
But compared to our boarding
school, it was a doddle.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.730
And all the rather
more better schools,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.720
they're all kids who
were crying, and weeping,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.610
and lying around.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.780
But we said, oh, come on.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.320
Come on.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.970
And so I think filming is
kind of tough and boring.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.050
It's a cross between
the two of them.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.590
And I think that did
prepare me to put up

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.469
with that sort of stuff.

00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:03.260
YIGAL PETREANU: OK.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.390
So "Beyond the Fringe"--

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.119
you mentioned it in
your book that it

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.550
was an epiphany for you.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.250
Can you describe to do the young
audience what was it all about,

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.339
and how did it
really affect you?

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.510
ERIC IDLE: Well,
growing up in the '50s,

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.740
it was very restrictive.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.890
And the English had
the tough attitude.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.030
We've been through it all
now, and we can tough out

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.440
the peace, and all this.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.420
But then there was this show
that came on in the West End.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.710
And it was Peter Cook, Dudley
Moore, Jonathan Miller,

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.030
and Alan Bennett.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.590
And it was a revue.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.540
It was, like, 1961.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.930
And I went to see this thing,
and I laughed my ass off.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.529
I rolled around
the wall, because I

00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:49.070
didn't know you were
allowed to laugh

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.370
at the queen, and the
Army, and the police.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.070
And all the things that
kind of annoyed you,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.440
they laughed at and mocked.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.870
And the scales
dropped from my eyes.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.300
And I got the album, and
I learned everything.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.690
And that's all I ever wanted
to be after that point was

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.001
to be a comedian, to be funny.

00:18:08.001 --> 00:18:09.500
And they came to
Broadway, actually.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.740
They were on on Broadway.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.565
YIGAL PETREANU: By they way, you
can still see them on YouTube.

00:18:14.565 --> 00:18:14.830
ERIC IDLE: Yeah?

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.871
YIGAL PETREANU: There is
a complete show of them.

00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:18.280
So it was very entertaining.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.410
So now, because we
are in Cambridge,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.650
and you moved to Cambridge,
enjoyed Cambridge University

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.270
Footlights Club.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.270
And it became something--
it has a very big role

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.710
in British comedy.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.510
So can you tell us
more, a little bit

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.190
about this Footlights
Club and how

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.720
come it became so important?

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.240
ERIC IDLE: Well, it was--

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.015
this is the other
Cambridge, by the way.

00:18:39.015 --> 00:18:40.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.670
Yeah.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.450
And I was fortunate
enough, because I

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.150
was stuck in a boarding school,
I had nothing to do but learn.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.710
So I got more qualifications
than almost everybody else

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.290
who had a decent life and
went out on the weekends.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.800
So I got into Cambridge,
and then in my second term

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.270
I met John Cleese.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:02.620
And I was doing this college
revue, and I did a piece of his

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.912
that he'd written, which
was quite extraordinary.

00:19:04.912 --> 00:19:06.120
And it was great to meet him.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.911
Then he said, come and
join the Footlights.

00:19:07.911 --> 00:19:11.020
And the Footlights
was founded in 1883.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.420
And it was a revue society.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.970
And I'm very proud of the
thing, because I eventually

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.400
became president of Footlights.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.780
And women were not allowed.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.810
So the first thing I,
as a little oik, did

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.020
was to change the
rules and admit women

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.510
to the Footlights, which was--

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.900
I'm proud of that.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.530
And that was about 10 years
before the colleges did.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.871
So it was still just
ahead of its time--

00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:36.370
just.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.614
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:37.614 --> 00:19:39.280
YIGAL PETREANU: About
the next question,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.571
I'm not sure if you can answer.

00:19:40.571 --> 00:19:41.440
But let's try it.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.720
The best of '60s
music was probably

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.500
written under the influence.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.460
However, in your book
you write, and I quote,

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.060
"The idea you could try to
write comedy under the influence

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.130
was anathema to us."

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.665
Why was it so different?

00:19:55.665 --> 00:19:57.790
ERIC IDLE: Well, this has
happened when-- you know,

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:01.430
Python we wrote business hours.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.330
Even when we went to
Barbados to write a movie,

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.750
we still write 10:00 to 1:00,
have lunch, 2:00 till 5:00.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.540
We just wrote-- because we
found it's better if you just

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.534
have regular hours,
then whatever you do,

00:20:12.534 --> 00:20:13.700
you can have fun afterwards.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.570
But when I went to do
"Saturday Night Live"

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.882
for the first time in 1976--

00:20:19.882 --> 00:20:22.820
I think it was the
second season--

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.494
I couldn't believe it,
because the NBC towers,

00:20:25.494 --> 00:20:27.910
you go into their offices, and
they just smelled of reefer

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.119
all over the place.

00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:30.910
And they had them
[INAUDIBLE] doors locked.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:31.880
Nobody came in.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.600
You couldn't do that at the BBC.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.750
They'd go nuts.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.400
But then they'd try and
write on a Tuesday night,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.900
smoking things and being--

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.190
and it would take forever.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.800
And they'd expect the
host to stay up with them,

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.440
which is really boring.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.750
So I found that that it wasn't
very productive-- not that they

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.500
weren't funny
occasionally, but they

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.850
wouldn't do what we always did.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.140
We were obsessive writers.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.990
We would rewrite.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.510
If that's not good enough,
give it to somebody else.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.980
Tighter, tighter, tighter.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.200
Python is just a
group of writers

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.054
who then acted everything
because we'd do it better.

00:21:08.054 --> 00:21:09.970
And we wouldn't have to
bring other people in.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.910
But it's really about
the control of writers

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.590
and that never really
happens in any--

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.740
it doesn't happen
certainly in Hollywood.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.720
It doesn't happen on
television, really,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.070
that the writers are in control.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.720
And I think it's
one of the reasons

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.880
that it's so wacky
and so kind of--

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.220
still resonates a little bit.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.550
But with "SNL," they
never heard of a rewrite.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.230
And when you did the
show, if you notice,

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.430
they're always looking off.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.055
So somebody's having
a scene over here,

00:21:38.055 --> 00:21:39.155
they're reading the cues.

00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:40.090
So, good evening.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:40.930
How are you?

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.590
How are you?

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.610
Are you all right?

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.970
So I find it very disconcerting.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.510
It's a [INAUDIBLE] fake--

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.150
whereas Python, we would
rehearse for five days,

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.910
learn it all, be on
top of the material,

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.090
and when we faced our audience,
we knew what we were doing.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.420
So I did I didn't find it very--

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.520
I found it-- you know, it
wasn't my kind of thing.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.580
I mean, we're much more control
freaks about the writing.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.180
YIGAL PETREANU: So now we
switch from comedy to TV.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.790
Your first experience,
per the book at least,

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.330
is that you were as a writer
only on "The Frost Report"

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.210
and later on at "I'm Sorry,
I'll Read That Again."

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.050
So was it a big change
for you to switch

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.184
to become behind the scenes
just as a writer, pure writer?

00:22:27.184 --> 00:22:28.850
ERIC IDLE: Well, of
the Footlights Club,

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.100
it was in Cambridge.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.180
And it had its own bar, which
was one of the great appeals,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.010
because the pubs
closed at 10:00,

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.900
and our bar would open at 10:30.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.360
So you could go
along to the Club.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.550
It had its own lunches.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.810
It had a little stage where
you could try out material,

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.180
where there were little
concerts that you could try.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.096
And that's actually the
only way to do comedy.

00:22:48.096 --> 00:22:50.530
You've got to stand on
the stage and try it.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.230
And those who die
must be got rid of,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.900
because it's a very painful
experience for them.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.500
So you either can do it
or you have to leave.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.290
So that was very good training.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.570
But it also taught
you how to write

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.280
and we were very,
very fortunate,

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.220
our generation, because the
minute we left Cambridge,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.130
we all went straight into jobs,
because David Frost brought us

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.340
into television immediately.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.000
And we were writing on
the radio immediately.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.520
So all of Python were writers
on "The Frost Report."

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.020
And John Cleese was actually
on the show, but the rest of us

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.561
were writers.

00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:26.300
So it's just one of those--

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.710
and again, it's because there
was nobody in front of us.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.430
It was new areas, we were
ground-breaking new areas.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.270
And the jobs were there.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.980
So I think we're
greatly lucky people.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.100
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.260
We are lucky as well
there, I must admit.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.740
The next experience was
a children's TV show,

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.640
which was this.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.761
I don't know how many
people watched it real-life.

00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:49.260
This is it.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:49.540
ERIC IDLE: Oh, yeah.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:49.880
YIGAL PETREANU: Is it?

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.050
Yeah.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:50.675
ERIC IDLE: Wow.

00:23:50.675 --> 00:23:55.240
YIGAL PETREANU: And again, how
was it writing and starring

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.380
in a TV show?

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.011
And how did it affect your later
writing and starring on the--

00:23:59.011 --> 00:24:00.760
ERIC IDLE: Well, the
Footlights was always

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.069
about writing and performing.

00:24:02.069 --> 00:24:04.360
So you'd write your own
material, and you'd perform it.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.620
And so you do revues, and
you write and perform.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.720
So that's what it was.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.920
It was a natural step for us.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.380
We were just lucky enough
to be offered a TV show,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.720
but it was a kid's show.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.300
And this guy said,
will you do the show?

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.050
And I said sure, but I want
Michael Palin and Terry Jones.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.570
So they came in,
and we wrote it.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:26.650
And we said, well, let's
not talk down to children.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.450
Let's not make it
a children's show.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.605
We'll just be funny.

00:24:29.605 --> 00:24:30.730
We'll just make them laugh.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.190
It will be absurd,
and they'll like it.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.070
And they did.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.722
And the only discipline about
that is you can't be rude,

00:24:37.722 --> 00:24:39.180
which is also very
good discipline,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.138
because it's easy to be
fucking rude, isn't it?

00:24:41.138 --> 00:24:42.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.080
The initial shock
gets you a laugh,

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.660
but it's sort of
cheating in a way--

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.090
useful cheating.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.210
But we were prepared,
and Cleese and Chapman

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.830
were writing for Peter
Sellers at the time, movies.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.570
And their relaxation every
week was to turn on our TV show

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.530
at 5:25.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.820
And they just loved it.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.770
And that's why they
came to us and said,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.390
let's all do this show
that John had been offered.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.780
And we'd been offered a very big
show on an independent channel,

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.787
but they didn't have a
studio for another year.

00:25:16.787 --> 00:25:18.370
So we said, oh, well,
we might as well

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:19.990
do the one with
Cleese for a bit,

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.202
you know, just to
see how that goes.

00:25:22.202 --> 00:25:23.660
But we never got
to the other show.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.012
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:25.012 --> 00:25:27.220
YIGAL PETREANU: And now,
finally, after half an hour,

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.860
we can talk maybe a tiny bit
about "Monty Python's Flying

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.750
Circus" if you don't mind.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.310
I brought a couple of books--

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.160
again, the Bible,
for me at least--

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.750
the entire scripts.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.920
And the question is,
again, most viewers

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.620
think about Monty
Python as a revolution.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.540
However, in your book
you stress the fact

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.250
that it's more
like an evolution.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.370
So how can you--

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.330
ERIC IDLE: Well, at
this stage in the '60s,

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.290
there were lots of little shows
all bumping into each other

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.420
and starting.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.010
And Python just
wasn't a big deal.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.130
I mean, when it started, it
was late on a Sunday night.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.000
The BBC were opening up
that slot because nobody--

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.990
it closed down.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.469
The queen was on a horse, they
played the national anthem,

00:26:10.469 --> 00:26:12.010
and they said, good
night, everybody.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.880
Good night.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.860
And everybody went to bed.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.080
But the BBC really recognize
that some people might

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.930
be staying up a bit,
and so they wanted

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.450
to put something on to see
who was going to be there.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.700
And they didn't much
care what it was.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.442
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:26.442 --> 00:26:28.150
Which was as well,
because we didn't know

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.770
what the hell we were doing.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.686
And they said, well,
what are you going to do?

00:26:31.686 --> 00:26:33.010
We said, Um, don't really know.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.660
And they said, will
there be a band?

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.210
Uh, no I don't think so.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.090
Will there be guests?

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.391
Um, will there be-- no,
no, I don't think so.

00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:41.890
Film?

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:42.400
Oh, yeah, film.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.066
We'll have film.

00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:43.690
We'll do film.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.510
And so they said, oh,
just go away and make 13.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.390
Fantastic.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.450
Really great decision,
because they didn't interfere,

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.200
they didn't watch.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.507
It was just a perfect--

00:26:58.507 --> 00:27:00.590
the BBC at that time was
mainly filled with people

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.070
were just left the RAF, and
smoked pipes, and had beer,

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.510
you know?

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.260
Jolly interesting show
you guys are doing.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:06.760
Keep it up.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.385
Jolly good.

00:27:08.385 --> 00:27:11.050
And it was absolutely perfect.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.310
I called it the
executive-free comedy.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:17.470
And if you see executive-filled
comedy, which Hollywood

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.240
puts out, you'll know
that it's terrible,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.880
because you've got to let these
idiots do what they do best,

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.280
even if they can't
explain it, because comedy

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.280
is the thing that you can't
really explain or predict.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.710
But it's very necessary,
because we all need to laugh.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.860
It just shakes us a little
bit into reality again.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.600
I think that's what it's doing.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.424
But I don't know why it
should be in primates.

00:27:41.424 --> 00:27:43.090
Although in "The Road
to Mars," the book

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:47.344
he was referring to
earlier, I do have--

00:27:47.344 --> 00:27:49.510
I try to make this film
with Robin Williams, and Dan

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.190
Aykroyd, and David Bowie.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.890
They were comedians
on the road in space.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.560
I figured that in space
what they wouldn't have

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.940
would be live entertainers.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.220
And that would be the most--

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.250
the best thing you wanted to
see was live people being funny.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.800
And they had a robot,
which was going

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.060
to be played by David Bowie.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.980
And he didn't understand
what they were

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.152
doing because he's a robot.

00:28:11.152 --> 00:28:12.610
And he couldn't
understand why they

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.560
went on stage and
people barked at them.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.050
And so he started to write
a thesis called "De Rerum

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:22.930
Comedia," for the University
of Saturn, about what on earth

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.760
this thing called comedy was.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.640
And it's quite interesting
when you try and look

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.530
at comedy coldly
and objectively,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:34.750
because if there are
other civilizations, even

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.020
other places where
human-- where life exists,

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.020
would you expect
there to be comedy?

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.040
And I think you would.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.230
If there's intelligent
life, it has

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.320
to perceive of itself as
being somewhat ridiculous,

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.670
because it's going to die.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.320
I mean, that's the basis of it.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.860
You're not here forever.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.470
And I find those sort of
ideas kind of fun to play with

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.760
and to examine.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.190
By having two comedians, I could
take the slightly pretentious

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.740
nature of that discussion
and make fun of it,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.620
as well as exploring it.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.610
That make sense?

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:10.510
A bit?

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.710
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.400
So preparing for
this talk, I, again,

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.492
watched again and again
old sketches on YouTube--

00:29:18.492 --> 00:29:19.950
everything is
available, of course,

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.742
in relatively good quality.

00:29:22.742 --> 00:29:23.950
ERIC IDLE: Thank you, Google.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.000
We spent all those years trying
to connect these sketches

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.899
together.

00:29:28.899 --> 00:29:30.190
And what do you got on YouTube?

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.440
Disparate little
sketches here and there.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.690
YIGAL PETREANU: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.990
But the funny thing--

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.130
maybe.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:39.950
That was funny.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.082
But the funny thing
is still that there--

00:29:43.082 --> 00:29:44.680
I started looking at videos.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.480
And then, of course,
like every YouTuber,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.430
I started looking
at the talk backs,

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.050
because it's much
more interesting

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.580
than the videos themselves.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.420
And there were--

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:59.850
And-- it's true.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.000
But two things really struck me.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.780
One of them was that all the
com-- most of the comments

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.050
were very positive, as opposed
to most comments which you

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.390
can find on YouTube in second.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.000
And secondly is that
they are very recent.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.590
It's not from 20 years ago.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.240
The comments are from last week.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.070
So I wonder-- how can
you explain the fact

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.760
that these sketches still
appeal to young people

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.005
in the 21st century?

00:30:25.005 --> 00:30:26.255
ERIC IDLE: I don't understand.

00:30:26.255 --> 00:30:27.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.810
It shouldn't happen.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.520
Next year as the 50th
anniversary of Python.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.570
It went on the air in--

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.800
Thank you.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.130
Thank you very much indeed.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.140
And we're going to
celebrate by doing fuck all.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.200
And we're more going to
do it together probably.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.840
No, it seems absurd.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.360
I mean it was 1969,
so it seems impossible

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.320
that comedy, particularly, which
tends to be about in the moment

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.670
or what we're thinking about at
the time could last that long.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.120
And I think it's partly
because it isn't in the moment.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.560
It's not satire.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.940
We followed a satire
boom in England,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.520
so there's nothing
that connect it

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.710
to the time in which it's at.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.650
It's about characters
and generic comedy

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.510
about human behavior.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.100
And some of it's silly stuff.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.330
It's still endearing.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.540
But I think the most important
thing about it is it's digital.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.750
We're right at the beginning
of the digital world.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.980
The BBC, we've gone from
film and everything to tape.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.170
Maybe on two-inch
Ampex being taped.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:34.310
And so it's still in pixels, and
you can polish them up still,

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.900
so it can still look fresh.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.210
And we were in color
by three months.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.742
Because if it was in black and
white, in the "I Love Lucy"

00:31:41.742 --> 00:31:43.700
and "The Honeymooners"
territory, then it looks

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.930
like forever in the past.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.700
But I think there's something
to something with that, both

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.430
that it's not tied into
time like an early "SNL,"

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.950
so you have to remember,
oh, Gerald Ford fell

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.444
over a lot, that's why
Chevy is doing that.

00:31:58.444 --> 00:32:00.110
You don't have to
have those references.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:04.760
You can still come in and
find it silly, I think.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.860
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah,
silliness definitely

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.500
strikes out, comes out.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.360
I heard somewhere that
you describe yourself

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.550
as the sixth nicest Python.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.800
Is that so?

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.300
I think I was
exaggerating a little.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.258
YIGAL PETREANU: Oh, OK.

00:32:18.258 --> 00:32:19.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.140
ERIC IDLE: Yeah, well,
I mean, you know,

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.470
poor old Michael always
got lumbered with being

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.450
called the nice one.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:30.270
And occasionally I'm mistaken
for Michael Palin when I'm

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.180
on the road and going around.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.160
And when I'm mistaken
for Michael Palin,

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.830
I always say, yes,
I am Michael Palin.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.538
Now, fuck off, you
ugly old geezer.

00:32:38.538 --> 00:32:40.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.010
And that sort of helps
to destroy his character

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:44.700
little bit more.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.230
YIGAL PETREANU: "Holy Grail"--

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.540
you did this movie, [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.330
ERIC IDLE: Yeah, we did.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.140
Yes, we did it.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.473
YIGAL PETREANU: OK, I wasn't
sure about it for a second.

00:32:57.473 --> 00:33:03.140
OK, anyway, you write in the
book that some of the scenes,

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:08.850
that you had to show the
film on 13 test screenings

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.560
until you were happy
with the result.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:10.770
ERIC IDLE: Yeah.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.228
YIGAL PETREANU:
And I asked myself,

00:33:12.228 --> 00:33:15.600
how come it was so different
from TV, because on TV, you

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.780
were quite confident
on your material?

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.820
ERIC IDLE: Well, on TV
we would do one a week,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.450
and we would rehearse
for five days.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.420
The writing was all done.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.010
And then we'd play
it to an audience.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.426
And the thing about
an audience is

00:33:27.426 --> 00:33:28.890
they tell you where it's funny.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.700
And you cut the bits where they
don't laugh, you take it away.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.830
That's the editing process.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.130
But in a film, you
don't have that.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:36.960
You have this, like, 95 minutes.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.570
And then they laugh here.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:40.320
Then they don't.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:40.960
And they stop.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.270
And then they get bored.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:47.820
And we had a completely
disastrous first screening.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.100
And then we all got
together, because we're

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.020
quite good at writing, and
rewriting, and editing.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.460
And so we started to tackle it,
and we had 13 different cuts

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.686
until we finally
made it really funny,

00:33:58.686 --> 00:34:00.810
where the audience would
laugh all the way through,

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.790
and there wouldn't be a
bit where they stopped.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.400
And if you put laughs together,
then people get on a roll.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.920
And they're still laughing
when the next gag comes along.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.280
And that's what you're trying
to do live on stage normally,

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.440
automatically you're
sort of feeling that.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.330
But in a film, it
takes much more

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.389
to drag it to where
the audience responds.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.800
And so most films
don't get that.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.034
I mean, that's quite unusual.

00:34:22.034 --> 00:34:24.075
And I think it's one of
the reasons the film sort

00:34:24.075 --> 00:34:26.949
of survives and is
still pretty funny.

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:28.440
Apart from a
10-year-olds love it,

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.810
because there is
adults pretending

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:34.500
to ride horses, which is
what they do all the time.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.331
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:38.280
YIGAL PETREANU: I know
many people, again,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.370
even my close family
relatives, regretfully,

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:45.900
who can act out scenes
from "Holy Grail" and "Life

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.610
of Brian" in entirety.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.889
So I wonder how do you
feel about such people who

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:54.929
can really refer to it as
the Old Testament, or New

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.010
Testament, or whatever?

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.680
ERIC IDLE: Not that many
laughs in the Old Testament,

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.179
are there?

00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.390
I did exactly the same.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.080
When I saw "Beyond the Fringe,"
I absolutely bought the album,

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.670
and I absolutely learned
all of the monologues

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.360
that Peter Cook did, and
Alan Bennett did a vicar.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.640
And I learned it.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.234
Why do we learn songs?

00:35:13.234 --> 00:35:14.400
I think it's the same thing.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.610
When you're young, you like
this song, and you learn it.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.920
And then you like this
comedy, so you learn it.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.790
And I think those are the two
important pillars of becoming

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.870
teenager and growing up.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.576
And that's why everything
turns over so quickly,

00:35:28.576 --> 00:35:30.200
because there's
another bunch along who

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.845
are rejecting what the people
in front of them just liked.

00:35:32.845 --> 00:35:33.720
YIGAL PETREANU: Yeah.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.310
Moving on to "Life of Brian,"
it was a lot of controversy

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.670
when it came out.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.540
But definitely cannot be
compared to what happened when

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.380
John said this quote about
Beatles being more popular than

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:49.880
Jesus.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.140
They didn't burn your records
or didn't become violent.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.010
So what do you think
changed between '66 and '79?

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.220
And how do you think it would
have been accepted if it came

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.745
out today, in today's--

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:05.620
ERIC IDLE: Well, that's
a different question.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.250
I think that today is different.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:11.101
People say, well, why wouldn't
you do it about Muslims?

00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:13.350
And we said, well, actually,
we grew up as Christians.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.710
We were forced to go to
church twice on Sundays

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.910
for 10, 15 years.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.950
And that was our heritage.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.170
So we're allowed to
be funny about that.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.780
If you would just randomly
funny about any other religion

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.370
that you haven't
experienced, I don't

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:29.190
think you have the right--
well, you may have the right.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.340
But I mean, it's not
what we would have done.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.940
We were specifically looking
at this particular, Church

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.680
of England, really, which
hardly exists anymore.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.410
And what was interesting
to us is, when we--

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:44.520
it all came from the
opening of "Holy Grail."

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.080
We're in New York.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.460
I opened my big mouth.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.300
And somebody said, what's the
next Python film going to be?

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.760
And I said, "Jesus
Christ's Lust for Glory."

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.134
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.740
I don't know why.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.760
I've had therapy.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.470
It doesn't seem to help.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.200
And then when we
got back England,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.600
Cleese said, actually, that's
a very interesting subject.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.709
Nobody's ever done religion.

00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:15.500
And what I was saying
about the blank field

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.640
is really attractive,
because you're not going in,

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.530
well, this is the 13th
comedy about religion.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.020
Nobody's done this.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.080
And why?

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.610
It was a very
interesting question.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.890
Why don't people do that?

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:31.340
And so we studied it, because
we're all Oxford and Cambridge.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.010
We did about a month's
research, reading the Dead Sea

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.520
Scrolls, and also some
books on the Bible

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.690
and you know what was going on.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.799
And then we all sort
of talked about it.

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:43.340
And we said, well,
you can't actually

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.610
make fun of Jesus Christ,
because everything he's saying

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:51.350
is love your neighbor,
blessed are the poor,

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.680
look after people,
be kind and gentle.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.930
People don't do that
today, but that's

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.280
what the religion says, really.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.720
And so we don't want to
do cheap jokes about JC.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.940
That's not going to be
what we're going to do.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.650
But what is funny
about religion is

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:09.620
how people take over
people, and force

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.660
them to become cult members,
and make them behave,

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.830
and force them to not
think, really, but obey.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.130
And so that's really what
the subject of the film

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:26.555
became as we explored it,
which is we're all individuals.

00:38:26.555 --> 00:38:27.639
(FUNNY VOICE) I'm not.

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:28.430
Yeah, but, I mean--

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.027
--that's really the sort of--

00:38:32.027 --> 00:38:35.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.230
That's the sort of--

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.740
I think that's
somehow very healthy.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.340
And really quite good, nice
people, religious people,

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.230
really enjoyed the
film, because they

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.010
noticed that it was actually not
mocking religion but actually

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:54.180
rather reinforcing some of
the better things about it.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.180
The only thing was that
we were supposed to come

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.030
to America to sort of sell it.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.740
We're flying for junkets.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.160
And I think the first was the
rabbis came out in New York

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.570
and protested,
and we went, what?

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:06.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:06.505 --> 00:39:07.880
And then they went
back in again.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.870
They said, oh, sorry.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.620
And then there were big pickets
outside Warner Brothers,

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.780
and it said "Monty Python"--

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.220
no, it said "Warner Brothers--

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.110
Agents of the Devil."

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:21.990
And everybody knows that CAA.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.470
But we didn't have to come,
because it was on the news

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.460
all over the place.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.230
And once you're on the news--

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.840
and also, the other thing is
once you try and stop Americans

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.194
doing something, they won't do
that, because freedom of speech

00:39:34.194 --> 00:39:35.235
actually means something.

00:39:35.235 --> 00:39:37.230
And it's the only
country that has it.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.990
And it's absolutely vital.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.559
And so they would go and
see it in another town

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:43.350
that would take it.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:47.049
If one had taken it off,
they'd go to the next town.

00:39:47.049 --> 00:39:48.840
It's sort of we didn't
have to do anything.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.872
We just-- we rather
missed the trip.

00:39:51.872 --> 00:39:53.150
Which is sad, really.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.287
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.287 --> 00:39:56.120
YIGAL PETREANU: People
are going to kill me,

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.150
because I have something
like twenty hundred more

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.370
questions about
science, and literature,

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:05.010
and meaning of life, which
you're very familiar with.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.560
But I think that
maybe we'll open

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.700
the floor for a couple of
questions from people here.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.310
And we can later proceed.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.210
So please go ahead.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.630
Let's do it quickly.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.046
ERIC IDLE: Nicely
lit, by the way.

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:18.649
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:19.940
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon, Eric.

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.410
Answer me these questions three.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.701
I'm only going to give you one.

00:40:22.701 --> 00:40:24.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.630
I've witnessed
admiration from Americans

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:29.222
since I moved here
about 18 years ago

00:40:29.222 --> 00:40:35.240
of the UK's progressive
politics and attitudes.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.130
But then, we've got Brexit.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.130
And growing up in Stockport,
just outside of Manchester,

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:45.090
I've seen bigotry in race and
gender be really big obstacles

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:51.410
from the football hooligan crowd
to seeing it on TV as well.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:52.890
How do you reconcile the gap?

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.380
And how successfully
do you think

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.620
that satire skirts the
line between parody

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.947
and reinforcement?

00:40:58.947 --> 00:41:00.530
ERIC IDLE: Well, you
have to remember,

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:04.800
I have now been in
America nearly 25 years.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.420
So when I go back to England,
I don't recognize it.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.080
It's not the England I left.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.440
And I think everywhere
is changing all the time.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.300
But you don't notice it,
because you there all the time.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.064
And I think you--

00:41:16.064 --> 00:41:17.480
don't forget,
Python, we were only

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.350
addressing people from 1969,
on television, to 1973.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:22.820
That's all we were on.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.780
And then it was on in America.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.000
So I think England is
rather good on the satire.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.010
They seem to have
very good comedians.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:34.280
They seem to be not racist.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:40.100
They seem to be quite modern
and quite progressive,

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.410
except for the politicians,
who seem to think

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.140
that Brexit is a good idea.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.570
But, you know, it's
like Dunkirk 2.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.348
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:51.737 --> 00:41:52.650
AUDIENCE: Very good.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:53.150
Thank you.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.290
ERIC IDLE: Sure, thank you.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.880
AUDIENCE: Eric,
what's funny to you

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.710
today-- comedians,
shows, movies?

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.450
What makes you laugh?

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.690
ERIC IDLE: Well, I
have a couple of girls

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.640
who make me laugh
a lot, and they're

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.482
called Garfunkel and Oates.

00:42:08.482 --> 00:42:09.190
Do you know them?

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.027
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.110
Yeah, they're really good.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.450
And they're very
beautiful and very young,

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:15.344
and they write
lyrics much filthier

00:42:15.344 --> 00:42:16.510
than even I've ever written.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.790
So I just love them.

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:23.429
I think there's a lot
of good comedy here.

00:42:23.429 --> 00:42:24.970
But to me, the most
interesting thing

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:28.120
is that, I think since
the George Bush time,

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.470
people get their
news now from comedy.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.220
And I think the "Daily Show"
started it, Jon Stewart.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.760
But now my missus watches the
"Daily Show," Trevor Noah,

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.240
and then Colbert,
and then Seth Meyers.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.740
Every night she
has to watch this.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.680
And it's interesting to
me now that, in order to--

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.050
I suppose it's a counter to Fox,
which is unintentionally funny.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.640
We can't trust the news anymore.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.259
So we get it from comedians.

00:42:56.259 --> 00:42:57.800
And I think that's
quite interesting.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.500
I don't quite understand it,
but I think it's quite healthy.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.971
AUDIENCE: So you were mentioning
how people sort of memorize

00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:05.470
the work.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.110
And these things are just
sort of embedded in our brains

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.410
after so long.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:14.110
And I'm sure that you
regularly have people just come

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:20.620
up and regurgitate your material
back at you out of the blue.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.320
Nudge nudge, wink wink, say
no more-- all that stuff.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.604
I'm wondering if
there are episodes

00:43:25.604 --> 00:43:27.520
that have happened that
stand out in your mind

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.290
where you were
really taken aback,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:32.830
or caught off guard, or were
surprised at the way someone

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:37.030
worked your own material back
into an encounter with you.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:42.870
ERIC IDLE: You mean like
Obama or somebody like that?

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:43.870
AUDIENCE: I don't know--

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.825
Her Majesty breaking into "The
Lumberjack Song," or something.

00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:48.220
ERIC IDLE: Oh.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.990
I did sing "Bright
Side" to Her Majesty,

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.360
and I did make her laugh,
and that was very good.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.160
And I did it for
Prince Charles, too.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.570
But I wore a tutu and a wig,
and I danced around [? these ?]

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.040
little ballet dancers.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.830
I don't think-- I mean,
people do do that.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.810
They seem to do it less--

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:07.450
maybe once you become
more firm stopping them.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.712
But there's nothing you can say
if somebody does that to you.

00:44:10.712 --> 00:44:12.170
Hey, nudge nudge,
know what I mean?

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.010
Say no more.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.120
And you go, mhm.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:14.620
Yeah.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.350
Well, my flight's
leaving, I better get--

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.110
it isn't the conversation.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.760
And that's the true--
all celebrity encounters.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.830
I always try and break
that and say, hi, I'm Eric.

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:28.840
What's your name?

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.300
And then you have a
real human reaction,

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.710
and you're meeting somebody.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:35.590
And they're not meeting
something that is a sort of--

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:39.820
well, they call us legends
now, which of course legends

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.010
are people who are
dead and not true.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:48.340
So I mean, you have to
learn how to deal with that,

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.880
otherwise you become a jerk.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.850
My wife still
thinks I am a jerk.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:57.842
But thank you.

00:44:57.842 --> 00:44:59.800
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that you guys really

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.130
worked really hard at
rewriting, and rewriting,

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.900
and practicing for Python.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.450
But when I watch it, or
when I watched it as a kid,

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.940
it really gave me the impression
of being very spontaneous.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.970
So could you say a
little bit about how

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.480
those seemingly conflicting--

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.910
how you resolve that, or
how you make spontaneity out

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.350
of so much work?

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.870
ERIC IDLE: Well, the
motto of the Footlights

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.750
is ars est celare
artem, which I'm

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.470
sure I don't need to
translate for you.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.110
But it means the art is
in concealing the art.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.080
And so even last night, when
I had a long conversation

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.540
with David Hyde Pierce--
he spent two weeks

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.330
writing and thinking
about how to do this.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:43.120
And then it was
effortless for him.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.410
And I think that's the thing.

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.690
It has to look effortless
but is a lot of work.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:53.530
Of the comedy we did, it
nobody did improvisation,

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.600
with the exception of
Peter Cook, in our day.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.140
And improv came around
in sort of the '80s,

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.377
and now it's all stand-up.

00:46:00.377 --> 00:46:01.210
But we weren't that.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:03.250
We were sketch
comedy, so you could

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:06.610
perfect the sketch
in the writing stage,

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.190
then rehearse it, and
then kill with it.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:14.110
So I think all good
work is hard work.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.046
And I think with writing, all
good writing is rewriting.

00:46:18.046 --> 00:46:20.170
I think you really have to
work hard, and then make

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.540
it look effortless if you can.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.555
That's my tip.

00:46:23.555 --> 00:46:26.829
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:27.620
AUDIENCE: Hi, Eric.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.270
ERIC IDLE: Hello.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:29.936
AUDIENCE: I hope you
still like Chinese.

00:46:29.936 --> 00:46:32.971
ERIC IDLE: [LAUGHS] Are we
allowed to sing that anymore?

00:46:32.971 --> 00:46:34.470
I had to change the
lyrics slightly.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.303
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:46:35.303 --> 00:46:37.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:41.660
So you mentioned earlier about
the blank fields in comedy.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.820
So in your opinion, what are
the blank fields today that's

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.599
still yet to be explored?

00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:49.640
ERIC IDLE: What are they?

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:51.503
ERIC IDLE: Well, it's very hard.

00:46:51.503 --> 00:46:56.380
I mean, I would say that when
you look at Trump, if you

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.450
didn't know, you could
put a laugh track on it,

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.300
because it is kind of insane.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.630
It's wonderfully mad humor.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:08.800
And I love the fact that he did
his usual material to the UN,

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.440
and the world laughed at him.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.135
And then he had the balls to
say they were laughing with him.

00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:16.010
And then they asked at
the UN, and the people

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.840
said, no, no, no.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.810
We were not.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:21.190
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:25.420
And so, I always
think that comedy is

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.745
like the emperor's new clothes.

00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:28.870
It's the kid who says he's
not wearing any clothes.

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.490
Then everybody laughs.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.450
And I think that's very much
what's happening at the moment.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:38.250
And I think people need it.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.970
It sort of reassures you.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.940
It's a balance--
it's a truth-testing.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.900
It's a test against reality.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.630
And I think that's its
uses and its excuse

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.520
and why it's healthy.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:53.190
ERIC IDLE: Sure.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.940
I'd like to read a bit
in conclusion, just

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:55.850
a tiny little bit.

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.880
And I think this
is rather relevant.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.820
So if you'll bear with me,
too it's not very long.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.820
And it's a quote about death.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.826
And I'm talking
about my song "Always

00:48:06.826 --> 00:48:08.200
Look on the Bright
Side of Life,"

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.110
which is the theme of the book.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:14.020
And I say, "My funeral song will
go on and on, though obviously

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.250
we don't.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.260
Dust to dust is about right.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.530
We dissipate into the
carbon atoms we came from.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:23.680
Technically, reincarnation
is sort of correct--

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.470
we get reassembled
into other things.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.710
I'd like to be
reassembled into a Tesla

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:33.580
so my wife can still drive me.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.830
I was born in the same
place as my mother,

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.690
and I wonder if I'll
die there, which

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:39.550
would mean our home in LA--

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.680
to be precise, in
our guest room.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.710
But that's now become
my wife's shoe closet.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.160
I think I wouldn't mind dying in
there amongst the Jimmy Choos.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.260
I worship the ground
she walks on anyway,

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.060
so that would be appropriate.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.690
She who, sadly, knows me best
thinks my last words will

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.930
probably be, 'fuck off.'

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.540
But that doesn't look
good on a tombstone,

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:05.350
so instead I would like
on my grave 'Eric Idle--

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:06.370
see Google.'"

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:08.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.420
Thank you.
