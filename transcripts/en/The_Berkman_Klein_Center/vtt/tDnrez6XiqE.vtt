00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.999
Good morning everyone. I am John Palfrey

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.999
and on behalf of the steering committee thank you for

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.999
being here and most importantly, thank you to Doron and Peter

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.999
and the founding sponsors of the Digital Public Library of America.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.999
That was an announcement of $5 million for the next 18 months or so.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.999
[Applause] there are many things exciting about this

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.999
effort mostly I think the extraordinary gathering of

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.999
people from so many walks of life

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.999
and places this morning gathered around the idea that attracts us.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.999
I think one central concept important to note is there

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.999
was a lot of talk in Washington about public and private partnerships.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.999
It seems this is the embodiment of the really good one.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.999
We just heard about $5 million on top of the previous million dollars in private capital

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.999
being contributed to an ad hoc group of all of us.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.999
We are the DPLA.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.999
To work together in a way we haven't before.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.999
That joins not just us as citizens of the United States and elsewhere

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.999
and international partners as we would hear later today,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.999
but also our federal government which has an unprecedented way stepped up

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.999
and said we want to participate in this likely crazy

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.999
thing. As the chair of the steering committee,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.999
I can say I have been blown away by the extent to which our federal agencies and state

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.999
and local government agencies have held up their hands to say let's work together on this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.999
An amazing realm of people on their steering committee and the three people

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.999
we are about to hear from now in this report from Washington.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.999
I'm going to go down the line

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.999
and we will hear in this report from Washington from three great friends

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.999
and some of the best friends of the Digital Public

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.999
Library of America effort. First Deanna Marcum, the associate librarian of Congress.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.999
We've heard reference to the Library of Congress which

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.999
has a central role to play in these efforts for many years

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.999
and have been a leader in the digitization of our nations heritage.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.999
I believe 28 million objects have been digitized by the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.999
Library of Congress as an important centerpiece in what

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.999
we have to work with the more important is the human capital that Deanna Marcum

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.999
and her team have brought to this effort.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.999
We are grateful for all you have done

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.999
and look forward to hearing from you this morning.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.999
Thank you very much. Is -- in the room?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.999
I have to check to see if she is in the room before I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.999
tell you the Library of Congress is the largest most

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.999
comprehensive library in the world.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.999
There is some debate about that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.999
In the collection of the Library of Congress there are

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.999
148 million items, we have digitized 28 million of those.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.999
I liked Peter's comment about moving from boutique to the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.999
Wal-Mart model because what I think this initiative

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.999
allows is even though we have digitized a lot of material,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.999
it isn't enough to be the kind of digital resource we all believe it's important for the country so we see this as

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.999
an opportunity to expand

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.999
and enhance the work we have already done.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.999
I am filling in today for the librarian of Congress.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.999
If he were here,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.999
I think he would want you to know a little bit more about

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.999
what we have done already

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.999
and then we can talk together about how we can leverage

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.999
what we have done to meet these needs.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.999
The mission of the Library of Congress is to support

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.999
Congress in fulfilling its constitutional duties

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.999
and to further the progress of knowledge

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.999
and creativity for the benefit of the American people.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.999
It is not unlike the NEH mission,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.999
unlike the missions you will hear about here.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.999
The point is what we are concerned about is making these

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.999
resources that have been amassed at a great institution

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.999
by tax dollars from American citizens

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.999
and we want to make that is available as possible.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.999
That is what brings us to the table of the digital public

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.999
Library of America.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.999
It appears to be the kind of opportunity that will help

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.999
us fulfill our mission in a very important way.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.999
Let me go into a little detail about what we have done.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.999
We have a long history of building Digital collections.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.999
It began in 1987 when Dr. Billington was appointed to the Library of Congress.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.999
He went on a tour of the country of town hall meetings in

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.999
10 locations throughout the country. He asked,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.999
what do you want from the Library of Congress?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.999
He met with teachers and librarians and faculty in universities

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.999
and pretty much the answer was uniformly the same.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.999
We want your content and we want to where we are,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.999
not where you are. He took that to heart

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.999
and he came back to the Library of Congress with the

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.999
notion of what we must do is make our content more widely accessible.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.999
The Internet hadn't been invented by anyone yet so we

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.999
looked to CD-ROM technology to get content out

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.999
and we began digitizing collections in the very early 1990s.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.999
We focused on materials that would be focused on the K-12

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.999
community because that's where we thought the greatest

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.999
need was. We were sending CD-ROMs to schools

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.999
and libraries. We had 44 pilot institutions

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.999
and we went back to all of them to find out how they were

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.999
using the content so we could understand what else we should try to digitize.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.999
What was amazing to everyone involved is when we thought

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.999
this would be most useful to high school students,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.999
in fact, all the way down to third grade,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.999
students were making innovative uses of this digital

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.999
content and we saw even with this CD-ROM method,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.999
students were beginning to ask important questions about

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.999
their history and about the world.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.999
We committed to making more and more of our primary source materials available to

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.999
schools and libraries around the country.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.999
In 1995, talked with the Library of Congress about this

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.999
digitization effort and said if you will raise private money,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.999
we will put up some money.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.999
There was a three to one match with a three-part private

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.999
and one part Congress but that allowed us to expand our digitization efforts.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.999
We realized we had special collections that were held

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.999
nowhere else in the country. We had manuscripts and music and maps and film

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.999
and all kinds of things so we began to focus on

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.999
digitizing those special collections of materials rather than books.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.999
We were visited by Google when Google began to digitize collections.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.999
We decided our focus would be on special formats

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.999
and we did a little bit of experimenting but in the end,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.999
we stayed with our primary focus. More recently,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.999
we have begun to think far more broadly about what from

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.999
our collections should be readily accessible to the American people.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.999
We were pleased with the Sloan foundation agreed to fund

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.999
a digitization project that would allow us to identify

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.999
public domain books and our general collections

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.999
and make those available through a website as well.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.999
We were founded for two years by the Sloan foundation

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.999
and we have been able to continue the books digitization

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.999
effort with there own funds but we are systematically

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.999
going through our American history, local history and genealogy collections

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.999
and putting those online as well.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.999
Before I lose my voice,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.999
we think the resources represented in the federal

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.999
agencies is a wonderful foundation for the digital public Library of America.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.999
We are so anxious to make our collections available.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.999
We have worked with the national archives and the Smithsonian.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.999
We have worked with IMLS

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.999
and look forward to working with everyone who has

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.999
contributions to make to this important effort. Thank you. [Applause]

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.999
Thank you so much and thank you to Dr. Billington

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.999
and essentially for your leadership and offers of support

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.999
and your actual support on this effort.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.999
We will see later on this afternoon a treat which is

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.999
examples from the beta Sprint.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.999
One of them is entitled Digital collaboration for

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.999
America's national collections which joins the line very

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.999
of Congress and the national archives.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.999
I understand it's not always the case of these three

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.999
agencies. We are hopeful for all of that

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.999
and all you have done and will do.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.999
A second report from Washington is from the DPLA, Susan Hildreth.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.999
She has been a champion through this project

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.999
and all manner of public libraries including small and rural libraries

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.999
and in many respects helped us identify the newest member of the steering committee.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.999
Susan is currently the director of the IMLS which is in

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.999
many respects yet another piece of amazing foundation that supports museums

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.999
and libraries in the digitization effort.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.999
Thank you and good morning everyone.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.999
I think in this audience,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.999
possibly everybody hear me know what IMLS is just to make

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.999
sure I'm going to review a little bit about what we do.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.999
We are the Institute of Museum and Library services.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.999
We are a federal executive agency that is responsible for grantmaking.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.999
We distribute the federal dollars for libraries and museums

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.999
in the United States but as time as the dawn

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.999
we are fairly young agency.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.999
We were established in the late 1990s and have taken on other roles,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.999
particularly data collection, evaluation,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.999
policy development and leadership in the field.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.999
We think about the role we play with our federal

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.999
partners, Library of Congress, Smithsonian,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.999
we have great access to our nation's museums and libraries

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.999
and we provide a distribution network to the on ramp up

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.999
our digital library highway.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.999
We are excited to be part of this adventure. Again,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.999
I would like to thank the Berkman center for Internet

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.999
and Society, our funders, the Sloan foundation

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.999
and we are very happy to be here today.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.999
Some of the key issues we are discussing today

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.999
and in the future are what should this DPLA be?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.999
I think we have made great progress and will continue to do so.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.999
Who can participate? How can you participate?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.999
How will a pizza stained as a public resource?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.999
From the IMLS point of view

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.999
and from all of the work many of us have done,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.999
I have another question to think about today is which products of the previous work

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.999
can we use in constructing a digital public Library of America this is a key interest for IMLS.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.999
We have made a number of investments in digitization all

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.999
around our nation. We do have federal resources.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.999
We are interested in how DPLA is moving forward so we can

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.999
make strategic investments to support the digitization efforts.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.999
I think as you have heard a little bit today from

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.999
Deanna-- and digital library research development and demonstration projects.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.999
We know in the years that followed other federal state

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.999
and private funders join in supporting these efforts

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.999
and in the mid- 1990s the newly created IMLS joined the

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.999
effort with our first digitization project grant awards in 1998.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.999
Our agencies range of digital library investments has expanded dramatically.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.999
Some of the things we have been doing includes hundreds

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.999
of digitization projects ranging from the specialized and focused --

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.999
and a great partnership with the University of Illinois

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.999
to aggregate the metadata.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.999
You will see that in the Beta Sprint project this

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.999
afternoon. We have been funding projects

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.999
and building tools that enhance how people use digital content.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.999
We have supported the advance of digital libraries such as the ongoing multi- partaner project managed at the

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.999
University of Michigan.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.999
We have supported collaborations at all levels with a wide variety of partners

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.999
and particularly the statewide digitization projects that

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.999
are now in existence in more than 40 states.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.999
We developed applied research ranging from the

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.999
examination of the online information seeking behavior of teens to investigations for the best methods for

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.999
preserving instructional video games.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.999
We are committed to training a high-class quality

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.999
workforce who can become our navigators of the 21st century.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.999
I think our library schools are doing a great job in moving us forward

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.999
and needs additional assistance in developing 21st century digitally competent librarians

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.999
and that is a key role for IMLS.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.999
We're also providing support for national conversations.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.999
Important to the future of digital libraries,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.999
a good example is an upcoming meeting of experts

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.999
and leaders to map out a blueprint for the public library

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.999
role in the emerging Digital Public Library of America.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.999
We will hold back in November at the Los Angeles public

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.999
Library thanks to the work

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.999
and collaboration of the library. These ongoing

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.999
and early investments by IMLS

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.999
and others have advanced digital library practices in

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.999
ways that might not have been possible without

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.999
coordinated and sustained support. What is our next step?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.999
I think we are at a critical point of moving forward in this world.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.999
What kinds of new organizations do we need to provide the services that have been provided previously?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.999
I think we want to recognize we have a lot of information available for our designers

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.999
and builders of DPLA to develop there efforts.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.999
We have developed a critical mass of digitized collections already.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.999
We have elements of existing digital library

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.999
infrastructure. We have developed systems that tools, models and standards and policies.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.999
We have organizations who  were willing to build and maintain and monitor

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.999
and support these digital collections.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.999
One other resource we have available to all of us to help

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.999
jumpstart the DPLA is we have a record of journals, conference proceedings,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.999
reports of 20 years of national

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.999
and international discussions on what digital libraries

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.999
should be, who can participate and how they can be sustained.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.999
From the IMLS point of view where we have invested in our

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.999
aggregate good efforts all across the country

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.999
and we would really like to have our efforts be

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.999
sustainable and available to be evaluated

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.999
and have the impact on our users,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.999
we just have a couple of lessons learned we wanted to

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.999
share. In digitization it's difficult to go at it alone.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.999
Collaboration is key to long-term success.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.999
The traditional understanding of the relationship between

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.999
information providers and consumers is changing

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.999
and both can benefit from working together in new ways.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.999
Digital libraries have demonstrated there potential to

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.999
reduce administrative barriers to information access .

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.999
We have a long way to go.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.999
How can they transform individuals and community lives.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.999
We also want to make sure we follow some of the key

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.999
principles we have been following at IMLS.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.999
We try to make sure our grantees follow interoperability

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.999
and preservation of digital information resources.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.999
We had a discussion about that yesterday about persistence

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.999
and how if someone is involved in DPLA we must have the

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.999
responsibility to take care of that data.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.999
We want to address rights for access and the use of content. Make sure programs

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.999
and services are sustainable

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.999
and find new ways to measure the impact to our public.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.999
Another question we are dealing with is this sounds great

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.999
but what is the difference going to be for a person who

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.999
is going on the web and wants to find information?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.999
I know we can find the answers to that question.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.999
I am particularly pleased to be here because I hope that

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.999
IMLS can support our efforts in the future. [Applause]

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.999
If I might briefly draw out two things you mentioned.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.999
One is one way in which I think the entire DPLA project

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.999
can be successful is not just if it brings support into a

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.999
single force but if it creates a platform that allows for

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.999
better coordination of the funding you

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.999
and others are doing into libraries

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.999
and institutions a part of this,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.999
if what we do is do more with what we are already doing

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.999
and coordinate better, I think we will have succeeded.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.999
I think that's an important initial concept. Second, you mentioned the excitement

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.999
and possibilities of having a new crowd of librarians.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.999
The archivist mentioned our friends at Symonds in Boston

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.999
have a room set aside for people are watching this being streamed to Simmons.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.999
Since we have started this process the number of library students and people

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.999
and library schools have raised their hand.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.999
It's encouraging and exciting.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.999
The last report from Washington. This is David Ferriero,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.999
the archivist of the United States.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.999
He is leading this institution we are in.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.999
He comes from the New York public Library.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.999
Before that he was the director of the MIT director of libraries and at Duke.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.999
It is extremely fitting you are a host today

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.999
and thank you so much for all you have done

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.999
and we are looking forward to listening to you.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.999
Citizens, have your records been scheduled? -- Susan,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.999
have your records been scheduled?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.999
Yes [Indiscernible].

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.999
How many of you, this is your first visit to this building?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.999
I need to tell you who we are because we are the best-kept secret in town.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.999
The national archives is the nation's record keeper.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.999
We are the record keepers for the 275 federal agencies and the White House

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.999
and we provide courtesy storage for all the records of

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.999
Congress. We opened our doors in 1935.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.999
FDR described it as his baby.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.999
It's amazing of what we have in terms of records before

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.999
1935 have survived, exposed to fire, theft and flood

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.999
and exposed to horrible situations.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.999
The story of records being stored in the garage at the

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.999
White House during the Rutherford B. Hayes administration.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.999
We have records that start with the Continental Congress.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.999
The allegiance signed at Valley Forge.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.999
With 44 facilities from Anchorage Alaska to Atlanta Georgia.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.999
I love this debate between the Library of Congress

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.999
and the British Library about size, get over it.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.999
We have 12 billion pages of textual records.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.999
40 million photographs.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.999
600,000 artifacts in the presidential libraries

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.999
and the largest growing collection of electronic content.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.999
Billions of electronic records right now in our custody.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.999
The presidential records act which is one of the sets of

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.999
laws the government recognized electronic mail in 1996 so

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.999
we started collecting e-mail from the Reagan administration.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.999
20 million e-mails from the Clinton administration in 210

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.999
million e-mails from the George Bush administration.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.999
As the president likes to tell me,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.999
not one of those is mine.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.999
Our customers are researchers and genealogists

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.999
and veterans and the general public, Congress

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.999
and the White House using our records all the time.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.999
I have an alter your motive.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.999
My reason for being so passionate about the digital

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.999
library is I want every piece of this collection digitized.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.999
I wanted available to the world. [Applause].

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.999
As you heard from John I have been in this business for long time

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.999
and I can still remember at Duke University faculty

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.999
members coming to me complaining because their students

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.999
were doing all their research online.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.999
I can't remember discussions with my librarians about how we were going to get him to use the paper material.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.999
Get over it.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.999
What can we do to get that stuff digitized.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.999
How can we facilitate the creation of it.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.999
I am convinced if it's not online it doesn't exist.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.999
That is why I am so interested in this project.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.999
Let me tell you a little bit about that massive amount of material we have.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.999
We have done such a small fraction of that content.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.999
We have established commercial partnerships with ancestry.com and family search

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.999
and genealogists are one of our biggest markets.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.999
We have done a small percentage of passenger lists, pension files, the civil

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.999
and revolutionary war records to get that material in people's hands.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.999
The massive amount of material we have has caused us to

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.999
be rather creative in ways of creating new opportunities.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.999
Some of you have may have seen the citizen's archivist

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.999
program that has been launched through the national archives.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.999
Soon you will see the dashboard giving out opportunities

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.999
for the people to get involved in helping us process records.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.999
We are also using them to help digitize our records.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.999
We have a civil war conservation Corps in this building

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.999
working on civil war records preparing them for digitization.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.999
We've got -- that has about 5000 primary sources that are

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.999
loaded with lesson plans

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.999
and a facility for teachers to talk to each other

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.999
and share lesson plans and share uses of material.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.999
We are trying in all different kinds of angles to make as

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.999
much of our content available as possible.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.999
I want to give you a concrete example of the power of

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.999
this kind of digital collection.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.999
I was at the New York public Library for five years.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.999
When I was being interviewed I had to sign a nondisclosure statement.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.999
I spent five years working with Google

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.999
and we digitized about a million books from the New York public Library collection.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.999
I slowly saw the power of researchers having access to that broad body of information

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.999
and how it has already transformed scholarship.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.999
I have a wonderful in-house storage. In December 2009,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.999
the President issued an executive order announcing the

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.999
declassification center at the national archives which

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.999
gave me the mandate to review 400 million pages of classified content

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.999
and with a mandate to release as much is possible on two

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.999
criteria, weapons of mass is corruption

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.999
and national security could be used to keep the classified.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.999
It's a process we have launched working with agencies who

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.999
have equities in the content.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.999
We have reviewed over a million pages

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.999
and have released of those that have gone through the

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.999
full analysis have released 91% to the open shelves.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.999
We are making great progress.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.999
The oldest in these records go back to World War I and 1917. In April,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.999
I am pleased the CIA finally caved on the six oldest

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.999
documents. They were German formulas for secret ink.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.999
Leon Panetta before he left the CIA had a big press

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.999
conference announcing the fact that he is releasing these documents.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.999
What he didn't say is he released them because my staff used Google books

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.999
and discovered these formulas have been published in 1931.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.999
[Laughter].

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.999
That's what it's all about.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.999
Thank you. [Applause]

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.999
Another of the exciting things I think that lies ahead

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.999
and in many different use cases

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.999
and stories we will hear about.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.999
It's not surprising this room is filled not just filled

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.999
with the information business but professional historians.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.999
Historians of researchers that are here because there is

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.999
a sense of opportunity for specific projects

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.999
and research that we simply can't do today.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.999
Another sign of this project is the speakers have kept to

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.999
their time so we actually have time for discussion in this report from Washington.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.999
There are microphones on either side.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.999
I would remind you we are in a place where you are being recorded.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.999
For those of you who haven't been here do need to carve

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.999
out some time to get up into the rotunda to see the

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.999
Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.999
There are samples of records from the archives

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.999
and in the special gallery there is a wonderful exhibit called its cooking uncle Sam

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.999
and it's about the government's role in telling you what to eat.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.999
I would like to acknowledge my mother who is here today.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.999
I'm doing that because it relates to the food exhibit.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.999
She has is in charge of the first ladies let's move initiative.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.999
I am hoping to drag her into the digital library as well.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:06.999
There must be a question by now.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.999
I have no other relatives in the audience to announce.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.999
IMX from Drexel -- I am Mick from Drexel.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.999
-- I think there are different technical challenges with

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.999
putting stuff online [Indiscernible]?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.999
You are looking at three people who don't know how to do that.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.999
[Laughter]. Public-private partnership.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.999
It depends on how you define discoverability.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.999
One of the things Josh Greenberg taught me when he came

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.999
to the New York public Library is we have a history of building digital libraries

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.999
and expecting people to find us so let's think about the people and likes get our stuff out there.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.999
Using YouTube and things like that to get the content into the eyes of the people.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.999
It's a huge problem for me because our records are so massive and complex.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.999
A new learning experience here is that kids today can't read cursive

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.999
and all of my old records are in cursive so one of the

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.999
wonderful things on the dashboard you will see is an opportunity for us to help us transcribe.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.999
Last week I transcribed my first document. I wanted to address accessibility.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.999
I think in your question we speak about accessibility

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.999
you're talking about making material available to be seen or identified,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.999
but I also think accessibility is a much broader issue in

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.999
terms of making the great content we have available to

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.999
all kinds of individuals with accessibility challenges

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.999
and those could be visually impaired,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.999
language challenges, so accessibility is really important.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.999
I agree with you that if you have a lot of stuff out

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.999
there and nobody can find it, what is the use?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.999
One of the things that IMLS is interested in supporting is different strategies

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.999
and platforms to effective discovery.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.999
There are many other entities in Washington

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.999
and even privately that would be willing to support

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.999
development of those kinds of platforms or strategies.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.999
That is a very good example for me

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.999
and better discovery tools about how IMLS can help use

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.999
federal dollars to support this initiative,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.999
but I would just like to echo,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.999
we haven't talked all that much about accessibility,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.999
but I'm assuming I think it is a key priority that all of

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.999
our information is available in many different formats.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.999
There's another aspect of this,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.999
this is a lesson I learned at MIT a round serendipity

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.999
and how we make it possible to have that same serendipity

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.999
experience because that is where discovery comes from.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.999
I will hand the microphone back to you.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.999
I am Nancy and I'm the director of the Smithsonian institution libraries.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.999
Since the Smithsonian was mentioned as one of the three

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.999
agencies trying to develop,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.999
I wanted to mention to the audience we also are very

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.999
interested in participating in the DPLA with our 137

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.999
million objects, since we are talking numbers today.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.999
This is a good competition.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.999
I have to follow that up by saying 124 million of them

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.999
are natural history specimens.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.999
How many mosquitoes we want to have at the DPLA is a question.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.999
I think you have seen in the past that the secretary said

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.999
he also wants to share the Smithsonian's riches with the

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.999
nation and the world in many ways and we already have 6.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.999
4 million digitized objects

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.999
and are trying to go forward as fast as we can.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.999
We are in a unique position to pull in museum library and archived objects together

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.999
and to help figure out how that can best be done for the DPLA and for the nation.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.999
I am eager to continue to cooperate

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.999
and share our riches with all of you.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.999
[Applause].

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.999
Thank you.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.999
We've had extraordinary support from your colleague

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.999
and the Smithsonian has been very actively involved

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.999
and we look for much more to come as we digitized the

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.999
insects and many other things.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.999
I have a question about the statement regarding the CIA

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.999
documents. My brother and I have had conversations

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.999
and is rocket science work for the military.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.999
We've had conversations about reverse engineering

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.999
and the dangers of fat.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.999
I was curious -- dangers of that. [Indiscernible]

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.999
I don't want to give the impression the archives of the

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.999
United States has the authority to release.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.999
The authority given to me in the executive order is to

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.999
give the agencies around the table to review the content

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.999
to ensure it is really classified. It was the CIA who released it, not the national archives.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.999
I just facilitated the process.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.999
Do you anticipate more?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.999
As I said, we have done a million so far.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.999
It has to be done by December 31, 2013.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.999
I should also tell you in this room we had two open forms

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.999
for the public to advise us on which records are of the

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.999
most interest so we could get some citizen participation

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.999
to help us prioritize. I hosted both of those meetings.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.999
The room was evenly split in both cases,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.999
the Kennedy assassination conspiracy and UFOs. [Laughter]

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.999
As you mentioned, I'm from the British Library

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.999
and delighted to be here but won't even get into

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.999
arguments about size. They are disadvantages of scale.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.999
It's like turning a big oil tanker

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.999
and whatever direction you want to go and it's always too slow.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.999
Those of you who have smaller institutions, sometimes that can be a major advantage.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.999
I'm really delighted to be here

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.999
and thank you all for inviting me.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.999
This happened to coincide with the visit to the states so

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.999
I was delighted to stay on here today.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.999
Like the Library of Congress,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.999
we are a library of the world

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.999
and for the world so we share your aspirations to open up

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.999
our great collections of all cultures

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.999
and languages to the world. We have digitized a lot.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.999
We have got a lot of boutiques

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.999
and shops that there is a disconnect and opportunistic but nevertheless

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.999
 we want to make a digital library.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.999
One of the challenges is what is the difference between

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.999
the digital library and a wonderful but confusing

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.999
and if you like random set of resources.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.999
I think that is one of the challenges that we need to face.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.999
I think public-private partnerships have been mentioned.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.999
I think we in the UK because of our history

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.999
and partnership of these things,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.999
I know you will hear from Jill Cousins.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.999
We have brought some coherence bringing brought from the

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.999
European context through the European Library library

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.999
which will be an aggregate of libraries of Europe into

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.999
the broader cultural Museum.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.999
We have just opened up all of our metadata on our CC0 license.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.999
It was a braver step then perhaps you might -- in part

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.999
because we have a particular government that requires me to earn money.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.999
It's not always a comfortable place to be so we said we

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.999
don't think that's right so we opened up the 16 million

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.999
of metadata to the world.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.999
We have got everything happening in the most extraordinary way.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.999
I suppose another lesson is you have no idea what this is

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.999
going to be used for. You can't plan for it

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.999
and it will be infinitely more creative the wider this thing gets.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.999
I think metadata is a key consideration with this.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.999
I think we have done a lot of work

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.999
and are beginning a long journey on what we label.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.999
Digital curators and modern librarians,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.999
I think that is a challenge we all share.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.999
People as comfortable with large data text

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.999
and all of those things,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.999
as with perhaps our traditional services.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.999
I can give you many examples of what we digitized.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.999
There is much more to go.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.999
We intend to go as far as we can from a variety of sources.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.999
It's often said the UK is probably the bridgehead between

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.999
North America and mainland Europe.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.999
I would like to suggest that we are probably a good stopping off point

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.999
and if there are opportunities perhaps in this program we

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.999
would be delighted to host something in London at the

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.999
British Library as you take this journey forward.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.999
We are part of the journey with you and I am delighted to be here today. [Applause]

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.999
We will probably take you up on that kind offer.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.999
I should note one other thing you didn't break about what

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.999
should have is some of the research coming out of the

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.999
British Library in terms of how young people use information.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.999
One of the reasons I think you have that serendipity

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.999
and wonderful things issue have come to understand the

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.999
concept but if we make available the tools and metadata,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.999
people will do amazing things with it.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.999
My name is John Mayer for the center for legal computer construction.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.999
To use your imagination, it's 2016

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.999
and older collections have been digitized,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.999
I am assuming this will only take five years.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.999
I've heard a lot of excitement for that process

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.999
and for the science and how are going to do that.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.999
What does society get? How does society

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.999
and crew for change once that is in place?

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.999
What is the science fiction of the DPLA?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.999
I can speak for myself.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.999
If we assume that people benefit from having access to information resources,

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.999
they can make better decisions for themselves.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.999
They can understand where they have come from

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.999
and possibly a better direction.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:07.999
They can understand world cultures.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:16.999
I think what we have been trying to do -- who want to use

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.999
them in any way they want it's what we have talked about

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.999
with libraries my whole career.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.999
We've talked about wanting to get these materials out to

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.999
people. We finally have a mechanism for doing that.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.999
I don't know for me it isn't any more than that,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.999
just making it available. Most of the resources

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.999
and public institutions are they are because Americans

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.999
have paid for them. It seems only right to share them.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.999
For me, it is creating better informed citizenry.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.999
The records here should be used to hold our government accountable for their actions

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.999
and for us to be able to understand our history.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.999
We should be learning from our history.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.999
The only way you can do that is to have access to the records

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.999
and people don't have that kind of access right now.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.999
I am hoping we create a more informed citizenry. I personally think it's an amazing opportunity as my

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.999
colleagues have echoed.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.999
I also think if everything is digitized,

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.999
I think as a practicing public Library

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.999
and the question comes to mind,

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.999
what happens to our physical facility?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.999
Even if we may be aggregating

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.999
and curating data for our customers,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.999
do we still have a place for people to gather?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.999
I think by providing all of that information

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.999
and the empowerment of that information to our citizens

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.999
it will create an even greater need

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.999
and desire for people to work together.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.999
As we have heard from the British Library,

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.999
the stuff it is out there

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.999
and people may be related in the virtual

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.999
and physical world, but I think it is a very exciting

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.999
and liberating future for our communities and citizens.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.999
I think the other question I have is,

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.999
if for going to have all of this data out there, we must have connectivity to homes

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.999
and libraries in schools.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.999
I think the more we make this content available people will understand

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.999
and adopt because they want to be there

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.999
and know what is happening.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.999
I think it is a great hallmark for the future.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.999
We have had a question session,

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.999
but you may have noticed a lot of that has taken the form of testimonials

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.999
and it's wonderful to see the support expressed from the

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.999
Smithsonian as well as from these three institutions represented on stage

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.999
and it's great that -- has just invited us all to London.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.999
We accept.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.999
The point I want to make is when we consider what we

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.999
should name this thing,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.999
one of these suggestions was a national digital library

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.999
and it was rejected because there is nothing

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.999
nationalistic about this at all.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.999
We may go from the boutique phase to the Wal-Mart phase.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.999
Getting bigger means going international.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.999
The -- wanted to be here. He says he is with us.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.999
We have Jill Cousins and the European digital library.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.999
These expressions of support from lots of different US

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.999
institutions as well as everyone scattered around the

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.999
country especially public libraries in small towns.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.999
What this represents is a movement that has nothing

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.999
nationalistic about it but goes back to the international

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.999
Republic of letters that was dreamt of in the period of enlightenment.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.999
I hope when getting his feeling we can make happen what

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.999
was a utopian dream at the founding of this country.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.999
That sounds a little hiatus, but I I couldn't resist. [Applause]

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:43.999
I hope you will join me in thanking ever speakers. We have had an amazing group come together. Thank you.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000
[Applause]
