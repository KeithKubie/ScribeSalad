00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.137
Use substitution to
solve for x and y.

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:04.720
And they give us a
system of equations

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.980
here. y is equal to
negative 5x plus 8

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.800
and 10x plus 2y is
equal to negative 2.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.010
So they've set it up
for us pretty well.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.627
They already have y
explicitly solved for up here.

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:18.210
So they tell us,
this first constraint

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.787
tells us that y must be
equal to negative 5x plus 8.

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:24.620
So when we go to the
second constraint here,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.250
every time we see a y, we say,
well, the first constraint

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.330
tells us that y must be
equal to negative 5x plus 8.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.810
So everywhere we see a
y, we can substitute it

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.277
with negative 5x plus 8.

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:39.360
Because that's what the
first constraint tells us.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.319
y is equal to that.

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.110
I don't want to be
repetitive, but I really

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.187
want you to internalize that's
all it's saying. y is that.

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:47.270
So every time we see a y
in the second constraint,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.710
we can substitute it with that.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.690
So let's do it.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.970
So the second equation
over here is 10x plus 2.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.610
And instead of
writing a y there,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.360
and I've said it
multiple times already,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.560
we can write a
negative 5x plus 8.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.280
The first constraint
tells us that's what y is.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.669
So negative 5x plus 8
is equal to negative 2.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.460
Now, we have one equation
with one unknown.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.520
We can just solve for x.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.974
We have 10x plus.

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:17.890
So we can multiply it.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.740
We can distribute this 2
onto both of these terms.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.170
So we have 2 times negative
5x is negative 10x.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.690
And then 2 times 8 is 16.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.740
So plus 16 is equal
to negative 2.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.280
Now we have 10x minus 10x.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.350
Those guys cancel out.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
10x minus 10x is equal to 0.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.750
So these guys cancel out.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.350
And we're just left with
16 equals negative 2,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.290
which is crazy.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.050
We know that 16 does
not equal negative 2.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.550
This is an inconsistent result.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.380
And that's because these two
lines actually don't intersect.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.930
And we could see that by
actually graphing these lines.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.450
Whenever you get something
like some number equalling

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.890
some other number that
they're clearly not equal to,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.780
that means it's an
inconsistent result,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.030
It's an inconsistent system,
and that these lines actually

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.760
don't intersect.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.280
So let me just graph these
just to make it clear.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.830
This first equation is already
in slope y-intercept form.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.960
So it looks something like this.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.690
That's our x-axis.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.120
This is our y-axis.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.170
And it's negative 5x plus 8,
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.720
And then it has a very
steep downward slope.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.157
Every time you move forward
1, you have to go down 5.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.490
So it looks something like that.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.350
That's this first
equation right over there.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.020
The second equation,
let me rewrite it

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.520
in slope y-intercept form.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.790
So it's 10x plus 2y is
equal to negative 2.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.870
Let's subtract 10x
from both sides.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.540
You get 2y is equal to
negative 10x minus 2.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.070
Let's divide both sides by 2.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.560
You get y is equal to negative
5x, negative 5x minus 1.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.200
So it's y-intercept
is negative 1.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.120
It's right over there.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.990
And it has the same
slope as this first line.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.950
So it looks like this.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.250
It's parallel.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.180
It's just shifted down a bit.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.900
So it just looks like that.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.180
So they're parallel lines.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.530
They have the same slope,
different y-intercepts.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.970
We get an inconsistent result.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.690
They don't intersect.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.260
And the telltale
sign of that, when

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.760
you're doing it
algebraically, is

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.500
you get something
wacky like this.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.140
This is why it's
called inconsistent.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.020
It's not consistent for 16
to be equal to negative 2.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.290
These don't intersect.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.310
There's no solution to both of
these constraints, no x and y

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.350
that satisfies both of them.
