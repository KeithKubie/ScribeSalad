[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.890
TERRY PATTEN: Hi, everybody.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.420
I'm excited to be here,
particularly in the citadel,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.590
Google, because I think
the broad cultural force

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.220
that intelligent,
rational, technologically

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.300
sophisticated, scientifically
innovative players are

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.110
able to bring to our
world is so crucial

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.720
and right now, so
under utilized.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.660
I think we have a
huge opportunity.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.150
You have a huge
opportunity, and frankly,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.160
as you'll hear a responsibility.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.630
And I'll be talking about
how the challenges are not

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.480
really just problems
to be figured out,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.600
but they're an
existential challenge

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.580
to our whole way of being human
and to our self understanding

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.000
and our orientation.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.790
I'll get into that.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.260
Mainly, I want to talk
about three things.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.850
One of them is this
idea of a meta-crisis.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.760
Very often, we talk
about global warming.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.220
And perhaps, in
some conversations

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.650
we have a broader
view, and we talk

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.690
about the larger ecological
emergency, which isn't

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.580
reducible to global warming.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.250
The destruction of so much of
the rainforest, for instance,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.870
shrinking the
lungs of the planet

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.440
is not exactly the
same as global warming,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.230
and this broader
ecological predicament

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.050
is a lot more severe
than people realize.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.750
It's part of what
I want to express.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.420
On the other hand, when
people have the courage

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.610
to face directly the
actual nature of our moment

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.450
and how dire it is in some ways.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.970
It tends to bring about
an orientation of despair.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.919
There's a huge community
that's grown up, for example,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.850
around the idea of
civilizational collapse,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.220
the idea that it is
inevitable that we

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.310
will see societal collapse
relatively near term.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.240
I disagree with that,
and I'll be explaining

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.840
why that's not only
logically flawed, but morally

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.010
reprehensible.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.170
And that's an important piece
of what I want to share.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.620
However, what it boils
down to is an opportunity

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.700
and a challenge for
us each individually.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.520
I often use the
metaphor of a zen koan.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.440
This meta-crisis is an
impossible question.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.330
Like in zen, the
monk is sometimes

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.400
given an impossible
question, like what

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.920
is the sound of
one hand clapping,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.510
or show me your original
face, the one you had

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.860
before your parents were born.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.190
And those questions
stop the mind,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.090
and they and they
require the aspirant

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.640
to go beyond their
whole way of being.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.570
It's a challenge that's
non-linear you can't figure out

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.460
the answer to a koan.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.170
You have to dwell in the
tensions that the koan creates.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.270
I think this crisis
represents that kind

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.180
of a transformational
pressure cooker

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.020
that admittedly, most of
humanity is busy ignoring

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.980
and not looking at.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.880
We live in a culture
pretty profoundly dedicated

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.730
to a kind of radical denialism.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.280
On the other hand, though, we
live in this time for a reason.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.230
It is an opportunity.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.560
And ultimately, I find it
thrilling and inspiring.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.520
And I hope by the
end of this talk,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.259
you'll be feeling the same way.

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.800
The second thing I
want to talk about

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.200
is a deeper dive into what
time it is on the planet

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.070
and what that means for us, the
nature of this tipping point,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.250
as an existential matter.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.220
And then finally, I
want to talk to you

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.820
about what the innovators--

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.460
and here at Google,
it's like a citadel

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.440
of what I call the innovators,
the unique role that innovators

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.830
will play or fail
to play at a very

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.880
crucial moment in the whole
evolutionary trajectory

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880
of this human experiment.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.450
Now, this is a little bit
of a different kind of talk

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.610
than you've probably
heard before.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.030
You might think of it
as a meta synthesis.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.270
A synthesis might bring together
a lot of data and insights

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.450
and factoids of a
variety of kinds

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.930
to deliver a shift of view.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.930
That's what a synthesis is.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.210
But if you really want
to comprehend what's

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.060
going on right now, it
requires a whole series

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.747
of such syntheses.

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.330
And so what I'm going
to be delivering

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.960
is a meta synthesis
that therefore will not

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.800
be peppered with all
kinds of references

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.880
to particular studies or to
facts you haven't heard before.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.380
It's going to really have to
do with an invitation for you

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.180
to make your way of seeing
an object of your attention

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.870
to make your way of being an
object of your inspection,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.920
and to draw you
much more profoundly

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.340
into an opportunity
for new possibility.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.390
So I invite you to suspend your
usual way of listening in order

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.120
to be available to
making real use,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.210
downloading this meta synthesis
that I'll be offering.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.800
Another thing that is
important to set out,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.780
just as a vocabulary
for us to use

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.220
is the idea of
world views, which

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.410
we've all heard of, that people
occupy certain world views.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.350
And we generally talk
about the differing world

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.370
views, for instance, of
Republicans and Democrats

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.090
in the United
States, or we might

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.230
talk about the world views of
people in an African country,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.890
or diverse, indigenous
world views, et cetera.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.450
But it's important
to understand just

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.880
how profound and far
reaching that idea

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.890
is, that in a sense, when we
occupy a certain way of seeing

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.940
reality, all kinds of
implicit assumptions

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.270
are part and parcel
of our world view,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.820
and just that we can
recognize world views and even

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.770
observe some things
about our own world view

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.910
doesn't deliver us from the
limiting function of world

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.920
views.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.770
A world view is a
total perspective.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.980
It has implicit in it values.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.830
It has implicit in it attitudes.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.460
It has implicit in it ways
of relating to other people.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.490
And most of that tends to
be invisible to the occupant

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.120
of any world view.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.460
And so as we begin to talk
here about how our crisis is

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.540
operating, we have to look at
how the conflict of world views

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.610
plays.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.140
And I'll go into this a
bit more as we apply it.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.470
Where are we right now?

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:49.310
Well, I think that among
democratic voters, recently,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:56.140
a poll identified climate
change, which is really

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.080
the proxy for all
ecological issues,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.860
as I think, the fifth most
urgent issue in the minds

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.790
of democratic voters.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.700
But in the last year, if
you've been paying attention,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.570
you've probably seen
a new IPCC report

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:19.430
that outlines just
how devastating 1.5

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.680
centigrade rays of global
temperatures would be.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.340
You've also seen a
US climate report

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.070
that underlines those findings.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.840
You've maybe seen
the new findings

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.299
that show that ocean warming
has been taking place way more

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.450
rapidly than anyone
had previously

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.960
been projecting, by somewhere
between 40% and 60%.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.650
You may have--
well, I won't keep--

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.580
this is a litany.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.790
We hear it all the time.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.560
You don't really need
that education from me.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.560
What you are aware of is
that we're not addressing it,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.150
and that the struggle to begin
to address it effectively

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.240
is, if you've paid attention,
even to European politics,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.130
where the countries
there are really

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.100
our leaders in the
world, it's not

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.920
as if the level of
awareness and action

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.930
that the European
countries are taking

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.790
is adequate to the
problem at all.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.100
And here in the United
States, nothing is happening.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.730
So the crisis, even
if we think about it

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.800
in climate or ecological
terms, and the meta-crisis

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.300
is much more than that, still
hinges on cultural changes

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.240
and cultural communication.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.290
And all kinds of
factors are interacting.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.990
You get serious about
climate, pretty soon,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.960
you're really interested
in campaign finance reform.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.760
Then you're interested
in reforming

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.010
the Balkanization of media.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.140
Then you're interested
in voting rights.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.250
I mean, you bounce around from
issue to issue as an activist,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.770
because everything is entangled.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.380
We have an entangled
series of crises.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.870
If you've looked
closely at what's

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.520
happening in the
educational system,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.480
not just in the United
States, but around the world,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.650
you discover, wow, our whole
way of educating ourselves

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.689
and younger people
is in a crisis.

00:10:17.689 --> 00:10:19.480
The health care system
in the United States

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.400
is particularly in crisis.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:29.750
We also can see that there are
crises that are psychological,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:36.840
addiction, depression,
anxiety, breakdown of family,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.530
and the interaction of family
breakdown and neighborhood,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.600
community breakdown.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.950
We can talk about this
crisis from multiple angles.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.350
But really, there's
only one world.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.500
And no matter what lens we put
on, no matter what analytics we

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.160
focus our attention on,
we're catching a partial view

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.020
of a larger phenomenon.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.840
And it's a single phenomenon.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.750
We may be thinking of it
as an ecological crisis.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.510
We may be thinking of it as
a psychological or spiritual

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.650
crisis.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.310
We may be thinking of
it as a cultural crisis

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.800
and a breakdown of
community, family, et cetera.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.640
We may be thinking of it
as a crisis of government

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.220
and economics and finance.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.210
And it is all of these things.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.610
But it's not reducible
to any one of them.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.690
That's why it's a meta-crisis.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:35.180
And in a way, crisis isn't
quite the right word.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.800
It's really kind
of a predicament.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:46.370
The ecological analysis
that is simplest and easiest

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.980
to communicate,
argues, essentially,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.310
that we have gone for
some years into overshoot.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.060
I think it's summarized
the best by a book called

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.380
"Overshoot" by William Catton
that was published 30 years ago

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.790
almost.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.460
And it basically
identifies a way

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.250
of understanding any
ecosystem, whether you're

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.320
talking about an
island or a pond

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.590
or a Petri dish or a planet.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.470
And whatever ecosystem
you're describing,

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:21.420
whatever environment, it has
a certain carrying capacity.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.530
And its carrying
capacity is the quantity

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:30.630
of any particular animal or
plant, any life form that

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.860
can be sustainably supported
in that ecosystem over time,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.930
permanently.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:45.790
And when you exceed the carrying
capacity of that ecosystem,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.780
you might successfully
continue for a while

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.330
by drawing down certain
resources temporarily.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.164
The problem is that those
resources you draw down then

00:12:59.164 --> 00:13:00.580
are in shorter
supply, and you may

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.320
have reduced the
ultimate carrying

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.420
capacity of that ecosystem.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.880
You've drawn down
non-renewable resources,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.240
or you've damaged the systems
through which resources

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.370
can regenerate.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.680
And Catton's
historical analysis is

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:23.650
that in an accident of
historical sequence,

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.090
around 1,500 Europeans
discovered the New World,

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:35.830
and very quickly were able to
draw huge amounts of resources

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.430
from the New World.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.280
So the European
Western countries

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.150
went through a period of
rapid economic expansion,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.450
based on the availability of
unlimited resources, which

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.110
he calls the corner
cornucopian myth.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:58.450
The idea is that there
are now and will always

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.030
be unlimited resources.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.670
And that was proven
out, because very soon

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.460
after the discovery
of the New World,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.480
and the full exploitation of
the incredible rise of wealth

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.187
that that brought, there
was the discovery of coal

00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:14.770
and then the discovery
of oil and then

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.740
the discovery of natural gas
and the exploitation of all

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.640
the fossil fuels.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.570
So we have gone through a
process in now world culture,

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.830
because those European countries
that originally discovered

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.980
the world view,
it is their legacy

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.010
that is now the pattern
of the whole modern world.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.580
No matter what part of
the world you go to,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.300
the systems that
are dominant are

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.380
the legacy of that original--

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.102
the conquest of the world
by the white man's tribes,

00:14:50.102 --> 00:14:50.810
we might call it.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:15:01.600
So that world has now
instantiated a presumption

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:09.650
of unlimited resources and
never ending economic expansion,

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.800
and we're now in the
neighborhood of a peak oil

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.570
moment, in which the efficiency
with which we can make use

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.290
of the remaining fossil
fuels is degrading,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.840
and that's periodically
sending shocks.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.470
It's one of the reasons that our
financial markets are so jumpy,

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.290
why there is so much pessimism,
why so many people say

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.390
that things are on
the wrong track,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.440
et cetera, et cetera. this sense
of disquiet, this sense that we

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:42.590
are headed for some kind
of apocalyptic calamity

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.050
is sort of in the water system.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.030
You go to the multiplex.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:52.290
Three out of four movies
are about saving the world.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.910
Well, we wouldn't be saving
the world if it weren't that we

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.760
believed in some way that
something about what we rest in

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.510
is endangered.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.550
So there's a deep
malaise and a confusion

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.480
that is culturally
pervasive that partly comes

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.600
from this intuition
of this situation

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.350
that the cornucopian era
is now under challenge.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.440
I personally believe
that we will discover

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.660
a relatively free,
relatively clean energy

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.670
source at some
point, and that there

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.290
will be another round of
cornucopian possibility.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.610
But the unsustainability
of a long term cornucopian

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.210
orientation needs to be--

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.870
well, the sustainability
of it needs to be examined.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.320
The presumption that we
can simply take for granted

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.730
that this orientation will
be a permanent condition

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.400
of our existence deserves
critical inspection.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.640
Let me digress for a moment
and introduce a vocabulary.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.760
I called you guys
innovators, and I

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.470
was drawing on a very
simple categorization

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.130
that I make of what I
consider the three most

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.020
important conversations
that human beings are

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.180
having at this time.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.109
We are at a time in which we are
reaching an inflection point,

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.740
and we are beginning to have
serious conversations in which

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.960
our very best intelligence
is in dialogue with itself

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.000
in the form of the most
intelligent participants.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.570
But we're having three different
conversations that I think,

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.090
each of which I
believe are essential.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.610
And those conversations are not
in dialogue with one another.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.670
So one of them I
call the innovators.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.760
And I very frequently
mentioned Larry Page as one

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.050
of the leading thinkers of
that innovator conversation,

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.480
along with many, many,
many others, too many

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.830
to mention adequately.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.160
But I'll throw out a few
names, but the obvious people,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.270
Elon Musk, Bill Gates.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:07.070
But Sam Harris-- you know,
they're not all entrepreneurs,

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.850
necessarily.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.820
Rational-- Steven
Pinker, a variety

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:16.850
of innovators who are in
the most powerful position

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.250
right now and are seen
broadly in our culture

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.680
as the people who are
creating the future.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.590
Because not only are they
capturing the flag in terms

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.822
of technological and
scientific advances,

00:18:26.822 --> 00:18:28.280
they're capturing
the flag in terms

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.420
of the entrepreneurial
deployment of those advances,

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.000
and therefore, they have
the cultural influence

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.210
and the money to really
back up their intention

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:44.020
to be the change, map the
future of possibility.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.920
But I kind of briefly
alluded to this point of view

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.730
that I describe and give
the simple name ecologists.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.260
And I would say the
ecologists ascribe

00:18:54.260 --> 00:19:00.940
to the narrative I offered,
that the cornucopian myth is

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.150
a myth, that the
Malthusian attitude,

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.200
which is that we are
headed for a collision--

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.210
you know, the
Malthusians have been

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.610
proven wrong again and
again and again and again

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.420
throughout history.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.250
So the evidence
kind of stacks up

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.370
to support a
cornucopian orientation,

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.030
except we're dealing
with a collision

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.650
of a different character
than we ever have before.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.470
And we don't see solutions.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.520
I'll get into that in a minute.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.660
So I think that
ecologists, you know,

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.714
there's a great range of
people I would call ecologists

00:19:34.714 --> 00:19:36.130
I would include
my friend, Michael

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.880
Dowd, the evolutionary
evangelist, who's

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.900
a very rational character.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.550
But I would also include--

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.880
for instance, there's a
non-profit organization

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.810
here in San Francisco called
the Pachamama Alliance, where

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.380
a financier, Bill Twist
and his wife Lynne,

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.030
who was the kind of
leader of the Hunger

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.890
Project for many years, had
a visit to Achuar people

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:10.090
in the Amazon and
Ecuador and formed

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.040
an alliance with
indigenous people,

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:18.320
and they're bringing services
into that part of the world

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.230
and trying to preserve
chunks of the forest,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.030
the habitat of those people.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.260
But what they're arguing
for, more fundamentally,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.610
is that there is a kind of--

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.780
we have lost our memory of how
to live on this planet in a way

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.470
that doesn't destroy it,
and that there is something

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:43.150
fundamental in the existential
orientation of a life that

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.440
knows at a deep unconscious
or pre-conscious level

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:53.410
that it is killing its host,
that all of us are sick,

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.520
it would be argued, because
how we feed ourselves,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.100
how we transport ourselves,
how we earn our living,

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.030
and everything else are
intertwined inexorably

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.750
with a larger system that
is completely unsustainable.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.680
And it's producing horrific
effects that offend us,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.590
morally and spiritually.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.060
And the ecologists are
arguing in a variety

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.560
of ways-- some of
them simply have

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.080
to do with a rational
argument about how

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.200
to preserve our future.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.750
Others have to do with the
whole field of eco psychology

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.650
as one of the expressions of
this ecological point of view.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:39.172
And there are very intelligent,
very well-read, very deeply--

00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:40.630
I'm going to be
offering you a link

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.260
to a rather terrifying,
but very well researched

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.150
paper called "Deep Adaptation"
by an academic ecologist,

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:54.010
somebody in the field
of sustainability.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.440
It's kind of business
management for sustainability

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.800
is now a pretty big field, and
he's a leading expert there.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:07.546
And he's arguing for this
scenario of societal collapse.

00:22:07.546 --> 00:22:08.920
Now, there's a
third group that I

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.040
think is equally important
that I call the evolutionaries.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.120
And I would number myself
as an evolutionary.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.060
What characterizes
evolutionaries is,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:26.460
is that we recognize evolution
as a multidimensional affair.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.900
It wasn't just
biological evolution,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.630
which is what people
usually think of,

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.200
the adaptive emergence
of new traits.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.080
There was cosmic evolution
before the earth was formed

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.820
and in the early years of the
earth, that just took place

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.320
in the [INAUDIBLE]
sphere, before it

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.400
moved into the biosphere
and created the biosphere.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.530
And really, the most
important evolution

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.540
that's been going on
for the last 500 years

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.300
has been cultural
evolution, the evolution

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.010
in the noetic sphere,
the interiors,

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.130
the collective learning
of human beings.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.970
And it's here that we
have our biggest problem,

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.060
because no matter how
much we might locate

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.400
our crisis as a
matter of maintaining

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.790
a habitable earth, our ability
to reach agreements and make

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.010
intelligent,
collective decisions is

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.700
crucial to any solution we
might want to instantiate.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.680
And we can all see how broken--

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.020
we say our politics
are broken, but it's

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.970
a much more pervasive matter.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:34.880
So evolutionaries are those
who take a meta perspective

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.500
on the perspectives
in play and recognize

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:45.870
that we are only
effective if we can

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.620
put on the lens of the person
we're in discourse with,

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:55.380
and if we can draw ourselves
beyond the limits of the world

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.430
view we're inhabiting, and
that to do that, we need

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.380
a lot of things that
radically reformat

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:07.380
the hard drive, for example,
higher states of consciousness.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.800
Particularly, there
are different species

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.800
of those higher states that we
can visit through entheogens

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.680
or psychedelics, or that
we can intentionally

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.680
cultivate through
practice of meditation,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.210
a variety of approaches.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.660
That's only one part of what
evolutionaries bring in.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.350
Part of what evolutionaries
are able to see

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.980
is the way that world views
define everything we can see.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:41.360
So evolutionaries are
looking at this whole matter

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.970
in an evolutionary context
and are recognizing

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.080
its evolutionary implications.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.520
And there's a lot more
to say about that,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.550
but very briefly, we
are alive at a time when

00:24:54.550 --> 00:25:00.110
from an evolutionary
perspective of life on Earth,

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:05.410
of not just the human species,
but most even marginally

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:10.970
intelligent species, not all,
but most mammalian species,

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.110
there's an existential
crisis brewing right now.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:19.850
What happens in your lifetimes
will have profound implications

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.700
to the future, not
just of human life,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.730
but of every charismatic
megafauna species

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.520
that you might care about.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.630
And we are here.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.900
Who is going to be a part of
the creation of that future?

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.940
And who has an opportunity
to make a moral difference?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.500
We are the ones.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.690
When we take that seriously,
it tends to sober us a lot.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:53.430
This particular moment in
time, I think maybe some of you

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:58.110
have noticed the 11
year time frame that

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:02.730
was identified in
the most recent IPCC

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.600
report about 1.5 degrees
centigrade temperature

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.740
increase.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.520
We have to make radical
changes that transform

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.320
our whole pattern of
our whole economy,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.190
relative to what powers
us, fossil fuels,

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:24.510
and accomplish it in
something like 11 years,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.660
according to that
particular analysis.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.610
Now, is that analysis
absolutely dependable?

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:38.120
Every analysis and every
perspective, by the way,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.780
is both true and partial.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:46.030
I think what we can know and how
well we can know it needs to be

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:52.210
viewed with a kind of
self-critical awareness,

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.220
that that 11 year--

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.680
at the end, nobody
knows for sure.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.660
But really, well-informed,
intelligent, deep people

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.900
have done their best to quantify
our window of opportunity.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.470
And they've come
up with 11 years.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.230
That's enough for me.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.450
What I have decided,
and what I offer

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.100
to you is the idea
that as much as you

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.100
may look at things through
a certain world view,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.510
and as much as that may
be inescapable, that is,

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.640
you can't just notice that
there are multiple world views

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.120
and escape the
limits of your own.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.650
You are bound to it, but
you can be in conversation

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.220
with perspectives
that are only apparent

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.390
from outside your world view.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:43.610
It is a little like state
specific memory, you know--

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.655
I remember, as a
kid seeing kind of--

00:27:45.655 --> 00:27:47.280
I don't think it was
a Hitchcock movie,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.780
but sort of a similar
to a Hitchcock

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.060
movie, about a
guy who could only

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:56.100
remember certain things when
he was drunk or sometimes

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.720
in a rage, or whatever.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.640
Only in a certain state are
certain things perceptible.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.910
Well, we can think about some of
what we're dealing with, using

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.120
that as a useful metaphor.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.910
It illuminates the fact
that we are actually

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.970
occupying entirely
different realities,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.380
and yet, we talk
with one another

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.810
in a single body
of discourse, as

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.660
if there were a single
knowable truth that we all

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.470
ought to be able to
talk one another into.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.540
Well, this orientation that
we have a definable problem

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:36.600
that we can figure out, and that
has a single definable solution

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.790
is completely obsolete.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.470
We are facing in
this meta-crisis

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:49.920
a necessity of transformation
on every level of human life.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.600
It's what I refer to in my
book as whole systems change.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.290
That means that there are
psychological changes, what

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:03.210
our idea is of a successful life
well-lived, what our ideas are

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:08.210
about satisfying relationships,
what we aspire to,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.410
what gives our life meaning
and purpose, the ways that we

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.140
enjoy.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.150
All that's going to have
to go through a morph.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.450
It does arrive on
a personal level.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.590
Maybe we begin by thinking of
this as an engineering problem,

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.950
of coming up with a relatively
free and cheap energy

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.730
source that will liberate
us from this problem,

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.760
but that wouldn't suffice.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.310
In fact, there are
analyses of what

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.070
we're facing that
don't focus even

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.610
on ecology, that regard the
whole matter as a matter

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:47.020
of a self-accelerating pattern.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.050
Maybe some of you are aware
of a very important book that

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.460
was published in 2017 by the
physicist Geoffrey West, who

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.910
is the director of the
Santa Fe Institute.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.890
The title of the
book is "Scale,"

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.100
and in it, he used the tools
of physics, mainly math

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.050
and ratios, to analyze
biological and social systems.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.690
And he came up with a lot
of very interesting insights

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:15.460
about metabolism and lifespan
and cities and so forth.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.310
But to me, the most
interesting single piece

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.040
of that broad analysis
was his tracking

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.150
historically of the
major transformations

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.670
of the techno economic
means of production

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.140
that power human societies, like
the discovery and use of stone

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.533
tools, or agriculture.

00:30:36.533 --> 00:30:40.120
He marked each one that
had an advent of out

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.030
of a major increase,
because it definitely

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.390
precedes in the stage process.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.830
It isn't a smooth
ramped trajectory.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:55.990
And what he noticed was
that each transformation

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.110
happened faster and faster
and faster and faster.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:03.910
And he noted, gosh, if we
are all together involved

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:09.590
in a self-accelerating pattern,
we have a design problem,

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:14.210
because a self-accelerating
pattern is self-terminating.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.030
You can't go faster
and faster forever.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.180
If you track changes
on a timeline,

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.880
and at first, they're
very slow, and then

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.250
they're a little faster and
faster and faster and faster

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:29.450
and faster and faster, you
come upon a time singularity.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:34.850
And he identified as a
result of that analysis

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.030
that a grand unified
theory of sustainability

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:42.230
was the way he put it that
combined our understandings

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:48.190
of economics and politics
and social theory and all

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:52.120
the hard sciences
would be necessary

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.440
in order to turn that around.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.460
He imagined that one of
these stage transitions

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.710
might give us the
breathing space

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.230
to make that kind
of a radical turn

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.710
toward a permanently sustainable
presence on the planet.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.040
But it was really something
he conceived of abstractly

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.010
as a hypothetical.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.250
Another futurist, Peter Russell,
came to the same conclusions,

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.800
examining entirely
different data.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.790
But in a way, it's an
extension of the thesis

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:25.000
that Alvin Toffler put
forward almost 30 years ago

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.770
in "Future Shock."

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.330
And part of our meta-crisis is
simply the human adaptation.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.740
We talk a lot about how much our
lives have changed because we

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.670
live so much of it online, and
our relationships are mediated,

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.670
and that's affecting us
in both good and bad ways,

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:48.770
and it's very different
now to be 10 or 15 or 20.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.370
Everybody is going through a
transformation because of that,

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.680
and that's a piece
of our meta-crisis.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.970
The argument there is
that change is stressful,

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.520
and complexification
is stressful,

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.180
and this self-accelerated
crisis is speeding up

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.630
change and complexification
to a point that it's

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.500
beginning to test the
neurological limits

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.260
of human adaptation.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.570
So that may be true.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.670
It's important to
realize, though,

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.030
that when we look at all of
these critical tipping points,

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:26.400
I've been mentioning, primarily,
depressing, negative ones.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.190
But there are equally inspiring,
potentially positive ones

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.740
in play, not just
technologically,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.970
but you know, for instance,
all the wisdom traditions

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:43.020
of every culture on Earth
have been in conversation now

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.830
in at least a beginning way
for over 50, maybe 75 years.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:51.650
And we now have a couple of
generations of Westerners,

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:56.300
who've applied themselves to
the technologies of awakening

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.850
or enlightenment that
come from the East.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.350
And those people
are in conversation

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.450
with each other informed
by the beneficial influence

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.840
of scientific
analytical tools, I

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.270
mean, just comparative
religion, for example.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.110
But much more
rigorous than that,

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.440
we're quantifying
all kinds of things,

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.550
and our development
of the technology

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:24.530
of becoming our best, not
just consciousness hacking,

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.800
but peak performance
as a general category,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:35.810
is reaching a whole new level
of objective clarification.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.330
And we have a lot of
people who are applying

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.070
those tools, and
who are achieving

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.250
different levels of
clarity and excellence,

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:48.889
who are advancing the
dialogue, just as in AI, we

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.219
may get to a point where
intelligent machines can

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.380
redesign even more
intelligent machines.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.770
We already have people
who are embodying

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:02.890
excellence, who are refining the
field of embodying excellence.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.790
And there's the beginnings
of the virtuous cycle

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.760
that might bring about
a positive singularity

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.080
of that kind.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:16.040
And there are other dynamics
that are very important.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:22.040
One of the things that I get
into in my book pretty richly

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.460
is our disasters are going to
open windows of opportunity

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.640
for more fundamental
systems redesign,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.250
that after it's too late
will be when it becomes

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.460
possible to do many things.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:42.830
One of the problems that we
have with the current dialog

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:47.100
is that everybody participating
in it, for the most part, very

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.040
few, few
evolutionaries, are free

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.940
enough from the implications
not to be so gripped by the fear

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.500
and grief that come upon
us when we contemplate

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.557
civilizational collapse, or the
end of the human experiment,

00:36:01.557 --> 00:36:04.140
that they're able to have enough
free attention to participate

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.250
with all their capacities.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.360
And so a big subsection
of what I teach

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.710
and what I bring to
people is an understanding

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:19.100
that no matter
what, you are going

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:23.630
to, at some point in your
life, experience what

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.340
the Buddhists call the
heavenly messenger, sickness,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.370
old age, and death.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.640
You will, and we all
will experience loss.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.980
We will all experience pain.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.400
And we'll eventually
cease to exist.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.040
And that's always
been OK with us.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.320
So the fact that we're
facing some of this

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.890
collectively, that the most
extreme challenges in every one

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.140
of our individual
lives, are challenges

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.330
that we face together,
this is stimulating

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.900
and will stimulate a new
species of conversations.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.380
Our intelligence will be
in conversation with itself

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.830
in new ways.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.150
And the people who
can do that best

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:07.600
are the innovators, because
you, collectively speaking,

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.660
are the dominant influence
in culture right now.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.720
But because your
world view tends

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.710
to confine what you think of
as relevant and interesting

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.620
to the kinds of things
you already recognize,

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.380
you're tending not to recognize
the fresh perspectives

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.820
and important truths that are
also being brought forward

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.850
by the intelligent
conversations among ecologists

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.950
or evolutionaries.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.920
And so it will be the--

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.680
not the kind of--

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.840
what we might call
the yang heroism,

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.620
the very masculine heroism,
kind of like Hercules,

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.350
bursting through, of the
innovators saving the day

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.016
with new breakthroughs
that will be sufficient,

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.640
because the cultural
dimension is going

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.210
to require a coming
together of the human family

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.220
and of all our intelligence.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.330
So it is innovators,
who by waking up

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.810
to a certain fundamental
epistemic humility, recognizing

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:07.410
that the way you know and the
way you see, however clearly

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:12.460
and with whatever profoundly
penetrating laser vision,

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.990
you may have, is only
a part of the process

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.030
and that you need to
be in conversation

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.310
with other perspectives,
and particularly

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.460
the families of conversation
that I'm lining out here,

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.970
that I call ecologists
and evolutionaries.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:32.620
So leadership among
innovators, who take seriously

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.790
your unique
responsibility, is perhaps

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:40.470
one of the crucial things
that can turn the Titanic.

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:43.080
Many of you are probably
familiar with the idea

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.760
of the trim tab.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.430
This is something Bucky
Fuller talked about a lot.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.110
When you have really--

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:56.510
the Queen Mary, a really
large ocean liner, a rudder

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.400
turns the ship.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.720
The turning radius
is way too wide.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.890
The efficiency of
navigation is compromised

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:08.360
by the very size of the ship.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.110
Even with massive rudders,
they turn too slow.

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.840
But if you put another
little rudder on the end,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.930
not very big, with a
very powerful motor

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:21.570
and all kinds of bracing,
it turns way faster.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.650
That's a trim tab,
that extra rudder.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.860
And if we're going
to turn this Titanic,

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.910
it's going to be because
of little acts of heroism

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:35.870
by many, many people
in a broad complex.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.290
It will be necessary for
our best intelligence

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:44.180
not to just rearrange the
deck chairs in this Titanic

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.540
metaphor, but to break into the
engine room and grab the wheel

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.130
and actually turn the ship.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:54.020
And I want you to
consider that this

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:59.570
is an inspiring and ennobling
prospect, that it's thrilling

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:00.710
to be alive right now.

00:40:04.412 --> 00:40:09.460
In some of the-- you might
say the Jungian and soul based

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.800
psychological and
spiritual traditions,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.340
it is said that we consented
to be born in this time.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.270
Whether we think of it
in those terms or not,

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.790
we certainly are
born in this time.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.290
This is our time.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.860
Whatever your
character is, it is

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.540
going to be expressed in the
peculiar mix of opportunities

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.550
and challenges that present
themselves in this time.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:36.200
And so you have
coincided with a moment

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.180
in which the events
in your lifetime

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.030
are going to be of
enormous consequence

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.040
on an evolutionary
scale, and you

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.970
have some measure of
intelligence and capacity

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.150
and power.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:58.680
There's a chilling poem
written by Drew Dellinger,

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.060
with lines that go something
like, it's 3:23 in the morning,

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.640
and I can't sleep.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.220
I keep hearing the voices of
my great great grandchildren

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.630
calling to me,
asking me, what did

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.600
you do when the
planet was unraveling?

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:22.210
What did you do when
the oceans were dying?

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.160
Once you knew, what did you do?

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.130
That's a tremendous
moral seriousness,

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.530
and the paradox is
we can't fulfill it

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:36.240
if we let the weight
of that sobriety

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.740
kill our sense of humor.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.620
Things are far too serious for
us to lose our sense of humor.

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:43.320
Things are far too serious
for us to lose our capacity

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.940
for lightheartedness.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.510
We are being asked to come
into the game with a yes,

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:53.200
we can kind of an attitude, a
can do positive orientation.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.820
And when you begin to
recognize where you really are,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.890
I think instead of arriving in
this orientation of believing

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.440
in collapse, which,
in my opinion,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.790
is a problem, because
mindset becomes

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:09.915
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.440
Things are far
too serious for us

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.570
to allow that
pessimism to condition

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.690
our way of participating, such
that the potential heroism

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.180
that we might bring
to this complex

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:26.990
is dented by our depression,
or our discouragement.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.210
So a whole different quality
of human relationship

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.860
is possible and asked
from us right now.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.430
We have to turn to one another.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.050
We've been given a koan, I
can't answer it by myself.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.620
The only answer to
that koan is from us.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.630
It's a collective koan.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.060
And the biggest
problems in our lives

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.630
are the same as the biggest
problems in each other's lives.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.780
Whatever the challenges that
you are facing personally,

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:59.020
they're dwarfed by our
collective challenges.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.210
And yet, those
are an opportunity

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.750
for a life of meaning and
purpose and contribution.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:08.980
So that's what I'm
dedicating my life to.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:14.140
At the end here, we'll put up
a slide with just a few links,

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.760
mainly to my work, and also
to this paper I mentioned,

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.020
which can serve as a 2
by 4 across the forehead,

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.450
the "Deep Adaptation"
paper by Jim Bendell.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:27.991
It's at lifeworth.com/de
epadaptation.pdf.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.490
My websites are
newrepublicoftheheart.com

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.750
about my book,
newrepublicoftheheart.org,

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.660
which is the non-profit I've
founded, and terrypatten.com,

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.480
and I invite you to
check all of that out.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.094
And I hope you'll read
my book or consider

00:43:48.094 --> 00:43:49.260
listening to the audio book.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.060
I've read the audio
book, and so you

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.300
can absorb it that way if that's
going to flow in your life

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.690
better.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.370
And I hope we have time
for a few questions.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.870
AUDIENCE: I wanted to get your
impression of the cornucopian

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.420
myth that we're kind of
fulfilling here at Google,

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.740
where there's kind of this--

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.440
there's still this impression of
unlimited expansion on the web.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.750
So there's kind of
maybe some impression,

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.480
there is maybe a lower
sort of material cost

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:21.540
by servicing equivalent
services or products on the web,

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.140
and as a Googler myself,
our targets every quarter

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.680
are higher than they
were previously,

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.980
our need to fulfill
click volume is

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.300
kind of continuing to increase.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.800
I'm just curious
on your perspective

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.670
unlike first how the cornucopian
myth has sort of translated

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.880
to the digital age.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.860
But also as Googlers, you know,
you said we're innovators.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.570
But are we also not--

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.110
do we have a space in trying
to curb some of the expansion,

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:53.111
like in turning the hit
Titanic, to your allusion there,

00:44:53.111 --> 00:44:53.860
from where we sit?

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.390
TERRY PATTEN: Yeah, I
think that to some degree,

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:00.270
you have to succeed in
the system that you're in,

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.540
even if you see that it has
some unhealthy dynamics.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:09.060
So your participation in doing
your job of helping Google

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:13.230
succeed this quarter
is probably not itself

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.960
part of turning the Titanic, no.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.340
But it is--

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.070
I don't think it's evil.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.740
I think that it's
part of perpetuating

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.650
a system that needs to go
through a more radical change.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:40.530
And as a participant in
this process, you are--

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.960
part of what you can do is--

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:50.830
and I would recommend--
is to grow yourself into--

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:54.400
like most of you Googlers
are relatively young,

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.920
and you have a lot of life
and capacity ahead of you,

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.980
and so as you cultivate your
consciousness and your capacity

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.270
to be a friend to
another person,

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.670
and there are a variety of
very ordinary human maturations

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:12.220
that are necessary for you to
be the kind of leader that's

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.370
going to be able to be
effective in changing--

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:22.390
the fundamental systems redesign
is probably going to not

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:26.710
be possible until there are
disruptions, positive or

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:27.910
negative.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:31.060
If somebody comes up with
that cheap free alternative

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.490
to fossil fuels, that's going
to be a massive disruption

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:34.502
to the whole economy.

00:46:34.502 --> 00:46:35.710
That's going to change a lot.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.084
And you might have
an opportunity

00:46:37.084 --> 00:46:39.850
to write the code
for what replaces it.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:45.730
If there is a massive
ecological disaster that

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.670
kills tens of millions
of people and shocks

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:53.560
the world into a whole new
orientation to our place

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.520
on the planet, and we've got
countries all over the world,

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.940
revising their international
financial agreements,

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.200
some people-- perhaps this
isn't your area of expertise,

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.740
I suspect.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.930
But we're going to be
rewriting the rules

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:09.770
of our international
financial system.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.650
We're going to be
rewriting the back code.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.740
So your guys' capacity to think
meta systemically and identify

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.560
the rule sets that are going
to genuinely be sustainable

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.630
is hugely important.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.310
If, for example, in
October or September,

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:30.190
October, November of 2008,
the brightest young thinkers

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:35.260
in financial and economic
theory were giving papers

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.220
to Hank Paulson and Ben
Bernanke and George W. Bush that

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:43.750
would have shown them a way of
making good use of that crisis,

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.180
they could have nationalized
the banks at that time.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.120
They had lots of
room to really make

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.980
fundamental systems redesign.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.870
Those opportunities are
going to come into being.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:56.260
So using scenario
planning, you can

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.900
identify the crises
that are going

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.550
to create windows of opportunity
for more fundamental systems

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.680
redesign, and you
can be there at

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.080
the ready with the white
papers or the thought

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.390
through new coding
or rule sets that

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.010
are going to make a difference.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.720
And you're the kind of guys
who can think in those terms.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.410
We really do need that
kind of leadership.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.290
And you don't have
to tackle the project

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.670
as a current
deliverable that you

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.390
have to come up with
this month or this year

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.280
in order to begin
to prepare yourself

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.130
to be the kind of person
in the kind of position

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.210
that can make that
kind of difference.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.290
So that's kind of what
I'm hoping you'll do.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.100
AUDIENCE: It relates
to the question--

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.750
it relates to the point about
being epistemically humble

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.050
and showing humility from
your particular world view,

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.880
and being open to
other world views.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.810
So for example, from the
innovators' perspective

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:54.280
being really opening up to the
perspectives of the ecologists

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.370
and the evolutionaries.

00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.010
Potentially, an
innovator would think

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:04.960
that being open to data, for
example, as is the innovator's

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.990
mindset, is kind of an
epistemically humble thing

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.470
to do, because you're being
open to the data that's

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.310
presented to you.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:17.740
So to be open to ecologists and
evolutionaries, what would that

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.660
look like in practice?

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.880
How would you become
more epistemically humble

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.470
from your particular
perspective?

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:24.886
TERRY PATTEN: Well,
the main thing

00:49:24.886 --> 00:49:27.040
is that you would
have to recognize

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:33.110
that all your data derives from
data collection methods that

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:35.540
are themselves
ways of quantifying

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.490
a more complex reality.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:41.430
And therefore, they're an
incomplete map of that reality.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:44.010
And so the data
is very powerful,

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:46.670
but it's not omniscient.

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:51.680
And so no matter how voluminous
or good your data is,

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:56.750
it is not a total
picture of reality,

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.980
and especially, because we're
facing a critical moment

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:06.140
in which we have to make such
profound whole systems change,

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.310
the critical
leadership can't derive

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.920
from data that is gathered
in the old pattern.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.350
A new pattern has
to come into being.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.020
And therefore, all that
you can gain from the data

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.630
that you have is
incredibly valuable.

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.010
But it isn't a total
view of things.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.560
So if you--

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:30.190
I think it's easy
for us to become

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.700
inflated by our successes.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:38.350
And data can help us succeed
famously in the marketplace

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:44.150
and in commerce, and even in
the court of public opinion,

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.180
academically, for example.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.360
But it won't.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.050
The design specs for the
challenge that we're all facing

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.970
right now are very, very steep.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:03.310
Our ability to meet those design
specs requires us to get past,

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:04.700
oh I'm doing pretty well.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.962
My income is going up.

00:51:06.962 --> 00:51:11.100
Or an attractive person
has come into my life,

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:14.410
and I'm happy about my
relationship in the world.

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:17.890
Those levels of
success are wonderful.

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:19.090
I wish you all the best.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:22.800
But we've got to crack the code
of how we turn the Titanic.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.970
That's a big, big challenge.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.800
And the existing data will
be of important relevance,

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.810
but if we worship
the god of data,

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.080
as if it has all the
answers, we're blinkered.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.770
It's just this.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:41.540
Ken Wilber, my friend
and our co-author

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.550
of the book in
real life practice,

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:47.090
uses the term
flatland to describe

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:53.870
the materialist scientific,
objectivist perspective

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.720
that tends to dominate
among innovators.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.050
And its biggest
liability is arrogance.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.890
It succeeds in many
ways, but it then

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:06.080
becomes epistemically closed.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.470
It lacks that humility.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:12.260
So simply taking on board the
fact that you do know a lot,

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.480
you can see a lot, the
data shows us a lot,

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.310
it's really
valuable, most people

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.960
can't understand
it or crunch it,

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.780
and I can, and I'm
able to contribute

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.930
something that's of real
significance, that's

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:24.440
not enough.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.590
That level of
success-- if you end up

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:32.530
having lived a life in which
you had a successful position

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.650
in a corporation that was part
of a pattern that destroyed

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.770
the world that your great
grandchildren would have

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.800
inherited, your success
is pretty tainted.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.400
So if you bring in the
kind of humility that

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.100
cares to really be the change
we want to see in the world,

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:55.100
then your relationship to
the data becomes serious.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:00.530
And you don't cease to
notice all the opportunities

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:01.730
and possibilities.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.520
But you don't confuse
them with omniscience.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.500
You break below that.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.160
And yes, letting the
data inform your choices

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.479
is brilliant and important,
but it's not a panacea.

00:53:15.479 --> 00:53:16.020
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.840
And with that, we've
come to the end.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.090
So Terry, on behalf
of Google, thank

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:23.190
you so much for sharing your
time and wisdom with us today.

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:24.850
Thank you.
