1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.050
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.610
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?</v>

3
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.590
It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,
March 18 2000.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.360
I take what's going on out.

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.363
<v 2>Ah,</v>

6
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.470
<v 1>what's up with you?
What do you say?
Um,</v>

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.900
I am uh,
you know,
I realized this morning when I was washing the dishes,

8
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.010
I just come from the gym by Dubai and then I did my upper body.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.960
I actually ran into somebody this past weekend.
They'll say,
dude,

10
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:35.090
I always see at the gym was,
he's like,
you're always doing legs.

11
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.620
That made me feel good.
You know,
being a child of the 80s,

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.540
you never did your legs.
It was just all about the upper body,
right?

13
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:49.330
Just building yourself up from the waist up,
like a house of fucking cards.

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.740
And all it took was one leg sweep,

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.730
one for Dota and putting up fucking three 15,
four times.

16
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.050
Still one leg sleep when dash land on your side.

17
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:04.370
Separate your shoulder.
Right?
Just covering up the skinny little legs,

18
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.510
trying to fucking kick the guy off you in some fucking parking lot that they put

19
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:12.240
a tent over so they could sell some bud lights with Lyman.
It.

20
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.980
Remember those days,
your member member that right.

21
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.090
We get fucking hammered and then the fucking,

22
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.000
the red line would shut down and we'd have to fucking steal a cat.

23
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.240
Sorry.
Um,
um,
I'm pitching the,
uh,

24
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.210
the sequel to goodwill hunting.
How soon before they reboot that,
right.

25
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.720
I would say goodwill,
this is a leather chair.
I'm not farting profusely here.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400
Um,
what was I gonna say?
Yeah,

27
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.860
the sequel to fucking goodwill hunting.
All right,

28
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.280
well marry the chick there.

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.573
Minnie driver,

30
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.680
he marries or they have four kids now that divorced because,

31
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.800
you know,
just hug and Robin Williams doesn't erase a childhood.

32
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.670
So eventually his demons,
because he is who we use,

33
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:05.330
came out the fucking marriage and now they get forward kids.

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.400
And uh,

35
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.300
the one that's most like will doesn't get along with them,
you know,

36
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.240
cause they're so alike.
Right.
And,
uh,
I dunno,

37
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.690
I dunno where to,
if somehow these iron man,

38
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.920
they're still to actually promote the movie or fucking one of those fucking God

39
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.440
damn.
When is that chicken?
And there's,

40
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.090
there's like no end in sight to those fucking movies,
right?

41
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.480
It's like become an incestuous now.

42
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.500
Now they like doing like the oceans 11 of like superhero movies.

43
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.390
He's fucking poor actors,
man.
You know,
back in the day,

44
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.630
used to dream of getting a role of playing this,
to play to that.

45
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:50.200
Now everybody that just,
everybody's selling the a two.
And I just,

46
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
if I could just be,
if I could just be a lightening man,

47
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.290
I could get a bungalow in Oxnard.
Um,
but who knows.

48
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.190
Congratulations to Liverpool.
They one,
I missed the game yesterday.

49
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:09.280
They won two to one.
I was hoping they one to nothing.

50
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.820
So I could say to nil sound like I know what I'm talking about.
As far as I know,

51
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.770
there's still one point behind the fucking man city cuts all that Middle Eastern

52
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.604
money.

53
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.740
You want your money clean from a pure nation appear part of the world like the

54
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:26.590
United States of America.
That's right.

55
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.170
Cause we're always on the right side of the ball.

56
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.630
If there's any comedian out there listening right now,

57
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:37.730
if you want to get laughs when you go overseas,

58
00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:41.450
just start reciting our propaganda.
You don't even need a set up or anything.

59
00:03:41.451 --> 00:03:45.890
And people just start laughing.
Begins Afraid of people just,
they just laugh.

60
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.350
All right,
this standards,
what do we got here?

61
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.050
<v 0>Oh fuck.
They're at first place by two points.
Oh my God.</v>

62
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.840
<v 1>God,
you gotta be shitting.
No wait,
wait,
wait.
Before I get excited.
Is it though?</v>

63
00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:03.600
Is this the latest one?
It is.

64
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.470
Are you fucking kidding me?
What happened?

65
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.950
What happened to Man City with that?
Never end in oil money.

66
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.700
What happened are the old breakfast buffet.
Gotcha.

67
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.200
<v 0>The yanks came in,
but their big valleys in that big bag of cash.</v>

68
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.890
<v 1>Woo.
All right.
I love it.</v>

69
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.620
I love money against money cause I'm a capitalist.

70
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.720
I want to see how this is going down.

71
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.020
Is there anything better than watching these giant hardware stores?

72
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.810
Just putting each other on a business.
I can't get enough of it.

73
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.260
Just fucking throw it down like bloodsport on to view and to be the ones that

74
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.350
shallow the how much no one was shut.

75
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.940
I have and this part of the region is part of the world unless we show,

76
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.480
oh,
oh.
What's that?
You want to build something?
It was called [inaudible].

77
00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.830
We rolling off the allies.
I'm sorry.
Anyways,

78
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.650
uploading ahead here.
Uh,
this morning after I went to the gym,

79
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.870
did my legs yesterday,

80
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.340
my pasty spindly legs that just never seem to want to get any bigger,

81
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.520
but I have to do them to,
to,

82
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.860
to keep my a cyanic nerve issue at bay because what happened after years and

83
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.800
years that drive in myself stuck gigs,

84
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.830
right?
Play in every shit hole from here to fucking uh,

85
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.130
Chilkoot Charlise I did them all.
White privilege,
um,
Hashtag not so much.

86
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.300
I hate when white people because they actually had to work for what they wanted

87
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:42.010
in life.
I think that they're not privileged.

88
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.600
My Dad didn't have a yacht,
therefore,
um,

89
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.830
do you need to look it up?
Does it mean you don't have to work?

90
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.540
It just means at no point was your skin color a,
if anything it was a positive.

91
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.760
Uh,
that's not true.
I was one of the people that put going college.

92
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.800
I like when white people talk about affirmative action to when like nine black

93
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.010
kids get in and they say that's why they weren't able to join the other 30,000

94
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:15.680
white kids at the university.
Oh that's why that,
that's what it was.

95
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.140
That's what helps you back.
You know,

96
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.770
you couldn't get into the upper fucking 92% of white people who were in the

97
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.570
lower 8% and now I'm supposed to feel bad for you.
Yeah.

98
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.540
Snow flakes.
Snow Flake,

99
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.690
flake,
sorry.
Um,
anyways,

100
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:42.610
so I was doing the dishes and I wore a long sleeve shirt cause it gets a little

101
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.380
cool out here in the desert in the morning.

102
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.700
So I wear a long sleeve workout shirt so I didn't want to get any water.

103
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.100
My sleep's fucking grosses me out the same way.
When I put lotion on,

104
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.770
I take my wedding ring off cause I don't like when it gets underneath the ring

105
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:56.000
and fucking grosses me out.

106
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.440
So I take off my shirt and I'm standing there shirtless watch and,
um,

107
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.980
relaxed ladies,
um,
upstanding,

108
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:08.120
the shirtless washing dishes.
Um,

109
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.180
the way I wish my wife would.
Um,

110
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.060
and it was reminded me of every joke that I heard a bunch of comics do back in

111
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.430
the day when they were talking about cops go in.
Like,

112
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:23.930
is there a rule that when you get arrested you have to not be wearing his shirt

113
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.080
then never wearing a shirt?
And it was fucking true.

114
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:28.430
And it finally dawned on me today,

115
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.060
probably that was because a lot of them couldn't afford air conditioning.

116
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.030
You know,
and God knows,
you know,

117
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.640
they want to get a lot of seasons when they first did cops,
they're like,
well,

118
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:43.340
how many,
how can you get five seasons out of this?
It's like,
well,

119
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:47.630
we're mainly gonna shoot in Florida and down south and everybody knows it gets

120
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:51.620
hot down there harder than Junebug fucking a lampoon are going to cook in July

121
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:56.210
morning.
Um,
so that's my theory with the no shirt thing.

122
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.400
I also think it's a fuck,

123
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.750
it's something that's done by people that go in and out of jail.

124
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.250
That's just part of the culture is,
you know,
you don't wear a shirt the same way.

125
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.960
Like,
uh,
you know,
the people that go to like the fucking Ivy League schools,

126
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.530
you got to wear like the fucking that do shout fit,

127
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.010
whatever the fuck you call that.
The Khaki pants with the fucking loafers.
This,

128
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:21.740
that fucking thing that,
you know,

129
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.970
it's actually one of my favorite looks when the white person steers into being

130
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:29.600
white rather than being ashamed of it.
You know what I mean?

131
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:33.170
Or are trying to put on a blue collar jacket,
you know,
cause every,

132
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.790
once every two days you go out,

133
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.930
walk down to the fucking mailbox to get you fucking mail.
You know,

134
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.850
I like people that fucking steer into it.
You know,

135
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.150
what does that look called?
It's like I can't,
I,
I,
I have like a vague

136
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.710
that,
that thing on Instagram that don't be a bread.

137
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.550
I love the way those kids dress.
You know,

138
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.760
the parents had money and now they know they're getting it and they're not

139
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:05.090
ashamed of it.
They don't have one ounce of guilt and they're just like,
listen,

140
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.960
my daddy polluted all the rivers and when I take over,

141
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:13.790
I'm going after the oceans.
You know,

142
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.860
you got to respect it.
It's my goal in that,
uh,

143
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.010
there'll be no more polar bears by the time I'm done running my daddy's company.

144
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.480
I enjoy that.
I liked that.
Just a little bit of honesty.
That's all,
you know,

145
00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:30.830
just being who the fuck you are.
All right.
Um,
I watched the f one yesterday.

146
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:35.180
Did anybody see the first race of the year down in Australia,
Australia?
Uh,

147
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.220
Grand Prix,
the local favorite.
Daniel Ricardo,

148
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.400
was he from
Perth Resting Place of the great bind?
Scott.

149
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.933
<v 3>Okay.</v>

150
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.810
<v 1>And he's with the Renault team this year.
Who,
by the way,</v>

151
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:54.690
I love the look of their cars,
the yellow and the black.
That looks cool as hell.

152
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.040
Granted,
I'm a Bruins Fan,
so I dunno.
Maybe that's what it is,

153
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:02.500
but I think those cars are cool as shit.
And this poor bastard Danny Ricardo.

154
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.380
The fucking,
the race,
just start.

155
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.360
He barely goes on the grass in the front end of his car.
Fucking blows up

156
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.870
his front wing,

157
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.350
hit something and the whole front of the car we're going to get fucking
exploded.

158
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.670
So here's my question.
Why do they have bumpy grass like that?
Deb Is,

159
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.330
I hit a tree stump or something,
especially right there near the start.

160
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:24.430
Somebody always goes off the grass a little bit,

161
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.680
fucked up his car and then he was like a layer to go in and change the nose

162
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:31.970
after the front.
Uh,

163
00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:36.050
the first lap and then he's down a lap and then his car just shit the bed and

164
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:38.420
it's just like he left red bull for this.

165
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.893
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

166
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.540
<v 1>Anyways,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm basically,
I root for Daniel Ricardo</v>

167
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.850
for some reason I root for Ruf Ferrari knowing that they're just not going to

168
00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:55.870
get it done.
I root for the Haas team cause that's the American team.

169
00:10:55.871 --> 00:10:59.180
We did all right yesterday.
Do you think,
you know,

170
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:03.650
one out of two people finishing as good.
Um,
but you know,

171
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:08.540
we did come in,
uh,
what's his face?
Magnuson came in sixth place.

172
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.340
Eight big points.
Right.
And what's his face?
Who was the other driver?

173
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:18.290
We got there with the hell's his name.
Roman Grogan.
Yeah.
He didn't finish.

174
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.720
Um,
well where the fuck were the Ferrari's?
The Ferrari's?

175
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.290
We're in fourth and fifth Max for STAPP and who's basically,

176
00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:30.500
I think going to be the next Lewis Hamilton if he could get a better ride.

177
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.310
Cause for whatever fucking reason,
those red bull cars,
you know,
they,

178
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.520
if they have taken fuck with the Ferrari's,
but now with the Mercedes,

179
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:40.910
so one and two was Valtteri Botox and Lewis Hamilton.

180
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.470
I'm trying,
you know,
I,
I love greatness,
but I just,

181
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.960
I can't get into the fact how Lewis Hamilton thinks Valtteri botox should

182
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:53.770
basically be his gimp.
Right.

183
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.750
Both times had this amazing start.

184
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.810
Lord said the Poli fucking blows by him and the first turn and then he just

185
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:02.260
pulled away for the rest of the goddamn race Lewis who's having his issues.

186
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.320
And whenever that happens,
he always acts like a baby.

187
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.150
You started bitching that Valtteri was too far in front of him,

188
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:13.450
wasn't helping them out.
It's like,
when the fuck do you want to do that for him?

189
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.880
<v 3>Ah,
okay.</v>

190
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.030
<v 1>Just a fucking,
I,
I,
you know what,
he just,</v>

191
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.100
he reminds me of a couple of comedians and actors that I've worked with,

192
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:27.940
like with a whole fucking seen the whole show.
It's about them

193
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.533
<v 3>all right.</v>

194
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.050
<v 1>And if overall what happened was good,</v>

195
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:35.080
but are part of it wasn't as good as they like the,
they,

196
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:36.940
they have a little fucking hissy fit.

197
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:39.340
Maybe that's why he's fucking great because he is great.

198
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.940
And I would never say that he wasn't,
but Jesus,
he always had like,

199
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:44.380
I've seen like,
you know,

200
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.060
I've seen Vettel not winning last year and Kimmy Reagan and was going to win

201
00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.790
something or he was out in front of him.
I heard him fucking bitching about it.

202
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.730
He just rear ends people in front of them.

203
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.640
Uh,
just bug,
you know,
Mercedes is winning.
You're a team.

204
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.110
You took first and second you find,
I know,
I know.

205
00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:11.960
The whole deal is the way he's wired.
That's why he's so great.

206
00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:16.280
But it's just like,
it's such a fucking,
it's such a chick move.

207
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:17.700
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

208
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.390
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

209
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.030
Like if you have some shit you have to do that day is a guy,

210
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.870
you go out and do it.
If your wife's got a bunch of shit,
she just be like,

211
00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:26.400
I thought maybe you could come with me.

212
00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:29.520
We could maybe have like a lunch duty drag into it.

213
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.350
<v 3>MMM.</v>

214
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.630
<v 1>You wouldn't know it.
But I still love the guy.
You know,</v>

215
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.330
I can never hate on fucking greatness.
The guy is fucking great.

216
00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:41.370
But that part of him,
you know,

217
00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:46.110
I guess we all have that part of ourselves that maybe we could all work on.
Um,

218
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.520
anyways,
I'm very excited that it's,
it's,
it's back.
F one is back.
You know,

219
00:13:50.521 --> 00:13:54.960
it was cool.
They were like,
it's better.
Hundred and 12 days since the last race.

220
00:13:54.961 --> 00:13:58.680
And I was thinking like,
well,
I haven't drank in 113 days.
So freckles.

221
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.280
I took a day off right before the last race of last year.
Um,

222
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:08.290
I'm almost a third of the way in to breaking my record of 367 days since I

223
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:12.690
started drinking man.
And went the first 15 years of my life.
Never had a drop.

224
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.580
I don't see myself beating that streak anytime soon.
Um,

225
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.420
so I think I'm going to try to go until June of next year.

226
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:22.470
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

227
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.070
<v 1>So then I would do a calendar year,
January to December,</v>

228
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.960
and then I would also do an entire birthday,

229
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.340
like my entire time of being 51 I didn't have a drop.
I think that would be cool.

230
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.220
Then I would go on for like a fucking year and seven months.
Right.

231
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.980
And at that point I have all the alcohol out of my house.

232
00:14:39.981 --> 00:14:43.970
And then I think what I do is I,
uh,
I don't drink in La.
I don't drink at home.

233
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.800
And when I go on the road,

234
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.213
<v 3>mmm.</v>

235
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.470
<v 1>One day out of the,</v>

236
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.310
I go on the road two weekends a month and one day out of those things.

237
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:56.390
So I'd be drinking two times a month,
24 times a year.
Okay.

238
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.450
Whatever the fuck you gonna do,
I think that'd be all right.
You know,

239
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.280
I got to figure out what the fuck's gonna open for me.

240
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.710
All my open is a fucking the crushing it now Paul Versey check out the tour

241
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:11.600
dates.
Joe.
Nick,
you gotta check out puck off.
He's got,
uh,

242
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.260
the fuck did he just have on there,
Darren McCarty.

243
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.940
He's still in the pie.
The Fuck Nhl Awards.
Writing on that,

244
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.280
eh?
Just say that.
What the fuck am I going to have now?
You know,

245
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:28.880
fucking law heads down to San Diego,
crushing it on the sports radio.
See,

246
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:31.730
this is what happens when you don't bring cupcakes on the road.

247
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.310
They move up into the business.
So I'm just putting it out there.

248
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:39.170
Are you the funny guy at the office?

249
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.440
Do you think that you'd like to be a standup comedian?
Well,

250
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:46.190
why don't you submit your tape to build bird.com?

251
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.250
Maybe you could play some chuckle hut.

252
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.330
Do 15 minutes in front of a bunch of animals before you bring up the freckled

253
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.010
brick who's closing out the show.
Oh,
by the way,
how about those Bruin?

254
00:15:57.011 --> 00:16:01.610
So Conor Mcgregor has showed up,
right?
I missed the whole game.

255
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.400
That's why,
of course,
it was fucking exciting.
I missed the whole Goddamn game.

256
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.230
I came in right at the end of the streak.

257
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:10.430
I watched two games where they continued it and then they lost two in a row and

258
00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:14.570
then I missed the next game and they went in and over time,
Brad Marshawn

259
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.320
fucking and over time.
And then he does the Conor McGregor celebration.

260
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.140
I missed the whole goddamn thing.
But you know what I did see,
I did see,

261
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.610
uh,
that maple leaf's game.
Who the fuck were they playing?

262
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.910
Somebody who had like a big,

263
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:36.900
big time lead like a five to two lead and they came back and won it.
Oh,

264
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.750
they were in the Saint Patrick State Jerseys.

265
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:42.350
What has happened to my short term memory?
It's out the window.

266
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.560
Um,
I got to start playing brain games again.
Who the fuck were they playing?

267
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.580
Anyways?
I,
I,
uh,
Toronto was my day.

268
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.360
If the Bruins don't want it this year,
Toronto's my teeth.

269
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.160
That's who the fuck I root for it in the West.

270
00:16:58.161 --> 00:16:59.720
I always root for the Saint Louis Blues.

271
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:02.970
Those are the two teams that have gone the longest without winning the fucking

272
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.660
thing.
And A,
I don't want,
Oh,
how much longer do you want their,

273
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.320
their fans to suffer?
Which is why I think it's bullshit.

274
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.680
When that was an Antonio Brown,
whatever his fucking name is,

275
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:17.240
that wide receiver from,
from the Steelers has a fallen out with his team.

276
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.610
The bills make a deal.
They're like,
all right,
you're coming in.

277
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.560
And he's just like,
yeah,
no,
I'm not going there.
You guys suck.

278
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.100
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

279
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.990
<v 1>Then he goes to the fucking rate is,
it's just like,</v>

280
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:30.090
so what a bills fan supposed to do.

281
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.740
I've never understood that.
John Elway,
I'm not playing for the colts.
Well,

282
00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:38.680
they need not play in the NFL.
CFL.
You can't.

283
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.110
Alright,
Colby.
Bryan,
I'm not playing for the Charlotte Hornets swelling,

284
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.200
joy Europe.
It's not how it works.

285
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.490
I want to go where I'm good with kids do when immediately,

286
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.650
um,
bunch of fucking babies.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

287
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.700
I guess I understand maybe the quarterback position just because if he don't

288
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:09.020
have an offensive line that you just got to get right,

289
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.520
but you're playing fucking basketball,
Jesus Christ,

290
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:16.320
you can't even touch anybody anymore.
Right.
And I can say this,

291
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.700
having not played organized sports for 40 years,
I know what it takes.

292
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.960
Uh,
you know what mean it's,
this is just me bitch.
And as a fan,

293
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.130
I was excited to see the bills get a,
an offensive weapon there,

294
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:36.170
you know?
Do you want to see a bunch of grown men cry?
You wait to the day,

295
00:18:36.171 --> 00:18:39.760
the fucking bills when,
when the goddamn Superbowl.

296
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.800
All right.
And when the red sox finally won it,
everybody was fucking freaky.

297
00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:50.400
You wait to when the bills went,
let's,
people are going to run outside crying.

298
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.210
The tears are going to freeze on their face because they live in buffalo and

299
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.040
they just going to hug their neighbor,
right?

300
00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.220
And then they're going to fall down and land on that little heating thing that

301
00:19:00.221 --> 00:19:02.920
heats up there fucking engine in the morning and it's going to unplug.

302
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.930
And the next morning,
I remember my rabbi,
rabbi,
rabbi [inaudible] rap.

303
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.130
It's not going to fucking start and they're not going to give a shit.

304
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.260
They're going to get mad for half a second.
Then they go,
wait a minute,

305
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.640
wait a minute.
They fucking,
they won the Superbowl.
Now I,
I don't,

306
00:19:15.641 --> 00:19:18.440
I don't give a shit anymore.
Um,

307
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.060
anyway,
uh,
plowing ahead here.

308
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.200
What else am I going to do today?
I'm going to go get it.
I'm getting three Mris.

309
00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:30.080
I'm finally going to finally see what's going on with my shoulders and then my

310
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:34.340
left knee.
That's what I'm doing today.
And we'll fix my,
uh,

311
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.520
both my shoulders and my knee and then,
uh,

312
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.410
I'll probably have some sort of cancer from all that radiation.
See,

313
00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.750
that's how it works.
Everybody,
you know,

314
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.180
it's one of the reasons why I love breaking bad is every time they've made a

315
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:48.350
step forward,
they,
there was always a price to pay.
And at best they were even,

316
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:52.190
but they never really were.
They always sank down a little bit lower.
You know,

317
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.820
it doesn't make any fucking sense.
I'll tell you everybody,
this world,

318
00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:03.720
this world doesn't make any fucking sense to me.
Yeah.
This whole fucking,

319
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:05.880
<v 3>yeah.</v>

320
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.650
<v 1>Food thing in boosting.
Here's something.
I finally had an epiphany</v>

321
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:17.430
about being in an adult and addiction and being fat and fucking,

322
00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:22.190
all of this shit that you try to avoid is,
um,

323
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.570
no one ever really tells you
like the,

324
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:32.100
the level of responsibility of when you go out on your own just for yourself

325
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.800
to not fuck the whole thing up.
I was sitting there,
right?

326
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.510
I'm on the Instagram and one of the people I follow,
he's in his twenties,

327
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.770
right?
Eddie's Fellman like the night out.
All right.

328
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.060
His drummer.
Okay.
And everybody's drinking,
everybody's dancing.
Hey,

329
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.720
just keeps going and going and going and going and going until like fucking four

330
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:58.870
in the morning.
And um,

331
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.070
I understand that you do that when you're at that age,

332
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.770
but there was a part of me thinking like,
what if I didn't do that?

333
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.180
Not like I danced in the street,
but you know what I mean.
I,

334
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.630
I puked in the street til like four in the fucking morning.

335
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:12.880
What if I didn't do that?
Like,

336
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:16.540
how many more miles on this engine,
what I have,

337
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.450
you know,
cause like right now,
I'll tell you my drug is eight hours sleep,
honey.

338
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.470
MMM.
I don't know,
just as far as like,

339
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.600
I was really sitting there like,

340
00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:33.600
trying to think how I'm going to explain that to my daughter one day.
It's like,

341
00:21:33.601 --> 00:21:34.020
all right,

342
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.650
you going off to college now you're gonna have this ridiculous level of freedom.

343
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.460
I remember the first time when I finally fucking moved out.

344
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.800
I remember I was in New York City.
It was my first night hanging out.

345
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:52.030
I was hanging out at the comic strip
and

346
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:58.550
it hit me.
It's like I don't have to fucking go home until I want to go home.

347
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.520
I don't have to answer to fucking anybody.

348
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.210
This big grin just broke out on my face like,
Jesus Christ,

349
00:22:06.211 --> 00:22:10.050
this is fucking amazing.
Because of course I was down there like Jesus Christ,

350
00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:12.840
they moved like two states away.
I don't fucking know anybody.

351
00:22:12.841 --> 00:22:15.390
I'm in a railroad apartment,
you know,

352
00:22:15.391 --> 00:22:17.850
I just talked to Lucian rest his soul and he's like,
yeah,

353
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.480
<v 5>guardian of an old white guys.
I have no need.
Rio,</v>

354
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.840
good luck with your dream.
Um,

355
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.740
<v 1>I remember just sitting there at that bar and then,</v>

356
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:34.030
but then the epiphany was that Jesus Christ,
I could fucking do whatever I want.

357
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:37.000
I can fucking meet a chick,
take a home.
It's just fucking unbelievable.

358
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.600
And fortunately during that time,

359
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.260
everybody that I was hanging out with was either they didn't drink or they were

360
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:50.380
already in Aa.
And I've always just been,
you know,

361
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.050
I just did what people around,
nobody around me,
he's drinking.

362
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:55.720
They want to go on and go to a diner instead.
I would just fucking do that.

363
00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:57.910
So I didn't drink a lot in my twenties,

364
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.170
but somewhere in my thirties and kind of went off the fucking rails and a,

365
00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:06.310
I wish I could go back at tiff.
I can tell you guys anything yet.

366
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.960
Don't bring the booze into the house.
Have,
it's like literally,

367
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:14.050
why would you bake cookies and cake and potato chip into your house?

368
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.080
You're going to become a fat fuck.
You bring bows in the house.

369
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.650
She got to become a drunk.
I'm not saying an alkie,

370
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.690
but it'll just be something that you just fucking do it.

371
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.510
If you like smoking a cigar,
don't buy humor door,

372
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.470
keep it at,
don't bring the devil in the house,

373
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.440
keep them down the fucking street.

374
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.340
You get any of that deal is because you'll sit there for 10 minutes being like,

375
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.210
ah fuck man,
I'd love a goddamned cigar or I'd love to go get a drink in there.

376
00:23:43.211 --> 00:23:46.130
But then you sit in there and I got fucking get dressed,

377
00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:49.370
I got to get in the car to you know,
fuck this.
I'll just,
you know,

378
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.120
I'll just sit here and hang out.
But the,
the one thing I have,

379
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.010
this really fascinates me is now that I don't,

380
00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.713
um,

381
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.460
I'm really not doing anything is uh,

382
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.970
getting used to just being sober

383
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.170
and I don't just mean,
you know,
booze.

384
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.070
I mean then also combining that with trying to eat right

385
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.020
cause it's like at the end of the night,
like I'm just used to being ramped up,

386
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.120
having a couple of pops and then when you quit boozing then that becomes like

387
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:30.110
food.
Like,
eat something sugary or eat something salty and you know,

388
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.560
Leno just fucking get the rpms going in your body.

389
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:35.990
And then when the reality is your body doesn't want to do that,

390
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:39.080
it just wants to be fucking idling,
chilling out,

391
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.050
saving it's stuff for when you've got to run from an earthquake,

392
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.990
a fire or some guy with an ax essentially.

393
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.340
And uh,
I dunno,

394
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.760
I feel like I need to take,
uh,
you know,

395
00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:56.240
that shit that you put in your gas tank to clean out your engine,

396
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.700
but then you get nervous.
Am I going to move the clots around?

397
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.100
Feel like I got to fucking do that,
man.
Um,

398
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.810
so now my big thing is like,
I've,

399
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.780
I've been cooking at home and last night I asked for the first time in forever.

400
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.730
I made like a full meal,
like two sides in a,

401
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.090
in an eye.
It'll look a little stinks.
I made this little steak,

402
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.380
I had some steamed Broccoli and then,
uh,

403
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.550
I had the potatoes,
right?
Garlic was a little bit of Rosemary,

404
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.010
a little bit of salt and pepper and some butter.
Oh my God,

405
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:35.840
they were fucking delicious.
That was basically,

406
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:39.770
that was the highlight of my night was those mashed potatoes.
Um,

407
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.590
but uh,
I'm going to fucking,

408
00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.660
I'm trying to revamp my whole lifestyle here.

409
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.490
Um,
so when I returned to drinking,
which I will at some point,

410
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.910
I just want to make sure that I do it in a,

411
00:25:54.911 --> 00:25:59.911
a part like the way I drink soda or pop a few people in the Midwest like

412
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.450
occasion.
Like if I have like a bomb out,
it's usually back east.

413
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:07.400
If I'm having a pizza,
then I would always get a coke.

414
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:09.740
And even then I can never really felt,
I could never really finish it.

415
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:14.570
If I'm just having a bad meal,
I'll have like a coke or something like that.

416
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:16.070
If I could just do that with booze.

417
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:20.030
It was fucking people that could just have a glass of wine.
Oh,

418
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.440
that was delicious.
That complemented my meal.
Right.

419
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.070
They don't sit there like a pirate and fucking bite the cork office.

420
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.853
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

421
00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.740
<v 1>Um,
anyway,
I did a,
uh,
I did a Gig at the American legion.</v>

422
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.800
I got to open for Ron White.
I worked with Joe to,

423
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.480
and um,
this other guy,
Alex,

424
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:53.190
I didn't get his last name.
He's fucking hilarious.
And a and John's sites.

425
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:56.990
We had a fucking great time and uh,

426
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.191
afterwards,
you know,

427
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:02.060
we smoke some cigars and stuff and there was a couple of buddies of mine,

428
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.770
they showed up in,
one of them showed up.
He bought a fucking,

429
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:06.420
one of those new Indian motorcycles,

430
00:27:06.421 --> 00:27:09.930
the one that looks like the Harley road king.
Ah,
fuck dude.

431
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.060
I would love one of those two tone.
He had black with the green man.

432
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:19.350
That thing was fucking sick.
And uh,

433
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.360
and all those guys in those big bites,
they always go,

434
00:27:21.361 --> 00:27:23.650
it's like riding a Cadillac.
You know,
it's getting,

435
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.600
it's got the three lights people can see.
Ah,
um,

436
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:33.450
ah man,
that's,
that's one of those fucking that owner remain the dad fantasy.

437
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:35.640
It's like if I didn't have a kid,
if I didn't,

438
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:38.730
if I wasn't living for somebody else,
Thou my God,

439
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:42.810
I would fucking get one of those.
I would take it out Sunday mornings.
Right.

440
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.850
It's drive down the fucking street.
I freckled arms out,
you know,

441
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.990
feeling like I'm in a motorcycle gang when I really never killed anybody.

442
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.520
Pay My taxes quarterly.
I blocked that part out.
Right.

443
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.110
Drive down the street.
Um,
I would fucking love one of those.

444
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.050
I love those boots as a bikes.
I love,
I love those big ones with the,
uh,

445
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:05.910
the white wall tires and shit like that.

446
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.820
Like I love a Harley rode king without the bags on it.

447
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.110
I just think that that is just one of the fucking coolest looking bikes ever.
Um,

448
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.700
who knows?
My daughter graduates high school,
goes off to college.

449
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:20.490
Maybe I'll do it then I'll be like my late sixties.

450
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.840
Yeah,
I'll get one of those.

451
00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:28.110
That's right around the time when you get that three wheeler fucking motorcycle,

452
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.850
you know,
um,

453
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.820
which I would think in a lot of ways could be a little bit more dangerous.

454
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.860
All of a sudden you kind of had to like,
I dunno,
like how does that work?

455
00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:40.260
If somebody cuts out in front of you and you've got to lay it down,

456
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:42.000
you can't lay it down.
What do you do?

457
00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.520
Um,
are you just fucking t bone the guy and go flying over the fucking,

458
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:51.771
I don't know.

459
00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:55.730
There's gotta be some sort of Robo cop type thing that they can put on.

460
00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.680
Can you buy one of those moto GP suits with like the fucking air bag in it and

461
00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:05.300
shit.
They don't have an air bag for your head.
That's the problem.
Wait a second.

462
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.440
Moto g p riding suit for sale.

463
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.070
The single be like five grand.
If they do

464
00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.670
well there's one for $478.
So you know that's not it.

465
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.000
I should've put air bag in there

466
00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.800
with airbag and then you going to like that would,
the thing is like,

467
00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:31.150
that's like hooked onto the bike.

468
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.173
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

469
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.470
<v 1>Come on.
You fucking cunts.</v>

470
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.770
Shop race shop race suits with airbags.
All right.

471
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.460
Amazon
is one for 1000 bucks.
There's one for fourth,

472
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.110
1500 bucks.
All right.
This sounds about right.

473
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.160
You know the Moto GP,
once we actually got one of those,

474
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.320
it's like fucking three grand.
But it's a thing.

475
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:58.090
You can have one of those and it's not going to help you.

476
00:29:58.091 --> 00:30:02.860
If someone in an SUV runs you over.
And another life,

477
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.250
I would have had kids younger and then I would have lived in the middle of

478
00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:10.870
nowhere and I would've had one.
Oh,
well.
Um,
speaking of motorcycles,

479
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:16.240
motorcycle,
uh,
Japanese and Italian motorcycles,

480
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:18.820
I don't have any advertising this week.
All right.

481
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:21.490
Japanese and Italian motorcycles.
Hey,
bill,

482
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.970
on your mom match 14th podcasts.

483
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:29.350
You wondered why Japanese and Italian companies make better motorcycles.

484
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:32.230
That's not what,
all right.

485
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.350
Had a little glitch there and ran out of batteries,
ran out of batteries.

486
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.640
Um,
getting back to what I was saying,

487
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:44.170
I didn't say that you guys make better motorcycles.

488
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.840
You just make the fast ones.
Like,

489
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:50.410
why don't mean when I was in Honda Indian or somebody like that and make a fast

490
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:52.030
one?
Um,

491
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.550
one explanation I've heard they're probably better,
but as an American,

492
00:30:57.551 --> 00:30:58.510
I can't fucking say that.

493
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.010
One explanation I heard is that after World War II engineers and designers for

494
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:06.340
the access military industry industrial complex,

495
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.800
we're forced to find civilian and nonmilitary work.
Some of the brightest,

496
00:31:11.801 --> 00:31:15.130
smartest engineers in those countries ended up in automotive,

497
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.840
motorcycles and electronics,
Honda,
Yamaha,
Sony,
Ferrari,

498
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.840
Lamborghini,
Ducati,
or too catty,

499
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.440
as they say in England in particular,

500
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.300
or at least the announcer does in particular,

501
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.830
aeronautical engineers who had designed a fighter planes,

502
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:37.060
found success applying their knowledge to motorcycle chassies designed because

503
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:41.140
many of the forces acting on a plane's fuselage is similar to the forces on a

504
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:45.550
motorcycle leaned over,
going through a turn.
That's fascinating.

505
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.650
Also because of rationing in the years following World War II engineers and

506
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.840
former access countries had to figure out how to design and manufacturer with

507
00:31:52.841 --> 00:31:55.630
less raw material like steel or aluminum.

508
00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:00.870
You can see how efficient the engineered German Italian and Japanese engines are

509
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:04.720
compared to a chunky Harley Davidson motorcycle.
Uh,

510
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.030
just post ride Chet,
I've heard over the years,

511
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:08.620
but I thought you might find it interesting.

512
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:13.570
Thanks for making me laugh and making your podcast.
That is really interesting.

513
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:15.310
Something else.
Um,

514
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.840
is that just the sheer amount of space that we have over here,

515
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.400
you know,

516
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.550
that if we're not driving down these little streets that used to ride a fucking

517
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:31.270
horse and buggy around in that everything needs to be really,
the cars,

518
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.170
motorcycles gotta be quick and nimble and all of that.
You could just fucking,

519
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.170
you know,
if you look at our cars,
it's the same thing.

520
00:32:38.171 --> 00:32:42.110
It's all about zero 60 in a straight line because for the most part there's not

521
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:45.800
a lot of turns and shit,
you know,
that we're going to be taking.

522
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:49.490
So I think part of it is also that,
but I really find that interesting that,
um,

523
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.850
just through,
you know,
a loss comes a win like that,
that's usually what happens.

524
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.810
That reminds me,
I was watching,
um,
uh,

525
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:04.811
that Joe Rogan podcast with Mike Tyson and he was alluding to the fact and a lot

526
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:08.750
of boxes have that.
Like,
you know,

527
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.680
boxing is basically that.

528
00:33:11.681 --> 00:33:15.730
There's never been like a rich kid that I can think of that just,
you know,

529
00:33:15.731 --> 00:33:18.880
came from a great background.
Everything just goes in and does that.

530
00:33:18.881 --> 00:33:23.881
Like it's for somebody that just came from nothing and you can literally,

531
00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.620
literally fighting your way out of it.
Um,

532
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.160
that would be fucking hilarious though if one of those don't be a Brad kids

533
00:33:30.161 --> 00:33:31.180
actually came,
you know,

534
00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.920
you know one of those kids that accidentally kills his girlfriend while having

535
00:33:35.921 --> 00:33:36.551
rough sex.

536
00:33:36.551 --> 00:33:41.290
Remember those fucking billionaire boy club fucking lunatics from the 80s.
Uh,

537
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.980
if one of him,

538
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.570
he came in and if he just steered into it like a great wrestling heel,

539
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.610
like when he did his interviews,

540
00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:51.490
he had his boat shoes with no socks on and khaki pants

541
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:58.170
and he's just in his old thing is even though we came up with all that money and

542
00:33:58.271 --> 00:34:03.010
shit,
he's just like a complete fucking sociopath.
Uh,

543
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.810
and then goes in and like,

544
00:34:04.811 --> 00:34:08.230
his nickname should just be staring into all of that shit.

545
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:14.410
Like what the fuck would it be?
It'd be like,
uh,
Brad,

546
00:34:14.411 --> 00:34:17.020
the trust fund kid,
you know,
fucking

547
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:22.600
van something or other as always the fucking rich white people names.
Right.

548
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.100
I missed that.
I missed the Robert Barron being famous,
you know?
Right.

549
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.420
I missed it the first time,
but like
JP Morgan,
ah,

550
00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.730
Andrew Carnegie I have and nobody else,

551
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.660
then it just all became a corporation.
I think that that's why they did it.

552
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:44.020
They became a corporation.
So then they,
their names wouldn't be out there.

553
00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.400
So now it's like,
can you believe what Alberta that raw diggy believe.

554
00:34:48.401 --> 00:34:53.080
What would a Monsanto,
you don't have one fucking name,

555
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.710
you know,
just as far as barroom chatter goes.
Sure.

556
00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.290
If he actually took the time to care enough to research agenda,

557
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.600
you'd know a name.
All right.

558
00:35:01.601 --> 00:35:05.500
I think I was kind of shitting on myself by the end there.
Um,
all right,

559
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.270
what else do we got here?
Marginal tax rate.
Hey Bill,

560
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.410
I'm listening to a recent podcast where you talk about [inaudible] plan to tax

561
00:35:14.411 --> 00:35:16.690
people at a higher rate.
Uh,

562
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.490
the marginal tax rate kicks in after someone earns their first $10 million.

563
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.900
After that,
the income is taxed at 70%.
Do Fuck that.

564
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:30.670
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

565
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:37.030
That doesn't touch people who create startups yet does,
when they turn around,

566
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.010
sell it for fucking

567
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.170
<v 7>tens of millions of dollars.
Of course it does.</v>

568
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:41.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

569
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.610
<v 7>Most comedians don't make anything close to that.</v>

570
00:35:43.611 --> 00:35:47.210
You don't even know what comedians make.
That's not fucking true.

571
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.420
Comedians are crushing it right now.
And secondly,

572
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.320
what I fucking hate about all of this shit is everybody's going to ignore the

573
00:35:54.321 --> 00:35:55.730
reason why we're broke.

574
00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.510
We're broke because we're fighting this never ending fucking war that is lining

575
00:35:59.511 --> 00:36:03.260
the pockets of about fucking a half a dozen to a dozen corporations and it's

576
00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:05.570
completely bankrupted this fucking country.

577
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.520
So rather than take those people to task,
who pay all the fucking politicians,

578
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.940
now you're going to go after regular fucking citizens and we're going to have to

579
00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:16.220
pay the tab.
Go Fuck Yourself,
dude.

580
00:36:16.221 --> 00:36:20.480
70% tax on anything is fucking criminal.

581
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.123
Criminal

582
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.960
to take more than half somebody is doing that work.

583
00:36:26.961 --> 00:36:29.630
You don't get more than half of that go fuck itself.

584
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.980
Those politicians need to grow a fucking Dick and some fucking balls and stand

585
00:36:33.981 --> 00:36:37.700
up to those corporations that they're fucking blowing.
That's the solution.

586
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.740
Fucking God damn fucking people who sit there and they demonize anybody.

587
00:36:45.711 --> 00:36:49.190
Any individual that went out and went after a dream and made it,

588
00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:52.340
and then they have to turn around and subsidize your fucking life.

589
00:36:52.341 --> 00:36:55.460
Go Fuck Yourself.
You really want to take down the rich.

590
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.790
Go after these fucking corporations that have all their money in offshore

591
00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:03.020
fucking accounts.
Kick them out of the fucking country and stop buying this shit.

592
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:08.050
Don't fucking punish some person because they started dollar shave club and

593
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.310
they're fucking dormitory.
Now all of a sudden they got to give 70% of it away.

594
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.350
You know what you sound like?

595
00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:18.320
You sound like somebody who's never going to make $10 million in their life.

596
00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:19.930
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

597
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.320
<v 7>Oh my God.
That drives me up the fucking wall,
and that's the genius.</v>

598
00:37:23.321 --> 00:37:26.710
Once again of corporations.
It's,
there's no name,
there's no face to it,

599
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.890
but she can do it with individuals,
so now they're going to get punished.
Anyways,

600
00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.380
let me finish this.
After the income,

601
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.460
it's taxed 70% that doesn't talk to people could create startups.

602
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.950
That's just a statement that you pulled out of your ass.

603
00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.540
Most comedians don't make anything close to that that's pulled out of your ass.

604
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:48.500
That's pulled out of your Reps.
I've seen like the top fucking,
um,

605
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.630
earning comedians that Forbes fucking lists are all over 10 million.

606
00:37:53.631 --> 00:37:55.430
Some of them are making $20 million.

607
00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:01.110
They're supposed to give 70% of over 10 million away
anyways.

608
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.520
Uh,
the most skilled brain surgeons don't make that much.

609
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.150
The people making more than 10 million a year,

610
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:13.350
our close with extremely high concentrations of wealth.
No,
they're not.

611
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.470
This is this what this is what you're doing,
dude.

612
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:21.950
What you're doing is you're creating this cartoon character of a rich person.

613
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:28.250
The same way female comics created a cartoon character of a white male comedian

614
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:31.080
where he just goes down to the club and the club owner goes,

615
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:34.530
what are your dreams?
How many doors can I open for you?

616
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.080
Nobody wants to see that it's fucking work.
I can't even,

617
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:42.350
I can't even read the fucking rest of this.
That's like that person going,

618
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.910
someone who makes $10 million a year.

619
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.940
It doesn't work any harder than someone who makes $20,000 a year.
It's like,

620
00:38:46.941 --> 00:38:51.820
what the fuck are you talking about?
If you work for yourself,

621
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:55.810
I don't care what the fuck you make a year.
It never ends.
It's,

622
00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.340
it's seven days a week,
three 65 you're working your fucking ass off

623
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.040
anyways.

624
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.510
Collecting it at a rate that is unnecessary for unhuman any human on earth.

625
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.350
Being able to start from nothing is what makes America great.
Yeah,

626
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:13.510
you're gonna Yank all these people back down again.

627
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.500
Those people also will make that they create a bunch of fucking jobs.

628
00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.990
There's a way to run your country that your company,
right.

629
00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:24.880
Anyways,
listen,

630
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.990
is being able to start from nothing is what makes America great and if anything,

631
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.830
a higher tax rate enables more Americans to follow their dreams.

632
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.040
That is complete bullshit because what you're going to do is just yank your

633
00:39:38.441 --> 00:39:41.740
fellow fucking country men down to the ground.
None of this shit.

634
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.010
You're not going to get to go out to these fucking corporations there and all

635
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:47.800
these super rich people,
their money's already out of the country.

636
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.020
They got it running through fucking 20 different islands and that's 20 different

637
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:56.770
fucking mountains are red tape that the IRS is not going to take their time to

638
00:39:56.771 --> 00:39:59.830
go through and that's why they're going to go after just regular fucking people

639
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.350
because we're standing here with their fucking pants down,

640
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.530
allowing people to hoard massive amounts of wealth only shrinks the middleclass

641
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:13.710
creating larger conglomerates and pushes us further towards a horrible dystopia

642
00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:16.660
where everything is commercialized.
Well,
first of all,
dude,

643
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.650
you're about 40 fucking years too late at that party,
all right?
It all,

644
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.290
you're all,
you're all these fucking tax things are going to do.

645
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.540
They're not going to fuck with any corporation.

646
00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.700
They fucking brush the IRS off their shoulder like it's a fucking net.

647
00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.000
All you're going to do is you're going to go after new money.

648
00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.180
Somebody went out and started something.

649
00:40:38.181 --> 00:40:42.980
Who the fuck are you to say how much money anybody can fucking make because you

650
00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:46.280
don't have an idea that will enable you to make $10 million.

651
00:40:46.281 --> 00:40:49.790
Somebody has to fucking subsidize your life and you're going to ignore the

652
00:40:49.791 --> 00:40:52.640
fucking elephant in the room and you just going to go after the fucking

653
00:40:52.641 --> 00:40:56.210
individual.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Go Fuck Yourself.

654
00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.830
I didn't want to fucking hear this.

655
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.640
This is this fucking bullshit that that fucking chick is talking about there,

656
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.940
that everybody's all high and mighty on.
She's talking about individuals.

657
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.070
She's not going to go out after the co corporations

658
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.760
that she's going to go out and give speeches to after she's done with her

659
00:41:14.761 --> 00:41:18.030
political career to the two and a 300 fucking grand a night,

660
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.050
just like the fucking Obama's,

661
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.780
but everybody's going to sit there and act like it's only the bushes in the

662
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:27.850
trumps.
The fucking fucking,

663
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:32.290
Obama's just like the Clintons are lining their pockets with that same fucking

664
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:35.240
corporate money that is never going to be fucked with and they just,

665
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:38.330
they're going to go,
I have to stand up comics people that start apps,

666
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.830
people who start dollar shave club,
that who the,

667
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.010
who the fuck is going to get yanked down.

668
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.400
And you sat there and whenever we've all set back,
support the troops,

669
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:52.130
support the troops,
see he can't fucking speak out against the war.

670
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.770
And you literally watched them bankrupt this fucking country.

671
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.500
And every year in August,
we're like,
we don't have any more money.

672
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.100
We don't have any money.
What's the solution?
Do we go after the fucking banks?

673
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.990
Do we go after the corporations?
No,

674
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.410
we just raised the level of debt that this country is going to accept and now

675
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:11.030
we're going to turn around and we're going to make sure that no individual who

676
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:14.930
doesn't fucking pour water in the fucking,
uh,

677
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.390
rivers and put water poor fucking,

678
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.940
that there are chemicals in the Goddamn rivers and all that.
Shit's just,

679
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.470
just let all of those fucking people,

680
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.600
all of those cons who fucking polluted your fucking God damn food supply to the

681
00:42:26.601 --> 00:42:29.780
point you got girls getting their fucking periods at nine years old and a kid

682
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:34.310
can grow a fucking full beard by the time he's 10 ignore all of that shit.

683
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.510
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

684
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:39.090
<v 7>and just sit there and be like,
I don't think you need to make 10 million.</v>

685
00:42:39.091 --> 00:42:41.610
Let's go fuck yourself.
You know what buddy?

686
00:42:41.611 --> 00:42:45.000
I hope you make $10 million and I hope you get to keep more than God damn

687
00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:47.580
fucking 30% of it because you earned it.

688
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:53.130
You should have to pay cause you fucking cause a what could you earn too much

689
00:42:53.131 --> 00:42:57.930
fucking money.
Listen,
I've got to tell you something right now.

690
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.690
If these corporations were paying their fair fucking share,

691
00:43:00.691 --> 00:43:02.310
I wouldn't have a problem with this and you.

692
00:43:02.311 --> 00:43:04.920
If you wanted to cap it at $10 million,
fine,

693
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.990
but that's not what the fuck you going to do.
All right,
I've got heated there.

694
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:11.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

695
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:16.450
<v 7>Fucking God damn stupid ass fucking morons out there with you.</v>

696
00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.830
Yeah.
Why don't you read up on what the fuck it takes?

697
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.410
Why don't you read up on what it takes to fucking go from not having anything to

698
00:43:25.411 --> 00:43:26.430
fucking get in there?

699
00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:30.150
Why don't you actually figure out how hard you have to fucking work to even get

700
00:43:30.151 --> 00:43:32.970
anywhere close to half of that fucking money.

701
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:36.210
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

702
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.700
<v 7>How fucking strong you have to be mentally.</v>

703
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.240
How much bullshit you have to get put through as you fucking watching other

704
00:43:42.241 --> 00:43:45.810
people around you that you started out with,
watching them slowly go crazy,

705
00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.350
watching them kill themselves and all of this other fucking shit,

706
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:55.380
and then turn a complete blind eye to fucking banks and corporations and all of

707
00:43:55.381 --> 00:43:59.840
these fucking assholes.
Let,
yeah,
let's go off to people making months.
Yeah.
Yeah.

708
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.820
Fucking nationwide drug epidemic.

709
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.570
Let's just completely ignore all the fucking pharmaceutical companies.

710
00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:07.880
That's fine.
That's fine.
Let's just go after Joe blow.

711
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.190
Who fucking worked his fucking balls off?

712
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:12.403
<v 3>You know</v>

713
00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.240
<v 7>who the fuck are you to say what the fuck?</v>

714
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.840
Just a certain segment of people are going to fucking make and you're going to

715
00:44:18.841 --> 00:44:22.380
ignore all those goddamn corporations and don't even fucking tell me that.
Oh,

716
00:44:22.381 --> 00:44:25.860
go after them to how they run the fuck they run.

717
00:44:25.861 --> 00:44:27.300
All of these fucking politicians,

718
00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.760
every one of them's on their fucking knees blown them.

719
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:33.570
And occasionally when you got a like Bernie Sanders who actually wants to stand

720
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.160
up to those costs,
what do they do?

721
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.130
They fucking box him out and give them no coverage whatsoever.

722
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:40.780
And then one of the way do they go with the fucking made man,

723
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.690
the Hillary Clinton,
right?

724
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.780
And then she loses to this orange headed can and now we're dealing with this

725
00:44:45.781 --> 00:44:46.614
shit.

726
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.233
<v 3>Okay.</v>

727
00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.290
<v 7>Jesus fucking Christ.
All right.</v>

728
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.970
Mother-In-Law was some messed up passive aggressive behavior.

729
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.240
All right,
I have to end this podcast soon cause I gotta go fucking,

730
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:04.403
<v 3>Oh my God.</v>

731
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:06.881
<v 7>Nobody who's making,</v>

732
00:45:06.881 --> 00:45:09.940
who's not making $10 million should fucking be telling somebody what they should

733
00:45:09.941 --> 00:45:11.830
be.
Fine.
Am I saying what the fuck you should be paying?

734
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:17.930
I want to hear what your fucking ideas that I'm going to bet that if I ever get

735
00:45:17.931 --> 00:45:20.090
over 10 million,
I'm going to be fucking subsidizing

736
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.060
what's,
you can sit on your fucking ass and not do anything.

737
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:31.950
And if a fucking nine to five job and it'll be over right at fucking five

738
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:34.890
o'clock on Friday and you could do whatever the fuck you want for the rest of

739
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:39.640
your fucking weekend.
Well,

740
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.620
poor people who fucking are running companies got to figure out through the

741
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.310
weekend how to keep that thing afloat so you still have your fucking job.

742
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.173
Then on top of that,

743
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.750
they're supposed to give 70% of their money over 10 million a year.

744
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.210
She can get another fucking beanbag chair.
Go Fuck Yourself.

745
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.760
Unbelievable.
We haven't,
we still haven't.

746
00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:02.430
We shown that just giving people fucking money doesn't do anything.

747
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.810
There really is that fantasy that,
you know,

748
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.250
if you give people fucking opportunity,
uh,

749
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:10.470
you know they're going to make something of themselves not true.

750
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.100
That's only half the recipe.
That's like,
if you get a bag of sugar,

751
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:17.070
you can make a pie.
No,
you can't.
You need fucking eggs,
Ede,

752
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:22.080
you all kinds of other fucking shit.
Somebody has to have the drive,

753
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:24.240
they have the vision and they gotta be strong enough.

754
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.170
Then when they keep getting a dick knock in the dirt to keep fucking getting up

755
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.880
and stay in positive and not letting his fucking business eat you up.

756
00:46:33.881 --> 00:46:35.830
I had a fucking texted my buddy of mine last night.

757
00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.150
I couldn't believe I haven't talked to him.

758
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.750
Well how fucking negative you got and I'm trying to find a nice way to say,
dude,

759
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.160
don't let this business get to you.

760
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:45.700
Don't let them put the fucking pilot laid out.
Cause when they do,

761
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.130
you're fucking done.
All right.

762
00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:52.540
I never had to have that fucking talk when I was unloading trucks working in a

763
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:57.150
warehouse.
I don't know.

764
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:57.660
Listen,

765
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:02.310
I am all for fucking pay in taxes and all of that shit.

766
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.540
If they would actually spend it on fucking the public schools,
if they would,

767
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:07.623
if they would actually

768
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:13.680
spending on trying to give people tax breaks to fucking keep industry in this

769
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:17.340
goddamn country and they haven't everybody who's thought about themselves and

770
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.110
they'd sent the thing out the fucking window.

771
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.870
So now what's going to happen is you're going to start going after the

772
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:26.520
individual and somehow demonize somebody that actually went after dreaming is

773
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:28.890
corrupted.
His function country is actually got,

774
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.980
you're not going to fucking yank his fucking pants down the fuck outta here.

775
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.380
Fucking bullshit.

776
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.420
I think for you to make a statement like that,
at some point in your life,

777
00:47:41.421 --> 00:47:44.570
you should.
You should actually have made over $10 million a fucking year.

778
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.520
So maybe you'd have a little bit of empathy.

779
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.510
You could actually speak with some sort of fucking knowledge instead of sitting

780
00:47:51.511 --> 00:47:54.630
there playing the goddamn victim.
All right?

781
00:47:54.631 --> 00:47:57.660
If you want to start a fucking revolution and go off to banks and corporations,

782
00:47:57.661 --> 00:48:00.570
I'm fucking all Ford.
If you want to start yanking other fucking you,

783
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.480
your own fellow country men who've done nothing wrong down by their fucking

784
00:48:03.481 --> 00:48:06.060
ankles because they had the balls to go after something

785
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.360
and fucking actually become successful,
and then you're,

786
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:13.420
you're going to decide how successful they need to be

787
00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.350
because these people are fucking honest enough to actually report their goddamn

788
00:48:22.351 --> 00:48:25.470
income.
They,
meanwhile,
you've got the fucking cartoons,

789
00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.340
the Goddamn Corporation after it's gone through 20 fucking Goddamn islands is

790
00:48:29.341 --> 00:48:33.650
now getting a loan from the last fucking island,
uh,

791
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.810
interest free tax free fucking loan.

792
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:39.660
His money comes back to him in the form of a fucking loan.

793
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:43.910
And then that Phantom fucking corporation forgives the loan and the guy's paying

794
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.420
0% taxes.

795
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.420
How about that buddy?
How bout that?
Yeah,

796
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.460
but let's ignore corporations that keep us in wars that believed this country,

797
00:48:55.461 --> 00:48:59.900
die dry,
and let's go after the dollar shave club guy.
There you go.
There you go.

798
00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:03.260
Let's go after the guys who started barstool sports,
yet they're the,

799
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:08.320
they're the fucking problem motivated fucking people who started from nothing

800
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:10.980
and,
and,
and hit the mother load.

801
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.073
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

802
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:20.000
<v 7>Jesus Christ.
That was fucking 10 minutes of my life.
I'll never get back.
Alright?</v>

803
00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:23.250
Mother-In-Law was some messed up,
passive aggressive behavior.
Dear Bill,

804
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.330
my boyfriend's mother is probably the most passive aggressive piece of shit you

805
00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:30.060
ever met in your life.
By the way,
I still have to talk about this.

806
00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:31.980
The fucking level of money that I'm making.

807
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:36.870
I'm lucky if I get to keep a third of it
in on paper.

808
00:49:36.871 --> 00:49:38.670
I'm not paying 70% tag.

809
00:49:38.671 --> 00:49:41.430
You wait until that fucking thing kicks in and if you think they're going to

810
00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:44.550
stop at 10 million and then it's going to be well at 5 million,

811
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.580
shouldn't they pay this at 1 million?
Shouldn't they pay this?

812
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.340
Any check that I get,
any fucking check that I get.
I just,
I just,

813
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:57.930
I take 70% already and throw it out the fucking window with commissions,

814
00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.570
expenses and then the taxes that I pay.

815
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:05.780
That's why people fucking go broke.

816
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:08.660
They go out and they get $1 million and they think they have $1 million.

817
00:50:08.661 --> 00:50:12.050
It's like you don't,
you have about 375 grand if you're lucky.

818
00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:16.070
That's what $1 million is before you're going to implement this bullshit.

819
00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.550
Kind of a fucking American fucking

820
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:31.830
<v 1>it is for pulling down another regular guy.
Who was you?
Yeah.</v>

821
00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:35.100
Why not get inspired by that person?
No.

822
00:50:35.101 --> 00:50:37.720
You should give him your money that you made back to me.

823
00:50:37.721 --> 00:50:42.630
You fucking go fuck yourself.
Oh my God.

824
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.030
What?
Doesn't everybody get to play it down?

825
00:50:47.031 --> 00:50:50.220
A Bennett fell football just because their NFL dream didn't make it right.

826
00:50:50.221 --> 00:50:52.890
Why don't you just let him do that?
Uh,
dear bill,

827
00:50:52.891 --> 00:50:56.250
my boyfriend's mother is probably the most passive aggressive piece of shit you

828
00:50:56.251 --> 00:50:57.180
ever met in your life.

829
00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:01.830
She still relatively young in her early fifties and acts like a college kid

830
00:51:01.831 --> 00:51:03.330
around her friends.
Oh boy.

831
00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:08.450
It's probably more annoying than the last 12 minutes of this podcast.
Uh,

832
00:51:08.451 --> 00:51:12.290
you just know that she was a sorority bullied when she was younger and now she

833
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:17.240
treats her family very passive aggressively.
Oh Wow.

834
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:20.390
For example,
when she came over for dinner to our house recently,

835
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:25.820
we asked if she could remove her shoes as we don't appreciate the filth from the

836
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:28.220
street infecting our floors.

837
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.330
This slighted her from the get go and then she went to the bathroom and

838
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:34.970
deliberately left skid marks on the toilet

839
00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:41.080
and came out on that announcing to the room that we should clean it regularly to

840
00:51:41.081 --> 00:51:42.610
prevent that from happening.

841
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.080
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

842
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.240
<v 1>I know that sounds crazy,</v>

843
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:52.241
but this is the same person who also made a big deal about how somebody should

844
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:57.480
get tested for an STD because my,
oh,

845
00:51:57.790 --> 00:51:59.990
saying how I should get tested for an STD because

846
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.690
my last boyfriend had an uncircumcised penis.

847
00:52:04.691 --> 00:52:08.980
Please let me know what you would do to put her in her place once and for all.

848
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:12.933
<v 0>MMM.</v>

849
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.860
<v 1>Oh,
this is a tough one.
This is family,
a family,
the family bank.</v>

850
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.680
He's um,

851
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.410
mother-in-law with messed up passive aggressive behavior,

852
00:52:25.411 --> 00:52:29.390
but you're calling it your boyfriend.
Yeah.

853
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.060
You got to nip this in the bud before you even fuck or the bud,

854
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:35.330
whatever the fuck you say.
Nip in the bud before,
uh,

855
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:37.550
before this goes any fucking further.

856
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:40.943
<v 0>MMM.</v>

857
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:44.040
<v 1>You don't want to marry into that.
And if you do marry into it,</v>

858
00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.210
you got to set up boundaries.

859
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.093
<v 0>MMM.</v>

860
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.420
<v 1>Uh,
his deal.
I would just,
uh,
I would say something to your boyfriend</v>

861
00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:59.290
and what I would do,
uh,
that's probably not going to work.

862
00:52:59.291 --> 00:53:01.960
You know what I would do?
I would just say I don't appreciate that comment.

863
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.430
And if you have to have a fight with her and have a fight with her and just say,

864
00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:07.600
listen,
you're coming over my house and they,
these are my rules.

865
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:09.340
If you don't like it,
don't come over here.

866
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.070
And if she has a fucking problem with that and your boyfriend is a problem with

867
00:53:12.071 --> 00:53:16.750
that,
fuck the both of them.
Fuck the both of them.
All right.
Yeah.

868
00:53:16.751 --> 00:53:19.960
There's no reason for you to be walking around on egg shells where you live,

869
00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:21.430
fuck this fucking person.

870
00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:26.160
And you'll basically show your future mother in law who you and your boyfriend,

871
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.870
<v 7>who you are and you know,
whoever has a problem with it can go fuck themselves.</v>

872
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.740
You can come over and leave skid marks in my toilet and say somebody should

873
00:53:34.741 --> 00:53:35.560
clean that.

874
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.400
You should should've grabbed her by the back of her fucking neck and the seat of

875
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.620
her pants and thrown her out.
Bounce of style.

876
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:42.870
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

877
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.330
<v 7>Right out of your fucking house.
The fuck out of my house.</v>

878
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.660
Clean up my shit.
Get the fuck out of my house.

879
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:55.010
That's an easy one.
That's as easy as the $10 million a year.

880
00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.310
Um,
thing there.
Uh,
I,
I'm open to it too.

881
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:04.460
It's hilarious of sale.
I'm open to more debate on that Saturday.

882
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:09.470
I'll talk to somebody who will actually talk about the corporations and banks.

883
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:14.180
If you want to talk about that first and what you plan to do with them,

884
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.940
then I will listen to your fucking over $10 million.

885
00:54:16.941 --> 00:54:21.860
And I don't make anywhere near that.
But like I plan to,

886
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:24.110
I'm building a company,

887
00:54:24.111 --> 00:54:28.040
I plan on that and I don't plan on fucking working my ass off.

888
00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:32.030
So then I could just go give it to a bunch of corrupt cops who aren't going to

889
00:54:32.031 --> 00:54:35.300
give it to you.
They're not gonna give it to you.

890
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:38.150
They're going to give it in the form of contracts to Pete,

891
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:41.510
to people at big construction companies to build more luxury,

892
00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.860
high rise apartments.

893
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.760
They're going to give them the kickback fucking money and they're going to

894
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:51.160
charge way more money for the fucking materials.
All of that fucking shit.

895
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.070
Government fucking jobs,
building roads and all of that.

896
00:54:54.071 --> 00:54:56.740
That's where it's gonna go.
It's not going to go back to the kids.

897
00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.410
It's not going to go back to the schools and it's not going to go to you.

898
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.173
It isn't.

899
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.830
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

900
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.680
<v 7>it never does because they're all fucking corrupt.</v>

901
00:55:04.681 --> 00:55:09.160
So if you want to talk about how to somehow pay politicians more money so they

902
00:55:09.161 --> 00:55:13.250
don't,
so they have fuck you money.
So data,

903
00:55:13.251 --> 00:55:16.190
they don't have to fucking sit there and suck the dicks of these corporations

904
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:18.680
and these bags.
Then maybe we could try to fucking,

905
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:20.050
<v 3>yeah,</v>

906
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.910
<v 7>have as honest accompanies you see a countries you could possibly have,</v>

907
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:30.250
which is impossible because people shit on socialism.
They shit on communism.

908
00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.960
They shit on capitalism.
None of them work.

909
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.220
None of them work because human beings are inherently flood.
Alright,

910
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.130
so there you go.
That's my uninformed bullshit for the fucking day.

911
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.520
God bless all you.
I got some shit to do.
I know the podcast.

912
00:55:42.521 --> 00:55:43.301
It was a little bit short,

913
00:55:43.301 --> 00:55:46.330
but you're probably sick of me after I was on my tree stump there for fucking 12

914
00:55:46.331 --> 00:55:49.570
minutes.
All right.
God bless all of you.
I hope you dreams come true,

915
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.150
and I hope when you go out and you make the money that you earned,

916
00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:56.050
some cut doesn't come in and take 70% of it.
All right?
See you Thursday.
