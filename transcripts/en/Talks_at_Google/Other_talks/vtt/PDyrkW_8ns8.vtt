00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.212
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.460
SPEAKER: Today, I'm very
pleased to introduce

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.090
two professors, Avner
Ash and Rob Gross

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.160
from Boston College,
the math department.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.570
We'll be speaking about
"Summing It Up From 1 plus 1

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.220
To Modern Number Theory."

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.530
I think is a great title.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.810
And to me, speaks to what I find
fascinating about real math.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.990
The way that seemingly
simple properties

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.610
of integers, addition,
and so on yields

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.980
this wonderful rich complexity.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.291
And so, here to introduce
that, Avner and Rob.

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:47.540
AVNER ASH: Thank you, Richard.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.950
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.090
And thank you for
organizing this.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.250
I'm going to speak
for about 10 minutes

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.150
and try to explain
what is number theory.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.700
And then, Rob is going to give
a worked out example of number

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.296
theory.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:05.920
And then, I'm going
to talk for 10 more

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.128
minutes about other stuff.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.820
So what is number theory?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.530
And probably maybe a lot
of you know this already.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.370
But it's studying the
properties of whole numbers,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.290
1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.502
And it has a long history.

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:26.710
One of the nice things about
working in number theory

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.260
is you feel you're connected
to a long intellectual history

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.780
going back to at least the
ancient Greeks and probably

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.810
other ancient peoples.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.750
In Plato's dialogues, there are
a lot of-- very simple number

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.270
theory is often used as
an example of something

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.180
you can know for sure.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.710
And the example
Socrates always gives

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.405
is the fact that some numbers
are even and some are odd.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.530
Well, that's pretty simple.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.936
But that's the first
basic fact about numbers.

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:58.435
They divide up into
these two parts.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.910
And then, people started
playing around with numbers.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.240
You also get in the
ancient world, people who

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389
are interested in numerology.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.490
You know, like seven
is a sacred number.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.410
And 6 is equal to 1 plus 2
plus 3, which are its divisors.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.160
And the Pythagoreans
especially were

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.210
interested in number theory
from that point of view.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.050
But as a real theoretical
subject in mathematics,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.775
the only really important number
theorist in the ancient world

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.490
was Diophantus.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.320
Who lived quite a few
centuries after Plato.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.920
And he invented the
study of what we now

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.690
call Diophantine Equations.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.470
And I'll give you an example of
one of those in a few minutes.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.350
Another interesting thing about
the history of number theory

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.890
is that it went to sleep
after Diophantus pretty much.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.449
And for centuries--
this has something

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.740
to do with what I'll be
talking about in my second part

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.430
of my remarks.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.860
It went to sleep
and people didn't

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.020
seem to be very
interested in it anymore.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.510
And the person
who woke it up was

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.210
Fermat, who was a lawyer
in France in the 1600s.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.964
And he just got
interested in numbers.

00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:17.880
And a big difference
between what he was doing

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.650
and what the ancients
could do is that algebra

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.540
had been invented by that time.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.480
So Fermat could use
algebra to study numbers.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.987
And he got all kinds
of interesting ideas.

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:31.320
There were a lot of other
people at the time interested,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.850
like Descartes.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.860
And then, the subject picked up
and has been an important part

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.810
of mathematics ever since.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.240
When you get to
the 20th century,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.198
there are all kinds of
famous number theorists.

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:45.800
One of them was
Hardy, the guy who

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.470
discovered ramanujen-- whom you
may have seen a movie about.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.460
Hardy was famous for saying
that number theory had

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.360
no applications at all.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.970
And he was really glad
of that, because it

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.380
meant his hands would never
get dirty with warfare

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.278
or anything nasty like that.

00:04:07.278 --> 00:04:13.709
A kind of very pure vision
of what number theory was.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.000
But the big change-- I was
talking about this at lunch.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.216
The big change in number theory
in the last 40 years or so

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:22.340
is that suddenly you got
these applications, right?

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:31.470
The cryptography and cyber
things, cyber security.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.970
All right.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.803
Well, that was the
history of number theory.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.120
So it has to with whole numbers.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.661
And I'm going to
give you the example

00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:43.200
of Fermat's Last Theorem of
something in number theory.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.120
But I wanted to just
fill it in a little bit

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.220
with some personal
history of my own.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.240
In 1993, there
was this one night

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.215
when I couldn't sleep at all.

00:04:54.215 --> 00:04:56.590
It was the only time I haven't
been able to sleep because

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.730
of some mathematical reason.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.710
I mean the whole night.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.800
It was the night
after the day when

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.090
I heard that Andrew Wiles had
proof Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.370
And some of the details of
the proof had also been given.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.470
And so, I just thought
about it all night

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.760
how these details figured out.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.250
It was just the most
amazing thing that

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.060
has happened in number theory.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.480
Probably the most amazing
thing in mathematics

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.340
in the 20th century.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.960
You may know the story that it
turned out his proof was not

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.880
quite correct.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.820
And it had a gap in
it, which was later

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.280
filled in with the help of
his student, Richard Taylor.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.270
And so, two years later it
became a definite theorem.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.170
But since that time, I've been
fascinated with his proof.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.620
And I immediately wanted to
be able to explain that proof

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.073
to non-mathematicians.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.030
It's a very complicated,
very subtle proof

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.470
with many, many different parts.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.640
But that's the origin
really of our first book.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.400
So Rob and I have written
three books about this.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.910
And this was the first one.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.920
So there are basically
three ingredients.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.450
Three abstruse ingredients that
go into Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.160
One of them is Galois
representation,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.200
whatever they are.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.240
And we devoted
this book to trying

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.930
to explain to--
literally, I wanted

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.550
to explain to my sixth grade
daughter and other children

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.940
what a Galois representation is.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.490
As it turned out, that
was shooting a little--

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.780
that was a little optimistic.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.460
But I think we did
explain it to someone

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.680
who really didn't know much
math, but could handle algebra.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.120
Anyway, that was the
Galois representations.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.150
The second big ingredient in the
proof of Fermat's Last Theorem

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.780
we covered in this book, that's
the theory of elliptic curves.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.560
Which are certain
cubic equations.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.730
And then, in our
most recent book,

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.230
The one we came to talk
about is the third ingredient

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.840
that Andrew needed.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.620
Which was modular forms.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.660
So I'll tell you
a little bit more

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.130
about the contents
of those books.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.260
But quickly, here's his
Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:37.470
And this is an example of a
statement in number theory.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.850
Because it's about ordinary
positive whole numbers.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.390
You may know you can have
a 3, 4, 5, right triangle.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.710
That means 3 squared plus
4 squared equals 5 squared.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.660
So two squares can
add up to a square.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.060
Fermat's Last Theorem says that
higher powers can't do that.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.320
Two cubes cannot
add up to a cube.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.970
Two fourth powers cannot
add up to a fourth power,

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.230
and so on, and so forth.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.500
That turned out to be
very hard to prove.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.680
It's famous, because Fermat
claimed he could prove it.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.490
But no one believes that
he really had a proof.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.730
He made some kind of mistake or
he was writing a little joke.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.390
I don't know what it was.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.060
So what we've tried
to do in our books--

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.400
so for each of those
three topics I mentioned,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.299
each of those
topics can be rooted

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.539
in something very elementary.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:44.330
So for example, modular forms is
rooted in just infinite series.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.090
Just infinite sums.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.510
And infinite sums,
that theory is

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.820
rooted in finite sums,
which is just addition.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.100
So what we did in summing
it up, we divided the book.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.110
All of our books are divided
into three parts, like Gaul.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.670
The first part is meant
to be very elementary.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.840
Really your sixth grader,
if she's motivated enough,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.580
should be able--
she has no algebra.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.940
But with just a
high school algebra,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.960
you should be able to
read that first part.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.750
And there, we talked
about finite sums.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.750
And in a couple
minutes, Rob is going

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.090
to give an example of what we
talk about in the first part

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.689
of the book.

00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:28.230
Then, in the second
part of the book,

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.000
we assume that
you know calculus.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.810
And so, if you know calculus,
one of the topics in calculus

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.200
is infinite series and limits.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.720
And so, then we can go
and discuss that topic.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.200
And then, the third part of the
book is about modular forms.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.620
And that's quite difficult.
But if you're motivated enough,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.960
we hope that you can read
that part of the book as well.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.550
We wanted to know,
who are our readers

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.900
after we published these books.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.490
And so, we get email.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.320
No sixth graders have
written to me yet.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.070
I did make my daughter
read the book,

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.742
so I know at least
one sixth grader.

00:10:05.742 --> 00:10:07.200
Well, she only read
the first part.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.390
So our readers though, turn
out to be-- a few of them

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.730
are like high school students,
math whizzes from high school.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.980
We got some college students
and graduate students.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.170
And I would say the majority
of people who send us email

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.320
are STEM professionals.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.930
You know, engineers,
physicists, chemists.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.320
Often retired, who have
time to read the book.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.510
But I think the range
of emails shows me

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.040
that we're reaching
the kind of audience

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.570
that we wanted to get to.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:54.420
So anyway, I think I'll let
Rob discuss now just one topic,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.610
so you can see in great detail
what a typical number theory

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.120
question is and how
you might answer it.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.970
ROBERT GROSS: OK.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:08.241
So this is going to get hard,
but let's start with something

00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:08.740
easy.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.000
Let's add up 1 plus
2 plus 3 plus 4.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.340
OK.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.780
Well, why are we doing this?

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.940
So there's this old
story about Gauss.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.290
And I'm actually going
to ask if anyone in here

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.190
wants to tell the
story about Gauss

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.614
rather than me doing this.

00:11:24.614 --> 00:11:26.280
Does anyone know this
story about Gauss?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.380
Yes!

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.670
Why don't you just go right
over there to the microphone,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.920
since you're right over there?

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.960
And just go through it.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.260
AUDIENCE: My
understanding is that he

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.890
was given some busy work along
with the rest of the class

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.620
to add up a list of
numbers, perhaps 1 to 100.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.780
And he had the
insight right away

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.510
that you could add
them all to each other.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.250
ROBERT GROSS: OK.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.600
What's interesting is that
that's one way the story goes.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.360
That's what's in Calingers book,
which is a standard textbook.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.620
The busywork part all
the stories agree on.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.930
If you look in Polya,
Polya says it was adding up

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.180
the numbers from 1 to 20.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.860
Now, Polya is not a historian.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.890
He is a mathematician.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.610
And then, you look in
what's undeniably a work

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.700
by a historian of math,
Eric Temple Bell's

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.230
"Men Of Mathematics".

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.010
And he has this really
intricate problem involving

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.050
adding up 100 numbers.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.710
But it's not 1 to 100, it's
something way more complicated.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.410
The trick will still work.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.884
But it's a little hard
to pin down the details.

00:12:20.884 --> 00:12:22.550
And I'm not so sure
the whole thing ever

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.220
happened given this variation.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.600
So let's recapitulate
what you just

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.380
said for the people who aren't
familiar with the story.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.230
If we're going to add up
1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4,

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.530
we can run the numbers
in the other order.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.460
And now, the key observation
is to add vertically, so 1 in 4

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.740
is 5.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.270
2 and 3 is 5.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.490
3 and 2 is 5.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.580
4 and 1 is 5.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.580
S and S is 2S.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.980
And now, we have this
labor saving device

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.470
of multiplication.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.920
Because we don't need to
add 5 to itself four times,

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.700
we can multiply.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.630
And we get that
twice the sum is 20.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.800
And therefore, the sum is 10.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.300
OK.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.940
Now, that works in
general if we're

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.700
adding up the first n numbers.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.130
We can write them
from left to right.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.790
Write them from right to left.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.720
Add vertically.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.330
Use multiplication.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.600
And divide by 2.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.620
That works for a lot of sums.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.800
It doesn't work for all sums.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.070
So the next problem
that one would consider

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.230
where this method
doesn't work is adding up

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.280
squares rather than just
consecutive integers.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.600
Square the numbers
before adding them up.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.140
This problem seems to
date back to the Greeks,

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.560
so it is a natural next step.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.810
I need a little notation here.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.780
Let's call this S2,
because those are squares.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.150
And let's call the
original sum S1.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.130
This same idea
doesn't work if you

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.110
write them from left to right,
write them from right to left

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.670
and add.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.550
It doesn't work.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.800
OK.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.150
So that's not going to fly.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.010
And I want to show you
two different methods.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:03.504
The first method is
very complicated,

00:14:03.504 --> 00:14:05.670
but I want to show it to
you just because it's a way

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.070
to make this left to
right, right to left method

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.840
work with a little
bit more effort.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.340
But this is quite
complex and you'll

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.173
need to look at it
afterwards more carefully

00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:15.360
to see what's going on.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:15.860
OK.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.900
It's a sort of two
dimensional version.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.807
You could say to
yourself, the first method

00:14:19.807 --> 00:14:20.890
isn't going to work again.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.280
Because left, right,
right, left isn't enough.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.930
We're dealing with squares,
we need two dimensions.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.670
So 1 squared is 1.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.410
2 squared is 2 plus 2.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.000
3 squared is 3 plus 3 plus 3.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.090
And 4 squared is 4
plus 4 plus 4 plus 4.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.480
So let's take our sum and make
those substitutions going down.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:39.980
OK?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.605
And now the idea is
that we've actually

00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:46.505
turned a one dimensional left
right approach into a triangle.

00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:48.130
There are actually
two different things

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.760
you can do that will work.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.220
You might be able to make
something work about diagonals

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.230
if you try hard enough.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.070
But I'm going to
go across instead.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.810
And so, the first sum is S1.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.630
The next one is
not quite our sum.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.020
It's S1 minus 1, because
we're missing the 1.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.590
The next line we're
missing the 1 plus 2.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.450
And finally, the last line
we're missing 1 plus 2 plus 3.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.040
OK?

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.200
So now, if we add down
the right hand side,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.760
we have our desired result
S2 is four times S1.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.380
That's the first column
on the right hand side.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.261
Minus a whole lot
of other stuff.

00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:24.760
OK.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.900
So now, here's where
it gets complicated.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.330
We're going to rearrange
that whole lot of other stuff

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.680
using our formula for S1.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.180
OK?

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.800
Those little terms in
parentheses in there

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.360
are all sums of
consecutive integers.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.380
So we're just going
to rearrange them.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.760
So here's our formula.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.320
And instead of 1--
well, that's really

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.620
the sum of the first integer.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.270
That's 1 times 2 over 2, when
1 plus 2 is 2 times 3 over 2.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.120
And 1 plus 2 plus 3
is 3 times 4 over 2.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.580
We'll factor out the 1/2.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.956
We'll do a little
bit of rewriting.

00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:02.330
We have some squares showing
up when we do the rewriting.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.540
1 times 2 is 1 squared plus 1.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.676
And 2 times 3 is
2 squared plus 2.

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:12.870
And eventually, we
end up with S1 minus 4

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:17.400
and S2 minus 4 squared
in the parentheses,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.610
which is really neat.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.180
And that's going
to work in general.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.800
OK?

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.170
If S1 is the sum of
the first n integers,

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.950
then S2 is the sum of
the first n squares.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.280
That same method ends up giving
this very complicated formula

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.190
here, S2 is n times S1 minus
a bunch of other stuff.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.550
We know what S1 is.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.270
We can do some algebra and
we get our desired answer.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.260
So that method can
be made to work,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.670
but it wasn't really good.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.984
It's quite complicated.

00:16:47.984 --> 00:16:49.400
Let me give you a
little homework.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.630
So the sum of the first
n cubes, we can call S3.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.130
Use the same trick,
expand out the cubes.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.070
Do the same idea and you can
eventually with a lot of work

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.500
show that the sum
of the first n cubes

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.300
is n squared times n
plus 1 squared over 4.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.730
It's not easy.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.750
I'll give you a
little more homework,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.010
which is much more interesting.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.280
The sum of the first n integers
is n times n plus 1 over 2.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.550
So show directly that if you
add up the first n integers

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.390
and square it, you get the
sum of the first n cubes.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.390
I'm actually going to
give you a little bit more

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.200
of an assignment.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.740
Not only do that algebraically,
but you should also

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.970
do that geometrically.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.130
What's on the left
hand side is a square.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.380
Take that square,
make it height 1.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.730
Turn it into a solid.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.050
Chop it up and reassemble
it into the cubes

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.730
on the right hand side.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.200
So you can do that.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.500
And it's very enlightening.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.430
But here's a more
motivated proof.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.730
OK?

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.230
Not going to look
that way at first,

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.620
but eventually it will work out.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.955
Let's take this polynomial
out of thin air.

00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:59.350
x cubed over 2 minus x cubed
over 3 minus 6 squared over 2

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.680
plus x over 6.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.480
This has the wonderful property
that if you plug-in x plus 1,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.070
plug-in x into a polynomial and
subtract, you get x squared.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.570
OK?

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.580
There's some algebra
there, but your telephone

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.010
can do the algebra for you.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.340
So you can trust me on that.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.570
And so, plug-in
first x equals 1.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:23.580
And you get f3 of 2 minus
a f3 of 1 is 1 squared.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.910
Plug-in x equals 2,
you get the next line.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.110
Plug-in x equals 3,
you get the next line.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.080
Keep going all
the way down to n.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.210
And we get this line over here.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:41.040
Now, the right hand side is
exactly our desired result.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.890
The left hand side looks like
it has 2n terms, but all but two

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.050
of them cancel.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.350
Notice that the f3 of
2 on the first line

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.060
cancels with the f3 of
2 on the second line.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.630
The f3 of 3 on the second
line cancels with the f3 of 3

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.530
on the third line.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.440
There are only two terms
left when you add up

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.490
the left hand side there.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.950
f3 of n plus 1 and f3 of 1.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.150
The right hand side
is our S2, which

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.690
is the thing we care about.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.920
And we just expand f3 of
n plus 1 minus f3 of 1

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.460
and get the desired answer.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.800
So this magic polynomial f3
solved the problem for us.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.651
So obvious question is,
where did this come from?

00:19:21.651 --> 00:19:22.150
OK.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.650
So this is just about
a Bernoulli polynomial.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.240
Not quite.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.930
I'm going to tell you what
a Bernoulli polynomial is.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.110
Several different ways in fact.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.610
OK.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.850
The Bernoulli polynomials
are polynomials of degree k.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.980
There's one in each degree.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.910
There's a B1.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.110
There's a B0.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.680
There's a B2.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.670
B2 is quadratic.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.360
B3 free is cubic.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.870
B4 is quartic.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.100
OK?

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.690
The first one, B0, is
just the constant 1.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.460
And then, there
after we define them

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.000
by saying each
Bernoulli polynomial

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.090
is just about the integral
of the one before it.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.760
Not quite.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.570
Multiply by a constant first.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.040
I'll explain why in a second.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.700
And integrate.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.280
Now, if you define
something by integration,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.370
there's this constant
of integration

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.086
that's undetermined.

00:20:09.086 --> 00:20:11.210
And we're used to picking
constants of integrations

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.290
being 0, but we're not
going to do that here.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.290
We're going to pick the
constant of integration,

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.060
so that this polynomial has
the same value at 1 as it

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.824
does at 0.

00:20:20.824 --> 00:20:22.990
I'll show you some of these
polynomials in a second.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.140
But those three lines completely
determine the Bernoulli

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.800
polynomials.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.070
You start out at 1.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.630
Integrate after
multiplying by a constant--

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.380
I'll explain why in a second.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.570
And pick the constant
of integration,

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.190
so that the polynomial
has the same value of 0

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.900
as it does at 1.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.660
OK?

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.650
The reason that we're going
to multiply by a constant

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.530
before integrating is to
make each polynomial begin

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.177
with x to the k.

00:20:47.177 --> 00:20:48.760
If we don't multiply
it by a constant,

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.780
we start building up
denominators in the first term.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.870
So here are some
of the polynomials.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.340
We start with 1.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.000
We multiply and integrate.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.540
And we get x, the minus 1/2 is
this constant of integration

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.800
that's picked out.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.640
So that the next
polynomial will have

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.260
the same values at 0 and at 1.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.600
We integrate x minus 1/2.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.850
And then, make the
first term start

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.490
as x squared rather
than x squared over 2.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.020
And the next constant of
integration is going to be 1/6.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.980
Here's one more.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.370
Again, integrate the previous
line after multiplying by 3

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.780
so that you end up with x cubed
rather than x cubed over 3.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.770
There is no constant of
integration here as it happens.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.991
And here's one more.

00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:32.490
OK?

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.970
So they're not
that hard to find.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.290
And they all satisfy--
this is the key.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.750
If you plug-in x plus 1
and plug-in x and subtract,

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.780
you get not x to the k minus 1,
but k times x to the k minus 1.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.940
And that's good enough.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.080
So these are actually the
polynomials we're looking for.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.780
They're not easy to
find, but they're

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.613
the ones that have this
property that if you

00:21:56.613 --> 00:22:00.280
plug-in x plus 1 plug-in x and
subtract, you get a monomial.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.290
And the key point
is the monomial then

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.560
can be added up to give
us the powers of integers.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.060
OK.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.020
So here's an example.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.850
If you plug-in x
plus 1 and plug-in

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.910
x into the third polynomial.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.930
And again, better to let
someone who is error-free,

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.210
like your computer do
the algebra than for you

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.290
to do the algebra.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.590
You end up with 3x squared.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.570
And then, if you
divide by 3, you

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.910
end up with the polynomial
we started with.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.520
Because we want to
get an x squared

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.480
and that's the magic that lets
us add up the first n integers.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.140
OK.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:40.780
And the formula then is B3 of
x1 minus B3 of 1 divided by 3.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.530
OK.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:50.740
Here's formulas for the sums
of the first n k-th powers.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.890
For k going from 1 to 7, we
saw n times n plus 1 over 2,

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.616
n times n plus 1
2n plus 1 over 6.

00:22:58.616 --> 00:22:59.990
I want to put this
on the screen,

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.380
because it's a great
example of something that

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.130
almost never happens in math.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.990
Every single
conjecture you can make

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.240
about this formula based on
these tables is actually true.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.980
OK.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.320
So there's nothing
misleading here.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.120
Very often there
are patterns that

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.820
are true for the
first 10 integers

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.317
and then they just go haywire.

00:23:18.317 --> 00:23:19.650
Here, they're not going haywire.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.900
The degree goes up by one
each time, you can see that.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.970
Each term is divisible
by n times n plus 1.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.960
That's always going to be true.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.550
In alternating degrees,
there's a 2n plus 1.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.460
That's always true.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.560
After k equals 1, the
odd k's all have n

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.290
squared times n plus 1 squared.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.110
There's more stuff that
you can't tell from here.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.450
But if for example,
you graph them,

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:51.100
they're all symmetric
about minus 1/2.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.240
Which is kind of neat.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.660
And there are even more things
if you multiply them out.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.950
For example, the coefficient
of the next to highest term

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.500
is always 1/2.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.810
Very mysterious.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.665
Very nice.

00:24:02.665 --> 00:24:04.790
So that's actually neat
and you can play with that.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.190
You can find this
table in lots of places

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.440
if you want to play with them.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.150
And it is fun to make
conjectures and prove them

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.100
in that way.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.690
The constant terms are
the Bernoulli numbers.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.190
OK?

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.000
So those constants
of integration,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.150
which were picked to
make the polynomials,

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.960
have the same value at 1
and at 0 are these numbers

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.090
called Bernoulli numbers.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:34.830
After the first three-- 0, 1,
and 2-- the ones with odd index

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.590
are all 0.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.430
So I can omit them.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.400
And they're very
mysterious fractions.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.970
The only pattern that
you can directly see

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.140
is that they alternate in sign.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.610
And that is not
that hard to prove.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.170
Other patterns are
pretty hard to prove.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.710
And I feel obligated to
show you some gobbledygook.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.870
Because the usual way of
defining Bernoulli polynomials

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.040
and Bernoulli numbers
is to write down

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.020
this formula for the
Bernoulli polynomials

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.610
in terms of these things
called binomial coefficients--

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.310
which I'm not going to explain.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.530
And then, to say that
the Bernoulli numbers

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.377
satisfy this very mysterious
formula at the bottom.

00:25:13.377 --> 00:25:14.960
Which again, I'm not
going to explain.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.252
And then, that is the way
people typically define them.

00:25:17.252 --> 00:25:17.751
Yes?

00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:18.260
I'm sorry.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.760
AUDIENCE: Why did you
only have [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.710
ROBERT GROSS: Because these
ones that I omitted were all 0.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:24.210
OK?

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:24.710
Yes.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.380
All of the odd ones are 0.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.840
And a very hard exercise
is that people often

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.270
start by writing
down this formula

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.150
on the bottom of this screen.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.554
And then saying, OK.

00:25:34.554 --> 00:25:36.720
Start with that definition
of the Bernoulli numbers.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.980
And now, I'm going to prove
that all of the odd ones are 0.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.160
It's extremely hard to do that.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.160
It can be done.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.360
If you look in some 100-year-old
books, you'll see that way.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.390
There is I have to say, a
much more motivated approach

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.760
to this in our book then
even the one I'm giving now.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.450
But this was one
quick way to get

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.560
to these very
mysterious numbers.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.490
They show up in number
theory all the time.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.270
They were involved in one
of the methods of trying

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.310
to prove Fermat's
Last Theorem using

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.690
something called Kummer theory.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.020
Wasn't quite successful,
but they feature critically.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.810
They also show up in calculus
in a place where you've never

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.892
seen them.

00:26:15.892 --> 00:26:17.350
When you study
calculus, if you get

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.724
to the end of the
second semester

00:26:18.724 --> 00:26:20.320
and you're still
paying attention--

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.210
the teacher tells you there's an
infinite series for sine of x.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.340
And she tells you there's an
infinite series for cosine x.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.774
They're pretty nice formulas.

00:26:27.774 --> 00:26:29.440
The teacher never
tells you that there's

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.340
an infinite series for tangent
of x, because it's not quite

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.160
such a nice formula.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.840
And in fact, it has the
Bernoulli numbers in it.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.700
A result of that along with some
knowledge about infinite series

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.080
is that you can show that
the coefficient in front

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.850
is actually a positive
integer-- which

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.190
is a extremely mysterious fact.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.300
The Bernoulli numbers
are fractions.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:57.210
But multiply them by this very
complicated 4n, 4n minus 1

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:57.980
divided by 2n.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.260
And you end up with it.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.720
And then, make
the sine positive.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.178
You end up with a
positive integer.

00:27:02.178 --> 00:27:04.360
A very strange fact.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.041
Bernoulli numbers show up
in one more interesting way

00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:09.040
that I can tell you now.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.260
I'm going to make a detour here.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:11.760
I'm sorry.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.730
Go ahead.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.230
AUDIENCE: So it's
not at all obvious

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.302
why there's a connection between
these particular polynomials

00:27:18.302 --> 00:27:20.264
and tangent?

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:21.180
ROBERT GROSS: Correct.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.510
AUDIENCE: Is there a
succinct reason for that?

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.260
ROBERT GROSS: Yes.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.452
OK.

00:27:26.452 --> 00:27:27.910
So the question is
it's not obvious

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.480
why these numbers have any
relationship to tangent.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.610
Is there a succinct reason?

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.760
The answer is yes.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:41.550
The numbers actually can
be related to e the x.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.040
And that's actually the
approach we take in the book.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.710
e to the x-- if you
substitute i theta for x,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.950
can be related to
sines and cosines.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.610
And then, there actually are
some complicated trigonometric

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.910
identities to get
tangent into the picture.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.740
Which is where those 4
to the n's come from.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.160
So that wasn't
succinct, but I hope

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.612
it gave you a little bit
of idea what's going on.

00:28:08.612 --> 00:28:10.028
AUDIENCE: Question back to-- OK.

00:28:10.028 --> 00:28:11.662
So why e to the x?

00:28:11.662 --> 00:28:13.620
ROBERT GROSS: That is
actually a good question.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.203
That actually turns
out to be the best

00:28:15.203 --> 00:28:17.490
way to define the
Bernoulli numbers.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.490
And so, that's the approach
we take in the book.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.720
They come from the infinite
expansion of the function

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.420
x over e to the x minus 1.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.860
That's actually the easiest
way to work with them.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.180
Start there and deduce
all of the properties.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.600
AVNER ASH: So you're still
not answering his question.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.361
ROBERT GROSS: OK.

00:28:32.361 --> 00:28:32.860
Go ahead.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.360
Yeah.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:33.890
OK.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.257
AVNER ASH: That if you do
what he just said about e

00:28:36.257 --> 00:28:38.750
to the x over x
or whatever it is,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:43.380
you'll get the Taylor
coefficients there will satisfy

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.840
certain recursion
relations that turn out

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.060
to be identical to the
recursion relations we wanted

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.366
at the beginning to solve
our problem about sums of k

00:28:51.366 --> 00:28:52.370
to the powers.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.390
Solve maybe you could
call it a coincidence.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.589
But that's why it happens.

00:28:57.589 --> 00:28:58.380
ROBERT GROSS: Yeah.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.210
OK.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.560
It is extremely
beautiful and extremely

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.080
mysterious is what I would say.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.680
And it's nowhere
near as mysterious

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.930
as the next connection, which
I will tell you about now.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:15.910
So back about the
time that Bernoulli

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.940
was doing that other work, there
was a famous unsolved problem

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.230
which appears to have the
name the Basel problem.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.660
It's to add up the
numbers 1 plus 1/4

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.030
plus 1/5 plus 1/16 forever.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.580
An infinite sum.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.550
This is the second
part of our book.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.921
The question is, what is it?

00:29:33.921 --> 00:29:34.420
OK.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.530
Well, it's 1.649.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.320
OK?

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:37.950
Dot, dot, dot.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.070
That's not a
satisfactory answer.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.850
It is pi squared over 6.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:47.180
Let me give you a little
bit of background here.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.910
I'm not going to show you that.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.310
This is rather hard to prove.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.870
It again, involves
in one approach

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.384
trigonometric identities.

00:29:55.384 --> 00:29:57.800
Which is where the Bernoulli
numbers are going to come in.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.010
It can be derived using
Fourier series, which again

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:02.470
have trigonometry in them.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.220
So that's one approach.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.450
There's an approach involving
identities, involving

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:12.070
cotangent and cosecant-- which
again, involves trigonometry.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.420
I don't think there's a
trigonometric metric-free way

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.760
to derive this formula.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.580
So a little bit of notation.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.410
We're going to call
zeta of k-- that's

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.740
that strange letter over there.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.000
The sum of the reciprocal
of the k-th powers.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.530
Zeta of 2 is our
subject of interest.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.390
Zeta of 3 is 1 plus
1 over 2 cubed.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:32.990
And so on.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.570
And Zeta of 4 is 1 plus
1 over 2 to the 1/4.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.880
And so on.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.050
So Euler showed that zeta
of two is pi squared over 6.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.630
He solved the Basel problem.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.420
He also essentially
had an identity

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.950
that let him keep going.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.350
Once he had zeta of 2, there's
a kind of complicated formula

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.780
that relates zeta
of 4 to zeta of 2.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.480
And zeta of 6 to zeta 4.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.730
And zeta of 2 and so on.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.850
So you can actually keep going.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:04.740
And he worked out that zeta of
4 is pi to the forth over 90.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.350
Using the identity again,
he worked out that zeta of 6

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.037
is pi to the 1/6 over 945.

00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:13.620
This wasn't part of
the Basel problem.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.250
Euler seems to have
been having fun.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.410
And he got all the
way to zeta of 12.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:21.910
OK.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.030
They're all even powers of
pi divided by something.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.430
And this is an amazing story
that not many people know.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.870
He got to zeta of 12.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:36.370
He said 691 is in the numerator.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.290
I know where else
the 691 shows up,

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.770
it's the 12th Bernoulli
number numerator.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.970
This is absolutely true.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:47.270
And a phenomenal bit of insight.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.850
Euler said, I can
prove a formula

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.180
that relates the even
values of the zeta function

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.610
to the Bernoulli numbers.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.280
So what's going on
here is we started

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:07.380
by trying to add up
squares and then cubes.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.700
Then, we went to infinite
sums of reciprocals

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.830
of squares and cubes.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.260
And the Bernoulli numbers
show up in both places.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.550
There's no good reason for that.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:20.930
So then, the next question to
ask is zeta of odd numbers--

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.780
and here, the answer
is more complicated.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.420
No one knows about
zeta of 3 or zeta of 5.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.100
Very little is known.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.100
Certainly not that it's
pi cubed times something.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.680
Or pi to the 1/5 over something.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.120
You have to answer
a different question

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.760
to get increasing powers of pi.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.330
You have to add odd
numbers, not all numbers.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.930
And sometimes you have
to take alternating sums

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.700
rather than all plus signs.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.670
And then you can get
a formula involving

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.320
increasing powers of pi.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.220
So with that, I'm going
to catch my breath.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.050
And I'll go back and let
you chat a but further.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.980
AUDIENCE: So as a
non-mathematician,

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.510
I have to ask you, is it weird
that you ask these questions

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.290
about series of things
that have integers in them.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.050
And the answer has a
transcendental number

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.226
on one side and an
integer on the other.

00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:15.100
And it's a weirdly
arbitrary looking integer.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.380
Is that as weird as it seems?

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.970
ROBERT GROSS: Yes!

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.460
AVNER ASH: Yes.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.280
Yes.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.810
That's exactly what
I was going to say.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:27.560
Is that what Rob's little
demonstration here shows

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.690
is that if you start off
with the whole numbers

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:37.080
and you're just interested
in the whole numbers,

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.940
It doesn't matter.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.824
You're forced to move on.

00:33:39.824 --> 00:33:41.490
If you want to
understand whole numbers,

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.450
well, first you have to
understand fractions.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.700
And then, we see transcendental
numbers starting to pop up.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.617
We see calculus, we
need to use calculus.

00:33:50.617 --> 00:33:52.700
And this is what Richard
said in his introduction.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.080
You start with the simplest
objects, the whole numbers.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.250
And if you want to understand
them as best you can,

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.040
the subject just
grows and grows.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.940
And it moves you
upwards, so that you're

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.790
learning about more
different kinds of numbers.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.489
And then, you get
to complex numbers.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.261
A square root of minus 1.

00:34:10.261 --> 00:34:11.719
That's really
important if you want

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.190
to go further in number theory.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.679
So that's one of the beautiful
things about the subject.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.095
Probably one of the reasons,
again, why the ancient Greeks

00:34:18.095 --> 00:34:19.730
couldn't get very far with it.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.760
Because their concept
of number was too much

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.610
tied down to commensurability.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.630
But in modern
times, we have this

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.159
is amazing growth
of the subject.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.870
It just keeps growing and
getting weirder and weirder.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.860
And more and more
mysteries are popping up.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.013
And every so often
we prove something.

00:34:39.013 --> 00:34:40.679
You know, Andrew Wiles
proves something.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.100
And that gets a little
bit [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.030
So now, we know Fermat's
Last Theorem is true.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.155
But that opened up a whole
bunch of other mysteries

00:34:47.155 --> 00:34:50.520
about Galois representations
in modular forms.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.310
So the question I
wanted to raise now,

00:34:55.310 --> 00:35:00.290
is why would anyone be
interested in whole numbers

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.119
or in any of this?

00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:03.910
And I want to talk
about that a little bit.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.760
And then, we're hoping to have
a question answer discussion.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.990
And I'm really interested to
hear from you in the audience

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:13.520
if you have any
ideas about this.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.320
But as we were writing our books
and thinking about our audience

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.132
and meeting our
friends-- and the friends

00:35:19.132 --> 00:35:20.340
say, what are you working on?

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.780
I'm working on
this number theory.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.630
There's a certain small
percentage, maybe 5% or 10%

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:31.300
of your friends who say, oh,
that's really interesting.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.650
And you sit down and
they'll listen to an hour.

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.400
You can talk for an
hour about this stuff

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.780
and they get into it.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.730
And the other 90% say,
oh, that's interesting.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:43.310
Their eyes glaze over.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.060
I'm sure that those of you
who are in technical fields

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.640
have had similar experiences.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.950
So one question I have is,
why does the population

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.340
divide up like that?

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.420
For one thing, where does
curiosity about whole numbers

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.840
come from?

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.960
And that I don't know.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.500
But for myself, I remember being
interested from my earliest

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.490
memories.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.130
Like when I was
6-years old, I learned

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.240
about casting out nines.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.820
And then, I would just
write down lists of numbers

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.530
and add them up.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.890
And then cast out the nines
and see that it worked out.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.542
That was like a great mystery.

00:36:20.542 --> 00:36:22.500
When I was a bit older,
I learned some algebra.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.140
I just liked solving
simultaneous equations

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.220
into unknown.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.500
Linear equations and
plugging in the answers

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.019
and seeing that it worked out.

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:31.560
I don't know.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.540
Is my brain wired that way?

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.080
My father was a physicist.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.210
Maybe it has something
to do with his tutelage?

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.200
So I was going to
ask you, how far back

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.130
were you interested in
math and number theory?

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.370
ROBERT GROSS: A long way.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.160
And I actually
remember working out

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.192
some of those formulas
in that table way

00:36:49.192 --> 00:36:50.400
before there was an internet.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.190
And I actually was
told that if you add up

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.714
the 1/5 powers of numbers from
1 to n, you get a polynomial.

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.380
And I remember working
this out by hand.

00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:02.460
And checking the answer.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.526
It was great.

00:37:03.526 --> 00:37:04.900
AVNER ASH: So this
doesn't really

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.910
give us any insight into
why we were interested.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:11.580
Why we became mathematicians.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.390
And then, the other
side of the question

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:17.700
is, why are so many
people not interested?

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.930
And that seems to be at least
partly a cultural thing.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.720
Because we were discussing
this also before the lecture

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.640
that in other countries,
like Russia and France,

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.160
many more of the general
public-- at least

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.970
they have some interest
in mathematics.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.010
Mathematicians
can be rock stars.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.515
There's a French
mathematician who

00:37:36.515 --> 00:37:40.140
is like a rock star over there.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.640
And there's just
much more attention

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.190
paid to mathematics in
some other countries.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:50.970
But I don't think that's
really the whole answer.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.150
Is it that there's something
in American culture

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:57.620
that is designed to
turn students off?

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.980
Could it be that all sixth
graders, if they were just

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.420
allowed to play around with
numbers by themselves--

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.800
or most of them
would be interested?

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.430
But there is something
in our-- that they're

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:12.440
getting some kind of message
that it's even nerdy to be

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.720
interested in mathematics.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.981
Or in girls it's not girly.

00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:17.980
You know, if you're a
girl, you shouldn't do it.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.030
And then, you should be
doing sports instead.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.740
I really don't know.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.920
But it's important if
you're writing books

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.170
for the general public
about mathematics,

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.816
you want them to be
interested in it.

00:38:31.816 --> 00:38:33.730
In the preface to
our book-- you know,

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.820
I thought a lot about when
we were writing this preface.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.970
How do we hook a reader?

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.470
Of course, I don't
know what they're

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.761
doing in the science section
anyway of their book store

00:38:41.761 --> 00:38:43.050
or of Amazon.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.240
But they look it up and
they look at the preface.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.520
And what are we going
to say to grab them?

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.970
And we never figured out
a good answer to that.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.420
Basically it says, if
you are interested.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.900
If you are curious about
the properties of numbers,

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.550
then this is a book for you.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:05.610
And we'll go back as
early as you want.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.780
We'll start off with the
most elementary concepts

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.680
that you might want.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.130
Addition is about as
elementary as you can be.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.040
And we can build up from there.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.230
But what gets a person
interested at the beginning?

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.800
I don't really know.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.950
And I'm very curious about that.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.640
So there's one
other possibility.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.085
As we saw it from
Rob's talk-- and then

00:39:32.085 --> 00:39:33.960
you all know this anyway
from any mathematics

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.084
that you may have studied
in school, or in college,

00:39:36.084 --> 00:39:40.400
or whenever, it starts off
slowly and then it builds.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.440
So it's always
building on itself.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.450
And if you can't kind of retain
several different layers,

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:48.670
you get lost.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.040
Students get lost.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.640
It's not like a
literature course,

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.831
where first read this novel.

00:39:53.831 --> 00:39:55.080
And then, you read that novel.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.330
And then, you read that novel.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:57.990
If you didn't
understand "Moby Dick",

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.180
you can still understand
[INAUDIBLE] or something

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.819
like that.

00:40:01.819 --> 00:40:03.360
But in mathematics,
there's much more

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.790
of this process of layering.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.230
And I think that might
be why a lot of people

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.450
drop out of the
game at some point.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.590
But I still don't
understand from early

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.470
on why more people aren't
interested in this really

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.580
wonderful subject that
we've devoted our lives to.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.450
So that's I think
all I wanted to say.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:24.220
Anything to add?

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.053
ROBERT GROSS: I want
to hear what they have.

00:40:26.053 --> 00:40:28.697
AVNER ASH: We'd really like to
hear any questions or comments

00:40:28.697 --> 00:40:29.530
that you might have.

00:40:31.865 --> 00:40:32.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.610
Actually while we're
talking about the subject,

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:36.380
my daughter is
actually home schooled.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.020
So it's kind of a
different experience.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.190
But it's still kind
of curious, because we

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:45.760
use this program called IXL
or something rather like that.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.830
And it's very interesting
in what they try to do,

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:52.810
because they're trying
to teach kids mathematics

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.630
but they're doing it
incredibly computationally.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.490
My daughter got pretty good.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.630
She's a 9th or 10th grade
in high school equivalent

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.490
right now.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.116
And she got pretty
good at calculating.

00:41:04.116 --> 00:41:05.490
And she was like
really impressed

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.390
that she could calculate
10 digit numbers.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.330
And I at some point
revealed to her, well,

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.230
that's great calculation.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.880
But it has really very little
to do with mathematics.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.940
And then, it turns out she
got interested in chemistry

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.010
on her own more or less.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:23.730
And it's interesting.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.690
Because I can see
with the chemistry,

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.850
I can talk to her about
the things about patterns.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.630
How [INAUDIBLE] and bases.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.280
And notice how the
numbers on this side

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.860
have to be the
numbers on that side.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:35.840
And guess what?

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.780
That's just equality.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.090
That's the mathematical concept.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:43.600
And when she sees that stuff,
it's very interesting to her.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.940
Now, the part with getting
her to do the actual

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.190
work to solve the
hard problems, that's

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.460
a little more challenging.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.570
But there is the
interesting stuff.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:54.690
A lot of stuff I
think that gets taught

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:59.870
these days is computation,
because computation is easy.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.710
You can easily measure it.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.980
You can say, oh, did you
get the right number?

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.239
It's like, well, OK.

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:06.280
You got the right number.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.220
But that doesn't
give you much clue

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.730
as to whether they
got any insight

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.264
from getting that number,
which is a much harder problem.

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:14.930
And I think that's
where the problem is.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.920
It's not so much that we
have bad teachers per se.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.090
It's that getting
people to get concepts

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.770
is actually a very challenging
thing and a very, very

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.230
hard thing to measure.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.140
And so, you've given as
you saidd-- your students

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:33.320
with the lowest GPA's
the hardest problem.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.670
How do you measure how someone
else is going to succeed?

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.615
Anyway, so just another--

00:42:38.615 --> 00:42:40.490
AUDIENCE: I had a
technical question for you.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.510
AVNER ASH: Yes, please.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.500
AUDIENCE: So the zeta functions.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.795
Because they involve greater
and greater exponents,

00:42:45.795 --> 00:42:49.000
does that lead to
faster converging

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.020
numerical estimations for pi?

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.920
ROBERT GROSS: It would
except the power of pi

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.240
is higher each time.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.130
And it turns out to
pretty much average out.

00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:57.838
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:42:57.838 --> 00:42:59.957
Because the square root
algorithms for example.

00:42:59.957 --> 00:43:00.790
ROBERT GROSS: Right.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:04.480
But the error seems to go--
if you compute zeta of 100

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.794
and relate that
to pi to the 100.

00:43:06.794 --> 00:43:08.210
And then, take the
hundredth root,

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.764
it's not the right
way to compute pi.

00:43:10.764 --> 00:43:13.180
There is a lot of number theory
involved in the right ways

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.460
to compute pi.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.920
But the zeta function turns
out not to be a good way.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.260
It's very disappointing,
because you would only

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.790
need to add one or two terms.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.000
AVNER ASH: But there's an
interesting separate issue

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.480
there that you raise.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.340
And I'm not an expert
on this, so I might

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.660
say something that's incorrect.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.650
Maybe you can--

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:37.140
But as Rob showed you,
zeta of even numbers--

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.020
so those are the
reciprocals of squares,

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.920
fourth powers, sixth powers.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.780
That infinite sum is known.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.990
It's a power of pi times a
rational number, it's easy.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:49.090
And then zeta of the odd
numbers are pretty much unknown.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.090
ROBERT GROSS: Completely

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:50.965
AVNER ASH: Zeta of 3.

00:43:50.965 --> 00:43:51.670
Zeta of 5.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.480
Except there's one
thing that's known.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.520
That zeta of 3 is irrational.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.980
It's not a fraction.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.274
That's the only one, right?

00:44:00.274 --> 00:44:01.440
ROBERT GROSS: It's possible.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.860
AVNER ASH: Any zeta
of 5 is known also.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.190
ROBERT GROSS: Yeah.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.089
I'm not sure.

00:44:04.089 --> 00:44:05.130
But very little is known.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:06.970
And it's not hard to
go back to your office

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.770
and get zeta of 3
computed to 100 places.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:12.860
Divide by pi cubed and
hope to spot something.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.070
We've all done it.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.960
And it's not anything.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.050
But maybe it's not pi cubed,
maybe it's pi to the 3/2.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:20.770
AVNER ASH: Oh.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.264
ROBERT GROSS: You could
play all afternoon and see.

00:44:23.264 --> 00:44:24.680
AVNER ASH: What I
was going to say

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.140
though is if I
remember right, the way

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.490
this guy proved that
zeta of 3 is irrational

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:35.950
does have to do with the rate
of convergence of a series.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:36.700
ROBERT GROSS: Yes.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.158
AVNER ASH: So it's known that
if a series converges really,

00:44:39.158 --> 00:44:44.450
really rapidly a certain
type, then it cannot converge

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.810
to a rational number.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.370
That's a kind of combination
of calculus and number theory.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.070
And now, the series
for zeta of 3

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.380
itself doesn't have that
fast convergence property.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.860
But the [INAUDIBLE]
figure out some ways

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:01.000
of manipulating it and
relating it to some very fast

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.110
quickly convergent series.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:02.790
Is that right?

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.920
ROBERT GROSS: No.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.630
Entirely correct.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:04.296
AVNER ASH: Yeah.

00:45:04.296 --> 00:45:07.760
And so, that's the amazing
thing about this subject.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.360
You never know what
other part of mathematics

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:15.940
is going to come in to be
useful in understanding

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.800
just these properties of
these simple whole numbers

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.605
and fractions.

00:45:20.605 --> 00:45:22.230
AUDIENCE: Regarding
the question of how

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.750
do you interest people
in number theory.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.270
Given that unlike
in Hardy's times,

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.370
there are actually applications
for number theory now.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.180
Is there a story
to tell there where

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.840
people might be interested
in the applications

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.250
and the number theory is
actually possible for people

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:39.454
for laypeople to understand?

00:45:39.454 --> 00:45:40.120
AVNER ASH: Yeah.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.160
I think so.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.220
I mean I think that books
have been written about that.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:51.010
So if you look at the range
of books of mathematics

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:56.880
for sort of the general public,
then there are different types.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.820
And one type is to concentrate
on these applications.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.890
And that's one good method.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.690
That's something we sort of
wanted to avoid in our book.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:08.260
Because we wanted to try to put
this out as something as very

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.960
pure and theoretical.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.040
Just because that's
how we view it.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.300
But that's a good way to go.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.930
Another way is to talk
about the biographies

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.370
of the mathematicians.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.990
That's pretty popular.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.130
And then, there are
quite a few books

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.230
that just treat the
mathematics itself,

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.210
but they usually start
at a higher level.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:31.620
And what we wanted to do
was to bring this down

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.660
at least at the
beginning of each book.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.650
To bring it down to the lowest
possible level we could.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.210
The last one summing it up is
a little bit more difficult

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.880
to actually.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.550
The algebra gets
heavy really fast.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:49.117
If you look at our first book,
"Fearless Symmetry", in a way

00:46:49.117 --> 00:46:51.450
that's harder to understand,
because it's more abstract.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:53.410
But in terms of the
math that is involved,

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.060
the whole first eight
chapters involve

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.930
nothing but addition,
subtraction, multiplication,

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.190
and division.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.520
And yet, we're studying some
very interesting properties

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.070
of numbers.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:10.710
Namely if you divide one
number by a prime number,

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.080
you get a remainder.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.610
We're interested
in those remainders

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.936
and how they fit together.

00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:17.060
And that's the beginning
of the story that leads on

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.880
to these Galois
representations that

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:23.027
are important in the proof
of Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:47:23.027 --> 00:47:25.110
AUDIENCE: I think I could
provide a little insight

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.414
about mathematics
in Russia as I'm

00:47:28.414 --> 00:47:29.690
a college student from Russia.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:33.310
So actually, mathematicians
and engineers

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:36.480
are not viewed as rock stars
in Russia at all-- at least

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.100
in the general public.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.830
But if you're interested,
and motivated.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.610
and you want to attempt
some early school

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.620
and get into the STEM
field at some point,

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.772
you have opportunities.

00:47:48.772 --> 00:47:50.146
At least in the
big cities, there

00:47:50.146 --> 00:47:54.080
are very good and famous
schools with great curriculum

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.230
in math and physics.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:01.810
And like proofs are all
over math curriculum.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.745
If you don't get into
the right school,

00:48:04.745 --> 00:48:08.740
you can probably still
attend a math circle

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.160
starting from middle school.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.060
Which again, exposes
you to number

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:17.440
theory, calculus starting
from fifth grade or something.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.352
That's how I personally got
involved in the math field.

00:48:21.352 --> 00:48:22.810
AVNER ASH: In fact,
down the street

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:24.268
from where I live
there's something

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:27.980
called the Russian
School Of Mathematics.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.610
I think there for
schoolchildren to give them

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:36.160
supplementary education
in mathematics.

00:48:39.206 --> 00:48:41.580
I was just going to say--
maybe this now will be obvious.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.400
I was going to
summarize by saying,

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.070
why should we get people
interested in mathematics?

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:48.440
Besides selling our book.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.900
You know, who cares?

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.980
So just to summarize.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.040
But I think you've all
probably heard this before.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.980
First of all, mathematics
is the language of nature.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.480
That's what Galileo called it.

00:49:05.086 --> 00:49:07.030
SPEAKER: He didn't
have group theory.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.030
AVNER ASH: Well, actually
group theory turns out

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.940
to be just as much there.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:11.770
But he didn't know.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:12.270
Yeah.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.491
Well it was very
insightful of him.

00:49:14.491 --> 00:49:14.990
Yeah.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.680
Mathematics is the
language of nature.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.900
And so, people who might not
be interested in mathematics

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.900
per se-- I mean most people
are interested in some part

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.620
of the natural world.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.370
And if you want to
be a good citizen,

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:30.740
you need to know your
basic mathematics.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.570
And there's all these
horrible stories

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.150
in the newspaper
about people don't

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:36.730
have any financial literacy.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:38.710
They don't understand
compound interest.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:41.860
They don't understand
global warming.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.680
Things like that.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.340
All those kind of
things would be

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.190
better served if we--
and I think maybe we

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:51.400
as a society are slowly moving
in the direction of making

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:55.910
mathematics more accessible
and more fun for all people,

00:49:55.910 --> 00:50:00.250
not just for this 5% or 10%
who get born interested.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.760
And then, finally we
want to have people

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.990
going into the STEM areas.

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.820
We need more and
more people educated

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.500
in mathematical sciences,
and engineering, and so on.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.470
And so, you need a
bigger pool to draw from.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.302
So I think those are all good
reasons for writing books

00:50:16.302 --> 00:50:17.760
like these and
trying to get people

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.300
interested in mathematics.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.870
SPEAKER: Well,
thank you very much.

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:23.227
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:23.227 --> 00:50:25.351
AVNER ASH: Thank you.
