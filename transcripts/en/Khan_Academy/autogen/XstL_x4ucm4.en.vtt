00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:02.352
 The teacher of Vivek and Camilla gave them a system 

00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:04.185
 of linear equations to solve. 

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:06.118
 They did it with the help of a few steps they led 

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.284
 to the systems shown in the table below. 

00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:10.052
 We have the original system of the teacher, 

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:12.450
 what has Vivek received after having done several actions, 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.552
 what she has received after she has done several actions. 

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:17.484
 Which one has received a system that is equivalent 

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.018
 of the system of teacher's equations? 

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.651
 The first question we should ask, 

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:24.151
 is what does it mean to have an equivalent system? 

00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:26.152
 For the purpose of this task or for our purposes, 

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:29.918
 equivalent to a system is a system that has the same solution as the one given. 

00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:32.418
 If there is a pair (x, y) that satisfies 

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:34.585
 the system of teacher's equations, which is the solution 

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:36.218
 the teacher 's system and 

00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:38.418
 the system of equations of Vivek, then we will call it equivalent, 

00:00:38.418 --> 00:00:41.011
 because it has the same solution. 

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:45.118
 This also applies to Camilla's system, if there is the same solution, 

00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:48.851
 we will call it equivalent to the teacher's system. 

00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:50.751
 Let's make some comparisons here. 

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.451
 First let's take a look at Vivek's. 

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.051
 The first equation is unchanged 

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.917
 equation of the teacher, 

00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:58.618
 it is no different than that of the teacher, 

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:02.551
 means any solution that satisfies both equations, 

00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.018
 will certainly be the solution of the above equation, 

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:07.251
 because it is literally the same as the above equation 

00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:08.984
 the teacher. So it happens. 

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:10.521
 Let's take a look at the second. 

00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.551
 The second equation here is definitely different. 

00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:17.551
 We can verify that it has not only been multiplied 

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.977
 by any number on both sides. 

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:22.618
 To make it a zero, if we multiply, 

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:25.251
 we will multiply 1 by 0 

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.351
 and then, in order to maintain equality, 

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:28.918
 we will do this on the other side. 

00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:31.218
 But 0 on this left side will be 0, 

00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:33.085
 we will get 0 equals 0, 

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:36.918
 so he not only divided the two sides of a number, 

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.317
 but seems to have done another action. 

00:01:38.317 --> 00:01:41.984
 It looks like he probably added or pulled out 

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:43.252
 something on both sides. Let's see how 

00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:45.351
 has received this here. 

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:48.521
 It started from -4h 

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.701
 plus 5u is equal to 1. 

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:53.717
 And it seems he has been able to get it 

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:57.118
 -3x plus 7th 

00:01:57.118 --> 00:01:59.288
 is equal to 0. 

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:02.251
 Let's see what it was supposed to do to get this. 

00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.818
 It is sure... 

00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:07.217
 To go from -4x to -3x, 

00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:09.717
 must have added x, 

00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:11.384
 so I will just write there x. 

00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:12.851
 To go from 5th to 7th, 

00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:14.917
 must have added 2u. 

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:16.717
 So on the left he added 

00:02:16.717 --> 00:02:18.284
 x plus 2u. 

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:20.818
 Note that there we have x plus 2. 

00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:23.251
 And on the right side 

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:25.551
 took 1 or added minus 1. 

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:28.251
 Here we see -1. 

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.084
 He has collected the left sides 

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.451
 of these two equations to get this new left side, 

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.184
 and has gathered the right sides, 

00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:39.818
 to get this new right hand. 

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:42.534
 And this is a perfectly acceptable action. 

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.384
 This new equation we received, 

00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:48.452
 this new linear equation will present 

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:51.285
 different rights than here, 

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:55.018
 but the resulting system will have the same solution. 

00:02:55.018 --> 00:02:56.984
 Why we are confident that the resulting system 

00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:59.019
 will there be the same solution? 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.019
 For a pair (x, y) that satisfies both equations, 

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:06.351
 this will be the decision: 

00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:09.452
 for this pair (x, y), x plus 2u 

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:11.585
 is equal to minus 1. 

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:13.051
 About this solution 

00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:15.385
 we add the same thing to both sides. 

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:17.784
 We say, "I will add x plus 2 

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:19.884
 to the left side. 

00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:23.584
 And if I do not want to change equality, 

00:03:23.584 --> 00:03:26.284
 I have to add the same thing to the right side. " 

00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:29.251
 We have been told about the solution of this equation, that 

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.584
 x plus 2u is equal to minus 1, 

00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:34.318
 so minus 1 is the same as x plus 2u 

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:36.917
 for that decision, and so we will not change 

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.584
 the resulting system solution. 

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.251
 What Vivek has done is a perfectly acceptable action - 

00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:42.517
 has gathered the left sides 

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:43.751
 and then gathered the right sides, 

00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.651
 to get this new second equation. 

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.850
 This will not change the system's decision. 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.518
 In fact, this method is often used 

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:52.185
 to find the solution of a system of equations. 

00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:54.785
 Now let's take a look at Camilla's. 

00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:58.318
 Its first equation is the same 

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:02.617
 as the second equation of the teacher. 

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.318
 Let's see her second equation 

00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:08.351
 how it relates to the first equation. 

00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:10.317
 Appraised by an eye, 

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:11.819
 it looks like it 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.750
 has multiplied both sides by some number. 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.485
 And it seems that this number is ... That she has multiplied 

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:20.917
 the right side by minus 8. 

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.151
 So below minus 8. 

00:04:23.151 --> 00:04:26.884
 Minus 1 minus 8 is plus 8. 

00:04:26.884 --> 00:04:29.051
 And it seems she has multiplied 

00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:30.618
 and the left side by minus 8. 

00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:33.384
 Minus 8 by x is minus 8x. 

00:04:33.384 --> 00:04:36.717
 Minus 8 in 2u is minus 16u. 

00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:39.718
 It has simply multiplied both sides of the same value, 

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:41.284
 which in fact does not change the equation. 

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:43.105
 This will be... 

00:04:43.105 --> 00:04:44.834
 It changes the appearance, 

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.951
 but in reality presents the same rights. 

00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:51.232
 This is definitely an equivalent system. 

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:52.851
 These are still the same conditions. 

00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:54.718
 We will have the same solution. 

00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:56.118
 When dealing with equation systems, 

00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:58.818
 you will not change the system's decision, 

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:02.885
 if you multiply both sides of an equation by 

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.651
 any number or if you collect and subtract the equations. 

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.184
 When I say collection and subtraction of the equations, 

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:09.085
 I mean, you add the left side to the left side 

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:10.752
 and the right side to the right, 

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:14.285
 here it is - you pull it out of the other 

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:16.651
 on the left, and if we remove the lower one 

00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:17.718
 from the upper left side 

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.751
 and remove the lower one from the top right, 

00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:21.785
 this will not change the decision. 

00:05:21.785 --> 00:05:25.417
 Both have received a system of equations equivalent to that of the teacher, 

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:27.385
 that is, the same solution 

00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:30.189
 such as that of the teacher.
