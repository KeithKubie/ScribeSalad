00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.050
Is the United States looking for a war with
Iran?

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.170
The Trump administration will now financially
penalize anybody that buys Iran's oil

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.599
and will also impose sanctions on Iran's iron,
steel, aluminum and copper sectors.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.280
This is the most drastic step the U.S. government
has ever taken toward Iran. And it comes at

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.080
a time when Iran was actually abiding by an
agreement it reached with the Obama administration.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.609
So frankly, it makes no sense.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.939
In 2018, President Trump pulled the U.S. out
of the Iran nuclear deal - an international

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.750
agreement unanimously endorsed by the UN Security
Council.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.320
It's not that Iran was deemed to have violated
the deal; international inspectors and even

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.380
U.S. intelligence certified that it was in full
compliance.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.879
Trump rejected the agreement itself, having
vowed on the campaign trail to take a harder

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.469
line against Iran.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.719
Although the U.S. does hardly any business with
Iran, Trump aimed to deprive Iran of its prime

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.390
source of revenue by threatening sanctions
against countries that buy its oil.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.109
After a year of so-called 'waivers' to countries
like China, India, South Korea, Japan and

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:08.580
Turkey, those threats of sanctions have now
come into effect.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.210
So the United States doesn't buy any oil from
Iran and hasn't for a very long time. But

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.420
what it's trying to do is tell the rest of
the world how it should conduct foreign trade.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.729
And needless to say, most countries resent
being told whether they can

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.789
deal with this country or that country.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.249
It's only because of the power of the dollar
in the U.S. financial system because most transactions

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:34.359
have to pass through the American financial
system that we even have the power to do this

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.240
at all.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.900
Some analysts think that the Trump administration's
policy is shortsighted, could backfire in

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.489
a number of ways, and even set the U.S. on a
path to war with Iran.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:49.319
Many also see its purpose as being to create
such deprivation among ordinary Iranians that

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.979
they rise up and overthrow their regime — a
longstanding goal of Washington hawks and

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.619
Iran's regional foes.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.100
Though European powers like France, Germany
and the UK oppose the U.S. withdrawal from the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.020
nuclear deal and the new sanctions, Washington
hopes to pressure them to comply by implementing

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.709
“secondary sanctions.”

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.079
These block foreign companies from doing business
in the U.S. if they also do business in Iran.

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.060
So some of Iran's remaining oil customers
are likely to fall in line and comply with

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.900
U.S. demands. However the situation is much
more complicated when it gets to China, Turkey

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.239
and India.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.019
They all have their own separate calculations
and horse trading with the U.S. and relations with

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.549
Iran that they have to balance.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.200
It's complicated and it's hard to predict in which direction
these countries would move, but they will

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.459
be the ones who will make or break U.S.' 
maximum pressure strategy against Iran.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.260
At first, it might seem like Trump turning
up the pressure and reimposing sanctions will

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.790
get the Iranians to comply to his demands.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.269
After all, sanctions forced Iran to sign that
2015 nuclear agreement, right?

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.269
Not quite.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.879
The accord could only become a reality because
the U.S. met Iran halfway.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.560
So yes, I mean sanctions played a role, but
more important is a diplomatic strategy that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.439
makes sense, where a country can see that
it will get benefits if it agrees to certain

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.180
concessions.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.349
And those benefits were supposed to be an
end to a lot of the sanctions,

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.150
an ability to sell oil freely again and to have foreign investment and to see the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.100
economy grow in Iran.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.240
And that's where the Iranians have been cheated
because so far they've been following

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.780
the restrictions they agreed to
on their program but they're not getting

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.180
the benefits.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.780
There lies the difference between Trump's
Iran policy, and the Obama approach that he

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.069
has reversed.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.030
The Obama administration believed that avoiding
another massive U.S. military intervention in

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.349
the Middle East required diplomacy.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.920
Obama and his advisors also believed that
it was necessary to make realistic demands

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.460
and offer clear incentives to Iran to prevent
it from gaining the means to build nuclear weapons.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.879
Although Obama initially increased sanctions
on Iran, he also saw that sanctions had failed

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.590
to curb the country's nuclear program.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.700
In fact, quick history lesson:

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.730
From 2001 to 2006, the Bush administration
had attempted to halt Iran's enrichment program

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.760
by using a mixture of diplomacy and threats
of force.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.500
States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.460
Guess what?

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.760
It didn't really work and Iran continued expanding
its nuclear program and began to build thousands

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.259
of centrifuges to enrich uranium.

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.310
Later, despite significantly tightening sanctions,
the Obama administration recognized that this

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.270
was not stopping Iran from expanding its nuclear
program in a way that would give it the means

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.540
to build a bomb.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.720
That's why Obama concluded that by staying
on the sanctions path, the U.S. would be left

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.880
with only two options:

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.640
Either accepting Iran as a nuclear weapons-capable
nation or starting a war to prevent that.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.040
And he didn't want to do either.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.480
Today, after two years of negotiations,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.480
the United States, together with our international partners,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.840
has achieve something that decades of animosity has not.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.990
Look, pressure without an open door is an exercise
in futility. The reality is the previous time

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.919
when we had sanctions and they resulted in
a diplomatic solution, it was when the Obama

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.810
administration took regime change off the
table in direct letters that President Obama

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.879
sent to the Supreme Leader of Iran.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.690
And also when the U.S. took the first step and
made the first concession to the Iranian side

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.330
when the Obama
administration took off basically the zero-enrichment

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.890
requirement from the table, then accepted
a limited enrichment program on Iranian soil.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.660
It's important to remember that by all measures,
Iran has been complying with the conditions

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.289
underlined in the 2015 nuclear agreement.

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.260
So if Iran has kept its end of the bargain,
why hasn't the Trump administration done the

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.260
same?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.910
Well, that's because adopting a harder line
against Iran has been popular among American

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.910
conservatives for a very long time.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.620
Even though Trump likes to say he's the great
dealmaker, the kinds of demands that Secretary

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.479
of State Mike Pompeo put forward are, are
simply unrealistic.

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:22.180
I mean, they wanted Iran to completely stop
its nuclear program, give up a ballistic missiles,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.370
pull out of all the places it's involved in
the region, even change its human rights policy.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.800
I mean, it's, you know, they're not going
to do that. They're not going to capitulate

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.220
to the United States. So what's the other
possibility? Regime collapse. And I think

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.500
that really is the goal of people like John
Bolton.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.050
They want to see the country fall apart.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.210
The sanctions against Iran have hit the country
hard.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.830
According to U.S. officials, Iran has lost
more than $10 billion in oil revenue because

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.920
of sanctions.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.900
The Iranian economy shrank by almost 4% in
2018 and is expected to shrink by around 6%

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.520
in 2019.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.610
Iran's currency also lost more than 60% in
2018, worsening inflation in the country which

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.510
is expected to reach at least 40% in 2019.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.879
And the Trump administration may be looking
to exploit this weakness.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:16.659
Look, there is this belief in Washington that
Iran doesn't respond to pressure, but responds

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:23.379
to massive pressure. So the idea is to ratchet
up and increase pressure in a way that would

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:27.330
able to bring the Iranians to their knees,
either to come back to the negotiating table

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.240
and surrender or, instead of capitulating,
maybe the regime will collapse.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.879
I think there are a lot of people in this administration,
most important among them National Security

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:41.400
Advisor John Bolton, who believes that this
is a moment of vulnerability in Iran, that

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.770
its leadership is aging and its population
is frustrated with political and economic

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.770
stagnation.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.379
And if they increased the economic pressure,
they have a chance of bringing about regime

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:59.879
change, which is something that many people in Washington have been dreaming

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:02.870
for at least four decades.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.410
But whether the United States can successfully
sabotage and bring the Iranian economy to

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.310
a complete collapse is still up for debate.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:15.370
After all, previous American presidents have
attempted to cripple Iran's economy, but Iran

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.360
has always found a way to survive.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.889
Without any doubt, the Iranian economy would
be in dire straights. But one thing that is

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:26.790
important to remember that this is not the
first time the Iranians are experiencing these

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.810
kinds of economic difficulties.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:33.420
In fact, this is the fourth time in the past
four decades that Iran is losing more than

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.840
half of its oil revenue almost overnight.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.970
The Iranians are quite resilient and quite
experienced in dealing with economic difficulties

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.360
and circumventing U.S. sanctions.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.390
So if we're talking about short run, I think
they have what it takes to remain afloat economically.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.730
But this situation is not sustainable in the
medium- to long-term.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.310
Now, it may seem like the Trump administration
is the only one wanting to turn up the heat

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.310
under Iran.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.960
The truth is, a few other players are involved.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.060
Specifically: Iran's neighbors who aren't
too happy with Iran's involvement in the region.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:14.030
Of course there are U.S. allies in the region,
Israel, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.780
which are strongly supporting this pressure
against Iran because they don't want Iran

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.340
to be as influential as it is in their region.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:27.320
And there is this tremendous rivalry between Iran
and Saudi Arabia. It's just gotten worse since

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.810
Mohammad bin Salman became so influential.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.370
And so the Saudi hope is that somehow Iran
will draw back in the region, that it won't

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:41.460
be so involved in supporting the Houthis in
Yemen and propping up Assad in Syria

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:47.710
and Hezbollah in Lebanon, that Iran won't
be as influential in Iraq. I don't think that's

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.710
going to happen.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.260
So, now that the U.S. has moved to essentially
strangle Iran's economy, how will Iran react?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.200
In May 2019, Iran gave an answer:

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.740
It officially ended its compliance with parts
of the nuclear deal.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.940
There are also signs that Tehran is getting impatient
with the European Union.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.950
The European Union has come up with something
called a "special purpose vehicle" for essentially

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.430
a kind of ledger, so that trade could go on
between Iran and Europe without money actually

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:24.070
changing hands, at least initially a kind
of barter arrangement. But it still has not started

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.070
working.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.960
And Iranians are really, really frustrated.
It's a year now

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.520
since the Trump administration withdrew from
the deal and this "special purpose vehicle" is still

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.920
not up and running.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.780
Trump's hardline on Iran is also an all-or-nothing gamble.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.170
It's important to understand that the Iranian
political system is not all in agreement.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.270
This means that, just like in the U.S., there
are competing voices in the political establishment.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.580
Quite a few of those voices weren't happy
with the compromises Iran had to make in the

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.580
nuclear deal.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.830
Now, those same voices are using Trump's abandonment
of the deal to question whether there's even

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.070
a point in cooperating with the West.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:06.480
The Iranian regime views U.S. sanctions as
economic warfare, and analysts fear that they

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.660
could be provoked into more dangerous confrontations
on other fronts, such as blockading oil shipments

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.460
through the Strait of Hormuz, which could
trigger military conflict.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.871
They think that because the election in the
U.S. is just a year and a half away, they

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:27.040
have to wait to see the outcome of that election.
But I think if U.S. pressure really brings

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.800
the Iranian economy to the brink of collapse,
then the Iranians might have to put aside

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.120
their strategic patience policy and pursue
retaliation.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:43.200
With relations between Washington and Tehran
souring, and Europe seemingly unable to act,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.790
what happens now?

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:52.330
We are all hoping that the next administration,
even if Trump is re-elected, will change its

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:58.890
policy toward Iran and will adopt a more realistic
strategy that has a chance of really not just,

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:03.640
you know, changing Iranian policies that we
don't like, but really improving the life

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.360
of the Iranian people.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.160
But the pressure on Iran is escalating sharply,
and the next U.S. election is 18 months away.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.140
And even if it could be sure that the result
would change the current hardline policy,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.900
can Tehran wait that long?
