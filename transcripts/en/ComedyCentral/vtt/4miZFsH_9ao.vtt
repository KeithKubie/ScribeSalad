00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:04.237
- My question to you people,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.407
is, "How do you spell law?"

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.309
It's K-E-V-I-N.

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:12.011
'Cause I am the law,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:15.314
and I don't want to be mean,
but if you leave me no choice,

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:17.316
then I will get angry.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.920
I am King Kong.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:25.658
Al Bundy ain't got nothing
on me.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.326
Hey, what's going on?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.295
I'm just practicing the way
that I'm gonna talk

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.230
to potential people
that I'ma lock up.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.599
Why?
'Cause I'm a cop for the day.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:34.667
Look, enough about me.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.835
Let's talk about where I am.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.103
I'm in Miami, baby,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.405
and I am ready
to do what I do best:

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:40.773
give the gift of laughter.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.041
This is Hart of the City,

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:44.777
and I'm Kevin Hart,
AKA the law.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.481
I get to cracking heads all--
oh, shit.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.184
God damn it.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.519
Props!
