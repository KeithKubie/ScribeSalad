00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.100
Now that we have a
visual sense of what

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.380
this common tangent
with a positive slope

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.180
would look like, let's see if
we get some constraints on it,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.610
especially constraints on
its slope and y-intercept.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.590
So this line that I
drew in the last video

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.770
here in pink-- it would have the
form y is equal to mx plus b.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.560
It's a line where m is the
slope and b is the y-intercept.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.060
Now, let's think about
what constraints there

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.530
would have to be on m and b if
this is tangent to the circle.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.960
And you might be tempted
to break out some calculus

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.500
and figure out the slope at
any point alongside a circle,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.080
but there's an
easier way to do it.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.610
You just have to realize that if
a line is tangent to a circle,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.325
it will only intersect
that circle at one point.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:53.950
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.100
So this is the line.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.641
What I want to do
is figure out where

00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:00.416
this equation and the equation
of the circle intersect.

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.790
That's we'll focus
on this video.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.330
And then, we'll do the same
thing for the hyperbola.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.540
So we have y is equal to mx plus
b is the equation of the line.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.890
The circle-- they give us
the equation up here. x

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.340
squared plus y squared
minus 8x is equal to 0.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.020
So the circle is x squared
plus y squared minus 8x is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.300
equal to 0.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.320
So what we can do
is we can substitute

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.230
this expression over here-- we
can substitute this in for y.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.540
And then we can figure out what
are the constraints on m and b

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.500
so that we only have one
solution to the intersection

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.136
where we only
intersect at one point.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.510
So to do that-- actually,
let's substitute for y squared.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.160
So if y is equal to
this, let's square that.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.734
We'll get y squared.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.650
I'm just squaring the
expression for the line.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.980
y squared is going
to equal m squared

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.690
x squared plus 2mbx
plus b squared.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.590
All I did is I squared
this expression here.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.770
And I did that so that now we
can substitute this whole thing

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.960
right in here for y squared.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.360
And the expression for the
x point for our intersection

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.280
is going to be x squared
plus all of this business.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.630
That's the y squared.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.990
Plus m squared x squared
plus 2mbx plus b squared

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.080
minus 8x is equal to 0.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.560
And if we wanted to write this
as a quadratic in terms of x,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.850
this would be-- so our x squared
terms are these two terms.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.800
We could write this
as-- let's see.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.410
Let's write this as m squared
plus 1 times x squared, right?

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.420
m squared times 1
times x squared.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.960
And then our x terms are
this one and this one.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.640
So then we have plus
2mb minus 8 times x.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.590
And then, we just
have this b term--

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.890
this b squared, the constant
term right over here.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.990
And I'll do that in orange.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.710
So plus b squared is equal to 0.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.560
So if we knew m and b, if we
knew the equation of this line,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.372
this would just be a
straight up quadratic.

00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:20.830
You could use the
quadratic formula

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.170
to figure out the x values--
where they intersect.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.260
Now, what's neat about this
is we know that they only

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.690
have to intersect in one point.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.290
Remember, the quadratic
formula-- negative

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.840
b plus or minus the square
root of b squared minus 4ac.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.170
All of that over 2a.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.620
And don't get this b confused
with the y-intercept b.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.200
This is just from the
quadratic formula.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.220
That's the quadratic
formula over there.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.150
This will only have one
solution if this over here

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.270
is equal to 0.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.780
Because you're just
adding and subtracting 0,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.790
so you're only going
to get one solution.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.250
So when a line is
tangent to a circle,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.050
it can only intersect
in one point.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.466
Or another way to
think about it--

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:08.900
this will only
have one solution.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.000
If a line intersects any other
type of non-tangent line,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.510
a non-tangent line would
do something like that.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.930
It would either have two
solutions, in which case, this

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.360
is a positive value, or
it won't intersect at all.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.020
And then, this will
have no solutions,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.930
which means that b squared minus
4ac would be a negative number.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.860
So we know that this
is a tangent line.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.540
So we only have one solution,
or b squared minus 4ac

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.010
is equal to 0.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.640
So what's b squared
minus 4ac over here?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.984
Well, this is our
b when we think

00:04:40.984 --> 00:04:42.400
in terms of the
quadratic formula.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.140
And remember, don't
get that b confused

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.520
with the b of the y-intercept.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.520
I'm just thinking of the
quadratic formula here.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.320
So let's do this.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.687
Let's take this squared.

00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:51.520
So I'm just going to
rewrite this expression

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.895
and set it equal
to 0, because we

00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:54.780
know there's only one solution.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.400
So we have 2mb minus 8 squared.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.940
And then you have
minus 4 times a, which

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.100
is m squared plus 1,
times c, is b squared.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.940
And so this is going to
have to be equal to 0

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.175
if this is truly a tangent line.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.770
So let's see any type
of interesting things

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.760
that we can get out here.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.940
If we can express b
as a function of m,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.820
that's a good place to start.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.999
So let's try to do that.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.540
So let's see.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.917
If we expand this out,
this becomes 4m squared.

00:05:38.917 --> 00:05:40.500
Let me do that in
the same blue so you

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.120
know what I'm expanding out.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.880
This part over here
becomes 4m squared

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.650
b squared minus 2 times
8 is-- 2 times negative 8

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.960
is negative 16.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.630
Multiply that times 2, so
it's negative 32mb-- I'm just

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.970
squaring this over
here-- plus 64.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:10.200
So that is that term over there,
expanded, minus 4 times-- well,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.660
I could just expand
everything out.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:20.040
Minus 4 times m squared b
squared minus 4 times 1 times b

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.649
squared is all going
to be equal to 0.

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:26.940
And then, lucky for us, some
of these terms cancel out.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.020
4mb squared.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.287
Negative 4mb squared.

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:30.870
And let's see.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.920
We could actually divide both
sides of this equation by 4,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:43.160
and we get negative
8mb plus-- we're

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.650
dividing everything by 4--
so plus 16 minus b squared

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.080
is equal to 0.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.790
And now, we can solve
for b in terms of m

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.274
using the quadratic
formula again.

00:06:56.274 --> 00:06:57.690
So now we would
have a constraint,

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.360
or we would essentially
know what our y-intercept is

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.230
going to be in
terms of our slope.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.532
And then, we can do
that for the hyperbola.

00:07:04.532 --> 00:07:06.240
And then, we could
essentially say, well,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.010
it's the same line
so the y-intercepts

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.870
have to be the same.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.202
And then, we can
solve for the slope.

00:07:11.202 --> 00:07:11.910
So let's do that.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.805
And you'll see that over
the next few videos.

00:07:13.805 --> 00:07:16.180
Let me just write this in a
form that we would recognize.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.150
This is the same thing.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.380
Let me just multiply
this equation

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.270
right here-- both
sides by negative 1.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.540
So then it would
become b squared

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.870
plus 8mb minus 16 is equal to 0.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.570
I just multiplied
this by negative 1

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.150
and just rearranged the terms.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.800
Now let's solve for
b in terms of m.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:45.320
So b is going to be equal
to negative 8m plus or minus

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.190
the square root of
this term squared.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:57.140
So it's 8 squared m squared
minus 4 times a, which

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:03.690
is just 1, times c, which is
16-- minus 4 times negative 16.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.335
So you could view this
as plus 4 times 16.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.940
All of that over 2a.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.280
Well, a here just 2.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.860
All of that over 2.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:25.500
Now, this is going to be equal
to negative 8m plus or minus--

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.350
now, this is 64.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.740
This is 64.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.513
So you could factor
out the 64 from here,

00:08:31.513 --> 00:08:33.179
but when you take the
square root of it,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:39.354
it's going to be 8 times
m squared plus 1, right?

00:08:39.354 --> 00:08:41.270
If you took the 8 in,
you'd have to square it.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.309
So it becomes 64.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.250
And the 64 times
m squared plus 64,

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.190
which is exactly what
you had up there.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.460
All of that over 2.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.690
And then, we can simplify it.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.700
This is equal to negative
4m plus or minus 4 times

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.420
the square root of
m squared plus 1.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.090
So this is a possible b,
given that the line is

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.940
tangent to the circle.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.740
Now, let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.890
If we add 4, we're
definitely going

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.740
to have-- well, let's
think about it for second.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.030
If we look at the line up
here, the way I drew it-- we

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.805
want a positive slope.

00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:25.680
And in order to do that--
the way I drew it--

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.490
you have to have a
positive y-intercept.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.130
Let me just write it this way.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.480
This is a positive b,
a positive y-intercept.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.000
So we want this value.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.070
We want to think about the
y-intercept that is positive.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.592
Now, m is going to be positive.

00:09:42.592 --> 00:09:44.050
We know from the
problem that we're

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.460
looking for positive slope.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.530
So m is positive.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.720
So negative 4, this whole term
here, is going to be negative.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.220
So our only chance
of being positive

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.242
is if we add 4 times this
expression right over here.

00:09:55.242 --> 00:09:56.700
And actually, if
you look at it, it

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.780
will be positive, because this
is greater than m squared.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.970
So the square root of that's
going to be greater than m,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.550
so 4 times this is going
to be greater than 4m.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.760
So if we add, it's
going to be positive.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.100
So we want to only look at b
is equal to negative 4m plus 4

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.180
times the square root
of m squared plus 1.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.680
I'll leave you there
for this video.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.260
In the next video, we're going
to do the exact same thing

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.760
for the hyperbola realizing
that the line will only

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.520
intersect at one point.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.400
And then, since
it's the same line,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.370
we know that their b's
have to be the same.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.911
In the next video,
we're going to get

00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:35.120
b is equal to some
other function of m.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.870
We're going to get
that in the next video.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.745
And then, we can set
them equal to each other

00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:39.780
and solve for our m.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.780
And then, when once
you solve for an m,

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.300
you also have solved for the b.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.070
And we'll have our line.
