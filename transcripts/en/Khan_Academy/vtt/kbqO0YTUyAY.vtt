00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.240
So once again, we
have three equal,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.502
or we say three
identical objects.

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:06.960
They all have the
same mass, but we

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.290
don't know what the
mass is of each of them.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.260
But what we do know is that
if you total up their mass,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.194
it's the same exact mass
as these nine objects

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:15.860
right over here.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.440
And each of these nine objects
have a mass of 1 kilograms.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.647
So in total, you have 9
kilograms on this side.

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:22.230
And over here, you
have three objects.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.490
They all have the same mass.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.698
And we don't know what it is.

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:26.206
We're just calling that mass x.

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:27.580
And what I want
to do here is try

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.740
to tackle this a little
bit more symbolically.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.090
In the last video, we
said, hey, why don't we

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.494
just multiply 1/3 of this
and multiply 1/3 of this?

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.910
And then, essentially,
we're going

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.600
to keep things
balanced, because we're

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.030
taking 1/3 of the same mass.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.120
This total is the
same as this total.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.740
That's why the
scale is balanced.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.640
Now, let's think about
how we can represent this

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.357
symbolically.

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:51.190
So the first thing I
want you to think about

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.830
is, can we set up
an equation that

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.490
expresses that we have these
three things of mass x,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.071
and that in total, their mass
is equal to the total mass

00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:05.570
over here?

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.500
Can we express that
as an equation?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.946
And I'll give you a
few seconds to do it.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:12.070
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.280
Over here, we have three
things with mass x.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.330
So their total
mass, we could write

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.010
as-- we could write their
total mass as x plus x plus x.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.940
And over here, we have nine
things with mass of 1 kilogram.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.970
I guess we could
write 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.530
That's 3.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.292
Plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:34.000
How many is that?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.542
And actually, this is a
mathematical representation.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:43.295
If we set it up as
an equation, it's

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:44.490
an algebraic representation.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490
It's not the simplest
possible way we can do it,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.130
but it is a reasonable
way to do it.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.290
If we want, we can say, well, if
I have an x plus another x plus

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.460
another x, I have three x's.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.280
So I could rewrite this as 3x.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.090
And 3x will be equal to?

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.180
Well, if I sum up all of
these 1's right over here-- 1

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.892
plus 1 plus 1.

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:03.600
We're doing that.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.807
We have 9 of them, so
we get 3x is equal to 9.

00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:07.140
And let me make sure I did that.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.616
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:12.990
So that's how we
would set it up.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.480
And so the next question
is, what would we do?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.429
What can we do mathematically?

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.220
Actually, to either
one of these equations,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.050
but we'll focus on
this one right now.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.630
What can we do
mathematically in order

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.930
to essentially solve for the x?

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.430
In order to figure out what
that mystery mass actually is?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.160
And I'll give you another
second or two to think about it.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.620
Well, when we did
it the last time

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.244
with just the scales
we said, OK, we've

00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:38.490
got three of these x's here.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.320
We want to have just one x here.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.090
So we can say,
whatever this x is,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.787
if the scale stays
balanced, it's

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:45.745
going to be the same as
whatever we have there.

00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:49.075
There might be a temptation
to subtract two of the x's

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.950
maybe from this side,
but that won't help us.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.190
And we can even see it
mathematically over here.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.630
If we subtract two
x's from both sides,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.174
on the left-hand side you're
going to have 3x minus 2x.

00:02:58.174 --> 00:02:59.590
And on the right-hand
side, you're

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.610
going to have 9 minus 2x.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.860
And you're just going to
be left with 3 of something

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.790
minus 2 something is
just 1 of something.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.856
So you will just have an x there
if you get rid of two of them.

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.230
But on the right-hand side,
you're going to get 9 minus 2

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.370
x's.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100
So the x's still
didn't help you out.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.020
You still have a mystery
mass on the right-hand side.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.430
So that doesn't help.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.065
So instead, what we say is--
and we did this the last time.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:22.190
We said, well, what if we
took 1/3 of these things?

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.180
If we take 1/3 of these things
and take 1/3 of these things,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.680
we should still get the
same mass on both sides

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.860
because the original
things had the same mass.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.818
And the equivalent of
doing that mathematically

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:35.260
is to say, why don't we
multiply both sides by 1/3?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.860
Or another way to say it is we
could divide both sides by 3.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.670
Multiplying by 1/3 is the
same thing as dividing by 3.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.340
So we're going to multiply
both sides by 1/3.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.330
When you multiply both sides
by 1/3-- visually over here,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.520
if you had three x's,
you multiply it by 1/3,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.340
you're only going
to have one x left.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.910
If you have nine of
these one-kilogram boxes,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.130
you multiply it by 1/3, you're
only going to have three left.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.830
And over here, you
can even visually--

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.690
if you divide by 3, which is
the same thing as multiplying

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.200
by 1/3, you divide by 3.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.560
So you divide by 3.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.670
You have an x is equal
to a 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.360
An x is equal to 3.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.380
Or you see here,
an x is equal to 3.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.680
Over here you do the math.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.333
1/3 times 3 is 1.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.320
You're left with 1x.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.420
So you're left with x
is equal to 9 times 1/3.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.900
Or you could even view
it as 9 divided by 3,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.380
which is equal to 3.
