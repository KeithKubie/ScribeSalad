&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:22.950
[ Silence ]

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.250
&gt;&gt; Good evening everybody.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.240
It's very nice to see you
here on this Founders Day,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.040
for this Founders Day concert.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.240
I have two special guests who
we'll be speaking with tonight,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.780
hearing a bit more about the music.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.980 position:56%
First to my right is Michel
Galante who is the artistic director

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.710
and conductor of the
Argento Chamber Ensemble

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.290
that we're going to
be hearing tonight.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.850
And we also have Ann Cleare with
us who is the composer of a piece

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.740
that has been performed
once I believe on Monday.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.470
And this will be its
second performance.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.460
So you know what they say,
the second time is the,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.390
that's when the magic
really happens so.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.200
&gt;&gt; It was just a warm up.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.500
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.450
And we'll also be hearing some of
Michel's music tonight as well.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.790
So we have two composers
and a really unique

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.080
and interesting artist here and
so we're very happen to have you.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.640
Yeah, I thought I'd just kind of
jump into asking about the program

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.360
and maybe, maybe Michel I'll
start with you with some of the,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.710
looking at the first half.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.270
What, what prompted you to,
to start working with Ann?

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.360
&gt;&gt; Well actually, our clarinetist,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.050
Carol McGonnell is a contrabass
clarinetist as well as,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.330
she plays all of the different
clarinets, E flat, AB flat,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.400
bass clarinet and contrabass
clarinet.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.900
Contrabass clarinet is the
instrument that Ann wrote for it

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.080
in a quasi concerto
fashion and she actually can

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.710
of course speak best for that.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.690
But maybe I think you
should speak about this,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.060
because they have a
very close connection.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.410
Throughout history there's always
been very rich relationships

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.050
between soloists and composers and
here we have one right here so.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I've been
working on two pieces

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.980
for Carol since about 2008, 2009.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.960
So tonight you'll hear the second
piece in a series of five pieces,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.930
so the series is entitled eyam.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.840 position:56%
And tonight's has a kind of subtitle
called Taking Apart Your Universe.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.950
So Carol has played
the first piece eyam 1.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.640
It's a B flat clarinet solo.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.140
She premiered that
a few years ago now.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.030
And then this piece tonight
kind of opens up that world

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.410
of that first B flat clarinet
solo into the contrabass clarinet.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.310
And she has an ensemble of about
10 instruments surrounding her.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.020
So you'll see the contrabass
clarinet.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.270
It's a very unusual instrument.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.950
It plays as low as
the piano can play.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.030
So it's really earthy.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.840
So we really worked on the,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.720
I think when I met Carol she had
just bought the contrabass clarinet

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.360
when she played all the
other clarinets for years.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.880 position:56%
So I think we kind of really kind of
discovered the instrument together.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.190
Alas, like really it
has four octaves

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.490 position:56%
from the very lowest you can imagine
to about say middle C. And then

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.720
after that you get higher register

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.950
but through harmonics
and multiphonics.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.000
So we kind of zoned into the
different colors of these registers

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.260
and then the ensemble
that's around her kind

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.550
of orchestrate these further.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.290
So we've worked on the color of the
instrument for a long time together

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.860
to try and give it this
kind of extended life

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.230
that the ensemble gives
to it as well.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.770
&gt;&gt; It strikes me that I'm, I
just got to hear a little bit

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.350
of the rehearsal, so it's my
first experience of the piece.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.450
But it's, it strikes me that
you really kind of orchestrate

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.300
out from the instrument into
the rest of the ensemble

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.200
and we can really hear kind of a,
almost like a [inaudible] expansion

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.090
into that space that's really
lovely and really nice.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I guess I'm
hugely interested in tanbur

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.420 position:56%
and it's something very much I think
of the last century for composers

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.650
to be interested in very kind

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.960
of unique sound qualities
of certain instruments.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.210 position:56%
And because this is, I guess quite a
new instrument and new for composers

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.860
to be writing for it, when you
kind of zone in on different colors

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.810
of the instrument, they also, they
introduce a different sense of time

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.560
or you know, the way the
sound kind of buzzes.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.810
The low register is
so electronic almost.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.280
So that encourages you to, to
kind of think that way in terms

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.970
of orchestration as well.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.030
So it's low register.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.160
I kind of batch with this trio of
bassoon, piano and double bass,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.660
so they're very low with the
low register of the clarinet.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.640
And then the guitar is
matched with another,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.600
the next kind of part
of the register.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.990
And then there's a trio
of flute, cello and violin

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.840
that are kind of the next octave.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.820
And then the trumpet and the water
percussion are the highest octave.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.630
And the saxophone then,
kind of veers into this kind

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.920
of multiphonic, kind
of harmonic area.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.980
So really, I guess
with the ensemble I try

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.040
to almost reconstruct the color of
the entire register of the clarinet

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.910
and just make it into
this huge clarinet.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.860
&gt;&gt; And so you also use the
B flat clarinet as well?

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit of the B flat
and that kind of is trying to kind

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.690
of bring us back to the solo
that opens the series of pieces.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.670
So then this piece then
kind of expands on the solo.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.600
&gt;&gt; Can you say a bit more about the
rest of the pieces in the series?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.710
Are those already finished,
are they?

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.870
&gt;&gt; You hear at the end of the this
piece tonight, the clarinet kind

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.510
of slowly hands its
powers over to the flute.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.080
[ Laughter ]

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.430
So from there the flute pieces,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.290
the third piece is a
solo bass flute piece.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.180
Then the fourth one
is a contrabass flute,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.090
an ensemble, an electronics piece.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.440
And the last piece of the series
will be premiered in February

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.980
with Carol on contrabass clarinet.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.300
The contrabass flutist that I've
been working with Richard Craig

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.460
and the RTE National
Symphony Orchestra in Dublin,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.350
so it ends with the two
contras kind of meeting.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.650
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Actually, I just want to mention.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.760
Professional musicians were
always working and very busy.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.190
And Ann, we had a really
wonderful rehearsal period with Ann

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.520
for the last 10 days
working on your music.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.360
But there's something
deeper actually.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.560
Carol has been our clarinetist

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.300
from the very beginning
and she is also Irish.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.590
And our Argento has gone
to Ireland many times

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.280
and we have a relationship
with this country.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.910
And there's a very strong
of course literary tradition

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.150
with [inaudible] and
Joyce and Yates.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.090
Many, many people who,
it's just in their blood.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.150
And I would love for you to tell
the story behind this, but I also,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.950 position:56%
I haven't had a chance to share with
you that even, I'm always waiting.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.810
I've always been waiting for, to
see this Irish spirit come out,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.250
you know, even suggestions
or even ideas.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.120
I've basically just been you
know, very quietly watching

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.430
for these last two weeks.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:38.130
She doesn't know this but,
but I think it would be great,

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.730
storytelling is also a very
big part of Irish culture.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.790
I think it will be
great to hear the story

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.000
of you know, a little
bit more about.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well eyam is
actually a little village

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.970
in England, not in Ireland.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:58.460 position:56%
But it's one I read about around
the time I started writing the first

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.270
piece for Carol.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.070
And it's just this tiny village

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:08.050
that the plague was discovered
there in the 16th Century.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.790
And this tiny village decided
to kind of blockade itself

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:18.310 position:56%
in from the rest of the world rather
than letting the plague spread

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.070
to the outside the village.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.960
So I just took it as a
metaphor really in terms

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.790 position:56%
of what I was talking about earlier.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:31.590
These different kind of colors,
parts of the contrabass clarinet

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.710
that I really wanted to zone
in on and kind of isolate them

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.020
and then eventually
let them kind of spread

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.360 position:56%
and become one kind of bigger place.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.530
So it was really just
a metaphor that I used

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.060
to get my mind moving I guess.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.430 position:56%
But what's, I never actually visited
the village but I've been working

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.150
on these pieces since
I said, like 2008.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.060
And I always said, when I finish,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.060
the whole five pieces
then I'll go and visit.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.940 position:56%
Because I only live in Ireland which
is like a short plane away from,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.250
like an hour flight
to where this is.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.370
But I just recently got a
teaching job at a university

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.690
in the University of York.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.760
And it happens to be
right beside Eyam.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.060
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.380
&gt;&gt; So I could even live there now.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.180
&gt;&gt; Wow. Five more pieces.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.460
You know, one thing and we can,
I think, speak more about a piece

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.480
but one thing that
strikes me as gratuitous

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.520
with the programming
tonight is the relationship

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.540
between your piece
Ann and the Chirino.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.730
There's almost like both

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.470
of them have a very organic
sort of feeling to them.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.110
A very breath centered
type of feeling.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.910
And maybe yours is more
street tone breath.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.050
And the Chirino is the
vibrato breath or [inaudible].

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.930
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.930
But there's this real sense of
I don't know, I get the sense

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.380
of a breathing entity on stage.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.510
Is that something that
you're looking at

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.810
or do you want to speak to that?

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.010
I mean, I love this
piece the Chirino piece.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.420
Actually for my doctoral studies,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.400
it was one of the pieces I
chose to write a major paper.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.220
So when Michel programmed it
with my piece, I was like wow.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.720
It was, I mean hearing Chirino's
music for the first time,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.720
I was totally blown away.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.360
I think it's, it's so bodily

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.310
and terribly I think
psychological as well.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:53.250
So it's definitely
an inspiration yeah.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.550
&gt;&gt; Maybe we can speak a bit more.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.220
We have maybe you can say a few
words about your pieces that are

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.470
on the first have Michel.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.910
&gt;&gt; You know, actually I think
I'll just say one thing.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.210
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.660
&gt;&gt; In terms of concert programming,
I always, there's a convention

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.980
of intermissions and
I always have had

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.840
for my whole life I've
had this feeling

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.350
that when there's an
intermission, whether we like it

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.150
or not, people socialize.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.690 position:56%
People go out and see their friends,
you know, they touch base with them.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:34.320
And somehow there's a need
to leave the realm of music.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.200
And so I never have you know,
when you accept that there's going

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.240
to be an intermission because we
don't have to have intermissions,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.570
that's already a convention
and when we accept

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.660
that convention I always feel
like well we need some way

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.870
of exiting the world of
music into the social world.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:58.620
Like and usually, so I always
like to choose an energetic piece.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:04.740
And I chose to program the solo
piano piece, because it has

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.360
that kind of energy and some of
the other pieces like Ann's piece

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.160 position:56%
and Salvatore Chirino's piece, these
are pieces that end poetically,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.800
whistfully you know, quietly and
you know, at the end of pieces

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.860
like that, the last thing I
want to do is go socialize.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:28.280
So I tried to end first halves
of programs with energy.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.460
Something that's going to actually,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.590
something so that the
psychological mood you're

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.200
in doesn't contradict you
know, socializing with friends,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.310
you know, saying hi to friends.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.710
You know, so that's the reason
I programed the piano piece.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.760
I'd prefer to leave the clarinet
and piano piece as a surprise.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.950
&gt;&gt; Sure, well maybe
you can say something

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.650
about the title of the piano piece.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:59.760
&gt;&gt; Oh, I think itself, not at all
to be cagey, not at all trust me.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.690
I think it's, it's a
little bit pathological.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.950
I mean totally pathological.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.990
I think it'll speak for
itself, the way, the repetition

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.260
and the layers and the obsession.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.520
I think it'll speak for itself.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, well we have
on the final part

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.870
of the program we have very unique
situation where Ann was talking

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.170
about how she was in
some ways orchestrating

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.200
out from this deep bass instrument.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.620
We have orchestrating in kind of a
thing from Mahler's Tenth Symphony.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:40.270 position:56%
And this is a very challenging thing
to do, I think is a very rewarding

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.220 position:56%
but challenging thing to do and
maybe you can speak a bit about what

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.520
that process has been like.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.890
And you've also done other
Mahler projects as well.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:54.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually, Mahler
is a, is an obsession and I,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.780
I feel as a conductor I do a lot of
you know, Beethoven, Bach, Mozart,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.420
Tschaikovsky all canonical works,
I conduct and love and have loved

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.560
since I was a child and so forth.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.940
But when I'm, I really have started
to feel the last couple of years

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.820
when I, especially when I conduct
normal classical music it's very,

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.190
very, clear to me that it's music
from another time and a place.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.610
It's from you know, if it's
Bach, it's Lutheran Germany,

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:27.560
if it's I don't know, Beethoven
it's from Vienna in 18th

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.010
and 19th Century and so forth.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.450
And a lot of that music is
emblematic of that time.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.030
Some of it's very religious or some

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.700 position:56%
of it reflects post
enlightenment feelings and you know,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.000 position:56%
it's a very, very different context.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.050
Even though this is
great music but a lot

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:47.030
of this music doesn't really feel
like it relates to modern life.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:52.790
It's more, you have to
experience it in a context.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.290
Whereas with Mahler I feel, I feel
when I'm working on his music,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.220
despite the ultra-romantic
surface of the music,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.940
I feel like I'm conducting
music that was written today.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.060
I don't know why, this is a
completely subjective thing,

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:14.420 position:56%
but I feel like this guy understands
modern problems, modern dilemmas,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.130
modern conflicts, frustrations.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.980
I don't know, he just
gets it, modern crisis.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.990
And for that reason
I've been quite obsessed

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.160
with his works for a long time now.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.800
The Tenth Symphony is something
that's particularly problematic

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.350
because it's unfinished.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:43.290
And there's some very strange
things in the manuscript,

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.360
basically when Mahler
died he left five folders,

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:52.930
each folder with sketches and
short score from beginning to end

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.490
of a movement, one of
his five movements.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:02.130
And the second movement has,
has scherzo finale written

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.430
which is a contradiction

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.760
because there's also the fifth
movement is also a finale.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.880
So a scherzo is a contrasting
movement that has a binary form

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.560
and is largely transitional
into a finale most

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.120
of the time in classical form.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.800
So to say scherzo finale
doesn't really make any sense,

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.700
but he wrote this very
clearly and it became clearer

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.140
as I was studying some other
scholars work on this piece

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.760
that Mahler was really thinking of
this piece as a two part symphony.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.520
One part being the
first two movements

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.400
and the second part being
the last three movements.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.100
And that the second movement
really answers the first.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:55.280
So I did the best I could to retain
the spirit of Mahler as I see it.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.620 position:56%
And put these two movements together
as one unit for a listening audience

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.540
for years, so that's basically
the story of the piece.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.110
&gt;&gt; I mean, there was something
that Mahler did in other pieces too

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.410
like in the Fifth Symphony.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.710
&gt;&gt; Three parts.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah and the
fourth and fifth

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.560
or maybe just a little bit
more [inaudible] unity.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.000
&gt;&gt; It's in two parts.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.350
The first is in two parts.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.520
A lot of them actually are bi-part.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.450
Actually a lot of the
symphonies are yeah.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.900
Also does the [inaudible],
five song cycle

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.720
and one massive movement,
it's in two parts also.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.930
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if
I can go back to Ann.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.590
There's, if I can kind of project,
you haven't heard the piece yet,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.280
but if I could project
a bit forward into what,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.580 position:56%
one thing that you're going to hear,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.680
one thing that you
said earlier struck me

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.320
and that was the passing off

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.350
from the contrabass
clarinet to the bass flute.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:59.240
Is that kind of this moment where
you have more of a pitch awareness

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.860
and then the silence is that
that moment or is it more

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.450
of a just a progressive thing
across the entire piece?

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it builds
slowly across the piece.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:18.320
I mean you'll hear so the
percussionist plays a waterphone

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.800
which is this kind of a spikey
small and metallic instrument.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.290
You'll see he's kind of near the
front of the stage at the beginning

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.250
and then we walks back to another
station at the back of the stage

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.500
that has a [tymp] [assumed
spelling] and another kind

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.050
of metallic instrument
that I use as well.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.350
&gt;&gt; You built that instrument right?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I, a
sculptor built it for me.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.880
&gt;&gt; Oh fantastic.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's kind of, it's
also a little bit like a waterphone

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.800
but without the as much resonance.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.300
So when you hear that sound
its, in a way it's a little bit,

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.010
I call it like a kind of
embedded dream in the piece.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.130
It comes back a few times.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:05.230
And it kind of, it tries to
embed this new flute material

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.700
into the music.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.140
And we hear it particularly
then at the end.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.770
So it's that kind of new
percussion material that kind

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:20.030
of brings this flute and clarinet
connection together throughout

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.330
the piece.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.230
&gt;&gt; It's really and make
sure you take a look

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.110
at these instruments are
quite unusual I think a unique

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.750
in a very different sound.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.640
Mostly bows are they, is that?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah they're bows.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.610 position:56%
And they bows are generally prepared
as well so you'll hear all these,

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.450
not just a bow but like
a rippling bow, yeah.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.860
&gt;&gt; And I think that the
spikey one is actually on top

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.350
of the tympanic membrane right,
so that you get, it acts as kind

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.010
of a resonator so that
you can hear it.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of amplifies it.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a very neat
thing so look for that.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.430
Maybe I can ask you both because
I know that Michel I know you have

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.790
to get ready to you know,
do a concert and everything.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.400 position:56%
But maybe I can ask you both about
some upcoming compositional projects

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.240
or other, any, whatever type of
projects that you might be up to

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.950
that you maybe interested
in, maybe Ann.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah well my I guess big
project that I mentioned

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:21.860
of the moment is finishing the
orchestra piece of this cycle.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.790
&gt;&gt; Are there plans to do
the entire cycle together,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.090
performances together?

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:33.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it will be amazing but I
don't know how practical it will be.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.020
Like most composers,
I'm not very practical.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:41.050
So it would involve
like two different,

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:46.740
very different large
ensembles, huge electronic setup

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.140
for one piece in an orchestra so.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.360
If anyone would like to do
it I'd be more than happy.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.690
I'm thinking of proposing it to the
people of Eyam actually in England.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:04.320
&gt;&gt; Actually just to share
one idea with you about that.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.960
There's a, there's a very large you
know, [inaudible], Gerard Grisey.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.600
Grisey was a French composer.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.650
He wrote this massive
cycle, kind of you know,

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.350
in some ways I think of your piece.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.580
His piece started with solo
viola, then it goes to a subtet

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.880
and it goes to 18 musicians.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.570
This is one piece for solo
viola, one piece for subtet,

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.860
one piece for 18 musicians,
one piece for 33 musicians,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.540
one piece for full
orchestra and one piece

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.890
for full orchestra and four hours.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.470
And I've, I actually, I went and
traveled to, did my pilgrimage

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.740
to hear this piece rehearsed
and performed in Oslo,

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.790
2002 with a conductor who's great
at it and knows it very well.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:51.810 position:56%
And the biggest problem was that the
first three pieces were really meant

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.800
for a small space.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.160
And the last three pieces
were meant for a big space.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.250
And this was a really big
problem because it meant,

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.620
I mean really it was
not a good presentation

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.920
of the first three pieces.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.200
It worked for the last three
but the first three suffered,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.060
because they needed
and intimate space

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.500
and the last three
needed a massive space.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.320
And I think this is, so I think

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.580
in your planning maybe
you need some kind of a,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.330
no I think what would be great is
a place that has different size,

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.080
different size venues you
know, in the same building.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.440
I think that would work.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.490
[ Laughter ]

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.790
&gt;&gt; So again if anybody has any.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.390
&gt;&gt; So again if anybody has any
venues they'd like to offer.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.690
&gt;&gt; I'd appreciate it.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.040
And Michel what types of
projects do you have coming up?

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.200
&gt;&gt; I have, okay so now
I'm going to panic.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.480
I have a piece that's going to be
premiered in three weeks and all

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.100
but one movement are done.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:56.190
I work with a choreographer named
Miro Magloire and got a commission

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:01.560
from the O'Donnell Foundation and
he's a fantastic, fantastic person

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.100
to work with, because he in fact
is a composer and he was a composer

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.780
and he studied with
Kagel, so I can speak

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.890
with him the same way
I can speak with Ann.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.590
You know, composers actually, we
don't know what we're talking about

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.210
and we don't know what each
other are talking about

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.870
but there's consensus in that.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.780
So it's like we don't expect

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.380
to really understand
each and we're fine.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:31.120
And with this choreographer, he's
like that I can talk with him,

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.300
in any case we understand
each other.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.580
But I was really only just
because I was performing a lot,

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.610
I wasn't you know, we
like to have a system

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.730 position:56%
where I give him all the music first

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.540
and I gave him all the music
except for a few minutes.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.750
And then he said I'm sorry I
need to start choreographing

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.510
and you're going to get a video
and you're going to have to come

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.810
up with the rest of the music.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:59.160 position:56%
So, so yeah as soon as this is done.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.400
&gt;&gt; Well, this does mark
probably the first time

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.650
that a composer has
ever been this close

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.670
to the deadline without
having a piece.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.470
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah right!

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.760
[ Laughter ]

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.970
&gt;&gt; Not exactly unheard of but, well
why if we have a few more minutes,

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.840
maybe we can take some
audience questions

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.830
if anybody has any questions.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:24.540
I know you'll probably have
more after you hear the works

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.510
but it's a good opportunity
just to ask some questions.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.640
[ Silence ]

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.940
There we go.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.240
There's a microphone
will come to you.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.540
&gt;&gt; Oh, I don't need it!

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.940
&gt;&gt; We need it for the recording.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.840
We need it for a recording.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.450
I have a question for Ann.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.390
And it may be a little bit naive
but I hope you'll bear with me.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:51.140
I wish you could share with us
in a little bit more detail,

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.040
what exactly it's like when
you and this soloist are

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.790
to use your words working
together on composing?

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:04.210
How exactly do you do that?

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.380
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I think it's,
for me it starts as basically

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.140
as just playing a scale
from the lowest part

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.680
of the instrument to the highest.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.620
And I just listen to that
scale over and over again.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.520
And then I start to kind
of explore out from there.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.310
Because as I said,
the different octaves

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.290 position:56%
of the instrument are very different

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.950
as you go higher into
the instrument.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:41.650
And then I, it's just I guess
kind of maybe playing them

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:46.640
in a very traditional way first,
so just with tone and maybe going

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:53.010
into more microtonal, so kind
of in between the semitones.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.430
Then maybe hearing it with
more of a percussive tone

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:02.140
like slapping the reed
rather than just normal play.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.640
And then the clarinet has all
these, especially the contra,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.900
it has all these variations of air.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.500
Like, you can have like you
know, half air, half tone

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.840
and then much more air and
that's still very pitched.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.280
So for me in terms of talking about
timbre which really means color,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.860
you know, there's so many different
shades you can get of one note,

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:35.850
say of like you know, middle
C. You can hear that with air,

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.020
with a little bit of
pitch, with full pitch,

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.170
with a kind of percussive
slap, with a key click.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.910
You know, the pitch is present
in a lot of different ways.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.000
So it's almost I think at first
like building up a little bit

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.350
like a dictionary of what
the instrument can do.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.020
And then from there I
kind of have to go away

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.480
and think what do I really
want to do with that?

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.870
Like where do I want to focus?

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:12.070
Where do I want to put my
focus on and what it can do?

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:16.930 position:56%
And then you go back and you try,
you pick some things and you go back

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:22.580
and try them, so it's just a
process of trying things together

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.640
until you finally find
what is important to you,

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.110
what you feel will really
speak for you, yeah.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.110
&gt;&gt; To follow up on that, do you
take into account what feels,

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.480
even though you're
taking what you just said

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.160 position:56%
into account what feels idiomatic to
a point or what feels like natural

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.200
to the player, do you push against
that or do you explore it that way

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.960
in terms of pushing the player
in particular directions or?

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.760
&gt;&gt; I don't know, I mean I think
Carol, I mean I've heard her play

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.130
so many different kinds of pieces.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:01.910
Like she's a real, she's such a
great interpreter and she like,

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.040
I feel like she throws herself
into the mood of any piece.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.750
Like I've seen her play the
most gentle things to the most

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.770
like outrageously like
psychotic things

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:20.610
to like very classical
to very early music.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.820
Yeah, I, like the first time
I saw Carol play was actually

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:30.110
on television in Ireland, I was
about 17 and she was playing,

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.960
I was about to start a music degree

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.990
and she was playing
Mozart's clarinet concerto.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.360
I thought she just
played it so beautifully.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.010
And I could never thought I dreamed
I'd work with her and I met her

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.330
about I guess 8 years after.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:52.620
And I was like I saw you television
when I was like when I was 17.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.480
So she plays, she plays so much
that I don't feel, I've never felt

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:03.020
like that I've had to, what's
the word like limit anything

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.600
in terms of what she can do.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.160
She's very much like you know, you
it's up to you what you really want

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.090
to do and I'll bring it to life.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.920
&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, we have some more
questions, anymore questions?

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.860
There's a couple over here.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.620
[ Silence ]

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.920
&gt;&gt; Can you both just give us
a little bit of the background

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.880
of how you came to composition?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.370
You were doing music and playing
and how old did you decide

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.860
that composition was
what you wanted to next?

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.670
&gt;&gt; I'll give a really short answer.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:42.970
I, I, because I think
it's actually very common.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.320
I was trained as a classical
musician and I had a crisis

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.540
and that was the way
out of the crisis.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.130
Yeah, I think and I
really think that maybe

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.860
that may be the majority of people.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:03.360
I think that you know, classical
music is, the music is sublime and

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.750
yet there are constraints
about it that make it very hard

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.600
to find one's own place in it.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.300
And I'll leave it at that, yeah.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.670
&gt;&gt; I guess and another
I think very common way

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:23.030
of becoming a composer is kind of
falling into it by accident is.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.040
[ Laughter ]

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.340
&gt;&gt; Becoming anything.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:33.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like I didn't, I kind of
ended up in a composition class

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:39.180
when I was 19 by just fluke.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:45.300
I had, I was in my second
year of undergraduate degree

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.800
and I had went to, I was actually
in San Francisco for the summer

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.180 position:56%
and when I came back I got very sick

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.620
and I missed the first
few weeks of that year.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.310
And when I came back
to the department,

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.200
the head of the department
was like you'll either have

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.820
to repeat the whole thing or
you'll have to take certain classes

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.350
that haven't handed
in assignments yet.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:11.180
So that's how I ended
up in composition.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.760
&gt;&gt; That's profound.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.040
[ Laughter ]

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.580
&gt;&gt; But it was, it was really
amazing because the name

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:23.590
of the class was Making
and Breaking Instruments.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:28.760
And the first piece I heard
was Berio Sequenza for voice

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.230
and like I really hadn't
grown up around composers.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.100
I really didn't even know that
there was still living composers.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:42.000
So the, when I heard Berio
Sequenza for voice I was just,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.810
it felt like a new
world that opened.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:49.360
And I just kept composing
from there really.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.780
But it was something that
suddenly appeared and it kind of,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.730
I mean looking back it makes
sense to me that it you know,

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.920
I've always wanted to
do something with music

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.880
but it was never going
to be performance.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.670
Maybe I felt teaching
but now when I look back,

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.470
before that it makes sense that
I would want to be a composer,

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:16.620 position:56%
because I've always been
interested in sound I've always kind

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.290
of heard music as like
telling me something.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:25.680
I've never seen like music as just
music or just kind of pure sound,

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.020
it's always been something
kind of narrative to me.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.940
So it kind, it makes sense even
though it was something I only

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.930
discovered when I was maybe 19 so.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.500
&gt;&gt; When you're working on.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.390
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.690
&gt;&gt; That's quite all right.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.580
When you're working on
a new piece like this

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.310
with a particular instrumentalist
you're working with

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.090
and you're exploring the limits of
the instrument and perhaps things

00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:00.320
that had not been explored before,
you have a working relationship

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.520
with the instrumentalist that
you can talk about you know,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.920 position:56%
this is what we're going to do here.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.160
And you know this is the
kind of shading that's going

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.890
to be done here and so forth.

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:12.230
But then when you think
about passing this

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.640
on to future generations, you have
to find some ways of notating all

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.590
of this and that has always
been a fascination of mine.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.550
How do you, you know, how much
of your process is finding ways

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.930
of notating that in a way that
will convey to future generations

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.950
that will not have
you as a resource.

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:33.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah that's
a very good question.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.850
And it does occupy a lot
of time in this research

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.260 position:56%
or collaborative time I spoke about.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:45.520
So we'd also when I found
something I thought I'd focus on,

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.990
we'd talk about how to notate it.

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:52.320
But a lot of the sounds too,
you know of the entire ensemble,

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.330
they're, they're kind
of unstable in a way.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:35:00.240
They're these very fragile
timbres that you know,

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.100
in a way I put them there so
they kind, kind of fluctuate.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:09.200
So that fluctuation in a way
is kind of meant to be built

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.460
into the notation as well.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.680
I guess all I can really
do is, I mean it's great

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.830
when you get a really good
realization like tonight,

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:24.200
it really sounds like a document
for the sound that I'm looking for.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:31.910
And then you know, I try to explain
it the notation, the graphics

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.340
and the introduction
to the score as well.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:41.520
But as I said, it's now good to
have a sonic document as well

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.200
that I can give people and say this
is what it sounds like you know.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.440
&gt;&gt; You know, that's something like
I think Lachenmann is now doing

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.150 position:56%
that for his string writing is
having a DVD that goes with the work

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.240
as a demonstration type of thing
so you can have the visual along

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.390
with the audio of just
some of the techniques,

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.780
so that's something you could
also [inaudible] for too.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.430
&gt;&gt; She actually, you made
videos, she made videos.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.730
&gt;&gt; Oh you did?

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.030
There you go.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:16.480
I think we have time for about
one more question if there is one.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.990
If not then I'd like to
thank our guests so much

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.050
for the music we're
going to hear and also

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.570
for speaking with me just now.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.870
So.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.760
&gt;&gt; Ann Cleare and Michel Galante.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.320
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
