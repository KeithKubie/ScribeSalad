Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta and this is
Crashcourse Mythology and today we’re going

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.870
to start looking at pantheons.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.820
Pantheons are families of gods, and those
families are complicated.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.820
Really complicated.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
A whole tangle of grandparents and parents
and uncles and aunts and nieces and nephews

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.750
and a couple of children of mortal women who
were raped and a pretty staggering amount

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.679
of violence and incest to just round everything
off.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.840
They have amazing feasts, but honestly, can
you imagine Thanksgiving with these people?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.810
I mean Thoth, you had a mistress and a wife
and you somehow gave birth to yourself.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.600
How is that not awkward?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:43.780
INTRO

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.600
The pantheons we are going to examine are

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.079
families of deities from cultures that are
usually considered polytheistic, meaning that

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.949
they worshipped more than one god.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.040
In most mythological traditions, the gods
are seen as immortal, and according to David

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.399
Leeming, “they are personified projections
of the human mythmaker’s dreams of overcoming

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.040
the inevitable effects of the physical laws
that require death and disintegration.”

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.040
Yeah.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.040
We went dark pretty quick.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.090
In creation stories and other myths, gods
represent the creative force that brings and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.130
sustains life.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.960
In many myths, gods are “personifications
of aspects of nature and of human nature – the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.420
sun, the winds, impatience, love.”

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.230
Pantheons, David Leeming argues, help us to
explain how and why the world we know came

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.320
into being, and can tell us a lot about a
culture.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.170
Leeming writes:
“All pantheons are ontological and teleological;

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.829
that is they are metaphors for the human attempt
to make sense of existence itself and to assign

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.590
ultimate cause.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.329
To “read” a pantheon is to read a culture’s
sense of itself and of the nature of the cosmos.”

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.020
But can pantheons explain the naked mole rat?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.229
Let’s find out together.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.490
If you thought that I was going to start with
the Greeks, ha!

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.490
Gotcha!

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.590
High five Thoth.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.149
But we’re not starting with Egypt either.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.149
Sorry.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.560
We’re going to start with one of the oldest
pantheons we have records for, the family

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.530
of Gods from ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.500
Sumer’s pantheon represents the most important
natural forces in the lives of Ancient Mesopotamians,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.270
and there are a lot of deities here, so strap
in.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.950
Try to pay attention to everyone’s responsibilities,
and note what kinds of things don’t have

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.950
gods.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.950
All right.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.950
Here we go.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.790
The first pair of deities are the earth goddess,
Ki, and the sky god, called An.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.670
An mates with Ki, AND Nammu, goddess of primal
waters.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.030
An and Nammu’s children are Enki, the trickster
god, and his sister, Ningikuga the goddess

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.030
of the reeds.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.680
An and Ki, the more significant duo, begat
Ninlil, the air goddess, and Enlil the air

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680
god.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.090
Ninlil and Enlil give birth to Nanna, the
Moon God.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.450
Enki and his sister Ningikuga create Ningal,
the Moon Goddess.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.870
Ningal and Nanna then have three children.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.340
Utu, the sun god, Inanna, the “Great Goddess
of Heaven and Earth”, and Ereshkigal, the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.090
Queen of the Underworld.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.120
Ereshkigal’s “husband” is Gugalanna,
the Bull of Heaven.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.560
And Inanna marries the Shepherd Dumuzi.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.120
Dumuzi, it turns out, was the son of Enki,
the trickster god, and his consort, the sheep

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.870
goddess Sirtur.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.730
It may be worth nothing that yes: a sheep
goddess DID give birth to a shepherd.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.590
So that is the basic pantheon of Sumer, but
what does all this tell us about Mesopotamia?

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.890
First it suggests that, at least in terms
of their myths, natural phenomena--like the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.080
earth and sky--take precedence over human
actions and emotions--like love.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.790
I mean, only two of the original Mesopotamian
gods, Enki the trickster and Inanna, also

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.120
the goddess of love, are described as ruling
over aspects of human nature.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120
And the sheep?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.190
Well, we tend to think agriculture when we
talk about the Fertile Crescent, but the fact

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.650
that their pantheon features Sheep and a Bull
rather than a harvest deity might recall an

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.540
earlier life as herders.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.680
Or perhaps the Bull is symbolic not only of
masculinity but also of farming.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.420
This is the fun part of pantheons specifically
and mythology generally; you can read them

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.970
in many ways.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.150
No, Thoth that’s not a joke about hieroglyphics.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.721
And this leads us to our next, significantly
more complex family of gods, the Egyptian

00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:14.721
pantheon.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:18.070
Right off the bat I’m going to say that
the Egyptian pantheon is even more confusing

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.380
than your average confusing pantheon.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.400
But surprise, surprise, it’s also just as
incestuous.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.030
First off: There is no standard version of
the Egyptian pantheon.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.450
the myth changes depending upon who is writing
it.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.450
And where.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.450
And when.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.260
For example, in the story of Isis and Osiris,
our most complete source isn’t even Egyptian,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.410
it’s the Greek biographer Plutarch, who
wrote in the first and second centuries CE,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.700
well after Egypt had become Hellenized, and
then Romanized.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.030
In his version of the Isis and Osiris myths,
he gives Egyptian gods Greek names.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.910
For example, he refers to Thoth as Hermes,
he does still give you credit for inventing

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.160
darts, though, so.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.860
There are also different versions of the pantheon
depending on where you are in Egypt.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.770
For the most part we’ll be sticking with
the group of gods worshipped at the city of

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.320
Heliopolis and headed by Atum or Ra, but we’ll
give a nod to the fact that in Thebes the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.920
pantheon was led by Amun.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.290
And we can’t forget the attempted monotheism
of Akhenaton.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.980
That was classic.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.980
But just to make this even trickier, a lot
of the Egyptian sources we have for myths

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.540
are fragmentary and spread out over thousands
of years.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.790
So, for simplicity, we’re going to settle
on the Nine-God pantheon that forms the core

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.860
of Egyptian religious belief, and it … doesn’t
include Thoth.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.090
Sorry, buddy.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:39.440
Anyway, the Ennead, or Nine Gods, was in place
in Heliopolis by 2700 BCE and is the one found

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.760
in the Pyramid Texts, which might be the oldest
surviving set of religious texts in the world.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.750
At the top of this pantheon is Atum, aka Re
aka Ra, aka Khepri aka Amun or sometimes Amun-Ra,

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.270
depending on where in Egypt you are.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.330
This is why we’re simplifying!

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.230
Atum is the great eye of the heavens and of
creation.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.070
He was the spitter in our Egyptian creation
story.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.880
So Atum’s creative cough creates Shu, the
life spirit, and Tefnut, the world order or

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880
cosmos.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.920
This brother and sister pair mate, and give
birth to Geb and Nut.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.370
Geb is the spirit of life and Nut is an Egyptian
Great Mother goddess.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.410
The two are separated by their father, Shu,
and Geb becomes Earth while Nut becomes the

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.300
sky and the stars, which is a neat reversal
of the whole earth mother sky father thing.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.220
Like their parents, brother and sister Geb
and Nut become the mother and father of the

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.960
rest of the gods in this pantheon.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.570
Their children, Osiris and Isis are probably
the best known Egyptian gods, other than hawk-headed

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.570
Ra.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.420
Osiris, god of the underworld and grain, kind
of like a Demeter/Hades combo, was probably

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.750
the most popular of the Egyptian gods-because
who doesn’t like food and death?

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.370
He dies and is revived, which happens more
than you’d expect, in myth.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.380
Actually, maybe just as much as you’d expect
in myth.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.480
Isis is a goddess of the earth and the moon,
and is married to Osiris.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.940
The mystery cult of Isis was popular well
beyond Egypt, into Roman times.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.360
And if you’re not sure what a mystery cult,
guess what, that’s the point.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.280
The second son and third child from the Geb-Nut
pairing is Seth.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.010
Seth is a god of evil and darkness and is
the nemesis of Isis and Osiris.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.780
He is married to his sister, Nephthys, a goddess
of death and dusk, because you know, if you’re

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.600
going to be married for all eternity, it’s
nice to share interests.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.140
And the final piece of this puzzle is young
Horus, not to be confused with old Horus,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.220
or the guy from WarHammer.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.890
He was conceived miraculously by Isis and
Osiris after the latter’s death, and he

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.360
has aspects of a sun god.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.720
He’s a light that defeats Seth’s darkness.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.970
Most important though, Horus, who is often
depicted with the head of a falcon (not a

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.000
hawk, not an ibis) is the spiritual force
behind the pharaohs.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.410
I know you’re wondering when we’re going
to talk about Anubis, Bastet, and Sekhmet,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.470
but remember, for the sake of comparative
simplicity, we’re sticking by this nine-god

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.470
pantheon.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.970
So what conclusions can we draw from the basic
pantheon?

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:10.380
There are multiple versions of sun gods and
with Ra representing both the sun and creation,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.500
and Horus representing both the sun and kingship,
we can infer that the sun was important to

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.010
the Egyptians, probably as much for its eternal
cycle of death and rebirth as for its providing

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.760
life-giving energy.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.360
Ancient Egyptian culture is commonly said
to focus on death, and that’s not wrong,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.930
although death to the Egyptians probably didn’t
hold the same terror that it does for many

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.930
in the modern world.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.219
I think the most distinct example of this
necro-centric ideal is the pyramids, and the

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:44.470
mummified corpses and jars full of organs
found within them, but also this week’s

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.210
featured myth, the story of Isis and Osiris.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.380
Take it away, Thoughtbubble.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.760
Osiris was much beloved by the people of Egypt;
he showed them how to cultivate grain, gave

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.650
them laws, and taught them to honor the gods.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.450
His brother, Seth, was envious, but wouldn’t
try anything while Osiris was away teaching

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.650
civilization to the world.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.420
But when Osiris returned, Seth and seventy-two
accomplices had a plan.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.180
A plan involving...furniture.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.890
They had secretly measured Osiris’s body
and built a beautiful chest to his exact dimensions.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.310
At a party celebrating Osiris’s return,
Seth suggested that whoever fit in the chest

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.940
would receive it as a gift.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.839
Osiris gave it a shot, and when he lay down
in the box, the conspirators nailed it shut

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:21.310
and sealed it with lead.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.820
They threw it in the river and, it floated
out to sea.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.900
Isis, Osiris’s wife, went looking for
her husband, and found the chest near the

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.330
land of Byblos, where a great tree had grown
up around it, encasing the coffin in its trunk.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.380
She cut away the wood around the coffin and
lay upon it, wailing with such grief and power

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.200
that the king’s younger sons died of fear.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.180
Isis soon left the chest to visit Horus, and
Seth found the coffin while boar hunting.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.040
He cut up Osiris’s body into 14 pieces,
and scattered them far and wide.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.120
Isis, discovering what Seth had done, set
out to search for the pieces.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.290
She found thirteen of them, but not what Izanami
might have described as “his excess.”

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.640
She buried the pieces where she found them,
which is why there are so many graves for

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.980
Osiris in Egypt.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.570
Seth couldn’t find the true grave of Osiris,
and Osiris would be worshipped throughout

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.570
Egypt.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.570
Win/Win.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.529
Except for, the fact that he was dead.

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:12.529
Or WAS HE?

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.630
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.720
This is one version of the story, but in another
version, upon finding the body of Osiris,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.210
Isis and her sister Nephthys wept such a loud
lamentation that Ra the sun god took pity

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:30.290
on them and sent down Jackal-headed Anubis
to help Isis and Nephthys.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:35.680
The two sisters, with the help of Anubis,
Thoth and Horus pieced Osiris back together

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.290
and wrapped him in linen bandages and performed
the funeral rites.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.990
Isis flapped her wings over the body and Osiris
revived.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.960
From then on he became the king of the dead,
ruling in the underworld.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.630
So this myth illustrates some central facets

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.160
of Egyptian culture.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.580
One is the idea of Osiris as king and god,
much like the pharaohs.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:04.730
Another is the role of mummification in Egyptian
life., Or death., or well, actually: both.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:10.300
The binding of Osiris and his revival is a
promise to Egyptians of eternal life.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.130
According to David Leeming, Egyptians, “believed
that every man would live eternal in the other

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:19.839
world if only his surviving friends did for
his body what the gods had done for the body

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:25.900
of Osiris; … as Osiris died and rose again
from the dead, so all men hoped to rise like

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.900
him…”

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.310
This myth also suggests that in Egypt, the
pantheon is somewhat fluid, with gods performing

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.610
numerous roles.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.680
Osiris goes from being the father of civilization
to the ruler of the underworld, a role that

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.330
in later Egyptian mythology will be taken
over by Anubis, while Seth is the source of

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.380
evil and trouble, the jealous younger brother
always trying -- and sometimes succeeding

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.900
– to take the place of his older brother.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:54.320
We have a tendency to view pantheons as explanations
of natural phenomena that correspond between

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.390
particular gods and particular aspects of
nature, like the sun’s rising and setting.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.899
But often the gods resist falling into such
restrictive roles.

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:08.690
And as myths like Isis and Osiris show, it’s
the particular stories that matter to people,

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.440
as much as if not more than who is the goddess
of what and why.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.480
Just ask Saga, Norse goddess of storytelling. We're going to meet her really soon.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.200
But until then.  Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
