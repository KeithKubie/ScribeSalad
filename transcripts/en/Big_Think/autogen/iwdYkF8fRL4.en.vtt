I believe that we are biological beings

I believe that we are biological beings
we are animals we have evolved from

we are animals we have evolved from

we are animals we have evolved from
countless ancestors each of those

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
countless ancestors each of those
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.560
countless ancestors each of those
ancestors in order to pass on their

ancestors in order to pass on their
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.609
ancestors in order to pass on their
genes had to survive and in some broad

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
genes had to survive and in some broad
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470
genes had to survive and in some broad
sense of the term compete for survival

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
sense of the term compete for survival
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599
sense of the term compete for survival
against others and against the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
against others and against the
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.720
against others and against the
environment and had to be successful in

environment and had to be successful in
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.140
environment and had to be successful in
surviving in reproducing and as mammals

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150
surviving in reproducing and as mammals
 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.330

in protecting his or her offspring so

in protecting his or her offspring so
it's not surprising that we should have

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
it's not surprising that we should have
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.799
it's not surprising that we should have
an element of selfishness in us but it's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
an element of selfishness in us but it's
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.180
an element of selfishness in us but it's
also a mistake to think that this

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
also a mistake to think that this
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.329
also a mistake to think that this
competition is a nature red in tooth and

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339
competition is a nature red in tooth and
 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.520
competition is a nature red in tooth and
claw kind of bloody conflict in which we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
claw kind of bloody conflict in which we
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.410
claw kind of bloody conflict in which we
have to kill others sometimes we compete

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
have to kill others sometimes we compete
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.090
have to kill others sometimes we compete
more effectively by learning ways of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
more effectively by learning ways of
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950
more effectively by learning ways of
cooperating with others and then the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
cooperating with others and then the
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.710
cooperating with others and then the
co-operative pairs or groups do better

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720
co-operative pairs or groups do better
 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.760
co-operative pairs or groups do better
so I think there is a biological basis

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
so I think there is a biological basis
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.000
so I think there is a biological basis
for both our competitive and sometimes

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
for both our competitive and sometimes
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859
for both our competitive and sometimes
aggressive instincts and for our

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
aggressive instincts and for our
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230
aggressive instincts and for our
cooperative instincts and what we need

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
cooperative instincts and what we need
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.819
cooperative instincts and what we need
to try to do if we're trying to fashion

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829
to try to do if we're trying to fashion
 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.319
to try to do if we're trying to fashion
a better society in which people can get

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329
a better society in which people can get
 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.700
a better society in which people can get
what they want more there's less

what they want more there's less
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.260
what they want more there's less
suffering is we need to think about how

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
suffering is we need to think about how
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.980
suffering is we need to think about how
to channel those innate behavioral

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
to channel those innate behavioral
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.120
to channel those innate behavioral
patterns into ones that will be better

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130
patterns into ones that will be better
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.550
patterns into ones that will be better

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
for fostering cooperative and productive
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.130
for fostering cooperative and productive
relationships and will not foster the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
relationships and will not foster the
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.050
relationships and will not foster the
aggressive competitive ones

wildermann how people can get themselves
into this mess especially people who are

already comfortably off that they just

terrible trouble and you wonder why it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380
terrible trouble and you wonder why it
 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.370
terrible trouble and you wonder why it
is that the money has so much value to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380
is that the money has so much value to
 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.870
is that the money has so much value to
them or that you know because once you

them or that you know because once you

have a certain amount really it can't
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.860
have a certain amount really it can't
make much difference to your lifestyle I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
make much difference to your lifestyle I

take it that it's something else that's

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
take it that it's something else that's
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.339
take it that it's something else that's
driving them it's it's the desire for

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349
driving them it's it's the desire for
 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.610
driving them it's it's the desire for
public success or status or something of

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620
public success or status or something of
 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.830
public success or status or something of
that sort then must be getting them to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840
that sort then must be getting them to
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.900
that sort then must be getting them to
lose sight of what for any normal person

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910
lose sight of what for any normal person
 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.320
lose sight of what for any normal person
would be a balanced set of priorities

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
 
 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.600
 
I don't think that greed in itself is

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
I don't think that greed in itself is
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.130
I don't think that greed in itself is
ever good I think that the desire to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
ever good I think that the desire to
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.660
ever good I think that the desire to
succeed the desire to have more can lead

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670
succeed the desire to have more can lead
 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.120
succeed the desire to have more can lead
to people being more productive and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130
to people being more productive and
 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.980
to people being more productive and
working harder but I think when it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990
working harder but I think when it
 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.320
working harder but I think when it
actually turns into greed it's not good

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330
actually turns into greed it's not good
 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.390
actually turns into greed it's not good
for the person who is greedy it doesn't

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
for the person who is greedy it doesn't
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.760
for the person who is greedy it doesn't
conduce to their satisfaction with life

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770
conduce to their satisfaction with life
 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.180
conduce to their satisfaction with life
and it's always liable to spill over to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190
and it's always liable to spill over to
 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.740
and it's always liable to spill over to
some of these consequences that we've

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
some of these consequences that we've
 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.250
some of these consequences that we've
been seeing in in the last few months so

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260
been seeing in in the last few months so
 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.800
been seeing in in the last few months so
I would not say that greed is really

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810
I would not say that greed is really
 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.460
I would not say that greed is really
ever good although I would agree that it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470
ever good although I would agree that it
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.790
ever good although I would agree that it
could be a way in which some good things

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800
could be a way in which some good things
 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.820
could be a way in which some good things
happen but I would much prefer if those

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830
happen but I would much prefer if those
 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.500
happen but I would much prefer if those
good things happen because people care

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510
good things happen because people care
 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.820
good things happen because people care
about the good things because people

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830
about the good things because people
 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.740
about the good things because people
care about trying to be use a better

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750
care about trying to be use a better
 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.360
care about trying to be use a better
product which will make people's lives

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370
product which will make people's lives
 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.410
product which will make people's lives
better

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420
better
 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.309
better
that's certainly preferable motivation

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319
 
 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.979
 
I think that people may feel pinched as

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989
I think that people may feel pinched as
 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.809
I think that people may feel pinched as
compared as compared to where they were

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819
compared as compared to where they were
 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.039
compared as compared to where they were
last year without really being all that

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049
last year without really being all that
 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.170
last year without really being all that
badly pinched if they compare themselves

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180
badly pinched if they compare themselves
 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.059
badly pinched if they compare themselves
so to where they were five or ten years

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069
so to where they were five or ten years
 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.780
so to where they were five or ten years
ago so I think I know if it's philosophy

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790
ago so I think I know if it's philosophy
 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.220
ago so I think I know if it's philosophy
