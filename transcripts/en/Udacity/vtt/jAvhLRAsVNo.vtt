[Norvig] It looks like that means that we're going to have to use something more complicated

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
than just this ranking from 0 to 8.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to propose a couple possibilities.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One possibility would be to continue to return integers but to use bigger ones.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So let's take an example of what we want to compare.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's say we have 2 hands that are 4 of a kind.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One has four 9s and a 5, and the other one has four 3s and a 2.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We want this hand to rank higher.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Under the old formulation, they would both be ranked as a 7

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because 7 is the rank for 4 of a kind.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So if we want to change that to use a different type of result,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we could use integers and we could say,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:11.000
let's say, 70905 and 70302,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
so the 9 and the 5 to represent that this is 4 of a kind of 9s with a 5 left over

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the 3 and the 2 to say it's 4 of a kind of 3s with a 2 left over.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We could use real numbers.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We could say 7.0905 or 7.0302.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Another possibility is we could use tuples.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We could use 7, 9, 5 versus 7, 3, 2.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
A tuple is just like a list,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
except it can't be modified and it has a slightly different set of operations associated with it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But basically, it just means a grouping of 3 values in this case.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
What I want you to tell me is out of these 3 possibilities,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
which one of them would work at all

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and which one of them seems best in terms of being most convenient

00:02:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and easy to work with within our program?
