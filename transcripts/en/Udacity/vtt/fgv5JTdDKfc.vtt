Okay, this was not meant to be a trick

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.580
question. Since most women will fall near the middle of

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.420
the risk spectrum, without knowing anything about her, our best

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.540
guess is that she's going to be close to average risk.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.290
This is the same kind of decision medical professionals all

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.000
across the country are faced with when they have limited

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.100
information on a patient. They look at the data, and

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.260
they make an assessment accordingly. As they get more information,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.200
whether from the genes or the environment that may the influence and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.790
push that individual to have a lower risk, or a higher risk.
