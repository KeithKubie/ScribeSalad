you know I spent six years researching
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.170
you know I spent six years researching
and writing this book on nuclear weapons

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180
and writing this book on nuclear weapons
 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.190
and writing this book on nuclear weapons
and now I've spent almost a year talking

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
and now I've spent almost a year talking
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.379
and now I've spent almost a year talking
about the book going to international

think there's anything inevitable about

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
think there's anything inevitable about
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340
think there's anything inevitable about
a nuclear disaster about a nuclear

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
a nuclear disaster about a nuclear
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.270
a nuclear disaster about a nuclear
catastrophe but it's absolutely urgent

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280
catastrophe but it's absolutely urgent
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.549
catastrophe but it's absolutely urgent
that we be aware of these risks and then

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
that we be aware of these risks and then
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.340
that we be aware of these risks and then
we take you know basic steps to reduce

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
we take you know basic steps to reduce
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350
we take you know basic steps to reduce
the danger and that's one of the reasons

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
the danger and that's one of the reasons
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150
the danger and that's one of the reasons
that I wrote the book that's one of the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
that I wrote the book that's one of the
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.650
that I wrote the book that's one of the
reasons I'm still speaking about it a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
reasons I'm still speaking about it a
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.750
reasons I'm still speaking about it a
year later and if I felt that we were

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
year later and if I felt that we were
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.400
year later and if I felt that we were
doomed and I felt that there was nothing

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
doomed and I felt that there was nothing
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.040
doomed and I felt that there was nothing
that could be done about this problem

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050
that could be done about this problem
 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.389
that could be done about this problem
there are a lot more entertaining things

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
there are a lot more entertaining things
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099
there are a lot more entertaining things
that I could be doing with my time so

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
that I could be doing with my time so
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.189
that I could be doing with my time so
there are very simple things that we

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
there are very simple things that we
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.020
there are very simple things that we
need to push for that will greatly

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
need to push for that will greatly
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539
need to push for that will greatly
reduce the risk as long as these nuclear

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
reduce the risk as long as these nuclear
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120
reduce the risk as long as these nuclear
weapons exist in the world fully

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

assembled they're going to present the
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160
assembled they're going to present the
danger of mass murder it's just that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
danger of mass murder it's just that
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.060
danger of mass murder it's just that
simple but what we can do is reduce the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
simple but what we can do is reduce the
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.310
simple but what we can do is reduce the
number of nuclear weapons in the world

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
number of nuclear weapons in the world
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.760
number of nuclear weapons in the world
that's hugely important we can prevent

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
that's hugely important we can prevent
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980
that's hugely important we can prevent
other countries from getting nuclear

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
other countries from getting nuclear
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.010
other countries from getting nuclear
weapons on the last step is we need to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
weapons on the last step is we need to
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830
weapons on the last step is we need to
lock up all the bomb grade uranium and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
lock up all the bomb grade uranium and
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840
lock up all the bomb grade uranium and
plutonium in the world to prevent

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850
plutonium in the world to prevent
 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.670
plutonium in the world to prevent
terrorists from getting hold of it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
terrorists from getting hold of it
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.390

people can get engaged in this issue get

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709
people can get engaged in this issue get
 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.640
people can get engaged in this issue get
active on this issue and may change the

two greatest dangers that we face in
this country existential dangers are

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
this country existential dangers are
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.039
this country existential dangers are
climate change and nuclear weapons and

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049
climate change and nuclear weapons and
 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.680
climate change and nuclear weapons and
the thing about climate change is you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
the thing about climate change is you
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.809
the thing about climate change is you
know maybe it can be reversed maybe the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819
know maybe it can be reversed maybe the
 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.339
know maybe it can be reversed maybe the
harms can be you know reduced but the

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
harms can be you know reduced but the
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.680
harms can be you know reduced but the
detonation of a nuclear weapon is going

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690
detonation of a nuclear weapon is going
 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.020
detonation of a nuclear weapon is going
to be instantaneous and it's going to be

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
to be instantaneous and it's going to be
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.839
to be instantaneous and it's going to be
irreversible and so that's something

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849
irreversible and so that's something
 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.849
irreversible and so that's something
that I think we we really need to be

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859
that I think we we really need to be
 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.810
that I think we we really need to be
focusing on as well as climate change
