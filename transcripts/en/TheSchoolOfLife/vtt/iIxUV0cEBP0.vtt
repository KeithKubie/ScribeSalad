00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:06.620
We are so used to thinking of Jesus as a divinity
whom we accept or reject on the basis of faith

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.900
that we are apt to miss a far more relevant
detail: that he was an extremely acute philosopher,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.080
whose rules on human conduct maintain a deep
and ongoing applicability. One of the most

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.470
salient of his lessons comes in chapter eight
of the Gospel of Saint John. Jesus has recently

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.210
come down from Galilee to Jerusalem when some
Pharisees, members of a sect focused on precise

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.789
adherence to Jewish tradition and law, present
him with a married woman whom they have caught

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.859
having sex with someone other than her husband.
‘Teacher,’ they ask him, ‘this woman

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.840
was caught in the very act of committing adultery.
In our law, Moses commanded that such a woman

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.859
must be stoned to death. Now what do you say?’
Jesus is being edged into a trap. Will he

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.940
say that it's completely fine to have an affiar? Or will the mild mannered preacher

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.760
of love and forgiveness turn out to be just
as strict about legal matters as the Jewish

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.549
authorities he liked to criticise? Jesus makes
a deft move. He doesn’t categorically deny

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.369
the mob the right to stone the woman to death
– but he adds one apparently small but in

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.820
practice epochal caveat to this right. They
can kill and destroy her to their hearts content

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.740
if, but only if, they can be absolutely sure
that they have first satisfied one crucial

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.409
criteria: they have never done anything wrong
themselves.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.469
Importantly, by this Jesus doesn’t mean
if they have never slept around outside of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.259
their marriage, he means if they have never
done anything wrong at all, whatsoever, across

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:49.450
any area of their lives. Only absolute moral
purity grants us the right to be vicious,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.579
high-handed and unsparing towards transgressors.
An important principle of ethics is being

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.909
introduced: we are to be counted as properly
innocent not when we are blameless in this

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.420
or that area, but when we have done nothing
wrong whatsoever, at any point and in any

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.420
Jesus responds
to the Pharisees with what have become immortal

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.060
words: ‘Let him who is without sin cast
the first stone…’ The mob, understanding

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.580
the rebuke, put down their projectiles and
the terrified woman is spared. The real target

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.360
of this story is a perennial problem in the
human soul: self-righteousness. Self-righteousness

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.840
is the degenerate outgrowth of something otherwise
extremely valuable: a desire to be in the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.080
right. The problem is that being in the right
in some areas has a fateful tendency to lead

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.440
us to see ourselves as morally blameless across
our entire lives and therefore encourages

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.140
a particular mean-spiritedness and inhumanity
towards those who transgress in situations where we have been good

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.000
Jesus’s

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.439
point is that the surest way to be kind is
not to take pride in never having done a particular

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:13.730
species of wrong. It lies in seeing that,
inevitably, we too have been foolish and cruel

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.409
at other moments, and in using that knowledge
to foster compassion towards those whom it

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:27.010
lies in our powers to ‘stone’. A world
in which we keep our own wrongs firmly in

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.280
mind becomes, paradoxically, a properly virtuous
and humane place.
