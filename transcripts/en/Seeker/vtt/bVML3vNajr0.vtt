00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:01.539
Save the rainforest!

00:00:01.539 --> 00:00:02.539
And the animals!

00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:03.539
And the ecosystems!

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:06.830
And also save me a chocolate bar cause I have
a feeling this mass extinction thing is gonna

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.929
be rough.

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.509
Hey folks, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.180
In the 3.5 billion years that earth has been
hosting evolving species, there have been

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.960
5 “mass extinctions” where a large percentage
of species die off.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.650
The most famous of course is the mass extinction
that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.650
ago.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.430
The Cretaceous Extinction Event killed off
about 75% of the species on earth, but the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.800
most deadly was the Permian-Triassic Extinction.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680
90% of species went KAPUT.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.820
In new publications in the journal Science,
scientists are saying that it’s beginning

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.240
to look like we are on the brink of the sixth
mass extinction, an era researchers are calling

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.110
“Anthropocene Defaunation”, meaning human-caused
animal decline.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.390
Currently we’re losing about 27,000 species
every year JUST because of tropical rainforests

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.530
being reduced.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.579
Animals are dying off in large numbers - for
instance, the invertebrates like butterflies,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.760
beetles and spiders, have declined 45% in
35 years.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.320
During that same 35 years, the human population
has DOUBLED.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
Amongst vertebrate species, anywhere from
16-33% of them are globally endangered, and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.140
the highest risk are a group called “megafauna”.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.140
The big ones.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.860
Rhinocerous, giraffes, elephants, polar bears.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.170
This group is declining at a rate that matches
extinctions in the past and it’s being attributed

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.740
to shrinking habitats (when they need a lot
more space to survive), climate change, as

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.229
well as human hunting.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.640
It’s estimated that humans have sped up
the rate of extinction by 1000x.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.970
What does this mean for us slash why does
it matter?

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.540
Well, for one, these big animals are predators.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.909
An experiment done in Kenya where they isolated
an area without any megafauna saw the number

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.200
of rodents double.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.310
Two, when the number of rodents double, so
do the number of parasites they carry that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.310
cause diseases.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.939
One of the researchers at Stanford explains
that without megafauna, there is more disease

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.259
that can threaten humans.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.540
Three, it matters because biodiversity ensures
the health of our ecosystems and thusly...human

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.540
survival.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.000
Not just because of the disease threat, but
because of we need fertile soil to grow crops.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.929
We also need pollination of our crops.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.930
No fertile soil or pollination equals no food.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.079
Healthy ecosystems also clean and recirculate
water and air, and they provide the resources

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.840
necessary to produce pharmaceuticals.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.419
Some biologists think that with our habits,
we’re on track toward human extinction in

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.419
later centuries.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.450
Others think that we’ll be thinned out,
but we will survive.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.569
We are the most dominant species in history,
after all.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.919
In the case of a mass extinction, it would
only take aroundddddd….200,000 generations

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.330
of humans to get back to the amount of biodiversity
we currently enjoy.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.099
Thanks for watching DNews folks.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.290
We’ll see you next time.
