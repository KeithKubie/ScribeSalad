1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,950
Well there are a lot of people that
are growing marijuana that are using

3
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:11,970
pesticides and chemicals that are,
that are dangerous. And there was one,

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,280
what was the company that
got caught recently? Jimmy?

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,740
They tested their stuff cause she
put I believe, yeah. So that again,

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,060
cause she punched it with the microphone
and fucked up it cushy punch. Um,

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,020
we had a guy named John Norris on the
podcast and he wrote a book called hidden

8
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,190
war and he started off his career
as a game warden. You know,

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,950
I'm investigating people
that caught too much fish,

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,480
things along those lines and he thought,
Hey, what a great job this would be.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,880
I'm going to get in, get a
job in the great outdoors.

12
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,810
I love the outdoors and you know,

13
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:48,390
I'll get to do some good
for the wildlife. Well,

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,700
turns out along the way they started
stumbling upon these public land Mexican

15
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:58,560
cartel grow operations where they
would grow these marijuana plants,

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,540
just giant plots of them. And they would
use these extremely toxic pesticides.

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,170
And also they would use
poison to keep animals out.

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,340
And they had vats of this shit laying
around and some of the marijuana was

19
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:13,110
actually infested with this shit.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,570
Yeah. Yeah. My friend, uh,

21
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,570
Amanda Chicago Lewis is
this great journalists,

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,270
folks focused on marijuana and yeah,

23
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:26,190
she put the fear of God in me about
those pesticides and carcinogens. And um,

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,640
the other thing is just
like these, you know,

25
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,950
these different oils
that people are smoking.

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,700
Some of them are marketed
as like all natural,

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,980
but they find synthetic cannabinoids
in them. And basically, you know,

28
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:45,450
synthetic cannabinoids like K two and
spice are what they're known as sometimes.

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,300
And those are the people
call it synthetic marijuana.

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,660
But the big difference is that, um,

31
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,770
THC is known as like a partial agonist.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,450
So it will like these receptors, they
will, it will activate them to an extent.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,320
You're chill, it's relaxed.
But the cannabinoids,

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,180
they also interact with the
cannabinoid receptors same as THC,

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,370
but they're full agonists.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,760
And so they make you basically like go
crazy and your heart starts beating fast.

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,450
You start, um, people overdose and
die on these, these cannabinoids.

38
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,930
And um, they, these are
all made in China too.

39
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:29,931
I went into a lab in China where they
made these and they made fentanyl analogs.

40
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,750
They let you in? Yeah, I mean
it was, it was a whole thing.

41
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:37,860
I like wrote them on the internet. I
made a fake email address and I said, um,

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,220
I'm a drug dealer, I'd
like to visit your lab.

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,900
May I do that when I come to China?
And they said, yeah, yeah, that's like,

44
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:49,140
do you have a fake drug dealer
name? Um, I called myself,

45
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,870
what did I call myself? Uh, I tried,

46
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,020
I had this like Skype avatar
picture where I looked like a bro,

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,830
like a 23 year old dude with like
big hair, like kind of a stoner look.

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,200
And uh, they just, um, they
said, yeah, come by. And so,

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,440
so I went to Shanghai and uh,

50
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:13,441
I met this guy at the train station and
he owned his own lab and he asked me if

51
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,720
I was a journalist actually like
pretty straight away. He was like,

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,830
are you a journalist though?
And I was like, nah, like no,

53
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:25,400
crazy question. Do I look like
journalists now? And so he didn't,

54
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,930
he didn't know whether to trust
me. So we went to his apartment.

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,220
It was like the top floor of this fancy
high rise. He's a total family man.

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,810
He had like lived there with his wife
and kid brings a stranger to his home.

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,720
Yep, yep. Meets a guy who
says this is a drug dealer,

58
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,440
picks him up at the train station, says
Hey come to where my kids sleep. Yeah,

59
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,790
exactly. Wow. And so then he showed
me, cause he had there the website,

60
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,470
a lot of these companies in China,

61
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,980
they make legitimate chemicals
and recreational chemicals
and they specialize in

62
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:01,540
drugs that are legal in
China but banned in the West.

63
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,930
So band in the U S so all
is illegal in China. Well,

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,150
in the U S we have this thing called the
federal analog act. And so that bands,

65
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,700
all these drugs even
before they're invented.

66
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,980
So anything that's similar to marijuana
structurally or in fact anything that's

67
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:22,120
similar to opioids is just automatically
banned, automatically scheduled.

68
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,380
But in China they have to do
it one by one, by one by one.

69
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,890
And so fentanyl itself was scheduled in
China was banned in China decades ago.

70
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,490
But these chemists spent
like this when I met,

71
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,760
specialize in this window when something
is banned in the U S but it's still

72
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,430
legal in China, but it's become
popularized on the internet.

73
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,320
So there's all these websites,

74
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,920
these web forums where these like
drug nerds basically are like,

75
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,520
you can't get fentanyl but you can get
this thing that's kind of like fentanyl

76
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,740
and that's hilarious. Drug nerds.
Yeah, yeah. That's what they are.

77
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,770
And like psycho naughts, I'm sure
you've heard of Psychonauts, right?

78
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,420
They specialize in these new,
uh, usually psychedelics.

79
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:10,810
They tend to prefer that have never
been tested on human subjects.

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,070
But this guy was entirely
specialized in, um,

81
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,600
fentanyl analogs and
synthetic cannabinoids. And
so he took out, you know,

82
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:23,440
he had his like fake list on his
website of all the legitimate, you know,

83
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:27,640
like Cialis and you know,
legitimate pharmaceuticals,

84
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,890
things like that. But
as a, at his apartment,

85
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:33,490
he showed me the real list and
that had all these, you know,

86
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,450
it was a cannabinoids, fentanyl.
It was like fake Vallian,

87
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:39,670
like different types of Xanax.

88
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,830
And he showed me the prices and I was
like, all right, I'm looks good. Can I,

89
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,090
can I go see your lab? And so
finally he decided, he trusted me.

90
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,530
He called up his driver
on the phone and um,

91
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,310
the driver showed up and he was kind of
this big like muscular dude who didn't

92
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,430
speak any English. And I was a
little worried. I was like, Oh,

93
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:05,300
this is the dude who's going to break
my kneecaps if when he finds out I'm a

94
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,470
journalist, you know,

95
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:10,880
but I just got in the car and we drove
like 30 minutes to the outskirts of

96
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:15,881
Shanghai and we got to the lab and it
just looked like a regular office park,

97
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,960
like a suburban office park.

98
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,520
There was a fountain in front of the
building. There was like, you know,

99
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,550
you use the key card to
get in the parking lot.

100
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,940
And then it looked like kind
of a new construction building.

101
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:33,880
It smelled like cement. We
went inside, um, we went up to,

102
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,870
to the labs, all the windows were open.

103
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,980
It was the middle of the winter and it
was kind of a strong chemical smell. Um,

104
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,580
but it looked kind of just like
breaking bad, like, you know,

105
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,200
like industrial sized
glass where, um, you know,

106
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,370
beakers Bunsen burners, all that
stuff from high school chemistry.

107
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,530
And, um, he would point, he points
up like basically I had my recorder,

108
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,690
you know, on my phone and I had it,
um, in my jacket pocket just on record.

109
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,140
And so he told me I couldn't take pictures
and so to take notes I would just say

110
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:12,890
stuff aloud. I'd be
like, Oh, that's um, uh,

111
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,530
oranges, a light orange mixture that's
being mixed up by a mechanical arm.

112
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,030
And you say it's benzo fentanyl.
A very interesting. And so, but,

113
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,820
but the language barrier
was such that he, you know,

114
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,640
didn't think I was being too
much of a weirdo that, uh,

115
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,300
I clearly was, but so,

116
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:36,980
but the cannabinoids would w were
crazy. There was like a table like this,

117
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:41,981
like almost exactly this size that was
piled up with the cannabinoids that were

118
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:43,940
there for drying and it was uh,

119
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,960
they were mounds like this high just
sitting right out in the open Zillow like

120
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,210
pot? No, because it's
not a plant, you know,

121
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,010
it's just basically it's a chemical
that's sprayed onto plant matter,

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,200
like dried Sage and stuff like that.

123
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,440
So they try to make it
look like pot and you know,

124
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,920
you can smoke that stuff out of a
pipe or even rolled into a joint.

125
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:11,540
But if you look closely though,
it's very clearly not pot. Wow.

126
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,380
And so they're drying this stuff.
That's what I think that, you know,

127
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,750
they also had like, um,

128
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,860
drying machines they looked like a mad
at or didn't like it when I use this

129
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,491
term. But you know,

130
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:26,540
when you go into subway and there's
the bread baking machines right there,

131
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,710
it looked exactly like that. Why did
he not like that term? I don't know.

132
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:35,520
I think he thought subway would
Sue us or something, but, um,

133
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,790
that they had those and then they had
like big buckets of one pound bags of

134
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,390
these, these cannabinoids and these
fentanyl analogs just ready for shipping.

135
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,560
He said they were sending them to
Russia, to Belgium, to the Netherlands.

136
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,670
And then I think a lot of
times it's repackaged there.

137
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,180
And so I don't know if you knew that
the cannabinoids used to be sold legally

138
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,030
and head shops like 10
years ago. Yeah, yeah.

139
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:02,280
And they would always be
in these colorful packets.

140
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,830
They almost looked like
a pop rocks package.

141
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:09,720
They say like spice spice
and laugh out loud and stuff.

142
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,810
And so I think in Europe
that's where they do that.

143
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,990
They put it in this colorful
packaging. They, um,

144
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,310
and then they ship it to
the U S and um, but yeah,

145
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,080
he was saying that like,

146
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,820
he kept like really close track of
the law and all these countries,

147
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,720
especially China, like they're
scheduling this next week.

148
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,210
So we're going to take all
this and throw it away.

149
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,150
And I thought at first he was
like probably just putting me out.

150
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,990
But I think they actually do that.
Like these guys are businessmen first.

151
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,280
They want to make money and
going to follow the law.

152
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,980
It just doesn't, you
know, it's not conducive.

153
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,820
This is where bath salts came
from. Right? Exactly. Yeah.

154
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,540
Bath salts tend to be Kathy unknowns.
So synthetic Catherine was there,

155
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,910
have you ever heard of the cat
plant? K? H? T? T? Yeah. So the,

156
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:03,770
the hijackers pirates in Somalia,
they, they take that. Yeah,

157
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,140
it's really popular in the middle
East. It's like, it's a stimulant.

158
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:11,700
It gets you really w um, have you
tried it? No, I never have. Yeah.

159
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
But I, uh, grew up in Minnesota though,

160
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:17,130
and there's a big Somali
population and so a lot of,

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,750
there was a big controversy in Minnesota,

162
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,550
whether or not to ban cat leaves from
being sold in regular stores. Is it legal?

163
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,720
I think it is. Um, I think it's not
legal in the U S now if I'm not,

164
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:31,980
but I don't know for sure.
Interesting. But so H a T. S yeah,

165
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,330
exactly. And so the synthetic cathinones
are the synthetic version of that,

166
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,910
like made in the lab, but
they're there, you know,

167
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,840
there's tons of different kinds.
You don't know how strong it is.

168
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,210
And the bath salts, um,

169
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,340
they of course it has nothing to do
with like salts for your bath. You know,

170
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,350
this was a misnomer and they also
wrote called them like incense,

171
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,510
sometimes plant food.

172
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,930
And on the back of all of them it would
say not intended for human consumption.

173
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,490
So that was like the way they got around.

174
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,960
They thought they could get around the
federal analogue act because part of the

175
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:14,010
law says that something is automatically
illegal if it's intended for human

176
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:17,370
consumption. So these guys were like
not intended for human consumption.

177
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,960
Just put it in your bath. Yeah. You bet.
It smells like fucking toxic chemicals.

178
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,160
Yeah. Do you remember when the homeless
guy ate someone's face? I remember that.

179
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:29,010
And they said he was on beta. Yeah.
But that was actually disproven.

180
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:33,810
There was none found in his system.
Cannibal Causeway. Cannibal. I think that,

181
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,550
yeah. And he was just crazy. Right. I
think he may have like smoked some weed,

182
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,430
but yeah, I don't think he had
any thing else in his system.

183
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:46,200
It was just high on life. Yeah. Oh man.

184
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,610
Florida original Florida man. Yeah, it is.

185
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,790
It's funny that one state is so
synonymous with fuckery. Yeah.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,240
And they also had this thing called
Flocka. Have you ever heard of that? Yes,

187
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,550
I have, but I don't remember
what it is. It's more Catherine.

188
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,950
And like if you look it up on YouTube,

189
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,260
there's all these people
going crazy that killed like,

190
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,090
I think maybe a hundred people
in Florida during a time. And um,

191
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,410
the problem is, you know,

192
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:16,180
like the prohibition on drugs causes
people to do really stupid things,

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,990
right? So you have this
cath known like Flocka.

194
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,100
And as bad as that was,
once they banned flock, uh,

195
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,490
the chemist started manipulating
the chemical structure.

196
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,410
So they change one little thing. They
add like a chlorine group for example.

197
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,630
So like a, a chlorine
like molecule, you know,

198
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,430
it has nothing to do with the drug,

199
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,000
but they just added on there
to make it so it becomes legal.

200
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,370
But then it becomes more difficult for
your body to like digest it so it becomes

201
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,070
worse for you and the high becomes worse.

202
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,510
And then they ban that and then they
make something new that's even worse for

203
00:12:55,511 --> 00:13:00,430
you. And it's just like down the
line and, um, and these Chinese. So,

204
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,780
so that's what all these new drugs have
in common. My, my book is about, uh,

205
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:08,560
they're called NPS novel
psychoactive substances.

206
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:11,830
So fentanyl is the most
famous and the most dangerous,

207
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,190
but these include basically like
synthetic new versions of every drug.

208
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,420
So there's, you know, marijuana, the new,

209
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,250
the NPS version is the
synthetic cannabinoids. Heroin,
NPS, Virgin is fentanyl.

210
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,900
There's LSD. So you take LSD,
it's like a wonder drug, right?

211
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,130
No one has ever died of an LSD
overdose. You know, people may have, um,

212
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,130
thought they were a bird or
whatever and jumped off a roof,

213
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,610
but no one has ever overdosed
on the drug itself. But,

214
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,780
but once they started banning, once they
started really cracking down on LSD,

215
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,270
these Chinese chemists
started manufacturing this
new type of psychedelic that

216
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,020
was sold as acid. And so if
you went on the dark web,

217
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,850
this was like in the, like
10 years ago or so, 10, five,

218
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:01,840
10 years ago, you would
search for acid and it,

219
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,120
you would think you were buying LSD,

220
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,010
but you're buying this new psychedelic
that could kill you and did kill you.

221
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,230
These drugs are called N bombs. It's
like the worst name of all time. Um,

222
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,970
these, these N bomb drugs.

223
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:20,860
And they started killing people in
like the suburbs in Dallas fell.

224
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,620
Um, and, and yeah, you
really were a music editor.

225
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,370
Yeah. So, so these kids all, um,
thought they just wanted, they,

226
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:36,520
they did their research. These
were like smart kids who said, Oh,

227
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,850
Alice D has never killed anyone.
Let's get that, this new thing.

228
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:43,990
And it killed them. And so it wasn't
really LSD, it was just, it totally,

229
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:46,570
no note. Nothing in common at all. Yeah.

230
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:54,930
[inaudible].
