well it might be at first glance
 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.660
well it might be at first glance
easier perhaps in an area like ours food

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670
easier perhaps in an area like ours food
 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.130
easier perhaps in an area like ours food
agriculture and so on but if you really

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140
agriculture and so on but if you really
 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.130
agriculture and so on but if you really
dig into it you will also see that for

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140
dig into it you will also see that for
 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.650
dig into it you will also see that for
example agriculture the way it is

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660
example agriculture the way it is
 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.850
example agriculture the way it is
handled today is not sustainable and

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860
handled today is not sustainable and
 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.389
handled today is not sustainable and
that we will have to make major efforts

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399
that we will have to make major efforts
 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.800
that we will have to make major efforts
especially in the area of agriculture in

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810
especially in the area of agriculture in
 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.479
especially in the area of agriculture in
order to make it sustainable one of the

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489
order to make it sustainable one of the
 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.570
order to make it sustainable one of the
main issues is water now you're talking

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580
main issues is water now you're talking
 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.440
main issues is water now you're talking
about energy and the question is of

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450
about energy and the question is of
 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.390
about energy and the question is of
course all the time and main energy is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400
course all the time and main energy is
 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.070
course all the time and main energy is
not sustainable

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080
not sustainable
 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.600
not sustainable
well let me say I personally believe

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610
well let me say I personally believe
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.040
well let me say I personally believe
that we will be not running out of

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050
that we will be not running out of
 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.580
that we will be not running out of
fossil energy because I strongly believe

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590
fossil energy because I strongly believe
 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.149
fossil energy because I strongly believe
that we will invent new technologies you

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159
that we will invent new technologies you
 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.460
that we will invent new technologies you
see we didn't leave the Stone Age

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470
see we didn't leave the Stone Age
 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.800
see we didn't leave the Stone Age
because there were no stones anymore in

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810
because there were no stones anymore in
 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.230
because there were no stones anymore in
this world and I'm quite sure we are not

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240
this world and I'm quite sure we are not
 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.370
this world and I'm quite sure we are not
going to leave the fossil oil age that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380
going to leave the fossil oil age that
 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.620
going to leave the fossil oil age that
we have basically enjoyed for the last

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630
we have basically enjoyed for the last
 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.770
we have basically enjoyed for the last
100 150 years because it will not be oil

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780
100 150 years because it will not be oil
 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.289
100 150 years because it will not be oil
available I think we will leave oil in

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299
available I think we will leave oil in
 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.989
available I think we will leave oil in
the ground because we will have more

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999
the ground because we will have more
 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.120
the ground because we will have more
efficient and different types of

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130
efficient and different types of
 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.730
efficient and different types of
energies so I think sustainability

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740
energies so I think sustainability
 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.660
energies so I think sustainability
should be at a nice business

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670
should be at a nice business
 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.120
should be at a nice business
consideration strategies

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130
 
 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 
the water issue to make it very simple

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140
the water issue to make it very simple
 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.330
the water issue to make it very simple
is a falling one yeah yeah we need about

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340
is a falling one yeah yeah we need about
 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.420
is a falling one yeah yeah we need about
five liters of water to be able to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430
five liters of water to be able to
 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.630
five liters of water to be able to
sustain our life we need about 20 litres

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640
sustain our life we need about 20 litres
 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.840
sustain our life we need about 20 litres
25 litres for minimum hygiene this is 25

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850
25 litres for minimum hygiene this is 25
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.870
25 litres for minimum hygiene this is 25
litres okay this is what what I would

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880
litres okay this is what what I would
 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.440
litres okay this is what what I would
call is a social product and there's a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450
call is a social product and there's a
 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.180
call is a social product and there's a
social product you can also call it it

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190
social product you can also call it it
 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.600
social product you can also call it it
is even human rights now that is one

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610
is even human rights now that is one
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.420
is even human rights now that is one
thing but then we are using about 200 to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430
thing but then we are using about 200 to
 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.630
thing but then we are using about 200 to
5 to 500 liters water per capita and per

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
5 to 500 liters water per capita and per
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.880
5 to 500 liters water per capita and per
day for the other things it in our

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890
day for the other things it in our
 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.490
day for the other things it in our
household which is for car washing for

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
household which is for car washing for
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.150
household which is for car washing for
dish washing for the gardens and so on

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160
dish washing for the gardens and so on
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.390
dish washing for the gardens and so on
now this part already I don't think is a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400
now this part already I don't think is a
 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.550
now this part already I don't think is a
human right I think this is we are using

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
human right I think this is we are using
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.040
human right I think this is we are using
a commercial good that should have a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050
a commercial good that should have a
 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.780
a commercial good that should have a
good price because if it has a good

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
good price because if it has a good
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.120
good price because if it has a good
price we are going to take care of it a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130
price we are going to take care of it a
 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.770
price we are going to take care of it a
little bit better now

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
little bit better now
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.090
little bit better now
household alone only takes 10 percent of

household alone only takes 10 percent of
 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.690
household alone only takes 10 percent of
the total freshwater withdrawal so we

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700
the total freshwater withdrawal so we
 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.360
the total freshwater withdrawal so we
are talking here 10 percent 20 percent

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
are talking here 10 percent 20 percent

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870
of the water
 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.080
of the water
fresh water is being be strong for

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
fresh water is being be strong for
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.600
fresh water is being be strong for
industry for production for energy

construction so and so on and 70 percent
 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.789
construction so and so on and 70 percent
of all fresh water is withdrawn for

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799
of all fresh water is withdrawn for
 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.710
of all fresh water is withdrawn for
agriculture

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
agriculture
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.410
agriculture
now agriculture uses ninety-three

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
now agriculture uses ninety-three
 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.840
now agriculture uses ninety-three
percent of all fresh water because

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850
percent of all fresh water because
 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.080
percent of all fresh water because
industry and households give a big part

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
industry and households give a big part
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.940
industry and households give a big part
of the water back they have to be

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950
of the water back they have to be
 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.030
of the water back they have to be
treated but they come they come back in

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040
treated but they come they come back in
 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.970
treated but they come they come back in
the in the in the agriculture we use it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
the in the in the agriculture we use it
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.060
the in the in the agriculture we use it
basically for the production of food so

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
basically for the production of food so
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.710
basically for the production of food so
while we are drinking five litres of

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720
while we are drinking five litres of
 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.560
while we are drinking five litres of
water per day and we are using 20 liters

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570
water per day and we are using 20 liters
 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.900
water per day and we are using 20 liters
of water for minimum hygiene we are

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910
of water for minimum hygiene we are
 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.660
of water for minimum hygiene we are
eating every single day somewhere

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670
eating every single day somewhere
 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.479
eating every single day somewhere
between 3,000 to 6,000 liter of water

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489
between 3,000 to 6,000 liter of water
 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.690
between 3,000 to 6,000 liter of water
because we need one litre for the pro

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700
because we need one litre for the pro
 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.300
because we need one litre for the pro
calorie that we eat if that calorie

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
calorie that we eat if that calorie
 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.289
calorie that we eat if that calorie
comes from vegetable so from grain but

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299
comes from vegetable so from grain but
 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.449
comes from vegetable so from grain but
if this one calorie comes from an animal

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459
if this one calorie comes from an animal
 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.289
if this one calorie comes from an animal
we need ten liters of water so therefore

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299
we need ten liters of water so therefore
 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.509
we need ten liters of water so therefore
the most important part in the water

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519
the most important part in the water
 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.890
the most important part in the water
issue is to see how

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900
issue is to see how
 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.780
issue is to see how
we are using water and agriculture

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790
we are using water and agriculture
 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.539
we are using water and agriculture
that's where we have to look at and

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549
that's where we have to look at and
 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.729
that's where we have to look at and
unfortunately we are using water and

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739
unfortunately we are using water and
 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.979
unfortunately we are using water and
agriculture in a very very inefficient

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989
agriculture in a very very inefficient
 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.059
agriculture in a very very inefficient
way why well one of the main reason is

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069
way why well one of the main reason is
 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.759
way why well one of the main reason is
that water in most parts of the world

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769
that water in most parts of the world
 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.960
that water in most parts of the world
for agriculture is a free good and

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
for agriculture is a free good and
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.029
for agriculture is a free good and
doesn't have any price

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039
doesn't have any price
 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.710
doesn't have any price
so in today's world already we are

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720
so in today's world already we are
 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.140
so in today's world already we are
overusing water in a substantial manner

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150
overusing water in a substantial manner
 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.930
overusing water in a substantial manner
we have several big rivers Rio Grande

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940
we have several big rivers Rio Grande
 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.210
we have several big rivers Rio Grande
I'm sorry which are not bringing one

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220
I'm sorry which are not bringing one
 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.969
I'm sorry which are not bringing one
drop of water into the oceans because

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979
drop of water into the oceans because
 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.330
drop of water into the oceans because
agriculture is using it in a non

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340
agriculture is using it in a non
 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.760
agriculture is using it in a non
