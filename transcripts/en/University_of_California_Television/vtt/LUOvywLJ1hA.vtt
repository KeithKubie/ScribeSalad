00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:21.540
of fire, tools and language but still
trying to understand ourselves, aware that

death is inevitable yet filled with
optimism. We grow up slowly, we hand down

- [David] Before we get to the question
and answer session, I'd like to say just a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:14.090
few words about the range of things that
have come up in this symposium. As Roger

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:23.150
said at the beginning, we decided to make
our focus not how did language begin but

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.650
how did language come to have the form it
has and we've included some other things

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:40.810
that we think go along with that. One
thing that we've seen today is the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.980
outstanding array of different types of
language that have either been studied in

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:57.710
some depth or mentioned in passing and
that have come up in this symposium. We

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:07.840
particularly wanted to include both spoken
and sign languages and take advantage of

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:17.070
the fact that sign languages, being so
much younger than spoken languages, afford

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.450
us a chance to see language at earlier
stages of its development, than we can get

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:35.960
very readily in spoken languages. We saw
that new linguistic forms emerge in spoken

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:48.910
language as well in Carmel O'Shannessy's
talk where we sew how children in this

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.170
Australian community have put together
bits and pieces of languages used around

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.410
them and created something entirely new.
There were references to pidgins and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:14.070
creoles and other such newly arising types
of language as well as two brand new

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.770
languages like the Central Taurus Sign
Language and the Al Sayyid Bedouin sign

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:31.190
language in southern Israel. All of these
things there's such a wide range of

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.020
different types of language sprouting up
around us in different parts of the world

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.700
and offer us a chance to see languages at
the very earliest stages, yet we must keep

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.760
in mind that this is not the same thing as
what the earliest stages of human language

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:02.130
must have been like. For all of these are
languages spoken or signed by individuals

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:11.510
with modern human brains and that's
probably a very big difference, and the

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:24.310
last talks on language in the brain
provided three different perspectives on

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:33.110
what the brain is doing in use of language
or when the individual is doing linguistic

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:43.270
tasks as well as particularly in professor
Mayberry's talk. How exposure to language,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:53.620
to any language, in the early years, the
earliest years of life is essential to

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:03.280
being able to fully master and acquire a
human language.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:17.500
So with that I think I will conclude these
remarks and turn now to the questions that

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.720
you have written down and have been
collected.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.620
- [Roger] So this is very exiting, as you
know we've just had nine wonderful talks

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.880
and we have way more than nine wonderful
questions but we'll do our best, we'll see

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.530
what we can get through. So the first
question of many many great questions. . .

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.870
thank you all for excellent questions
that you asked, this is for Ann Senghas.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.948
The question is just sort of a merger of
several different questions, but the

00:06:56.948 --> 00:07:03.572
general question is, “What was there
before the first cohort of Nicaraguan Sign

00:07:03.572 --> 00:07:11.068
Language speakers, what was the setting in
which this emerged?” And also, “With

00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:14.924
successive cohorts, what is the
relationship between the ability to

00:07:14.924 --> 00:07:19.249
communicate between cohorts?” So is it the
case that successive cohorts are able to

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:23.309
communicate with their predecessors but
not vice-versa and could you give us more

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:24.986
information on that?

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:29.055
- [Ann] So the first question of what came
before, what did people have before. If

00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:37.879
you meet deaf people in Nicaragua who are
over the age of 50, these are people who

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:41.666
were language-less in childhood right.
These are people who are the kind of

00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:47.670
people that Rachel was talking about. But
some of them encountered the sign language

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:54.746
late in life and some of them did not. And
so, the people that I've met who preceded

00:07:54.746 --> 00:08:00.146
that first cohort really range in their
ability to participate as members of the

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.330
society that these are people who were
language-less.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:10.300
They vary in how much they developed a
home sign system that Ray Jackendoff

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:18.160
eluded to that these simple systems that
have some of the elements of language that

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.270
they might developed with their families
some deaf people develop those and some

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.760
people don't. So, they really are variable
unlike people who are exposed to language

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.440
who aren't variable they all kind of can
use their language. And then the ability

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.680
to communicate across cohorts is a really
interesting one, I have lots of fun videos

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.620
of that and the kinds of miscommunications
that can occur. But to give you a flavor

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.670
for it, it's kind of like interacting with
someone like if you're a younger signer

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.080
interacting with an older signer or
someone from an earlier cohort, think of

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.900
that, the younger signers are more
specific they mark things more

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.190
specifically, they make more distinctions
in their language. So some of those

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.190
distinctions aren't processed by the older
signers like if you're signing something

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.580
in one location versus another that
doesn't mean anything to an older signer.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.090
So it's kind of like someone's speaking a
language without any of the morphology.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.370
You can get a lot of stuff across, you can
use context they don't notice most of the

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.500
time that they're using different forms,
but when you push them on a really hard

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.270
task where you have to make a certain kind
of distinction with minimal pairs they. .

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.190
.the sense that seems ambiguous to an
older signer will be more specific to a

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:38.280
younger signer. It's kinda like talking to
a non-native speaker of English maybe or

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.430
if you have a grandmother who knows
Italian and you speak English with her and

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:48.900
her English isn't like yours but you don't
notice it most of the time, she's a late

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.330
learner of English and I think it feels
like that to them. The older signers think

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.130
the younger signers are kind of fast and
messy, and they're screwing the language

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:05.140
up and they make these signs that are
sloppy, and they drop certain important

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:13.000
things and they put the words in all these
funny orders where things get ambiguous.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.960
- Thank you very much. So the next
question I'd like to. . . this is also a

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.950
merger of a couple of questions, this is
for Simon Kirby. So the question generally

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.860
is that “One thing that is not present in
the experiments that you reported is

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.710
social interaction between people, so this
is very single speaker, single generation

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:39.274
to next speaker, next generation and what
are your thoughts on. . . are there

00:10:39.274 --> 00:10:43.397
important dimensions of the nature of
evolution of language that we can't

00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:46.275
capture without that kind of social
interaction within generations?” So just

00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:49.000
could you have a few comments on that?

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:55.995
- [Simon] That's a great question. So when
we started doing these experiments we were

00:10:55.995 --> 00:11:00.743
just interested in this iterate learning
process and that first experiment I showed

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:05.068
you where we just ended up with just a
smaller and smaller number of words, and

00:11:05.068 --> 00:11:09.303
in some cases get this incredibly
degenerate language which only has one

00:11:09.303 --> 00:11:13.830
word for everything. That language is
amazingly learnable, it's very easy to

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:19.284
learn a language where you just say Ug
for everything. So we had to put in this

00:11:19.284 --> 00:11:24.821
kind of hack into the experiment where we
filtered out those ambiguous items in sort

00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:30.450
of secret between each generation. But of
course, there's a much more sensible way

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.399
of doing that which we've then gone on to
do which is to add in communication. So

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:40.447
the experiments that we're doing now in
Edinburgh nearly exclusively involve

00:11:40.447 --> 00:11:46.713
interaction as well. So we have two
individuals who learn their language from

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:51.328
the previous generation and then interact
in some kind of communicative task and

00:11:51.328 --> 00:11:58.286
then the output of that is fed on to the
next generation, and our current models

00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:01.910
and experiments and our theory is that you
need both.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:09.040
So you need learning which leads to
simplification of structure and you need

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:15.020
communication that leads to a pressure to
be expressive. And when there's this

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.560
pressure to be simple plus a pressure to
be expressive, that's the sweet spot that

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.920
gives you linguistic structure. So I think
it's really. . . linguistic structure is

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:32.090
the product of a kind of tug of war
between these two processes: wanting to be

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.610
expressive with your language but also the
language needing to be learn-able by the

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.330
next generation.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.020
- Thank you, so the third question is for
Rachel Mayberry. The question is, “Have

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:55.560
you studied how the teenagers in your
sample who didn't have the exposure to

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.010
early language performed on non-linguistic
tasks?” So what's the relationship between

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.070
performance in linguistic and
non-linguistic tasks?

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.070
- [Rachel] Well, depends on what kind of
linguistic, non-linguistic task you're

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:12.530
talking about. They're very very good at
picture arrangement and so, the elements

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:18.450
of a story, putting them together they're
quite good at that. One of the teens is a

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:24.020
fantastic drawer, he just makes beautiful
drawings and paintings. Another of the

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:31.400
teens is fascinated with maps, they have
no problems navigating, driving, doing

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.910
tasks like this. Math skills are very very
low, reading they're illiterate. Those are

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:42.820
the language skills. But for the. . . and
we haven't really looked at a range of

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.470
non-linguistic tasks.

00:13:48.136 --> 00:13:51.470
- Thank you, so the next question is for
David Perlmutter, I think this is a really

00:13:51.650 --> 00:14:00.000
neat question. “How do sign languages
rhyme?”

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:10.310
- Well, this question obviously comes from
someone who's language is one where rhyme

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:18.770
is a prominent feature of poetry. As it
happens I actually published a paper on

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:26.000
poetry in sign language and one of the
questions I addressed. . . it's starts out

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:33.420
as an analysis in depth of one particular
poem and then I go on to discuss the

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:46.550
question of how do different languages
differ with respect to the resources they

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:53.280
put at the disposal of their poets? And in
particular when there's a difference in

00:14:53.460 --> 00:15:00.000
modality between a spoken language and a
sign language, how do spoken and sign

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:08.180
languages differ in the resources they
give their poets for poetic expression?

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:16.850
And so, one of-- I don't talk about rhyme
as such but I analyze in depth the

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:23.950
structure of this particular poem and the
types, the ways the poet uses ASL for

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:35.000
poetic effects. And particularly uses of
resources that ASL puts at his disposal

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:43.500
that are quite unlike anything in spoken
language. Let me just say that I was

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.590
amazed at the richness and depth I
discovered in the one poem I analyzed in

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:56.350
detail, I can recite a poem in Russian, in
French, in German whatever. I cannot

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:03.090
recite a poem in ASL because things are
going on simultaneously with the hands,

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:09.940
the body, the face facial expressions.
And though I sign at a very elementary

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:18.780
level with deaf signers I simply can't do
all those things at once that are required

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.830
for poetic effects, that are used for
poetic effects in this particular poem. So

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:32.710
that's my answer. If you're interested, I
can tell you where to find this paper or

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:38.300
provide it to you if you're interested.
Come up and see me afterwards. All right

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:45.660
let's try another question to Ray
Jackendoff. “Why would languages ever

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:53.230
develop more complexity, embedding, etc?
If language evolves, what is the source of

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:59.660
pressure for them to become more complex,
i.e.beyond linear grammar?”

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:08.190
- [Ray] It's a good question that I've
asked my self about a lot, it actually

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:14.510
relates to David's answer to the last
question. So all of these strategies that

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:21.530
we have with agreement and tenses, and
relative clauses, and concessive clauses

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:29.340
and all this sort of thing give us extra
dimensions of expressivity that we can do

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:37.190
all at once. So instead of just saying
“boy kiss love girl” or something like

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.780
that, we can say, “Well, we're focusing on
what the boy is doing, he's kissing the

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.680
girl,” and that 'he love' is kind of
backgrounded and that's conveyed by

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:53.940
putting it in the relative clause. We can
make distinct-- and different languages

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.170
make different distinctions of what kinds
of things they express grammatically. So

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:04.600
some languages will have some little
operator on a verb that will tell you

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.680
whether you actually saw this event
yourself or somebody told you about it,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.310
they're called evidentials.
They seem to be things that people want to

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:21.530
express and to do it in a linear language,
you have to say I know da, da, da and it's

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:29.010
more efficient in a way in expression to
just put it as a suffix. Now what I think

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.990
if this is right that linear languages
were sort of an earlier stage in evolution

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:41.450
of the human language capacity, it took
some extra tweak in the genetics to make

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:47.580
us capable of learning languages of this
more complex sort. Again, I don't have any

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:56.010
evidence to that. It's sort of a working
hypothesis in terms of which you can

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:01.090
reevaluate a lot of the things that we
have been studying over the years.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:08.370
- Great. Thank you very much, so this is
another merger question to Edward Chang.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:14.750
So let me phrase it the following way, so
we know that children are actually born

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:20.600
with the ability to perceive more sound
differences than adults can and so we

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:28.900
actually lose perceptual distinctions over
time as we acquire a native language. And

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:37.720
do you think that part of what you're
seeing may actually be the outcome of some

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:42.850
kind of synaptic pruning that may take
place earlier on in childhood developments

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:48.600
as the end product. A related question is
do you have data on speakers of other

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:55.790
languages? If so, are there differences
for example, is the hierarchical

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:02.450
organization of phonemes different?
So for example, the placement of nasals

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.400
with vowels rather than with consonants.
And if not, what would you speculate will

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.550
be you'd be likely to see another
languages?

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:16.800
- [Edward] I think that that's a wonderful
question and one that we often hear a lot

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.430
about because it's one of the most
remarkable things about the acquisition of

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:28.390
phonological systems is their sensitivity
to language environment. And so, that's a

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.740
natural one for us to look at and there's
a lot of properties in the neural

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.870
recordings that we see that seem like
they're specialized for the English

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.140
language not in work that I presented
today, but in previous work we've

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.700
demonstrated that for example, you can see
evidence of categorical type of responses

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:53.760
to place of articulation cues like Ba, Da,
Ga those kind of sounds in the superior

00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:00.350
temporal gyrus and that's one that we're
pursuing. So one. . . can we look at that

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:05.510
same distinction between Ra and R and L
sound Ra, La one that's very well formed

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:11.540
in English listeners but loses distinction
in some Asian language. So that's work in

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.320
progress.
But I think that the way I see it is that

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.230
a lot of the way the phonological systems
are actually organized is very much driven

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:28.250
by our acoustic sensitivities. And so,
what I would predict is that the major

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.700
principles of that taxonomy or that
organization that we found actually will

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.570
probably exist for almost all speech
sounds, but where there are these more

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:47.160
subtle distinctions and place of
articulation is a very good example the Ra

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.700
versus La distinctions is another one.
These are more subtle ones that are very

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.910
language specific. So I think we're going
to see a very nuanced kind of answer to it

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:01.540
where there are certain things are going
to be universally observed across

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:08.860
listeners of different experiences.
But there will be some refinement of that

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.820
basic organization and that will probably
be reflected in its neural activity

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.100
patterns.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.450
- Okay, this one is about age of
acquisition presumably for doctor

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:27.470
Mayberry. “Given the great influence age
has on language acquisition, would

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.820
acquisition of a second language at an
early age enable the acquisition of a

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.110
third language in adulthood?” And another
one also for doctor Mayberry, “Do you

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:51.990
think you can use these patterns you've
discovered for clinical applications?”

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:58.400
- Regarding age of acquisition effects on
second language learning. We don't really

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:05.340
have a lot of research looking at if you
know two languages will it help you learn

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.990
three, will help you learn four?
Presumably the answer is yes, but people

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:13.960
are only starting to study this question.
The other thing about age of acquisition

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:20.060
effects in second language learning is
that they are variable such that how well

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.670
one can learn to speak a second language
depends upon the overlap, the language

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.560
families that the two languages are from.
And what seems to be a really important

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.470
variable in second language learning is
how much education you've received in your

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.840
second language. So it is quite possible
for people to learn a second language at

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.090
near native levels if they're immersed in
it, if they use it a lot and in fact some

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.190
second language learners their language
dominant shifts. So that they're more

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.400
comfortable in their second language than
they are in the first language as a

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.610
function of how much they speak the
language, but I think this notion of

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.740
polyglots and people who speak a lot of
languages, how do we tease apart

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:05.790
linguistic talent from actually just going
at it and learning a lot of languages and

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.360
becoming familiar with the structures of
languages so that you can learn them, we

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.900
really don't know a lot about that.
The second question in terms of clinical

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.470
applications, I do actually think that
this work has a lot of clinical

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:24.770
applications. I think that we're getting
to the point where we can characterize how

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:30.640
much language and what kind of language a
child should have by a certain age to

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.010
insure that the child is on an upward
trajectory for acquiring language.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:40.520
Likewise, I think that same kind of
information we can use to see weather some

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:46.400
children are actually in jeopardy of not
acquiring language. And the third aspect

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.330
of this, although there are many many
more, is that now that we know that these

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:56.450
young people who don't have language are
in jeopardy of not having language at all,

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:02.440
we're in a better position to develop
crisis intervention so of speak. You know,

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.940
it's an emergency, somebody doesn't have
language we need to get them as much

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.500
language as possible and we can have some
idea of where we might start in that

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.560
particular kind of training but there's
clearly much much work that needs to be

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.550
done.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:21.620
- And here's the question for doctor
Fedorenko that I thought I had in my hand

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:29.180
before. “Music shares many features with
language structures and texts, etc. Do

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.250
people with extensive musical training
show different responses in linguistic

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:42.000
regions when listening to or producing
music compared to non-musical people?

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:51.510
Would they respond to violation of a
musical 'rule' eg: key signature in a

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:56.860
similar way to how others might respond to
a grammatical error for example?”

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.910
- [Evelina] So let me start with the
second one.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.400
So the second question is asking about
these violation of structure paradigms I

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:11.190
have been used a lot in studying structure
perception in music. So it's where

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:16.940
basically you hear sequence of tones or
chords and then there's an expected chord

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.400
or note with respect to your knowledge of
the tonal structure. And people notice

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.730
these, you can find markers of these using
both kind of electrophysiology methods and

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:34.890
brain imaging methods. And it turns out
that the kinds of markers you get for

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.830
these errors are actually quite similar to
what you get for errors when you

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.830
encountered ungrammaticality in language.
Okay, so that's part of the evidence that

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.990
people have used to argue for overlap
between language and music.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:51.730
There's a big problem with that line of
work and some of you may be arriving at

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.560
this already. And that is: there's a lot
of things that's shared between language

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.280
and music in these paradigms in addition
to the fact that they may share

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.260
similarities at the level of complex
hierarchical structure. That is you

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.490
encounter surprising events, you pay
attention, you may need to update your

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.650
representations, it's a learning event.
And indeed, whenever people have tried to

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.800
use control conditions to test for these
kinds of lower level violations like in

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.900
Stephen Kotia's work,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.010
he often uses instrument change
condition. So the structure goes on as

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:26.590
expected, but you get a timbre change like
for something played by a violin instead

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.580
of a piano and for all of these
conditions. . . for that condition you

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.560
basically get exactly the same response as
you do for structure violation conditions.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:41.890
Moreover, if you look at the responses to
very low level oddball violation, so this

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.890
is like high, high, high pitch, low pitch
or something like that very very dumb, no

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.540
hierarchical structure anything again, you
get a very similar kinds of responses. At

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.930
least in fMRI you get exactly the same set
of regions that react. So there's issues

00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.700
with using evidence from these violation
of structure paradigms to argue for

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.980
overlap in some kind of a deep level of
shared structure or something like that.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.040
There are some differences. . . again with
respect to those paradigms there are some

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.040
differences between musicians and
non-musicians but it's certainly the case

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.910
that just like we've known from behavior
ever since like the 50s, you know you

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.430
don't need to be a trained musician to
detect these violations very quickly, very

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:26.320
efficiently. But there are some subtle
differences you can report. Yeah, I think

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.100
I'll stop there, I mean there's. . .

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:38.280
- Thank you, so the next question is also
going to be a question merger and I'm

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:46.200
going to give this question to you David.
So the first part of the question is,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:52.880
“Since many sign language users have some
degree of hearing ability, is there

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:59.410
significant influence of the local spoken
language on the structure or the sign

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.770
language?” And the second part of these
question is, “What's the nature of

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.770
dialectal variation, geographical
variation of dialect in sign languages?”

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:21.860
- Okay, the first part influence of the
surrounding spoken language on sign

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:31.480
language. I would divide this question
into two areas. In terms of individual

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:43.080
vocabulary items, lexical items, there's a
huge amount of borrowing from English in

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:55.030
ASL just for individual words. There are
many words which are conventionally

00:29:55.210 --> 00:30:03.520
spelled, there's a manual alphabet A, B,
C, D and you can spell any word written in

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.910
the Latin alphabet with this manual
alphabet.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:15.080
So that is one, it feels sort of like, in
a way, a foreign element but most ASL

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:24.410
signers also know English. So a lot of
things are finger spelled. However,

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:35.600
there's another way that signs are created
by borrowing from English and these have

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:44.770
been known as initialized signs where you
take the first letter of the English word

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:52.010
and use the hand shape from the manual
alphabet and you get whole groups of words

00:30:52.190 --> 00:31:00.800
that way. So I'll give you example, this
is the manual alphabet for M two handed

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:13.560
sign, this is mathematics, A algebra, C
calculus, G geometry, T trigonometry, S

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:19.370
statistics and so on. So you get a whole
family of signs that are borrowed from

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:26.260
English. The movement, the actual
articulation and so on is native to ASL,

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:33.180
but the hand shape is expressing the first
letter of the corresponding English word.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.540
Needless to say, this suddenly gives you a
huge potential for additional vocabulary,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.130
but the way the question was worded, the
structure of the language and the

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:48.680
structure of the language in terms of the
syntax, in terms of patterns within the

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:58.010
lexicon, in terms of the phonology all of
that is indigenous and quite different

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.150
from English really very different from
English.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.720
Now there was a second part of the
question.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.730
- [Roger] Dialectal variation.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:13.110
- Yes, there is dialectal variation. There
have been studies of that under the rubric

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:19.340
of the socio-linguistics of sign language,
socio-linguistics of ASL. I'm not familiar

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.410
with most of that work, but it does exist.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.960
- Thank you, so the next question is for
Ray Jackendoff and I really like the

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:34.113
wording of this question. The question is,
“Does antagony recapitulate philogyny in

00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:41.739
the brain and evolutional language?” That
is should we think about. . . is it useful

00:32:41.739 --> 00:32:46.702
to think about the earliest stages of
child syntactic acquisition as being

00:32:46.702 --> 00:32:48.097
linear syntax?

00:32:48.995 --> 00:32:55.599
- That's a question I ask my self all the
time and part of the. . . well, there are

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:59.966
earlier stages of child language
acquisition that correspond to even more

00:32:59.966 --> 00:33:05.516
simple models of language, like languages
that can only have one word per sentence

00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:14.892
and those are useful as well. So at least
the earliest stages of child language seem

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:20.213
to be captured by very simple grammars.
I've been having this discussion with

00:33:20.213 --> 00:33:26.831
people working in language acquisition
about when you can detect real syntax in

00:33:26.831 --> 00:33:32.595
child language either in perception or in
production. Production is always way

00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:39.975
behind perception, and I'm getting a lot
of blow back from them. But on the other

00:33:39.975 --> 00:33:45.384
hand, most work in language acquisition
has presumed that as soon as the child

00:33:45.384 --> 00:33:50.641
starts stringing words together that there
is syntax, that there are nouns and verbs.

00:33:50.641 --> 00:33:56.046
So there's a lot of negotiating that has
to be done between this program of

00:33:56.046 --> 00:33:59.803
research and the people working on
language acquisition before we can really

00:33:59.803 --> 00:34:02.890
answer the question.
I would love it if we could show that

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:08.950
there's a stage of linear grammar that we
can detect in child language acquisition

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:15.500
that would be really nice. There's a
famous old book by the great Roman

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:22.750
Yakubson called child language aphasia and
how do you translate [foreign language]

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:24.420
because that's a--

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.440
- [male] General sound--

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.550
- . . . general sound patterns something
like sound laws, where he's suggesting

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:38.440
that what children. . .the order of
children's acquisition parallels the order

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.910
of loss in the other direction in aphasia
and this corresponds to typology among

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:48.860
languages. And this hypothesis, if we want
to say about linear grammar if we take it

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:55.250
really seriously, is like Yakubson on
steroids. Now I'm prepared to back off

00:34:55.430 --> 00:35:02.450
that, but it's something that I'd like to
know about and this requires really

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.380
mastering a lot of the child acquisition
literature and convincing people in child

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.410
language acquisition that this is a
question worth taking seriously, and so

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:16.160
far I haven't really succeeded in either
of them.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.920
- This question is for Mark Aronoff,
so. . .

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.148
[laughing]

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:32.310
They're very exited, it's a good question.
So are you ready for this? Yes. Okay, “How

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:37.890
should we think about expressions like OMG
and LOL on Twitter” So should we think

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.630
about these as a kind of degeneration of
language that's going to continue or

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.160
should we think of this as something else
perhaps a general tendency toward

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.420
abbreviation and efficiency?

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:55.180
- [Mark] Yeah, so it's very interesting
because OMG and LOL are very. . . they're

00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:00.170
complicated because they involve the
interaction of spoken and written

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:05.500
language.
So if you don't have a writing system, you

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:13.990
simply can't do that, right? And in fact
we know a little bit about the history of

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:22.440
those sorts of abbreviations, they
actually go back to biblical times. And

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:30.900
so, it was apparently that notion of that
interaction between spoken and written

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:43.940
language seems to. . . rose with increased
literacy in particular among the creators

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:54.820
of the biblical text. And we know this
from things like verses where the first

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.407
letters of lines of poems will spell out
words and things like that or you'll have

00:37:03.407 --> 00:37:07.746
poetry that's written in alphabetical
order and all that relates to what David

00:37:07.746 --> 00:37:13.230
was saying about, it depends on what your
resources are. So now that we have writing

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:21.120
as well as speech, then we can actually
play with the interplay, the interaction,

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.997
between the written and the spoken
language right? I think as a general rule,

00:37:27.997 --> 00:37:35.954
you could say that talking about language
in terms of degenerating never gets you

00:37:35.954 --> 00:37:44.411
anywhere. Though I must confess that I had
originally written down a question which I

00:37:44.411 --> 00:37:51.726
didn't submit and the question was WTF. So
thank you.

00:37:55.090 --> 00:38:01.830
- Great, so next we have a question for
Carmel O'Shannessy now, and the question

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:16.590
is, “What factors predict how much do we
know about when a language combines, when

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.550
it draws on multiple different source
languages, what factors influence what is

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:25.220
drawn from one language versus what is
drawn from the other language?”

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:34.790
- [Carmel] I wish I knew the answer to
that. Sorry. There's a language with

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:40.800
similar structure except reversed spoken
in North America, Michif, which combines

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:46.920
Cree and Canadian French. And there, the
verbs are from Cree and the noun structure

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.350
is from French, so it's kinda like the
opposite of Light Warlpiri. And the

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:56.380
argument for that combination is that the
verb structure is so complex that you

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.060
couldn't really divide it at any point.
And so, if you're going to have a Cree

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:07.140
verb, you have to have the whole thing. I
don't have the same argument for Light

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:16.040
Warlpiri. One possibility is that Warlpiri
verbs appear more complicated in some ways

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.220
in that they have several different
conjugations and so on in a way that

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.530
English verbs don't. And some of the
speakers in the community have told me

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:33.390
that they think of English as easy to
learn. And I think there's an idea of

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:39.330
using English verbs or creole-type verbs
to children because it's easy and people

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:44.420
have said they'll Warlpiri as they get
older. So I think it's an idea of what is

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:51.140
easier for language learning and what can
then be learned later, but I certainly

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.650
like to know more about typologically and
psychologically what might be involved

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:57.760
there.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:06.750
- And for closing remarks we turn to Fred
Gage of the Salk Institute and he's also

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:12.910
co-director of CARTA.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:17.800
- [Fred] Okay, my role in this is to close
the meeting and most importantly to elicit

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.360
some applause or thanks from you for all
the people that have actually done all the

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.483
work.

00:40:23.483 --> 00:40:26.214
[applause]

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:37.350
- In particular I'd really like to thank
the chairs of the session for picking some

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:42.560
really outstanding speakers, this has been
a great learning experience for all of us.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:48.510
But also, I was really impressed we do
this a lot and the questions that were

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.790
elicited from the audience were really
coherent. Maybe it was the way you guys

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:59.130
phrased them. But it was very very
coherent and really quite wonderful and

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:02.370
some of the the best answers to the
questions I think only come when you have

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:07.820
good questions that are being asked. So
thank you guys for all of that, thank you.

00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:10.855
