(ambient music)

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.840
(audience cheering)

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.911
- Welcome back, my
guest tonight is,

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.281
he is the President of the
Syrian National Coalition.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.350
Please welcome to the
program Hadi al-Bahra.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.521 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience applauding)
(upbeat music)

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.794
Welcome to the program.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:32.432
You are the President of the
Syrian National Coalition.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.067
What is that?

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.504
And is that, because
we're awfully confused,

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.838
and, by the way,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.775 align:start size:88% position:13%
sorry for destabilizing
the whole region,

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start size:84% position:16%
but what is the Syrian
National Coalition?

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.714
What is it made up of?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:52.152 align:start position:0% line:0%
- The Syrian National Coalition
is simply proud Syrians

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.655 line:0%
who seeks their justice,
to regain their rights,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:59.726 line:0%
their freedom, and
to have their country

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.495
with democratic rulership.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.764 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Your goal is not
just the defeat

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.534
of this new terrorist group.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.936 align:start size:97% position:3%
This ISIL, this ISIS,
whatever they call themselves.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:13.139 align:start size:88% position:13%
Your goal is also to
gain justice from Assad.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.973
- True.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:14.908
- [Jon] Yes.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.209
- Assad is the sole cause

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.144 align:start size:94% position:6%
of terrorist
organizations in the area.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.612 line:0%
This has been since the 80s,

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:23.983 line:0%
since the invasion of
Lebanon by Syrian Army.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:28.154 line:0%
Since the presence of the
American forces in Iraq.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.991
The origin of ISIS organization,

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:35.261 align:start size:81% position:19%
it was the Islamic
state of Iraq,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.764
and it was carrying
terrorist attack

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.867
against American forces
in Iraq at that time.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:44.404 align:start size:97% position:3%
Again, he invested and he
brought this same organization

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.006
to terrorize the
Syrian people now,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.677
in order to block
their free movement

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.445
for freedom and democracy.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.948
- Assad did that, because
our understanding of ISIS

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.450
is that they were
fighting Assad.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.587
That they were, along
with the Al-Nusra Front

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:04.791
and the Free Syrian Army,
were all fighting together,

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.027
or not necessarily together,
but to try and defeat Assad.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.429
- Opposite.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.597
- It's the opposite.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.265
- Assad never fought ISIS.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.902 align:start size:97% position:3%
ISIS never fought Assad
since the start of the year

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:19.572 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the start of the presence
of ISIS inside Syria.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:23.143 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Actually ISIS fought only
the Free Syrian Army.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.613 line:0%
And Assad has bombed,
carried air strikes

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.081 line:0%
against the Free Syrian Army

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.351 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
while leaving totally
ISIS forces out.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.852
Go Google it out.

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:36.222
See how many air raids against
ISIS carried by Assad regime

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.891
since the start of the year.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.125
You'll find nothing.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.594
All the strikes are
against civilians,

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.932
against people inside
Aleppo using TNT bombs,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.936 align:start size:94% position:6%
and using extreme violence
against his own people.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.438
- I'm a little sad that
we don't know that here,

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.841
and that we could Google it,
and then we would know it.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.675 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Yes.
(laughter)

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.510
- That's a little sad.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.980
Why would Assad,
who's essentially,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.284
this is the Alawite kingdom,
and he's supported by Iran.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:07.353
Why would he unleash a Sunni

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.889 align:start size:88% position:13%
fundamentalist
terrorist organization?

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.493
Wouldn't they be
his mortal enemy?

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:14.994
- No.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.764
He wanted from the start
of the Syrian revolution,

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.966 line:0%
he had a strategy and plan.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.369 line:0%
He wanted the free world to
see that it's only a choice

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.339 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
between an evil
terrorist organization

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.408 line:0%
and an evil dictatorship.

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.511 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he assumed that
the world would choose

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.479
the lesser of the two evils,

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.015 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they would choose
Assad to cooperate with.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.651 align:start size:88% position:13%
Luckily, the free world
refused to do this,

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.220
and they understood the game,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.589
and they stood by
the Syrian people.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.757
- Are you concerned?

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.926
You know, I think the
sympathies of the world

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:51.664
are with this coalition of
people who just want freedom,

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:52.932
they just want to be left alone,

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.267
they just want to
live their lives.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:58.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
How do you combat Assad
is backed by Iran,

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.974
and in some ways
backed by Russia?

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.178 align:start size:84% position:16%
ISIS, ISIL is backed
by maybe Assad.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.614 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe they're getting money
from some of the other

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:11.050
more fundamentalist
regimes in the area.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.821 align:start size:88% position:13%
How is a group like this
going to defeat them

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:18.391
and create something stable?

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.160 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Mainly by our will,
and our patience.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.964 align:start position:0% line:0%
This is the future of our kids,
our granddaughters and son.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.734 line:0%
We have been fighting
them since 40 years,

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.037
and the world has kept silent.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.305
Nobody moved.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.307
They moved only against ISIS.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:37.277
Why they didn't move and
do anything for Assad?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.711
- [Jon] Mm-hmm.

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.214 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But we, the people of
Syria will carry on our fight

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:44.083
and will fight until we
win back our freedom,

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:48.755
and we'll achieve our quest
into a democratic society.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:49.822
- How would you...

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.857
(applause)

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.459
I wish you very well with that.

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:59.399
So now a coalition has formed

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.434
that they are going to
do strategic air strikes

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.771
that they believe
will weaken ISIS.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.073
Will they weaken them
to the extent that,

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:09.208
is this some sort
of round robin?

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:13.179
Does the free Syrians have
to fight and defeat ISIS

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.481
and then take on Assad?

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:19.385
Because it seems that the
coalition is unwilling

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:22.355 align:start size:84% position:16%
to utilize their
power against Assad.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:25.425 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, our American
friends here,

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:28.094 line:0%
they have to know that we
have been fighting ISIS

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.263 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
since the first
quarter of this year.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.699 line:0%
We have been fighting
two fronts all the way.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.401 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
We've been fighting ISIS and
the regime, Assad regime,

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.705
at the same time with very
little help of the world.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.908
We cannot carry on the fight
on two fronts at the same time

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.577
without the assistance
of our friends in the US,

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.312
and other free world.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.982
- If we give you weapons,
can we put labels on them

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:53.686
because we have a tendency
to get weapons over there,

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.288
and then the bad guys
come and take them

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.390
because we tend to leave.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.460
- I guess we have passed this.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.262
As you know, ISIS
has went into Iraq,

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:05.698 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they already
captured all the weapon

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.667
provided to the Iraqi armies.

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:10.536 align:start size:97% position:3%
But for us, we are fighting
for our own freedoms.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start size:97% position:3%
We have been handling
sophisticated weapon system,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.410
anti-tanks weapons, and
they are very well kept

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.512
within the hands of
the Free Syrian Army.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Can you work also with
the Iraqi government?

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.349
Will they work in
concert with you

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.185 align:start size:81% position:19%
to help defeat
these two menaces,

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:28.187
and to stabilize the region?

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.656 align:start size:81% position:19%
- It's not anymore
Syrian problem.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.292
It's not anymore even
the regional problem.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.261
It is an international problem.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.797 align:start size:84% position:16%
We are talking about
an organization

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:41.267 align:start position:0%
with 30 different nationalities
within this organization.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.735
- [Jon] Right.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.570 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You have Americans, you have
British, you have French--

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.172
- Have you seen and
up-tick in support?

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.875 align:start size:94% position:6%
Have you seen and up-tick
in coalition support

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.544
going your way since
all this occurred?

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:54.147
You're here for the UN mission.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:56.916
Are you getting the help
that you think you need,

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.618
and that your people deserve?

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:01.220 line:0%
- I think the world has started

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.855 line:0%
to move in the right direction.

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.825 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
It's not to our
expectation as of yet,

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:10.396 align:start position:0% line:0%
but I think slowly it will
build up toward that direction.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:14.100
They need to notice that they
cannot eliminate terrorism

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.769
by only military operations.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:20.573 align:start size:97% position:3%
It has to be much, much more
than military operation.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.975 align:start size:94% position:6%
You have to have a
social, political program.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:26.078 align:start size:88% position:13%
You need to provide a
vision of political life

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.314
for all the region
in the Middle East.

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:30.183 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think that's the
fascinating part.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:31.384 align:start size:84% position:16%
Can you stick around
for a little bit?

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.852
- Sure.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.353
- We'll come back, and
then I want to talk about

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:35.955
what could work there because
it's something that I think

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.857 align:start size:84% position:16%
America thought
they tried in Iraq,

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.225
were not successful with.

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
Thought they were
trying in Afghanistan,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.496
were not successful with.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.965 align:start size:84% position:16%
What a world like
that would look like,

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.901
I think would be important
to find out, to delineate.

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.069
Alright, so we'll be right back.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.337 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hadi al-Bahra,
we'll be right back.

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:55.508 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
(ambient music)
(audience applauding)

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.747
- We're speaking
with the President

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:04.116
of the Syrian National
Coalition, Hadi al-Bahra.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:05.518
Thank you for joining us.

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:08.387 align:start position:0%
Obviously this is a very
difficult time in your country.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:09.956
You are based in Turkey now.

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:11.224
You can't be based in Syria

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.292 align:start size:81% position:19%
because they would
come after you.

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:17.396
- Yes, our head office
is in Istanbul, Turkey,

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:20.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
but our people
exist inside Syria.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.336
We have the local councils, we
have seven different steams,

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.239 align:start size:94% position:6%
we have police force
inside the liberated areas

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:29.242
under the control
of the opposition.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.347 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What has been the reluctance
of a country like Turkey

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.848 align:start size:84% position:16%
to involve themselves
in the fight,

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.684
and to not close
down the borders,

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.989
and to keep them so porous
in terms of black market oil

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.191 align:start size:97% position:3%
going back and forth,
fighters going back and forth?

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:50.162
How difficult is it to get
them to close that down?

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:51.898
- You cannot look
at it this way.

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:56.636
Turkey always faces very
hard, tough choices to make

00:08:56.636 --> 00:09:00.139
because either they go in
the strict security system,

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:03.042
where they will not allow the
easy flow of Syrian people

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:07.346 align:start size:97% position:3%
out of Syria, inside
Syria, and food and supply.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.483
The other option is to let
the humanitarian convoys

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:13.953
and the free movement of
the Syrian people easier.

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:17.757
Always Turkey chose to stay
on the humanitarian side

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:21.327
of the problem, risking
its own even security.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:23.329
But today, as we
heard in the news,

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:26.899
that Mr. Erdogan has announced
his support to the coalition,

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:29.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he said Turkey
cannot stay any longer

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.836
outside of this coalition.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
- So you believe we have reached
a certain coalescence point

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.376 align:start size:88% position:13%
where the world will
take this seriously now,

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:41.180
and it will change
things on the ground?

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.715
- It has to be changed.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.917 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's a risk you
cannot ignore anymore.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.587
Should we wait until we
see these guys all over

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.956 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the United
States, or in Europe?

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.924
We are your front line.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.993
We have been fighting as I said,

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:56.529 align:start size:84% position:16%
from the first quarter
of this year alone.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start size:97% position:3%
Isn't it enough, or about time
now for you to support us?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.202 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now you are supporting
with the weapons,

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:06.005
with supplies, with
the humanitarian aid

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:09.875 align:start size:88% position:13%
which you should do more
aggressively with us

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:13.713
because we are the front line
in the war against terrorism.

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:16.616 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Is it difficult
as you observe this,

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.786
to watch our Congress not
come back from their break

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.590
to talk about it?

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.159
Is that seem like an abdication

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:31.664 align:start size:84% position:16%
of a responsibility
in your eyes?

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:35.434
- For us, I mean we look at
our own national interests,

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.970
and our way of life,
as the American people,

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.339 align:start size:81% position:19%
they don't feel
the danger of this

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:43.743
because it's far away
from their homeland.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.612
But for us, we can
foresee its problem

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:50.049
to our national interest, to
the region, and to the world.

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:52.051
So we should I think, all of us,

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:54.153 align:start size:84% position:16%
we should be more
responsible in this.

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.455
- What does a stable
situation look like?

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.190
Because the entire region,

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.192
I mean you can distill
the conflict in Syria,

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:01.794
but the entire region
is sort of trapped

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:05.331 align:start size:84% position:16%
between these despots,
and terrorists.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.534
You have autocracies, and you
have these Islamist groups

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.302 align:start size:94% position:6%
that are bringing
terror, and it seems like

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.304
there's a large majority
of people in the middle

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.573 align:start size:84% position:16%
that are caught
between this fight.

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:16.509
- No, for us as Syrian people,

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
we seek democracy
and freedom for all.

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:24.016
We seek protection of
all the Syrian people.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.619 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know Syria is
unique in its position.

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:30.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
We have many ethnicity,
many religious in our land.

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:33.426 align:start size:88% position:13%
Syrian society is
open, moderate society.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.328 align:start size:84% position:16%
Syria's the only
country in the world

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.130
where you have people who speak

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.900 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the tongue of
Jesus, until to now.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.570
If we were extremist country,
you wouldn't find these guys.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.138
- No, no, no.

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:49.875
That's my point, I think is
that it's a moderate people,

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:53.913
but they're trapped between
extremists and authoritarian.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.815 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I think the whole
region will have to move

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:59.085
into more democratic
type of government

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:02.521
procedure and systems.

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:04.256
I think it will move.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.059
It started already
in Tunisia, in Egypt,

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.694
and other countries.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:12.698
Nobody can move against
the movement of history.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:16.368
I think Syria will
be the cornerstone

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:18.804
of democracy in the region.

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:22.441 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And your group is working
to rebuild that civil society.

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:25.611
Have you created enough of
a free zone for yourselves,

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:28.414 align:start size:88% position:13%
that there's at least
some semblance of safety

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.015
for at least that group?

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.451 align:start size:84% position:16%
- As you know, until
now we don't have

00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:34.320
a free zone inside Syria.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.990 align:start size:97% position:3%
We control land, but we don't
have air defense for it,

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.427
so daily these areas been
bombarded by Assad regime

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.597
using TNT barrels,
all type of bombs.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.031
- So if they did a no-fly zone,

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
would that be at
least the first step?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.302
Create a no-fly zone over Syria?

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:52.772
- This should be the
first thing to consider

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:56.208
in order to provide this
swift transition of power

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:59.445
inside Syria and allow
people chance to live

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.847
a little normally in
the liberated area,

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:04.817 align:start size:88% position:13%
and to start, look,
and build their future.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:08.721 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Is the drawback to that,
that Iran will not allow that,

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:10.256 align:start size:84% position:16%
or that Russia will
not allow that?

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:13.325
Who is standing in the way of
a no-fly zone over that area?

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:17.563 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Well I think only Russia
and Iran are the front

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:19.732
opposing this no-fly zone.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.469
- Okay, so we have
to go to a war with,

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.303
alright, hold on.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.604
Let me work this out.

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:28.174
I'm just working out this math.

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.744 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't think
they will go to war.

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:34.547
If you remember when
the chemical attack

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.483
which Assad carried out
against his own people,

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.819
and 1,400 people died.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:40.653
- Yes.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.922
- The US put a red line,

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.658 align:start size:81% position:19%
and threatened
about using force.

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:48.060
- Yes.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.963
- When Assad felt that the US
is serious about using force,

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:53.699
he backed out, and he
signed the agreement

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:57.002
to disarm and let go
of his chemical weapon.

00:13:57.002 --> 00:14:00.673
Russia at that time, said
they are not ready to fight

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.842
for any regime in the area.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.344
So all what we need,
we need the resolve

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.613
by the US and by our friends,

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
and really to tell
Assad enough is enough.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:14.720
If we treat the sole cause,
for sure we'll be 50% away

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.056
in our fight against terrorism.

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:19.992 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And you feel this will
not trigger or create

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:22.228
a deeper fault line
between the Sunni

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:23.495
and the Shiite community?

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:24.897
You don't feel like
that will trigger--

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:27.132
- It is not a sectarian war.

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:30.970
It is Assad tried to make
it as a sectarian war.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.571
He had tried to ignite it.

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:34.773
Until now, he could not.

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:35.808
- Well I wish you all the best.

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.610
I know you have a book.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.546
- I have one bracelet which
I've been asked to give you.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:41.647
- So we're going steady now?

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:42.748
I think is what's happening.

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:43.716
(laughing)

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:44.984
We are.

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:47.419
This is what's remarkable.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:48.621
I want to get to this.

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.890
- I have this great
book to remember

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.661 align:start position:0%
the first 100,000 people killed
in Syria by Assad regime.

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:58.497 align:start size:88% position:13%
This project was carried
out with the dream

00:14:58.497 --> 00:15:02.601
started by a nice American
lady here, Mrs. Lina Sergie.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.072
I would like to give
it to you with some--

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.774
- It's astonishing.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:12.011 align:start size:94% position:6%
This is a book of 100,000
that have been killed

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:14.013
during this terrible war,
and you were telling me

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:16.115 align:start size:97% position:3%
that there are another
100,000 that they could put--

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:19.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Now it's over
than 200,000 people.

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:22.554
- Well here's the hope that
there will be no more books,

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:25.190 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that you will find the
peace that you're looking for.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
I really appreciate
you being here.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:27.126
(applause)

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.193
Hadi al-Bahra.

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:31.363
(cheers and applause)
