&gt;&gt; KANNINEN: Hi. I'm Matt Kanninen. I'm a
software developer with MySpace. I'm here

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.970
to show you the application we developed for
the Android platform. First, we'll go to home

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.499
page. They have features of the core social
networking functions of MySpace, including

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:20.040
searching and add friends; commenting on photos,
blogs and profiles; messaging; and viewing

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:50.550
and uploading photos. First, we'll view our
friend status.
Next, I'll update mine.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:00.199
Next, we'll upload a photo to MySpace. I'm
accessing the phone's library right here,

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:14.180
choosing a photo and uploading it to MySpace.
We can view the uploaded photo in its album

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:31.350
right here. And there we go. We're excited
about the Android platform and we developed

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.530
this application to take advantage of the
rich device capabilities that presents to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.380
us. We've previously developed applications
for other mobile platforms and Android was

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.750
the logical next step. Our application began
as a part of our iPhone App. We're able to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.920
use--we start out using the same assets, we
consumed the same SOAP web services and we

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.390
were able to take the XML layout files from
that application and perform accessibility

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.100
transforms on them to generate the initial
app for this application. We used our Apache

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.920
Access to generate stubs from the WSDL files
and we use K sub 2 to perform the SOAP metric

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.390
calls.
