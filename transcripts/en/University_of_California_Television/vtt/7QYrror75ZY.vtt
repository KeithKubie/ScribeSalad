00:00:01.262 --> 00:00:04.032
- [Announcer] This UCSD-TV
program is presented

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:06.746
by University of California Television.

00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:08.053
Like what you learn?

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:11.268

us Facebook and Twitter

00:00:11.268 --> 00:00:14.268
to keep up with the latest programs.

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.511
(uptempo piano music)

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:25.922
We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.278
Bipedal,

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:28.333
naked,

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.500
large-brained,

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:34.995
long the master of fire,
tools, and language

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:38.412
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:43.551
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.448
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.034
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:53.117
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:55.693
We shape the future

00:00:55.693 --> 00:00:59.880
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.734
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:07.901
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.429
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.012
of humans like you.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.700
(pensive piano music)

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:12.313
- I'm sure all of you came
away from the symposium

00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:15.756
realizing that evolution, as Randy Ness

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:18.581
has repeatedly pointed
out, is the basic science

00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:21.273
that's absolutely critical to medicine.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.041
So you're probably wondering why UCSD,

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:26.672
maybe one of the only few
schools in the United States

00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:30.152
where evolution is even taught
as part of the curriculum.

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:32.966
And it's not for any
religious, social, political,

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:36.716
or historical reason,
it's really an artifact

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:39.146
of the way medicine involved.

00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:42.249
Medicine was an art that
had a shotgun marriage

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.560
with science in the 1920s and 1930s

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.111
in what is called western medicine.

00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:51.701
At that time, evolution
wasn't an established science,

00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:54.718
really because we didn't know
about DNA, genetics was not

00:02:54.718 --> 00:02:57.151
yet known, and lots of
other things are not known,

00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.129
so the new synthesis really happened only

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.046
in the 1950s and 1960s, by
which time it was too late,

00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:09.362
the curriculum had been jammed
full of everything else.

00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:13.432
And so while Randy and others led the way

00:03:13.432 --> 00:03:16.134
in looking into this matter,
i think there's going to be

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:17.963
a lot more effort we have to take,

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:20.367
which is more of an effort we have to take

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.239
with our curriculum committees rather than

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.434
a scientific issue to ind truce evolution

00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:29.199
and evolution biology more
into the medical curriculum,

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.209
so next time you go see
your doctor, ask him

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.376
do you understand evolution
while you're taking care of me?

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:42.352
Okay, so with that, I'll go to
the question answer session.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.897
(pensive piano music)

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:53.800
- We're gonna start with
questions for Katie Hinde.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.642
First question is, come on out, Katie.

00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:59.472
If milk content varies based
on the infant's gender,

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:02.863
what's the signalling mechanism
that tells the mother's body

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:05.907
what this is, is it prenatal, and if

00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:08.824
in male and female twins, who wins?

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.040
- Okay, that's a great question.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.672
From dairy cows, because of the management

00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:19.567
of the dairy industry, calves
are removed from the mom

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.336
at birth and they're fed a milk replacer

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:25.753
and the milk that the heifer is producing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.823
is then used to feed us and so from that

00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:35.190
we can evaluate if there's
differences in milk production

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.552
and if there are, that means
that they reflect something

00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:40.418
about the prenatal environment, and indeed

00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:43.340
in the dairy cows we've seen
that there is a signature

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.197
of the infant sex from
pregnancy and we hypothesized

00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:51.052
that this has to do with
hormonal transfer from the fetus

00:04:51.052 --> 00:04:53.953
into maternal circulation
that then influences

00:04:53.953 --> 00:04:54.956
the functional development

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:57.122
of the mammary gland during pregnancy.

00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:59.892
Experimental manipulation in bank voles,

00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:02.479
in which they created all
male and all female litters

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.926
after they were born has also shown

00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:09.538
that milk synthesis is
up-regulated when mothers

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:12.139
are rearing all daughter litters.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.361
So there seems to be both
prenatal and postnatal

00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:19.027
mechanisms that are influencing
how the mammary gland

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:22.579
knows that it's synthesizing
milk for sons and daughters.

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:25.447
The twin question is a
really, really good one

00:05:25.447 --> 00:05:29.269
and whoever asked that
question find me afterwards

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:32.420
and I will tell you, 'cause
there's work that I've reviewed

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.796
that's now in press that
gives us some insights into

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:40.283
how milk produced for
son and daughter twins

00:05:40.283 --> 00:05:43.185
may be different than what
would happen if there were

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:45.445
son son twins and daughter daughter twins,

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.783
but I can't say from the podium.

00:05:47.783 --> 00:05:49.419
Thank you.

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.669
(applause)

00:05:53.154 --> 00:05:54.526
- Next is a question for Mike Gurven

00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:56.030
Mike, come on out.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.719
Do helmets reduce the
incidents of atherosclerosis

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.408
to aid in their own survival
because the host lives longer

00:06:03.408 --> 00:06:04.408
so they can?

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.201
- Thanks for the question.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:12.052
There's nothing that worms
can't do, apparently.

00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:12.952
No, it's a good question.

00:06:12.952 --> 00:06:16.232
I think there's a variety of ways, yeah

00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:20.554
helmets aren't trying to make
changes in our human bodies

00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:22.943
just for our own benefit but, you know,

00:06:22.943 --> 00:06:26.983
they're trying to ensure
their own growth and survival.

00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:29.431
Now, intestinal helmets don't
reproduce inside the body

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:33.113
but of course, you know they
lead to the shedding of eggs

00:06:33.113 --> 00:06:37.280
which will permit to spread
and so there's a variety

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:42.381
of different ways that helmets
actually exert their effects.

00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:46.422
They're taking lipids,
consuming lipids and glucose

00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:49.614
from our bodies, they're
altering the way that lipids

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:53.861
are metabolized and so
people with helmets tend

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:56.636
to actually have lower cholesterol levels.

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:58.145
We've seen that in the Chimane,

00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:00.493
and it now exists in other populations

00:07:00.493 --> 00:07:04.232
and also, they modulate immune function

00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:07.130
in a variety of ways, as I
mentioned, that seem to be

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.963
regulatory and
anti-inflammatory and certainly,

00:07:13.738 --> 00:07:16.040
the solution well, you know,
maybe we all need worms

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.207
is a hard one to address,
aside from the ick factor.

00:07:21.311 --> 00:07:25.300
Your own body often can shed these worms.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.880
Somehow evolution has
decided that our body

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.590
should tolerate them as Ruslan said,

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.070
rather than get rid of
them, and so the dynamic

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.839
we're actually still
trying to work this out

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:43.561
how helmets have co-evolved
with our immune system

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:46.721
in ways that our body almost
expects them to exist.

00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:47.554
Thank you.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.740
- One for Barbara Natterson.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.000
If chimpanzees are so
closely related to humans,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.353
why do we use species like
mice that are so distant

00:07:57.353 --> 00:07:59.686
as models for human disease?

00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:03.246
- Well, there are a number of ways

00:08:03.246 --> 00:08:07.193
I could approach that question,
starting with the ethical

00:08:07.193 --> 00:08:08.865
or starting with the scientific.

00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:11.416
I guess my response quickly would be that

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:15.125
we have been overall very
disappointed with the mouse model

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:17.929
in many ways, you know it's
often said that we've cured

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:21.483
cancer thousands of times
in mice, but the problem is

00:08:21.483 --> 00:08:23.614
it doesn't translate so well to humans.

00:08:23.614 --> 00:08:27.272
I guess my comment would
be that there are ways

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:31.334
that we can begin to
advance science by looking

00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:34.778
at the natural occurrence of
disease in non-human animals

00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:37.654
because there are limitations
to experimental models.

00:08:37.654 --> 00:08:40.865
Don't get me wrong, experimental
models are very valuable

00:08:40.865 --> 00:08:43.874
and yet there's certain
diseases, for example bone cancer

00:08:43.874 --> 00:08:47.521
osteosarcoma which happens
very commonly in large dogs

00:08:47.521 --> 00:08:51.481
like Great Danes and
Labradors and Mastiffs

00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:54.762
and the biology, the natural
history of this kind of cancer

00:08:54.762 --> 00:08:58.929
in those dogs is nearly identical
to the biology in humans

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.643
who develop this problem,
typically adolescents.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:07.259
And so this is an area that
we've really not looked at

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:10.026
and is hiding in plain
sight, an opportunity

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:13.445
to begin to understand and
ask important scientific

00:09:13.445 --> 00:09:18.236
questions by looking at
the animals all around us,

00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:22.190
not only our pets but also
wild animals, farm animals,

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.355
who are one their own developing
many of the same diereses

00:09:26.355 --> 00:09:27.438
that we have.

00:09:28.563 --> 00:09:30.323
- [Randolph] Thank you.

00:09:30.323 --> 00:09:33.076
(applause)

00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:35.408
- As you can tell, we're doing
questions from the speakers

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.535
before the break first, and
the last is Ruslan Medzhitov.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:42.003
Do you know, or would
you predict the effect

00:09:42.003 --> 00:09:45.384
of ketogenic metabolism on the outcome

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:46.488
during a viral infection?

00:09:46.488 --> 00:09:51.480
And start by explaining what
ketogenic metabolism is.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.647
- So presumably, what was
meant as ketogenic diet,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.027
a diet that is rich in fats
and low in carbohydrates,

00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:07.961
similar to Atkins Diet for example.

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:12.079
The answer is that it
depends on the duration

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:15.658
of the ketogenic diet
and how extreme it is,

00:10:15.658 --> 00:10:19.825
if it's really only just fats
and no carbohydrates at all,

00:10:21.616 --> 00:10:26.193
and it depends on what
is the limiting factor

00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:29.958
during an infection, so we
shouldn't be just generalizing

00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.678
it into any viral infection,
even for a given viral

00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:38.032
infection, the limiting factor
could be viral-induced damage

00:10:38.032 --> 00:10:41.410
or it could be viral-induced inflammation,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.410
and ketogenic diet or ketons rather,

00:10:46.294 --> 00:10:49.544
have various anti-inflammatory effects.

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:55.029
And that can help under
conditions when inflammation

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:59.345
is the limiting factor,
but generally being

00:10:59.345 --> 00:11:02.678
on a ketogenic diet for long enough time

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:06.997
and if it's a very
aggressive ketogenic diet,

00:11:06.997 --> 00:11:11.500
no carbohydrates at all, it
has also various side effects

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.667
such as ketoacedosis, which
leads to a drop in the pH

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:22.056
of the blood and that in
itself can have various effects

00:11:23.252 --> 00:11:27.920
that can be deleterious on
the outcome of the infection

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.087
so there's a long way to say
that there is no simple recipe

00:11:34.597 --> 00:11:38.808
or when our study was
published, somebody asked me

00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:42.975
a question, how many candies
should I eat to prevent flu?

00:11:44.627 --> 00:11:47.960
There is no answer like that and I think

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.980
only one general implication
I would say is that

00:11:55.713 --> 00:11:59.546
it appears that our
bodies may have preference

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:05.246
for what we want to eat and
what we want to avoid eating

00:12:05.246 --> 00:12:06.687
depending on our condition.

00:12:06.687 --> 00:12:10.319
We all experience that in
difference and it's most obvious

00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:14.139
in the case of an early pregnancy
when the food preferences

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:17.632
change dramatically, but that
also seems to be the case

00:12:17.632 --> 00:12:22.623
with infections, so we have our
preferences for chicken soup

00:12:22.623 --> 00:12:26.527
versus honey and tea
versus other types of food

00:12:26.527 --> 00:12:30.463
and we think that these
are some ancient mechanisms

00:12:30.463 --> 00:12:33.667
telling us which type of
metabolism would be protective.

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:36.561
But anything extreme, like ketogenic diet

00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:39.587
or any one of those
diets, it's all of course,

00:12:39.587 --> 00:12:42.688
much of it is nonsense
and we should just follow

00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:45.997
more natural desires, thank you.

00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:48.247
(applause)

00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:52.845
- Okay, so we'll go to questions
from the second session,

00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:55.087
a question for David Haig.

00:12:55.087 --> 00:12:56.957
It's a bit complex, but I think

00:12:56.957 --> 00:12:59.057
there's some interesting stuff in here.

00:12:59.057 --> 00:13:01.959
For offsprings with defects
passed on maternally,

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:04.642
daughters may not suffer,
but will pass on genes

00:13:04.642 --> 00:13:07.566
to their sons who exhibit defects.

00:13:07.566 --> 00:13:10.319
Will defects in sons be
less in the first born

00:13:10.319 --> 00:13:12.986
and more in the subsequent sons?

00:13:18.513 --> 00:13:22.430
- There are a lot of
difficult questions there.

00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:30.893
First of all, the genetic
defects we're looking at,

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:34.794
you know, those are the
mutations that Randy talked about

00:13:34.794 --> 00:13:38.544
that just happen that
are bad and maladaptive,

00:13:38.544 --> 00:13:43.106
but they provide information
about what the genes

00:13:43.106 --> 00:13:47.715
that aren't working do
during normal development,

00:13:47.715 --> 00:13:50.324
so I wouldn't want to
suggest that any of these

00:13:50.324 --> 00:13:53.991
defect conditions are
adaptive in any sense.

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:57.889
Since I have the podium,

00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:04.407
I want to put something out
there fascinating for you.

00:14:04.407 --> 00:14:07.881
We now know that during
pregnancy, that once a woman

00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:11.609
has been pregnant, cells
from each of her offspring

00:14:11.609 --> 00:14:15.230
colonize her body and persist in her body

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.318
for the rest of her life.

00:14:17.318 --> 00:14:19.434
And we also know that
there are populations

00:14:19.434 --> 00:14:23.577
of maternal cells that
colonize in offspring bodies

00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:27.744
and remain in those bodies,
often for the rest of the life.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.910
During pregnancy, a mother's
mother's cells increase

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.383
in frequency in her blood,
and so there's a possibility

00:14:37.383 --> 00:14:41.621
that maternal grandmother
cells can colonize a fetus.

00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:44.477
And since cells from previous pregnancies

00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:47.577
are in the mother's body,
there's a possibility

00:14:47.577 --> 00:14:52.113
that cells of older siblings
can move across the placenta

00:14:52.113 --> 00:14:56.113
and move into younger
siblings, so these are all

00:14:57.282 --> 00:15:00.185
anecdotal observations that are out there,

00:15:00.185 --> 00:15:02.541
but I think it raises the
possibility of all sorts

00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:05.847
of really, things that
we haven't thought about

00:15:05.847 --> 00:15:09.984
of effects within families
if sometimes cells

00:15:09.984 --> 00:15:12.908
from the genetic
individual of our siblings

00:15:12.908 --> 00:15:16.575
can be colonizing our
own bodies, thank you.

00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:19.292
- Question for Cynthia Beall.

00:15:19.292 --> 00:15:23.869
Does the difference between
the Andeans and the Tibetans

00:15:23.869 --> 00:15:27.165
reflect the time in
which they have adapted,

00:15:27.165 --> 00:15:31.982
or is it the environment
in which they have adapted?

00:15:31.982 --> 00:15:34.974
- That's a very good question to which

00:15:34.974 --> 00:15:36.651
I don't know the answer.

00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:40.818
I would add a third option to
the time and the environment

00:15:43.013 --> 00:15:45.680
and that is evolutionary history

00:15:46.832 --> 00:15:49.723
and micro-evolutionary history.

00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:52.442
It is the case that
someone has been living

00:15:52.442 --> 00:15:56.002
on the Tibetan plateau for much longer

00:15:56.002 --> 00:15:59.810
than someone has been
living on the Andean plateau

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.810
so it's possible that
given another 15,000 years

00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:09.828
Andean highlanders might converge
upon the Tibetan phenotype

00:16:13.868 --> 00:16:18.026
The fact that we see signals of selection

00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:21.323
that are different in the two populations

00:16:21.323 --> 00:16:25.352
suggests that that is not going to happen.

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:28.729
The questions about
differences in environment

00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:33.662
is an interesting one because
I think what you're doing

00:16:33.662 --> 00:16:37.867
is implicitly asking well,
you're focusing on high-altitudes

00:16:37.867 --> 00:16:40.756
and you're focusing on
hypoxia, but what about

00:16:40.756 --> 00:16:45.100
could dietary differences,
could latitudinal differences

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.085
and ultraviolet radiation differences

00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:50.762
and infectious disease
differences contribute

00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:54.666
to the pattern of differences,
and the answer is yes,

00:16:54.666 --> 00:16:58.250
it's possible, we don't have any evidence.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.750
The third option that I introduced is that

00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:07.933
the population that gave rise
to the Tibetan population

00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:13.321
came from northern eastern
Asia, and that is also

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:18.500
the population that gave
rise to the Native Americans.

00:17:20.634 --> 00:17:25.257
And so it's possible that
in the course of moving

00:17:25.257 --> 00:17:28.298
from the Old World to the New World,

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:31.656
there was genetic drift,
there were new mutations,

00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:34.509
there were adaptations to
other environmental factors

00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:39.385
along the way so that the
genome, the details of the genome

00:17:39.385 --> 00:17:42.314
that the Andean highlanders
took to altitude

00:17:42.314 --> 00:17:44.656
were different than that for Tibetans

00:17:44.656 --> 00:17:48.920
and that would be a great
question to sort out.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.925
And if the person who
asked that is looking for

00:17:50.925 --> 00:17:53.738
a dissertation topic, go for it.

00:17:53.738 --> 00:17:55.988
(applause)

00:17:59.624 --> 00:18:01.482
- Okay, so I think Charlie Nunn

00:18:01.482 --> 00:18:05.267
takes the prize for the
maximum number of questions.

00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:07.845
Sleep, everybody's interested in sleep,

00:18:07.845 --> 00:18:10.120
but we can't really go
through all the questions,

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.847
but I'll give a sort
of a combined question.

00:18:13.847 --> 00:18:15.949
One question which has two flip sides,

00:18:15.949 --> 00:18:19.896
one is you highlighted the
risk of short fragmented sleep,

00:18:19.896 --> 00:18:22.694
but what about sleeping too much,

00:18:22.694 --> 00:18:25.805
either because of sleeping
too much because you're lazy

00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:29.345
or because you get some drugs,
could that have an effect

00:18:29.345 --> 00:18:33.211
on cognitive deficits
and on the other hand,

00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:35.099
do the requirements of modern life

00:18:35.099 --> 00:18:39.010
which are very different from
the hunter-gatherer lifestyle

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.343
actually require you to have more sleep?

00:18:43.662 --> 00:18:45.830
- [Charles] I'm sorry,
say the second one again.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.997
- The second one is given
the stresses and environment

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:55.017
of modern life, could
it be that you actually

00:18:55.017 --> 00:18:59.383
need more sleep now that
the hunter-gather needs.

00:18:59.383 --> 00:19:00.869
- Yeah, okay.

00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:03.493
Well these are really
interesting questions

00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:05.415
and clearly there's a lot
that we still don't know

00:19:05.415 --> 00:19:09.351
about sleep and it's effects on health.

00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:10.885
The evidence that is out suggests

00:19:10.885 --> 00:19:15.380
that there's sort of a sweet
spot of around eight hours,

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.793
there's probably a lot of error on that

00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:21.819
and that sleeping too
little or sleeping too much

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:26.584
will have health consequences,
negative health consequences

00:19:26.584 --> 00:19:30.755
and so it probably is the
case that sleeping too much

00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:35.234
would also contribute to some
negative health consequences.

00:19:35.234 --> 00:19:38.579
Now I don't know a lot about
that side of the equation,

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:42.145
I think most people are
focusing on the other side

00:19:42.145 --> 00:19:44.943
in terms of too little sleep.

00:19:44.943 --> 00:19:47.474
It's also interesting
to think about whether

00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:49.343
the stresses of modern life would lead us

00:19:49.343 --> 00:19:50.926
to need more sleep.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.416
I can't say that's really

00:19:55.416 --> 00:19:58.545
come up in a lot of our conversations.

00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:01.349
The people we study in
Madagascar and I go to Madagascar

00:20:01.349 --> 00:20:04.811
with David, I've not yet
been to see the Hadza,

00:20:04.811 --> 00:20:06.424
but when we got to Madagascar,

00:20:06.424 --> 00:20:08.924
those people are working really hard.

00:20:08.924 --> 00:20:12.546
We're of course, often
there in the harvest season

00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:16.946
and their activity levels
are incredibly high.

00:20:16.946 --> 00:20:20.215
We actually had the hypothesis
that they might sleep

00:20:20.215 --> 00:20:24.166
more than eight hours because
they don't have electricity

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:26.332
and I think that there'd
be an argument to say

00:20:26.332 --> 00:20:29.990
that they should sleep more
than a typical westerner

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.040
does just because of all
the physical activity

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.365
that they're undertaking,
hauling firewood,

00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:39.220
hauling water, you know,
harvesting these crops,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.152
bringing the crops in,
they're really working hard

00:20:42.152 --> 00:20:44.595
so I would actually expect
them to need more sleep

00:20:44.595 --> 00:20:47.637
than a typical westerner,
but I think these are

00:20:47.637 --> 00:20:49.715
really interesting questions

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.663
that we don't yet have answers to them,

00:20:52.663 --> 00:20:55.788
so very nice questions, thank you.

00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:57.560
(applause)

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.727
(pensive piano music)
