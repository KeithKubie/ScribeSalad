00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.730
They say that history can be stranger than
fiction, so it's no wonder so many hit movies

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.110
return to the past for their characters and
drama.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.840
But no matter how much modern filmmaker may
try to stay faithful to the source, some incredible

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.220
mistakes, changes, or downright insane inaccuracies
always slip through.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.010
Here are 10 Famous Movies That Got History
Wrong.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.070
Pocahontas

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.869
The songs are as classic as any Disney hit,
but the story of Pocahontas and John Smith's

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.630
romance is where this story departs from history.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.620
Mainly, because the Native American girl in
question was only 10 years old when John Smith

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.830
arrived in the New World.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.019
Thankfully, there was absolutely no romance
between them, just friendship - which kind

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.470
of makes Disney's decision to turn it into
a love story for the ages especially weird.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.470
Gladiator

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.089
The Roman epic actually did a good job of
portraying the idea of ancient Rome, but made

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.100
its biggest mistake in casting the villain
as a helpless, weak Emperor.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.920
The real Commodus was so insane a ruler, he
deserved to be the star.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
Renaming himself as the new Hercules, renaming
Rome after himself, and each of the months

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.150
for his own names, Commodus even took to the
gladiator arena himself, killing countless

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.370
exotic animals, battling other slaves, and
clubbing the poor to death.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.390
The crowds were stunned and confused, obviously,
but it was the fact that he paid himself from

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.360
Rome's treasury to appear that led to his
assassination - not by a proud gladiator,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.590
but a wrestler, during a bath.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.590
Titanic

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.310
Most audiences knew that the movie version
of Titanic's sinking was as much fiction as

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.190
fact, but when it came to First Officer William
Murdoch, director James Cameron's decision

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.390
to show his shooting passengers, then himself,
courted controversy.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.560
Cameron claimed it wasn't an act of cowardice,
but taking blame for the crash - except testimony

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.710
and inquires never determined who was truly
at fault - and just as many people view Murdoch

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.100
as a naval hero.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.520
His family protested the film with good reason,
showing how dangerous it can be to tell fictional

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.760
stories about actual people.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760
Argo

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.800
Ben Affleck's story of a fake movie crew infiltrating
Iran to rescue Americans won him the Oscar

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.480
- and some critics north of America's border.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.819
When the movie released giving the CIA the
credit, President Jimmy Carter came forward

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.340
to clarify that 90% of the idea and planning
came from Canadian intelligence.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.250
Affleck's character Tony Mendez still got
the hostages out, but the "Canadian Caper"

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.319
as it was later called wasn't the CIA masterpiece
the movie implied.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.040
Django Unchained

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.680
As over-the-top as the movie got, Quentin
Tarantino made sure that audiences would find

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.870
the scenes of slaves being forced to fight
to the death were as horrifying as they really

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.400
had been.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.790
Except that... they probably never happened.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.620
Tarantino named the movie "Mandingo" as one
of his favorites, but no American historians

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.980
have found any proof that slave owners would
ever engage in the practice, since it doesn't

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.640
even make economic sense in the larger slave
trade.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.560
We guess that's good news, since... it was
all pretty terrible.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.299
Pirates of the Caribbean

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.780
Being rich in the 1800s really was the life,
and for Elizabeth Swann, it even means red

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.129
hot coals are slid into bed with her to cook
her feet as she slept.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.470
In reality, bed warmers were filled with warm,
not hot coals, and only used to... well, warm

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.970
the bed before the sleeper got into it.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.849
But it's really the smallest mistake the movie
makes - it even has skeleton pirates.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.730
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.450
Every fan of Indiana Jones remembers his standoff
with Nazi soldier, threatening to blow up

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.029
the Ark with a bazooka over his shoulder.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:33.599
But when you realize that the movie's set
in 1936, and Germany was still years away

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.549
from designing the first rudimentary anti-tank
rocket launchers, it would be just as historically

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.510
accurate if Indy was holding a raygun.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.959
Sherlock Holmes

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.780
Guns are the culprit yet again, but it's the
small detail here that baffles us.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.469
In the opening sequence, the police can be
seen arming up with pistols and shotguns.

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.790
Shotguns, loaded with plastic shotgun shells.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.829
Since the guns of the era would have used
BRASS shells, and plastic ones weren't invented

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.309
until 1960, this mistake seems like an almost
impossible one to make.

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.650
Mulan

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.170
Disney got off the hook by setting their story
centuries in the past, and thousands of miles

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.969
from their usual locales, but the historical
mistakes followed.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:19.639
Not only is the writing Mulan paints onto
her arm Simplifed Chinese - created and implemented

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.810
in 1950 (at the beginning, leading up to the
matchmaker scene) - but the parts of the Great

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.400
Wall of China featured in the movie weren't
built until the 1300s, when the other medieval

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.629
Disney princesses were being kissed by prince
charmings.

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:30.680
The Revenant

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.840
There are plenty of small anachronisms to
point out in the movie, from zippers to American

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.080
accents and even wild boars roaming the wilderness,
when they weren't brought to North America

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.060
until the turn of the 20th Century.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.151
But our favorite is the idea that a hunter
could be mauled by a bear in the dead of winter,

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:48.770
when nearly all North American bears are hibernating.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.949
Those are just a few of our favorite historical
inaccuracies in hit movies, but there's plenty

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.210
more where they came from.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.789
