00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.230
Now, fair game play has always been a requirement of multi-player games.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.188
Although, it didn't always start that way. See back in the early 90s, video

00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:10.068
game players were actual able to tweak some of their perimeters to get an

00:00:10.068 --> 00:00:14.093
unfair advantage. Quake players, for example, would actually lower their

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:17.041
resolution on the graphics card to lowest quality setting, reducing the amount

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.769
of processing time required to process a frame, so they would actually get

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.170
higher frame rates. Another good example, that I'm not really, you know, bitter

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.022
about, or anything, was my Quake clan actually lost the last round of a very

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:31.058
expensive tournament because all of us were on dial-up while the other team was

00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:36.450
all on DSL. Again, this was back before cable modems, again, not that I'm

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.917
bitter about that. The point is, that unfair game-play makes it bad for

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:44.898
everyone and then makes bitter people get bald. Since then, multi-player games

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:47.758
have actually done a lot to reduce this kind of cheating and unfair advantage,

00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:52.004
but it is something that we had to worry about Inside of GRITS. See, if you're

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.734
actually using mouse controls, you have a lot more degrees of freedom because

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.170
there is more resolution to it than someone who is playing on a four pad

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.818
keyboard. We decided to actually attack this for GRITS because some of us were

00:01:01.818 --> 00:01:04.527
bitter about losing unfair games in the past, and actually lock the mouse to

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:08.831
the same directional output that you get from a keyboard. Ensuring that both

00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:11.954
players actually have a same and fair chance to play. Now, your designers

00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:14.642
should mostly take care of this, but if you're one of those types that likes to

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:17.372
design and program make sure you start from the beginning worrying about fair

00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:21.470
game play. Or you can create someone like this.
