00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.190
ED COPELAND: I'm going to
introduce pi in a way that I

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.570
don't think many people
have seen before.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.380
A friend of mine, David Tong,
told me about this.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.160
And I think it's really neat.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.020
And it involves rolling
balls at each other.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.810
Our thought experiment involves
just two balls.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.290
So there's a small ball, and
we'll give it a mass little m.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.260
And there's a big ball.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.560
And we'll give this mass a big
M. This is actually a 10-pin

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.720
bowling ball which I
believe you stole.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.830
Now, the idea is that this ball,
the big ball, is rolling

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.710
with some initial velocity.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.220
And it hits the little ball.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.480
Now the little ball moves
off and hits the wall.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.490
And it bounces elastically.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.430
That means that when it bounces
it doesn't lose any

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.600
kinetic energy or
any momentum.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.680
It bounces back.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.420
Meanwhile, the big ball
is carrying on.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.470
It hits the big ball.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.660
And then, of course,
it bounces back.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.550
The big ball--

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.590
it's imparted a little bit of
momentum to the big ball,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.460
which is now slowing down.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.800
It goes back, bounces again,
comes back, bounces back, goes

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.600
back, and just keeps
doing this.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.620
Eventually, the big ball slows
down enough that it stops and

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.190
at the next collision will
begin to go back.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.550
OK?

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.130
So the system is the ball's
coming in, there's a number of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.630
collisions, and then the
big ball eventually

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.230
bounces and goes back.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.820
What's that got to do with pi?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.313
The question is how many
collisions between the big

00:01:39.313 --> 00:01:43.340
ball and the little ball before
the big ball starts

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.480
going the other way.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.310
OK?

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.430
It's as simple as that.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.280
Now as long as the mass of
this big ball is quite

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.610
particular.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.900
In fact, it's given as--

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.740
in terms of the little mass,
it's given as 16 times 100 to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.910
the power N, where I'm going
to let this number N vary.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.280
So if N is 0, the big ball is
16 times the mass of the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.450
little ball.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.220
If n is 1, the big ball is 1,600
times the mass of the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.210
little ball.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.320
If N is 2, the mass is 160,000
times that of the little ball.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.520
So as long as you've got this
very particular mass, then it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.970
turns out that the number of
collisions between the big

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.400
ball and the little ball
is the first N

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.210
plus 1 digits of pi.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.470
So if N equals 0, then
the number of--

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.370
so the big ball is 16 times the
mass of the little ball,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.050
there'll be three collisions.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.715
If N is 1, so the big ball is
1,600 times that of the little

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:57.345
ball, and so there will
be 31 collisions.

00:02:57.345 --> 00:03:04.640
If N is 3, there'll
be 314 collisions.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.150
If N is 4, there'll be
3,141 collisions.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.620
What's remarkable about
this, I think, is

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.820
that this is exact.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.150
As long as N is an integer and
you let it get bigger and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.330
bigger and bigger, you will
get exactly the relevant

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.230
number of digits of pi.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.830
So if this was three grams,
and this is about 4.8

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.870
kilograms, then there would
be of order 31 collisions.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.080
So if I scale this up, so this
was a boulder of mass 480

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.320
kilograms, then there should be
314 collisions before the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.210
boulder begins to
go backwards.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.060
BRADY HARAN: I guess these
things are round and have

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.190
circumferences and pi,
so is that where this

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.660
is all coming from?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.950
ED COPELAND: It's got
nothing to do with

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.090
that, which is fantastic.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.040
In fact, if this was a point
object, with very massive--

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.440
and that was a point
object, the same

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.020
thing would still apply.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.710
The fact that it's round has
nothing to do with it.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.710
What is important is that the
collision is elastic, that it

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.160
conserves energy and conserves
and momentum.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.963
But it could be any shaped
object that would do that.

00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:18.680
BRADY HARAN: So this has nothing
to do with circles.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.850
ED COPELAND: This has nothing
at all to do with the circle

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.780
of this ball and the circle
of this ball.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.470
BRADY HARAN: So if that was a
cube or something else--?

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.010
ED COPELAND: I think, yes,
that would still work.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.610
As long as we're in the
collision, you've conserved

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.538
energy and momentum.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.671
BRADY HARAN: Ahh, I think
you're going to have to

00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:35.860
explain that.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.240
ED COPELAND: OK.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.800
Here we go.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.490
Let's try and make sense of two
balls hitting each other

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.890
and how we get pi out of it.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.940
Let's just draw it again.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.310
And so the idea is I have some
surface and then I have some

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.890
wall at the end.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.930
And I have a little ball of,
mass, little m, and I a big

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.090
ball of mass big M.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.680
And initially, the big ball is
moving with some velocity.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.270
Let's call it u.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.370
And it hits the little ball.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.720
And then what happens is the
little ball begins to go

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.580
towards the wall.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.190
Meanwhile, the big
ball carries on.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.285
The big ball is still moving.

00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:27.600
The little ball hits the
wall and comes back.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.400
And then it hits the
big ball again.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.750
And so the little ball bounces
back, hits this

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.020
wall, bounces back.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.030
I mean each time the little
ball hits the big ball, it

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.360
transfers a bit of its momentum
over to the big ball.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.290
Then the big ball
will slow down.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.870
And in fact, eventually, the
big ball will stop and will

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.810
begin to go the other way.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.240
And what we want to know is if
that happens after, say, p

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.200
steps, then how does p--

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.060
the number of collisions--

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.120
depend upon the mass
of the big ball?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.670
Now what's important here-- the
only bit that I've had to

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.150
throw in that I must say Brady
wasn't that impressed with

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.080
when I told him, but still
I think it's neat--

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.315
is that there's a very
particular value for the big

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:15.810
ball that we're interested in.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:26.550
The mass of the big ball is 16
times 100 to the power N times

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.540
the mass of the little ball.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:37.750
So if N equals 0, then the big
ball is just 16 times the mass

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.740
of the little ball.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:48.010
If N equals 1, then the big ball
is 1,600 times the mass

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.790
of the little ball.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.700
Then you get the idea.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:07:01.840
If N equals 2, then the big ball
is 160,000 times the mass

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.116
of the little ball.

00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:03.890
So rapidly--

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.510
BRADY HARAN: It jumps
up in hundreds.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.650
ED COPELAND: It jumps
up in hundreds.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.200
That's right.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.900
BRADY HARAN: Not tens.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.000
ED COPELAND: Not tens.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.850
Now, in each case, you can ask
how many steps, how many

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.170
collisions of the big ball and
the little ball are there

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.270
before the big ball starts
going in the opposite

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.450
direction, in other words,
before the big ball starts

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.160
going backwards.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.480
And the result is remarkable.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:34.030
So the number of steps when
N equals 0 is equal to 3.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.320
So the number of collisions
is 3.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:44.380
The number of collisions
when N equals 1 is 31.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:51.500
And the number of collisions
when N equals 2 is 314.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.200
And it goes on.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.250
It goes on so that for the
case of a general N, the

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:10.940
number of collisions is the
first N plus 1 digits of pi,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:16.760
pi being 3.141 dot
dot dot dot.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.040
And it's true for any N. So as
N goes towards infinity, you

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.920
just keep recovering the first
N plus 1 digits of pi.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.520
It's not an expansion or
anything like that.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.950
It's just the expression
that you get.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.380
BRADY HARAN: And nothing
to do with circles.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.400
ED COPELAND: Nothing
to do with circles.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.850
You can work out this, and the
key ingredients that you need,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.320
which we do at school, is you
need to remember that we have

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.650
conservation of energy
in the collision and

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.720
conservation of momentum.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.060
That's all we need
to make use of.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.710
And when you've got that, you
can work out the velocity of

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.590
the part of the big ball
after N collisions.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.280
It's possible to do that.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.930
And then the num-- which
I'll call Un.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:09.310
OK?

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:18.070
So after n collisions, the
big ball velocity is Un.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.782
And it turns out I can
work out what Un is.

00:09:21.782 --> 00:09:28.130
Un, after a bit of algebra, Un,
in terms of this initial

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.730
velocity, U0 is given
by the following.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.860
It's given by this fairly
simple expression--

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.630
I'll tell you what x is in a
minute, so don't panic, Brady.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.830
it's given by--

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.450
this bit's kind of irrelevant,
but the bit that's important

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.380
is the following.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.230
There's a cosine of
this angle theta.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:58.150
So x is just the ratio of the
little mass to the big mass.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.745
So it's generally going
to be very small.

00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:06.420
You can see that the largest
it's going to be is 1 over 16.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.020
And then it just gets really,
really small very quickly.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:14.930
So x is generally much
less than unity.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:26.900
So cos theta is equal to 1
minus x over 1 plus x.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.560
So everything is in terms
of x, this ratio.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.950
So how can I see when this ball
is going to start going

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.850
in the opposite direction?

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.910
And all I need to do that
is to remember what--

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.440
sorry, that's calls
cos n theta--

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.680
I missed that one important
n there--

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.450
that's cos of n theta,
not cos theta.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.330
All I need to do is look at
this cosine function.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.010
We know what the cosine looks
like from our school days.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.395
Cosine looks like
the following.

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:05.700
It's got, as a function
of some angle, alpha.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.420
The cosine of alpha
looks like this.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.605
It goes between 1 and minus 1.

00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:19.430
And it changes when
alpha is pi by 2.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.560
It goes from positive values to
negative values when alpha

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.570
is pi by 2.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.830
BRADY HARAN: That's
our smoking gun!

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.200
ED COPELAND: There
it is, Brady.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.780
Pis are coming in.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.740
So when n theta or alpha
is less than pi by

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.390
2, cosine is positive.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.950
So Un is positive.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.340
That means it's going
in that direction.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.620
But when n theta gets bigger
than pi by 2, cos

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.520
n theta goes negative.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.600
So Un goes negative.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.240
And it's beginning to go
in that direction.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:06.030
So when N is 0, it's the integer
part of 10 to the 0

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.860
times pi, which is just pi.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.030
And so the integer part
of that is 3.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.330
When N is 1, the number of
collisions is the integer part

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.040
of 10 times pi, which is 31.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:28.030
And when N is 2, it's the
integer part of 100 times pi,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.720
which is 314.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.370
And this is true for
any value of N.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.170
BRADY HARAN: And the
light went off.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.420
Perfect.
