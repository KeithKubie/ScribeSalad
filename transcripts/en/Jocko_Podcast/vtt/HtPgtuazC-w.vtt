00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.780
What's the dichotomy in having an ego?

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
When is it good and when does he get to a point where you have to check your
ego?

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.840
Okay,
so
the dichotomy is pretty clear.

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.240
Um,
ego drives you absolutely.

5
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.730
It makes you want to win.
It makes you want to perform well.

6
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.731
It makes you proud of your achievements made you want to be number one.

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.670
And those are all good things.
And I fully,

8
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.630
fully have those myself.
I mean,

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.660
my ego will keep me up at night trying to win at some ridiculously meaningless

10
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:45.090
thing in the world,
especially when I was younger.

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.300
It was kind of stupid.
Um,

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.770
but the ego can also get you in trouble,

13
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.150
get you in trouble really,
really quickly.
For instance,

14
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.310
I mean,
you can,

15
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.340
your ego can make you sabotage your coworker that's all on the same team as you

16
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.670
so that you can outshine him,
right?
That's ego.

17
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.980
You can vote down a plan,
a better plan,

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.240
because that plan isn't yours.
That's your ego.

19
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.183
You can

20
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.620
chase some material items,

21
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.000
some things,
something that you don't really need.

22
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.020
Maybe in some cases it might even be something that you don't actually even
want.

23
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.110
And it's just fueling your ego,
which is,
which is a really bizarre thing to see.

24
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.590
It can make you step on your subordinates,
right?

25
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.120
It can make you undercut your peers cause that eagle flares up.

26
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.010
It can make you,
your ego can make you dig in,

27
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.210
dig in on some stupid ideas that you've had.

28
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:02.100
Those are the kinds of things that ego too and all those things are negative.
So

29
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.290
that's pretty clear to me where ego starts going sideways and,

30
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.830
and I would say even though like my ego always fueled me to,
to,
to want to win,

31
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.790
but I never was that out of control where I was like screws and screwing people

32
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.100
over because I wanted to win.
Now I wouldn't do that.

33
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.450
That wasn't part of my personality wasn't,
I'm not that person.

34
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.380
I was never really naturally good at much.

35
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.800
So it wasn't like I was going to win the only way I could be people and things

36
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:33.420
was outworking them.
Yeah.
Other than that I,
it would be hard for me.
Yeah.

37
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.050
Usually that kind of person who like you,

38
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.980
well then the two kinds of people want who who is down to like screw someone

39
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.130
over or basically cheat cheating is what you're doing.

40
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.340
It's like I want to be here.

41
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.760
They don't necessarily want to quote unquote win because if you cheat it's not

42
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:51.594
really winning.

43
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.110
You know the whole benefit of winning is like overcoming certain things,

44
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.140
you know?
But when you cheat it's like you're not on any,
you cheated,
you know,

45
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:01.150
whatever.
So it's less about,

46
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.610
it's more about you understanding really what winning is and that's what you

47
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:10.980
like the winning,
you know?
Yes.
Yes.
Why so?

48
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.660
Like people under my,
you know,
cheat and do this stuff.

49
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:17.250
It's like they don't want to win.
Case in point where,

50
00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:21.480
I remember when when I was going to seal training,
there was people,

51
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.300
there was guys that would like brag about it.

52
00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:26.340
They were going through the same seal training class and me,

53
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:27.960
same buds classes meet what they would like,

54
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:32.100
brag about it and like you could hear him talking to let's say some random

55
00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:35.730
person.
Yeah,
we're on the seal training.
I wasn't bragging about that.

56
00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:37.290
I'm just like,
hey man,
I'm a lucky I'm here.

57
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.070
And I realize that a lot of those people quit because they were comfortable.

58
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.520
They did just being able to say like seal training,

59
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.110
they were already good with it.
They were like,
Oh yeah,

60
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:53.610
I did what I'm supposed to do.
So me,
I want,
I don't want to do that.

61
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.170
I don't want to say anything until I made it through.
Yeah.
And so,

62
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.830
um,
yeah,
so,
so what I'm saying is similar to what you're saying,

63
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.420
they were satisfied just by being able to throw that out there,

64
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.650
that was enough for them.

65
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.960
So for someone that's willing to cheat and when are there,

66
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:13.560
either they're willing to step on someone.
Man,
it doesn't feel good to me.

67
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.720
That's never felt good to me.
Like if I got to step on someone,

68
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.510
I don't even want it.
I don't want that victory,
don't want it.

69
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.780
So it's like they want to,

70
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.190
some people want to look like they won and other people want to really win.
Yeah,

71
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:28.510
of course.
That's really the difference.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

72
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.330
So back to the ego point,

73
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.570
when you start feeling like you're doing some of those negative things,

74
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.510
that's when you've got to put your ego in check.

75
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.660
That's what you got to support your coworker instead of sabotaging.

76
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.250
And that's when you got to pick the best plan out there instead of picking your

77
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:50.740
own.
That's when you say,
do you know what,

78
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:55.741
I'm happy with what I have in state of chasing things that I don't even need.

79
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.760
You know what I'm talking about when people like if you were,

80
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.060
there's been something that you wanted even though you actually didn't even

81
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.990
really want to put,
you just want it just cause you cause it's pure ego.
Your Ego.

82
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.780
Yeah.
Like when you're in the weight room,
well growing up like lifting weights,

83
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:15.520
some guys would do this where they'd be lifting weights and you can see a lot of

84
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:20.521
times in these like like a 24 hour fitness situation where you'd be live guys,

85
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.160
we'll be lifting weights.
And then one guy was,
he's like Dang,

86
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.270
he's lifting kind of a lot.

87
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.880
You'll see someone all of a sudden be doing that same exercise.

88
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.730
Like trying to live more than that.
He doesn't know him not lifting with him.

89
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.160
He wasn't even doing that exercise.
It wasn't even his workup,

90
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:34.510
but he'll like try to do it.
You know,

91
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.430
probably you weren't even doing that exercise.

92
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.140
You weren't doing bench today and now you're doing bench chasing something.

93
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.300
You don't even worry.
Don't even need it that day.
Don't need it that day.
Uh,

94
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.850
that's another big one is like when I talked about subordinates,

95
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.700
instead of cutting down your subordinates,
you start lifting them up,

96
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.760
you start making them shine,
you start giving them the credit,

97
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:59.150
making them shine even brighter than yourself.
That's,

98
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.370
that's the beautiful thing.

99
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.740
When you can put your ego in check and you can make that happen.

100
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.050
Making your own boss look good,
having an open mind to new ideas.

101
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:13.490
Those are the things.
That's how you put your ego in check.
Those are the things.

102
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.210
Those are the,
those are the hallmarks of having your ego in check.
Now,

103
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:26.200
sometimes people don't know when they need to put their ego in check.

104
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:31.201
And I think there is one really easy indicator to know when you need to just at

105
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:36.040
least like do an assessment of your ego.

106
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.100
And that is when you come into conflict with another person cause cause a huge

107
00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:44.710
percentage of conflicts that you have with other people.

108
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.230
Our Ego Ego.

109
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.300
And so when you feel that conflict,
whether it's about positioning,

110
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:56.020
whether it's about an idea,
whether it's about a plan,
whether it's about,

111
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.490
oh no matter what it's about,
but if I'm in conflict with you on something,

112
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.670
I immediately,
I'm going to say,
okay,
wait a second,

113
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.680
is this your ego talking or are you,
is is this business or is this ego?
Yeah.

114
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.310
And if you do that,
you will find yourself,
you know,

115
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:17.311
any form of frustration or anger that you have.

116
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.680
Just check your ego and there's a good chance that you're going to be able to

117
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.160
take that thing,
get ahold of it and aggressively put it in check.
It's hard.

118
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.100
Your ego is a tough bastard.
Your ego man,

119
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:30.880
that thing wants the spotlight.
It wants to shine.

120
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:33.880
It wants the glory and it's,
it's driven.
You know,

121
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.130
that's a lot of you high achievers out there.

122
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.010
That's what's driving you and that's not a bad thing.

123
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.390
So when it comes time to harness that bad boy,
it can be a challenge.

124
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.400
But it's very rewarding when you make it happen.
It's,

125
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.490
it's rewarding in a long term gratification.

126
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.930
It's not immediate gratification generally.
You know,
you're given,

127
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.060
you're given your subordinates to all the credit for some,

128
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.710
for some project that they did.

129
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.930
You know that you could actually know that you did the bulk of the work.

130
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.370
Would you give it away?
That's not gratifying.
Immediately.
Immediately as like,

131
00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:13.030
yeah,
that's right.
Put the accolades on my head loss.

132
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.920
That's immediate gratification that you're looking for.
No.
You say,
Hey boss,

133
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:20.920
you know what?
Don't put the accolades on my head.
Look at my team,

134
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.940
let's crown them.
Cause they really did a great job.
You know,

135
00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:26.770
I'm just here to help them.
There's no gratification that,

136
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.080
but when you get feed back a week later,
a month later,
six months later,

137
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.910
people want to come and work for your team.

138
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:35.740
Now your team gets picked for another project.

139
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.240
That's the longterm gratification that you get when you keep your ego in check.

140
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.283
Yeah.

141
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.800
<v 1>Okay.
Keep</v>

142
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.980
<v 0>that ego and check people meal.</v>
