00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.200
So we've talked about how to make our
game easy to play and very engaging.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.340
But the best games also need to
reach as many people as possible.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.690
&gt;&gt; For example, our game where we
bounce a ball through a ring of fire

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.880
is obviously brilliant, but it's so
new that no one knows about it yet.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.290
And you can't get someone interested in
your game if they haven't heard of it.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.500
You need fans.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.040
So what makes a player a fan?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.080
&gt;&gt; Fans of players that help
spread the word about your game

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.740
by telling their friends about it.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.270
And then those friends tell
their friends and on and on.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.110
&gt;&gt; And how can we get fans like that?

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.040
&gt;&gt; Well, word of mouth is one
simple way to grow your fan base.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.090
Many developers also do outreach on
social media to reach a wider audience.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.330
But they keep their fans
by creating ways for

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.320
them to influence the content of
that very game and improve it.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.010
&gt;&gt; And by making your game better and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.640
promoting it,
fans can help your game make money.
