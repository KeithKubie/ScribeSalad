great little sample app there's some
code there and you can just see what

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470
code there and you can just see what
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.010
code there and you can just see what
what it basically looks like you'll

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020
what it basically looks like you'll
 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.659
what it basically looks like you'll
notice that there are some scrolling

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669
notice that there are some scrolling
 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.129
notice that there are some scrolling
tricks that we've been implementing with

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139
tricks that we've been implementing with
 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.140
tricks that we've been implementing with
our apps so as they scroll down here

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150
our apps so as they scroll down here
 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.330
our apps so as they scroll down here
you'll notice that that the little white

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340
you'll notice that that the little white
 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.370
you'll notice that that the little white
bar disappears but as soon as they pull

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380
bar disappears but as soon as they pull
 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.800
bar disappears but as soon as they pull
down the white bar shows up again so

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810
down the white bar shows up again so
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.629
down the white bar shows up again so
it's kind of like a floating or dock bar

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639
it's kind of like a floating or dock bar
 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.580
it's kind of like a floating or dock bar
across the top but there's a sticky

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590
across the top but there's a sticky
 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.390
across the top but there's a sticky
version of it as well so it's a it's

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400
version of it as well so it's a it's
 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.490
version of it as well so it's a it's
some really nice source code there so

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500
some really nice source code there so
 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.590
some really nice source code there so
you can see if it's worth implementing

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600
you can see if it's worth implementing
 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.540
you can see if it's worth implementing
or something that you consider to be

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550
or something that you consider to be
 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.270
or something that you consider to be
useful for your apps we use it in the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280
useful for your apps we use it in the
 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.210
useful for your apps we use it in the
Google Play client actually another one

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220
Google Play client actually another one
 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.550
Google Play client actually another one
is that is what we call the pin or

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560
is that is what we call the pin or
 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.210
is that is what we call the pin or
progress so it's something that that we

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220
progress so it's something that that we
 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.170
progress so it's something that that we
sort of introduced in the Google movies

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180
sort of introduced in the Google movies
 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.690
sort of introduced in the Google movies
client and you'll notice that as your

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700
client and you'll notice that as your
 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.940
client and you'll notice that as your
and as well as books actually so as

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950
and as well as books actually so as
 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.950
and as well as books actually so as
you're downloading content you get this

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960
you're downloading content you get this
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.080
you're downloading content you get this
little pin which is what you toggle to

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090
little pin which is what you toggle to
 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.150
little pin which is what you toggle to
say whether to download or not and the

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160
say whether to download or not and the
 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.909
say whether to download or not and the
progress bar starts to fill up so Roman

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919
progress bar starts to fill up so Roman
 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.620
progress bar starts to fill up so Roman
again put together some some great

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630
again put together some some great
 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.460
again put together some some great
sample code and you can you can go and

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470
sample code and you can you can go and
 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.159
sample code and you can you can go and
grab it from the URL that's just

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169
grab it from the URL that's just
 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.170
grab it from the URL that's just
displayed here as well it's just a

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180
displayed here as well it's just a
 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.000
displayed here as well it's just a
shortened version but you can just

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010
shortened version but you can just
 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.650
shortened version but you can just
follow Roman on google+ so with that

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660
follow Roman on google+ so with that
 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.330
follow Roman on google+ so with that
being said that's pretty much the

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340
being said that's pretty much the
 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.159
being said that's pretty much the
biggest things that have happened from

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169
biggest things that have happened from
 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.430
biggest things that have happened from
from our side of the Android developer

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440
from our side of the Android developer
 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.290
from our side of the Android developer
ecosystem I know there's been plenty of

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300
ecosystem I know there's been plenty of
 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.210
ecosystem I know there's been plenty of
things in the community side ah the

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220
things in the community side ah the
 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.230
things in the community side ah the
other thing we're going to do today

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240
other thing we're going to do today
 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.520
other thing we're going to do today
that's that's a bit different is that

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530
that's that's a bit different is that
 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.830
that's that's a bit different is that
we're going to have a message from our

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
we're going to have a message from our
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.779
we're going to have a message from our
sponsor and our sponsor this week is the

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789
sponsor and our sponsor this week is the
 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.600
sponsor and our sponsor this week is the
Android manifest file so we thought we'd

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610
Android manifest file so we thought we'd
 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.620
Android manifest file so we thought we'd
share some pro tips with you guys and

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630
share some pro tips with you guys and
 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.270
share some pro tips with you guys and
because there has been some confusion in

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280
because there has been some confusion in
 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.190
because there has been some confusion in
the past and ways to really optimize

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200
the past and ways to really optimize
 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.910
the past and ways to really optimize
your

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920
your
 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.640
your
your development so we thought we'd

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650
your development so we thought we'd
 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.620
your development so we thought we'd
share those with you we're going to

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630
share those with you we're going to
 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.030
share those with you we're going to
start off by talking about users SDK so

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040
start off by talking about users SDK so
 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.650
start off by talking about users SDK so
users SDK is a tag that you'd have in

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660
users SDK is a tag that you'd have in
 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.090
users SDK is a tag that you'd have in
your manifest file and there's a couple

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100
your manifest file and there's a couple
 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.290
your manifest file and there's a couple
of attributes on there that are quite

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300
of attributes on there that are quite
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.260
of attributes on there that are quite
important and they can really make some

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270
important and they can really make some
 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.570
important and they can really make some
some dramatic impacts to your to your

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580
some dramatic impacts to your to your
 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.300
some dramatic impacts to your to your
apps compatibility and availability on

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310
apps compatibility and availability on
 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.220
apps compatibility and availability on
Google Play so let's let's get started

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230
Google Play so let's let's get started
 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.700
Google Play so let's let's get started
the first one is the minimum SDK version

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710
the first one is the minimum SDK version
 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.330
the first one is the minimum SDK version
or we stated as min SDK version so what

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340
or we stated as min SDK version so what
 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.160
or we stated as min SDK version so what
it is is it it basically tells the

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170
it is is it it basically tells the
 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.620
it is is it it basically tells the
device that hate that this app needs a

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630
device that hate that this app needs a
 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.340
device that hate that this app needs a
minimum version of this API level to be

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.350
minimum version of this API level to be
 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.980
minimum version of this API level to be
able to run now when you specify the

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990
able to run now when you specify the
 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.500
able to run now when you specify the
minimum SDK version in your manifest

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.510
minimum SDK version in your manifest
 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.220
minimum SDK version in your manifest
file it is up to you as the developer to

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230
file it is up to you as the developer to
 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.350
file it is up to you as the developer to
ensure that you're not calling api's

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360
ensure that you're not calling api's
 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.840
ensure that you're not calling api's
that are not supported in that SDK

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:38.850
that are not supported in that SDK
 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.080
that are not supported in that SDK
version or if you are you're putting

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.090
version or if you are you're putting
 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.610
version or if you are you're putting
version gates around them so you are

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620
version gates around them so you are
 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.730
version gates around them so you are
checking that that particular API is

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740
checking that that particular API is
 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.530
checking that that particular API is
available on that version of the

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.540
available on that version of the
 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.020
available on that version of the
platform now the good thing is that once

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.030
platform now the good thing is that once
 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.510
platform now the good thing is that once
you start using the SDK version if

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520
you start using the SDK version if
 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.340
you start using the SDK version if
you're using more recent version of the

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.350
you're using more recent version of the
 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.530
you're using more recent version of the
Android developer tools we added Lynch

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:57.540
Android developer tools we added Lynch
 

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.260
Android developer tools we added Lynch
support so lint is a compile-time check

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.270
support so lint is a compile-time check
 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.300
support so lint is a compile-time check
the guys and sees if you're doing

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.310
the guys and sees if you're doing
 

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.380
the guys and sees if you're doing
anything anything not quite right with

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:06.390
anything anything not quite right with
 

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.060
anything anything not quite right with
your source code so this is an example

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.070
your source code so this is an example
 

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.860
your source code so this is an example
where what it'll do is it'll actually

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:09.870
where what it'll do is it'll actually
 

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.880
where what it'll do is it'll actually
check what the minimum SDK version that

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:13.890
check what the minimum SDK version that
 

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.560
check what the minimum SDK version that
has been specified in your manifest is

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:15.570
has been specified in your manifest is
 

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.450
has been specified in your manifest is
and to see whether you're calling any

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460
and to see whether you're calling any
 

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.580
and to see whether you're calling any
particular API is that are not supported

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:19.590
particular API is that are not supported
 

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.500
particular API is that are not supported
in that minimum SDK version so it's a

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:21.510
in that minimum SDK version so it's a
 

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.760
in that minimum SDK version so it's a
really nice handy tool and those

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:22.770
really nice handy tool and those
 

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.470
really nice handy tool and those
warnings should definitely be actioned

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:26.480
warnings should definitely be actioned
 

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.090
warnings should definitely be actioned
the thing about the minimum SDK version

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.100
the thing about the minimum SDK version
 

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.030
the thing about the minimum SDK version
is that when a user goes to install an

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.040
is that when a user goes to install an
 

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.250
is that when a user goes to install an
APK so let's say your side loading a nap

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260
APK so let's say your side loading a nap
 

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.640
APK so let's say your side loading a nap
the operating system will actually check

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:37.650
the operating system will actually check
 

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.060
the operating system will actually check
whether it is a version that's higher

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.070
whether it is a version that's higher
 

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.219
whether it is a version that's higher
than the or higher greater than or equal

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:43.229
than the or higher greater than or equal
 

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.770
than the or higher greater than or equal
to the minimum SDK version so the

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:45.780
to the minimum SDK version so the
 

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.450
to the minimum SDK version so the
operating system itself will confirm

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:47.460
operating system itself will confirm
 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.510
operating system itself will confirm
that Google Play also does this so if

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:50.520
that Google Play also does this so if
 

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.820
that Google Play also does this so if
there's if you're running on let's say a

there's if you're running on let's say a
 

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.970
there's if you're running on let's say a
gingerbread device and a minimum SDK has

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980
gingerbread device and a minimum SDK has
 

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.990

app on google play on your gingerbread

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:01.890
app on google play on your gingerbread
 

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.160
app on google play on your gingerbread
device play won't actually show that

device play won't actually show that
 

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.310
device play won't actually show that
that app actually if you go to the web

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320
that app actually if you go to the web
 

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.410

you you search for that particular app
 

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.980
you you search for that particular app
you'll notice that when you try to

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:12.990
you'll notice that when you try to
 

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.750
you'll notice that when you try to
install the app through the web version

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760
install the app through the web version
 

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.300
install the app through the web version
there's a way you can choose which

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:17.310
there's a way you can choose which
 

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.820
there's a way you can choose which
device you want to install to it won't

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:19.830
device you want to install to it won't
 

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.070

actually present devices that are below

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080
actually present devices that are below
 

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.700
actually present devices that are below
that minimum SDK version so by default

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:25.710
that minimum SDK version so by default
 

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.490
that minimum SDK version so by default
the the value that's there it's an

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500
the the value that's there it's an
 

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.560
the the value that's there it's an
implicit value that defaults to one

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:30.570
implicit value that defaults to one
 

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.660
implicit value that defaults to one
which means it supports every version of

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:32.670
which means it supports every version of
 

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.900
which means it supports every version of
Android but we always in terms of best

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:35.910
Android but we always in terms of best
 

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.640
Android but we always in terms of best
practices we recommend that you

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:37.650
practices we recommend that you
 

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.980
practices we recommend that you
explicitly specify the minimum SDK

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:39.990
explicitly specify the minimum SDK
 

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.530
explicitly specify the minimum SDK
version and it's also a way for you to

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540
version and it's also a way for you to
 

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.000
version and it's also a way for you to
make sure that you're targeting the

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.010
make sure that you're targeting the
 

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.450
make sure that you're targeting the
rights that abuses if you have a very

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:46.460
rights that abuses if you have a very
 

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.720
rights that abuses if you have a very
media heavy app for example or an app

media heavy app for example or an app
that you know requires a certain level

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.070
that you know requires a certain level
 

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.890
that you know requires a certain level
of device minimum SDK is one way to do

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:57.900
of device minimum SDK is one way to do
 

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.230
of device minimum SDK is one way to do
it one way to check to ensure that it

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240
it one way to check to ensure that it
 

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.400
it one way to check to ensure that it
doesn't get installed on the wrong

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:01.410
doesn't get installed on the wrong
 

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.329
doesn't get installed on the wrong
device so please you know go and

00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339
device so please you know go and
 

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:08.600
device so please you know go and
explicitly specify minimum SDK you might

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:08.610
explicitly specify minimum SDK you might
 

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.860
explicitly specify minimum SDK you might
be looking at that in saying well it's

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:09.870
be looking at that in saying well it's
 

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.720
be looking at that in saying well it's
not there by default so why do I need it

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:11.730
not there by default so why do I need it
 

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.960
not there by default so why do I need it
well the next bit of useful information

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:14.970
well the next bit of useful information
 

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.040
well the next bit of useful information
is the target SDK the target SDK is is

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.050
is the target SDK the target SDK is is
 

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.980
is the target SDK the target SDK is is
basically saying to about you're saying

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:21.990
basically saying to about you're saying
 

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.020
basically saying to about you're saying
by specifying a target SDK that this

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.030
by specifying a target SDK that this
 

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.170
by specifying a target SDK that this
particular app is guaranteed to run on a

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180
particular app is guaranteed to run on a
 

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.930
particular app is guaranteed to run on a
particular API level and the reason that

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940
particular API level and the reason that
 

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.300
particular API level and the reason that
you should be should be stating it is

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.310
you should be should be stating it is
 

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.579
you should be should be stating it is
that it actually enables a whole bunch

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:34.589
that it actually enables a whole bunch
 

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:36.950
that it actually enables a whole bunch
of features in the background so what we

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:36.960
of features in the background so what we
 

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.510
of features in the background so what we
recommend and we're going to talk about

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:38.520
recommend and we're going to talk about
 

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.700
recommend and we're going to talk about
what some of those features are what we

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:40.710
what some of those features are what we
 

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.620
what some of those features are what we
recommend in terms of our best practices

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:42.630
recommend in terms of our best practices
 

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.150
recommend in terms of our best practices
is that you should always set your

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160
is that you should always set your
 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.000
is that you should always set your
target SDK version in your app to be the

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.010
target SDK version in your app to be the
 

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.000
target SDK version in your app to be the
latest version of Android okay just

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.010
latest version of Android okay just
 

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.300
latest version of Android okay just
because you said it to let's say 15 api

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:53.310
because you said it to let's say 15 api
 

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.730
because you said it to let's say 15 api
api level 15 if you try to install them

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740
api level 15 if you try to install them
 

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.190
api level 15 if you try to install them
on let's say a gingerbread device which

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200
on let's say a gingerbread device which
 

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.420
on let's say a gingerbread device which
is api level 9 it's not going to

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:02.430
is api level 9 it's not going to
 

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.449
is api level 9 it's not going to
actually prevent it from running what it

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459
actually prevent it from running what it
 

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:07.460
actually prevent it from running what it
will do is that it will default back to

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.470
will do is that it will default back to
 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.710
will do is that it will default back to
the API level 9 behavior on those API

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720
the API level 9 behavior on those API
 

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.580
the API level 9 behavior on those API
level 9

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:10.590
level 9
 

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.310
level 9
devices and this is where minimum SDK

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320
devices and this is where minimum SDK
 

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.380
devices and this is where minimum SDK
helps because what you do is you use the

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:15.390
helps because what you do is you use the
 

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.020
helps because what you do is you use the
minimum SDK to specify what's the lowest

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.030
minimum SDK to specify what's the lowest
 

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.210
minimum SDK to specify what's the lowest
version or oldest version of Android

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220
version or oldest version of Android
 

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.400
version or oldest version of Android
that you can run and you use target SDK

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:22.410
that you can run and you use target SDK
 

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.860
that you can run and you use target SDK
to specify the one that you're really

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:24.870
to specify the one that you're really
 

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.440
to specify the one that you're really
targeting now remember earlier I said

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:27.450
targeting now remember earlier I said
 

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.880
targeting now remember earlier I said
that there will be some features that it

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:28.890
that there will be some features that it
 

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.390
that there will be some features that it
enables so let's talk about some of

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:32.400
enables so let's talk about some of
 

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.900
enables so let's talk about some of
those if you target API level 11 or

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:35.910
those if you target API level 11 or
 

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.310
those if you target API level 11 or
greater you actually get some nice

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320
greater you actually get some nice
 

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.890
greater you actually get some nice
benefits it enables the holo theme for

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:39.900
benefits it enables the holo theme for
 

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.290
benefits it enables the holo theme for
example in your app so that your all of

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300
example in your app so that your all of
 

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.290
example in your app so that your all of
your UI controls look modern look up to

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300
your UI controls look modern look up to
 

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.180
your UI controls look modern look up to
date they don't look like the

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.190
date they don't look like the
 

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.310
date they don't look like the
gingerbread versions so for those apps

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320
gingerbread versions so for those apps
 

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.260
gingerbread versions so for those apps
that you've seen occasionally running on

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:51.270
that you've seen occasionally running on
 

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.030
that you've seen occasionally running on
your ice cream sandwich devices that

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040
your ice cream sandwich devices that
 

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.400
your ice cream sandwich devices that
seem to have gingerbread looking buttons

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:55.410
seem to have gingerbread looking buttons
 

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.100
seem to have gingerbread looking buttons
it's because they haven't specified a

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:58.110
it's because they haven't specified a
 

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.760
it's because they haven't specified a
target SDK version of 11 or higher so

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:01.770
target SDK version of 11 or higher so
 

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.530
target SDK version of 11 or higher so
it's really important that you do go and

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540
it's really important that you do go and
 

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.750
it's really important that you do go and
enable it so you get the holo theme then

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760
enable it so you get the holo theme then
 

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.250
enable it so you get the holo theme then
there's a screen compatibility mode

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260
there's a screen compatibility mode
 

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.690
there's a screen compatibility mode
which is all about saying whether you

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700
which is all about saying whether you
 

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.670
which is all about saying whether you
want your app to stretch to fit or zoom

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680
want your app to stretch to fit or zoom
 

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.360
want your app to stretch to fit or zoom
to fit and the more interesting one now

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.370
to fit and the more interesting one now
 

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.820
to fit and the more interesting one now
is obviously the legacy menu button so

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:16.830
is obviously the legacy menu button so

have a physical menu button if you try

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000
have a physical menu button if you try
 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.690
have a physical menu button if you try
to run in a legacy app and older app

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700
to run in a legacy app and older app
 

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.380
to run in a legacy app and older app
with a on your on these newer devices

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:33.390
with a on your on these newer devices
 

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.060
with a on your on these newer devices
what you'll find is that in your

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.070
what you'll find is that in your
 

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.180
what you'll find is that in your
navigation bar you get a little menu

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:38.190
navigation bar you get a little menu
 

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.460
navigation bar you get a little menu
button it looks like the overflow button

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:40.470
button it looks like the overflow button
 

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.960
button it looks like the overflow button
but it's the menu button that's the

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:41.970
but it's the menu button that's the
 

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.580
but it's the menu button that's the
legacy menu button and it's something

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:43.590
legacy menu button and it's something
 

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.050
legacy menu button and it's something
that really you should be moving away

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060
that really you should be moving away
 

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.510
that really you should be moving away
from and moving towards using the action

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:47.520
from and moving towards using the action
 

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.480
from and moving towards using the action
bar so target SDK version is what you

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:50.490
bar so target SDK version is what you
 

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.520
bar so target SDK version is what you
use as soon as you specify 11 or greater

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:52.530
use as soon as you specify 11 or greater
 

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.670
use as soon as you specify 11 or greater
it'll it'll enable these things on the

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680
it'll it'll enable these things on the
 

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.220
it'll it'll enable these things on the
newer versions of the platform if you

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:58.230
newer versions of the platform if you
 

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.380
newer versions of the platform if you
target 14 or higher you'll automatically

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:00.390
target 14 or higher you'll automatically
 

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.140
target 14 or higher you'll automatically
get hardware acceleration unless you

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.150
get hardware acceleration unless you
 

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.180
get hardware acceleration unless you
explicitly mentioned that you don't want

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.190
explicitly mentioned that you don't want
 

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.100
explicitly mentioned that you don't want
hardware acceleration in your app but

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.110
hardware acceleration in your app but
 

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.130
hardware acceleration in your app but
there are very few scenarios that that

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:10.140
there are very few scenarios that that
 

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.840
there are very few scenarios that that
we found where you wouldn't want that

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:11.850
we found where you wouldn't want that
 

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.360
we found where you wouldn't want that
hardware acceleration so really you know

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.370
hardware acceleration so really you know
 

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.040
hardware acceleration so really you know
try and follow these best practices of

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.050
try and follow these best practices of
 

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.200
try and follow these best practices of
keeping the target SDK version up to the

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.210
keeping the target SDK version up to the
 

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.360
keeping the target SDK version up to the
maximum version now you might be asking

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:20.370
maximum version now you might be asking
 

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.730
maximum version now you might be asking
yourself well if this is how it works

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740
yourself well if this is how it works
 

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.410
yourself well if this is how it works
why doesn't it implicitly

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:24.420
why doesn't it implicitly
 

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.160
why doesn't it implicitly
target the newest version all the time

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.170
target the newest version all the time
 

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.329
target the newest version all the time
the reason is because there can be

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339
the reason is because there can be
 

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:31.639
the reason is because there can be
changes in behavior so when we make

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:31.649
changes in behavior so when we make
 

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:33.850
changes in behavior so when we make
certain changes in behavior to the

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:33.860
certain changes in behavior to the
 

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.639
certain changes in behavior to the
android framework we we make sure that

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:37.649
android framework we we make sure that
 

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:40.699
android framework we we make sure that
we keep the existing behavior for if the

00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:40.709
we keep the existing behavior for if the
 

00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:44.060
we keep the existing behavior for if the
app is targeting all the API levels so

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.070
app is targeting all the API levels so
 

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.519
app is targeting all the API levels so
an example of changes in behavior is

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:46.529
an example of changes in behavior is
 

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:48.650
an example of changes in behavior is
that we change the async cast threading

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660
that we change the async cast threading
 

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.560
that we change the async cast threading
model in API 13 where instead of having

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:51.570
model in API 13 where instead of having
 

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.780
model in API 13 where instead of having
a pool of threads that that executes

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:53.790
a pool of threads that that executes
 

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.540
a pool of threads that that executes
async task we use a single thread that

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:56.550
async task we use a single thread that
 

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.240
async task we use a single thread that
runs async task serially but still in a

00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.250
runs async task serially but still in a
 

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.550
runs async task serially but still in a
separate thread so there can be minor

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560
separate thread so there can be minor
 

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.110
separate thread so there can be minor
changes in behavior and so that's why we

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120
changes in behavior and so that's why we
 

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.110
changes in behavior and so that's why we
recommend that you do not only do you

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120
recommend that you do not only do you
 

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.150
recommend that you do not only do you
update to the latest API level in your

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160
update to the latest API level in your
 

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.610
update to the latest API level in your
target SDK version but you do go through

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620
target SDK version but you do go through
 

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.610
target SDK version but you do go through
your full test cycle but as I said the

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620
your full test cycle but as I said the
 

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.829
your full test cycle but as I said the
benefits are great yeah one thing i want

00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839
benefits are great yeah one thing i want
 

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:18.230
benefits are great yeah one thing i want
to add this also like for example the

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240
to add this also like for example the
 

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.050
to add this also like for example the
action bar when you enable a set target

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060
action bar when you enable a set target
 

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.720
action bar when you enable a set target
SDK to greater than y 11 so action Bob

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:23.730
SDK to greater than y 11 so action Bob
 

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.139
SDK to greater than y 11 so action Bob
will be something will be enabled like

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:27.149
will be something will be enabled like
 

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:31.810
will be something will be enabled like
at that point so when so if your app

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:31.820
at that point so when so if your app
 

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.790
at that point so when so if your app
hasn't been tasked on the later version

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800
hasn't been tasked on the later version
 

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800
hasn't been tasked on the later version
so make sure you test your app as well

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:36.810
so make sure you test your app as well
 

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.350
so make sure you test your app as well
because that made them in that will have

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360
because that made them in that will have
 

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.850
because that made them in that will have
an impact on the UI of your application

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:42.860
an impact on the UI of your application
 

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.689
an impact on the UI of your application
yeah thanks Tony so the last one is the

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699
yeah thanks Tony so the last one is the
 

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:50.689
yeah thanks Tony so the last one is the
max SDK version and actually as of

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699
max SDK version and actually as of
 

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:53.900
max SDK version and actually as of
android 2.0 point one the operating

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:53.910
android 2.0 point one the operating
 

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.819
android 2.0 point one the operating
system doesn't even look at the max SDK

00:14:55.819 --> 00:14:55.829
system doesn't even look at the max SDK
 

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:58.910
system doesn't even look at the max SDK
version it's only used in Google Play so

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920
version it's only used in Google Play so
 

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.769
version it's only used in Google Play so
what happens is if you specify max SDK

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779
what happens is if you specify max SDK
 

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:03.680
what happens is if you specify max SDK
version it means that Google Play won't

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:03.690
version it means that Google Play won't
 

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.769
version it means that Google Play won't
often devices that are running newer

00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779
often devices that are running newer
 

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:10.550
often devices that are running newer
versions of the APAP sorry newer version

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560
versions of the APAP sorry newer version
 

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.889
versions of the APAP sorry newer version
of the API it won't offer your app this

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899
of the API it won't offer your app this
 

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:15.410
of the API it won't offer your app this
particular app to those devices so

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420
particular app to those devices so
 

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.780
particular app to those devices so
you're kind of saying hey it'll only run

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:17.790
you're kind of saying hey it'll only run
 

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.850
you're kind of saying hey it'll only run
up to ice cream sandwich and not not any

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860
up to ice cream sandwich and not not any
 

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.370
up to ice cream sandwich and not not any
further than that and really as an

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380
further than that and really as an
 

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.350
further than that and really as an
Android app developer what you want to

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360
Android app developer what you want to
 

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.259
Android app developer what you want to
be doing is maximizing the the number of

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:27.269
be doing is maximizing the the number of
 

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:30.259
be doing is maximizing the the number of
people well maximizing the number of

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:30.269
people well maximizing the number of
 

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:31.610
people well maximizing the number of
people that can install your app right

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620
people that can install your app right
 

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.680
people that can install your app right
so you don't want to be specifying these

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:33.690
so you don't want to be specifying these
 

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.470
so you don't want to be specifying these
max SDK versions because remember what i

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480
max SDK versions because remember what i
 

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.150
max SDK versions because remember what i
said when you're using target

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160
said when you're using target
 

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.280
said when you're using target
sdk version and you're fixing it to a

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.290
sdk version and you're fixing it to a
 

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.230
sdk version and you're fixing it to a
particular value we will can we will

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240
particular value we will can we will
 

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.079
particular value we will can we will
ensure that you get this same behavior

00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:45.089
ensure that you get this same behavior
 

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:48.050
ensure that you get this same behavior
so that async task change that I

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060
so that async task change that I
 

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.210
so that async task change that I
mentioned before if your target SDK

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220
mentioned before if your target SDK
 

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.610
mentioned before if your target SDK
version isn't 13 or greater you will get

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620
version isn't 13 or greater you will get
 

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.040
version isn't 13 or greater you will get
the older behavior so in general we

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.050
the older behavior so in general we
 

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.960
the older behavior so in general we
don't actually recommend you use max SDK

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:56.970
don't actually recommend you use max SDK
 

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.809
don't actually recommend you use max SDK
version and the only real situation that

00:15:59.809 --> 00:15:59.819
version and the only real situation that
 

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:02.360
version and the only real situation that
that we've that that I can come up with

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:02.370
that we've that that I can come up with
 

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.189
that we've that that I can come up with
where you might want to use it if you're

00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199
where you might want to use it if you're
 

00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:06.920
where you might want to use it if you're
using multi APK support so in play

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:06.930
using multi APK support so in play
 

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.030
using multi APK support so in play
you're kind of saying well I've got

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040
you're kind of saying well I've got
 

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.189
you're kind of saying well I've got
different apks targeting different

00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199
different apks targeting different
 

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:12.590
different apks targeting different
versions of the platform so an example

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600
versions of the platform so an example
 

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.150
versions of the platform so an example
of what you might want to do that is

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160
of what you might want to do that is
 

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.220
of what you might want to do that is
where you have an appt today that's

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:16.230
where you have an appt today that's
 

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.009
where you have an appt today that's
supporting a set of older android

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019
supporting a set of older android
 

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:21.019
supporting a set of older android
versions but in your next version of

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:21.029
versions but in your next version of
 

00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:23.900
versions but in your next version of
that app you kind of want to say I'm no

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:23.910
that app you kind of want to say I'm no
 

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.240
that app you kind of want to say I'm no
longer supporting those old devices or

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.250
longer supporting those old devices or
 

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.150
longer supporting those old devices or
old API versions but I don't want to

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160
old API versions but I don't want to
 

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.030
old API versions but I don't want to
take that old version off the store for

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040
take that old version off the store for
 

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.189
take that old version off the store for
people that have all devices so then

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199
people that have all devices so then
 

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:36.110
people that have all devices so then
what will happen by using this you would

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120
what will happen by using this you would
 

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.720
what will happen by using this you would
specify max SDK version for your older

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:38.730
specify max SDK version for your older
 

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.970
specify max SDK version for your older
version of the app and then people with

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980
version of the app and then people with
 

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.400
version of the app and then people with
all the versions of the API so you need

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:43.410
all the versions of the API so you need
 

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.259
all the versions of the API so you need
a combination of Max and min obviously

00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:45.269
a combination of Max and min obviously
 

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:47.600
a combination of Max and min obviously
use people with the older versions of

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:47.610
use people with the older versions of
 

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.300
use people with the older versions of
the platform will get the older app so

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.310
the platform will get the older app so
 

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.509
the platform will get the older app so
people on 1.5 1.6 and then your newer

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519
people on 1.5 1.6 and then your newer
 

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:56.210
people on 1.5 1.6 and then your newer
users can get the latest updates and

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220
users can get the latest updates and
 

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.189
users can get the latest updates and
latest features so it's really about

00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199
latest features so it's really about
 

00:16:58.199 --> 00:17:03.290
latest features so it's really about
making your life easier but it is

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300
making your life easier but it is
 

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.059
making your life easier but it is
something that that developers can

00:17:05.059 --> 00:17:05.069
something that that developers can
 

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.340
something that that developers can
overlook from time to time and and we

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:07.350
overlook from time to time and and we
 

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.620
overlook from time to time and and we
really recommend that you you certainly

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:09.630
really recommend that you you certainly
 

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.649
really recommend that you you certainly
use minimum and target SDK versions yeah

00:17:12.649 --> 00:17:12.659
use minimum and target SDK versions yeah
 

00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:14.949
use minimum and target SDK versions yeah
I think another thing i want to add is

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959
I think another thing i want to add is
 

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:18.110
I think another thing i want to add is
another use case i saw developer using

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120
another use case i saw developer using
 

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.230
another use case i saw developer using
the max SDK version is when when there

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240
the max SDK version is when when there
 

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.470
the max SDK version is when when there
is a major release enjoys release

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480
is a major release enjoys release
 

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.770
is a major release enjoys release
something fell from a just temporarily

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:26.780
something fell from a just temporarily
 

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.830
something fell from a just temporarily
set the mat mass SDK awarded doing I

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840
set the mat mass SDK awarded doing I
 

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.830

extensive extensive testing on the under
 

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.020
extensive extensive testing on the under
on the major release I think that Pablo

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.030
on the major release I think that Pablo
 

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.590
on the major release I think that Pablo
another will use case that may be useful

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600
another will use case that may be useful
 

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.799
another will use case that may be useful
for temporary setting the mass as SDK to

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:42.809
for temporary setting the mass as SDK to
 

00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:47.440
for temporary setting the mass as SDK to
to the

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.450
 
 

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.860
 
yeah alright so that's users SDK the

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:51.870
yeah alright so that's users SDK the
 

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.060
yeah alright so that's users SDK the
next one we'd like to talk about is

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.070
next one we'd like to talk about is
 

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.630
next one we'd like to talk about is
users feature so you know often you may

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640
users feature so you know often you may
 

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.750
users feature so you know often you may
have an app that you're you know you're

00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760
have an app that you're you know you're
 

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.490
have an app that you're you know you're
using some sort of hardware feature but

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500
using some sort of hardware feature but
 

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.470
using some sort of hardware feature but
it's not critical to the operation of

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480
it's not critical to the operation of
 

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.060
it's not critical to the operation of
your app so an example of that is that

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.070
your app so an example of that is that
 

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.740
your app so an example of that is that
you may have a brilliant app that does

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:06.750
you may have a brilliant app that does
 

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.290
you may have a brilliant app that does
great photo editing now one of the

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:09.300
great photo editing now one of the
 

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.180
great photo editing now one of the
features of your app might be that you

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.190
features of your app might be that you
 

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.030
features of your app might be that you
use a you that you allow the user to

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:14.040
use a you that you allow the user to
 

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.210
use a you that you allow the user to
take photos as well as edit existing

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.220
take photos as well as edit existing
 

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.580
take photos as well as edit existing
photos in the gallery now if you're

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:19.590
photos in the gallery now if you're
 

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.050
photos in the gallery now if you're
taking photos you might be wanting to

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:21.060
taking photos you might be wanting to
 

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.350
taking photos you might be wanting to
use features like autofocus so you don't

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360
use features like autofocus so you don't
 

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.490
use features like autofocus so you don't
want to get into a situation where

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500
want to get into a situation where
 

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.490
want to get into a situation where
people that have devices that don't have

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500
people that have devices that don't have
 

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.860
people that have devices that don't have
a specific hardware feature unable to

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:30.870
a specific hardware feature unable to
 

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.720
a specific hardware feature unable to
use the core functionality of your app

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:32.730
use the core functionality of your app
 

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.390
use the core functionality of your app
so there are ways that you can actually

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400
so there are ways that you can actually
 

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.490
so there are ways that you can actually
specify that hey I would like to use

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500
specify that hey I would like to use
 

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.650
specify that hey I would like to use
this hardware feature if it's there but

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660
this hardware feature if it's there but
 

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.570
this hardware feature if it's there but
if it's not then go ahead anyway and

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580
if it's not then go ahead anyway and
 

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.890
if it's not then go ahead anyway and
what that's what we're going to talk

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900
what that's what we're going to talk
 

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.200
what that's what we're going to talk
about now so in terms of how you would

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.210
about now so in terms of how you would
 

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.300
about now so in terms of how you would
do this you would typically say hey I

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:47.310
do this you would typically say hey I
 

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.330
do this you would typically say hey I
want to use a camera and then you can

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340
want to use a camera and then you can
 

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.650
want to use a camera and then you can
make decisions on which of those

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660
make decisions on which of those
 

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.360
make decisions on which of those
features are optional so in the example

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:53.370
features are optional so in the example
 

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.490
features are optional so in the example
here we're saying we're using the camera

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500
here we're saying we're using the camera
 

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.370
here we're saying we're using the camera
we're also using auto focus but you'll

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380
we're also using auto focus but you'll
 

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.560
we're also using auto focus but you'll
notice at the bottom of that white text

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.570
notice at the bottom of that white text
 

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.170
notice at the bottom of that white text
it says android required equals false

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:03.180
it says android required equals false
 

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.360
it says android required equals false
and that's stating that this particular

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:05.370
and that's stating that this particular
 

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.650
and that's stating that this particular
auto focus feature is optional now keep

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660
auto focus feature is optional now keep
 

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.990
auto focus feature is optional now keep
in mind that when you request these

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000
in mind that when you request these
 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.720
in mind that when you request these
users features for anything that is said

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:14.730
users features for anything that is said
 

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.020
users features for anything that is said
to be required equals true Google Play

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.030
to be required equals true Google Play
 

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.900
to be required equals true Google Play
will feature will filter on those so at

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:20.910
will feature will filter on those so at
 

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.660
will feature will filter on those so at
the top that we said users feature

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:22.670
the top that we said users feature
 

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.040
the top that we said users feature
camera we didn't actually specify

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:25.050
camera we didn't actually specify
 

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.730
camera we didn't actually specify
required it's implicit its implied there

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740
required it's implicit its implied there
 

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.620
required it's implicit its implied there
that required is true that's the default

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:30.630
that required is true that's the default
 

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.350
that required is true that's the default
value so the second part the autofocus

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360
value so the second part the autofocus
 

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.110
value so the second part the autofocus
is actually saying it's optional so you

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120
is actually saying it's optional so you
 

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.910
is actually saying it's optional so you
can make a decision as to which part of

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:37.920
can make a decision as to which part of
 

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.860
can make a decision as to which part of
which of these features are optional in

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:39.870
which of these features are optional in
 

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.130
which of these features are optional in
your app and then at runtime what you do

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140
your app and then at runtime what you do
 

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.080
your app and then at runtime what you do
is that you can go through the package

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.090
is that you can go through the package
 

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.690
is that you can go through the package
manager to go and find out if the system

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700
manager to go and find out if the system
 

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.690
manager to go and find out if the system
has that particular feature so here

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700
has that particular feature so here
 

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.880
has that particular feature so here
we're checking if we have the feature at

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:52.890
we're checking if we have the feature at
 

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.190
we're checking if we have the feature at
runtime and then conditionally we are

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200
runtime and then conditionally we are
 

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.640
runtime and then conditionally we are
executing our code so this is

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:58.650
executing our code so this is
 

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.700
executing our code so this is
a nice way to kind of you know broaden

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:01.710
a nice way to kind of you know broaden
 

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.040
a nice way to kind of you know broaden

location but often that you'll find the
 

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.770
location but often that you'll find the
course location will be good enough or

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780
course location will be good enough or
 

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.750

the network location you can also

00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:25.219
here's for permissions that are
requesting which ones you want to turn

00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:25.229
requesting which ones you want to turn
 

00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:27.950
requesting which ones you want to turn
on and off so we really need to think

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960
on and off so we really need to think
 

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.149
on and off so we really need to think
about the user experience when it comes

00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159
about the user experience when it comes
 

00:27:29.159 --> 00:27:32.659
about the user experience when it comes
to installing apps and then we also need

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:32.669
to installing apps and then we also need
 

00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:33.739
to installing apps and then we also need
to think about well what about

00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:33.749
to think about well what about
 

00:27:33.749 --> 00:27:35.659
to think about well what about
developers that are already got an

00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:35.669
developers that are already got an
 

00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:38.359
developers that are already got an
existing set of apps then are not

00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:38.369
existing set of apps then are not
 

00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:39.710
existing set of apps then are not
stating that those permissions are

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720
stating that those permissions are
 

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.419
stating that those permissions are
optional should users be able to turn

00:27:41.419 --> 00:27:41.429
optional should users be able to turn
 

00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:43.430
optional should users be able to turn
off permissions on a nap so what does it

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440
off permissions on a nap so what does it
 

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.289
off permissions on a nap so what does it
mean for our existing set of apps what

00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299
mean for our existing set of apps what
 

00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:46.609
mean for our existing set of apps what
does it mean for the user experience if

00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:46.619
does it mean for the user experience if
 

00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:49.129
does it mean for the user experience if
we were to do this so there are a couple

00:27:49.129 --> 00:27:49.139
we were to do this so there are a couple
 

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:53.089
we were to do this so there are a couple
of things that play here and so I as I

00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:53.099
of things that play here and so I as I
 

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:54.799
of things that play here and so I as I
said I can't really comment on what's

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:54.809
said I can't really comment on what's
 

00:27:54.809 --> 00:27:57.619
said I can't really comment on what's
going to happen in the future but yeah I

00:27:57.619 --> 00:27:57.629
going to happen in the future but yeah I
 

00:27:57.629 --> 00:28:00.369
going to happen in the future but yeah I
guess I guess one of the current

00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:00.379
guess I guess one of the current
 

00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:02.299
guess I guess one of the current
implementation developer currently is

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:02.309
implementation developer currently is
 

00:28:02.309 --> 00:28:04.070
implementation developer currently is
doing slice is to build some plugins

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080
doing slice is to build some plugins
 

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.739
doing slice is to build some plugins
right and and in those plucking asking

00:28:06.739 --> 00:28:06.749
right and and in those plucking asking
 

00:28:06.749 --> 00:28:08.629
right and and in those plucking asking
for those optional permissions right I

00:28:08.629 --> 00:28:08.639
for those optional permissions right I
 

00:28:08.639 --> 00:28:10.909
for those optional permissions right I
mean if you have something that you

00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919
mean if you have something that you
 

00:28:10.919 --> 00:28:13.519
mean if you have something that you
think your apps can be optional you can

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:13.529
think your apps can be optional you can
 

00:28:13.529 --> 00:28:17.029
think your apps can be optional you can
put those features into a into a

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039
put those features into a into a
 

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:19.879
put those features into a into a
separate 14 so and Wall Street least a

00:28:19.879 --> 00:28:19.889
separate 14 so and Wall Street least a
 

00:28:19.889 --> 00:28:21.680
separate 14 so and Wall Street least a
plug-in him in a separate PK file is

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:21.690
plug-in him in a separate PK file is
 

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.629
plug-in him in a separate PK file is
going to be hosted on the google play

00:28:23.629 --> 00:28:23.639
going to be hosted on the google play
 

00:28:23.639 --> 00:28:25.700
going to be hosted on the google play
store yeah so it's a separate app

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:25.710
store yeah so it's a separate app
 

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.619
store yeah so it's a separate app
totally separate app you what you would

00:28:27.619 --> 00:28:27.629
totally separate app you what you would
 

00:28:27.629 --> 00:28:30.139
totally separate app you what you would
do is you could you could go and check

00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:30.149
do is you could you could go and check
 

00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:32.060
do is you could you could go and check
if you know that's installed and if it's

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.070
if you know that's installed and if it's
 

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.830
if you know that's installed and if it's
not installed you could say so when you

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840
not installed you could say so when you
 

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.119
not installed you could say so when you
user tries to use a feature you could

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:35.129
user tries to use a feature you could
 

00:28:35.129 --> 00:28:37.190
user tries to use a feature you could
say hey you actually need to grab this

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200

have a better performance but against it

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:14.549
have a better performance but against it

actually depends on the benchmark and we

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:17.850
actually depends on the benchmark and we
 

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.149
actually depends on the benchmark and we
can take this as a feedback and and and

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159
can take this as a feedback and and and
 

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:22.279
can take this as a feedback and and and
and bring this back to the engineering

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:22.289
and bring this back to the engineering
 

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:24.860
and bring this back to the engineering
team and see whether there is there's

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:24.870
team and see whether there is there's
 

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.100
team and see whether there is there's
really a performance optimization there

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:28.110
really a performance optimization there
 

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:31.820
really a performance optimization there
we can do on the pool passer also in

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:31.830
we can do on the pool passer also in
 

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.070
we can do on the pool passer also in
terms of coding style i think the pool

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080
terms of coding style i think the pool
 

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.490
terms of coding style i think the pool
part is better because you can select
