the important thing about application

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
the important thing about application
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.889
the important thing about application
architecture is really you need to act

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
architecture is really you need to act
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.959
architecture is really you need to act
early in your applications as soon as

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
early in your applications as soon as
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700
early in your applications as soon as
you start writing code you've made these

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
you start writing code you've made these
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.530
you start writing code you've made these
decisions that are going to affect how

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
decisions that are going to affect how
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150
decisions that are going to affect how
your application is going to be

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
your application is going to be
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.830
your application is going to be
developed from there forward so those

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
developed from there forward so those
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.189
developed from there forward so those
decisions stick with you these really

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
decisions stick with you these really
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.900
decisions stick with you these really
really deeply influence your application

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
really deeply influence your application
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.459
really deeply influence your application
we're going to show you a few of the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
we're going to show you a few of the
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680
we're going to show you a few of the
ways that this really affects how you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
ways that this really affects how you
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.439
ways that this really affects how you
might write your app as you move forward

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449
might write your app as you move forward
 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.029
might write your app as you move forward
it really makes it easier or harder to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
it really makes it easier or harder to
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770
it really makes it easier or harder to
think about the problems that you're

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
think about the problems that you're
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.939
think about the problems that you're
really setting to solve in your

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
really setting to solve in your
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.630
really setting to solve in your
application so you might be asking okay

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
application so you might be asking okay
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.160
application so you might be asking okay
well which patterns do I use there's a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
well which patterns do I use there's a
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679
well which patterns do I use there's a
lot of stuff out there and you can

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
lot of stuff out there and you can
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.700
lot of stuff out there and you can
really kind of get into a lot of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
really kind of get into a lot of
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.130
really kind of get into a lot of
alphabet soup as you start looking over

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
alphabet soup as you start looking over
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.690
alphabet soup as you start looking over
all of the different prescriptive

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
all of the different prescriptive
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999
all of the different prescriptive
patterns that you can blow into for I'm

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
patterns that you can blow into for I'm
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.850
patterns that you can blow into for I'm
super confused yeah yeah I mean I've got

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
super confused yeah yeah I mean I've got
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.200
super confused yeah yeah I mean I've got
all these things here that's me by doing

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210
all these things here that's me by doing
 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.010
all these things here that's me by doing
customers so this isn't a survey of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
customers so this isn't a survey of
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.300
customers so this isn't a survey of
libraries that's not what we're here to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
libraries that's not what we're here to
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.030
libraries that's not what we're here to
talk about today and there really are a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
talk about today and there really are a
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.620
talk about today and there really are a
lot of great libraries out there and you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
lot of great libraries out there and you
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.030
lot of great libraries out there and you
should really look into many of them and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
should really look into many of them and
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700
should really look into many of them and
see what they can do for you and but I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
see what they can do for you and but I
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469
see what they can do for you and but I
mean the trends change quickly the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
mean the trends change quickly the
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.730
mean the trends change quickly the
challenges you're going to face are

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
challenges you're going to face are
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.679
challenges you're going to face are
really timeless the properties of some

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
really timeless the properties of some
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.149
really timeless the properties of some
of these devices that we're writing for

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
of these devices that we're writing for
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.609
of these devices that we're writing for
have been the same properties from the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
have been the same properties from the
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.560
have been the same properties from the
first time any one of us held a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
first time any one of us held a
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.410
first time any one of us held a
smartphone and really lava flow happens

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
smartphone and really lava flow happens
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510
smartphone and really lava flow happens
over time this is kind of this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
over time this is kind of this
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760
over time this is kind of this
phenomenon where after your code goes

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
phenomenon where after your code goes
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.889
phenomenon where after your code goes
through a number of refactorings there

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
through a number of refactorings there
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.120
through a number of refactorings there
isn't really kind of an overarching

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
isn't really kind of an overarching
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830
isn't really kind of an overarching
principle that ties it all together

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
principle that ties it all together
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840
principle that ties it all together
anymore someone new who comes to your

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
anymore someone new who comes to your
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.700
anymore someone new who comes to your
code base may or may not understand

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
code base may or may not understand
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.770
code base may or may not understand
what's going on as you start piling up

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
what's going on as you start piling up
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.150
what's going on as you start piling up
all of these different pieces that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
all of these different pieces that
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.480
all of these different pieces that
really no longer fit

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490
really no longer fit
 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.070
really no longer fit
the important takeaway from this is to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080
the important takeaway from this is to
 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.000
the important takeaway from this is to
architect for user experience really

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010
architect for user experience really
 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.350
architect for user experience really
nobody in your user base is going to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
nobody in your user base is going to
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.420
nobody in your user base is going to
care exactly what patterns you used to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
care exactly what patterns you used to
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.100
care exactly what patterns you used to
produce your application they're going

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
produce your application they're going
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.450
produce your application they're going
to care about the experience that they

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
to care about the experience that they
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.080
to care about the experience that they
have while they've got it in their hand

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090
have while they've got it in their hand
 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.550
have while they've got it in their hand
alright so let's let's look at some

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
alright so let's let's look at some
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.110
alright so let's let's look at some
examples

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
examples
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.820
examples

maybe some videos so here's an
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.270
maybe some videos so here's an
application it's very simple I'm posting

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280
application it's very simple I'm posting

waiting waiting all right it's sent so
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.420
waiting waiting all right it's sent so
what was the problem here so what's

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
what was the problem here so what's
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.100
what was the problem here so what's
happening was the user clicks on the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
happening was the user clicks on the
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.980
happening was the user clicks on the
send button it goes your controller goes

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990
send button it goes your controller goes
 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.470

back whenever it wants to come back and
then you update your UI meanwhile you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
then you update your UI meanwhile you
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110
then you update your UI meanwhile you
block the user because you don't know

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
block the user because you don't know
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.640
block the user because you don't know
what happened maybe the comment will not

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
what happened maybe the comment will not
 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.950
what happened maybe the comment will not
go what did we get rid of this

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960
go what did we get rid of this
 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.720
go what did we get rid of this
introduced something you can call a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
introduced something you can call a
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.090
introduced something you can call a
model which is your storage with where

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100
model which is your storage with where
 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.370
model which is your storage with where
you keep your comments and everything so

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
you keep your comments and everything so
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.410
you keep your comments and everything so
and then when the user hits the send

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
and then when the user hits the send
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.530
and then when the user hits the send
button you keep it in your model

exposing pieces that you may need
 

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:18.729
exposing pieces that you may need
and so forth and really start building

it up as a series of layers so you have

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:21.139
it up as a series of layers so you have
 

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:23.049
it up as a series of layers so you have
the the very low level components that

00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:23.059
the the very low level components that
 

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:24.549
the the very low level components that
provide your data such as the network

00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:24.559
provide your data such as the network
 

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:25.869
provide your data such as the network
and then you have the higher level

00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:25.879
and then you have the higher level
 

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.369
and then you have the higher level
components that preside provide the

00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:27.379
components that preside provide the
 

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:28.749
components that preside provide the
presentation and it's very tempting to

00:13:28.749 --> 00:13:28.759
presentation and it's very tempting to
 

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:30.910
presentation and it's very tempting to
not have the higher levels inform the

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920
not have the higher levels inform the
 

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.530
not have the higher levels inform the
design of the lower levels but you can

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:32.540
design of the lower levels but you can
 

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.470
design of the lower levels but you can
get a lot of wins by doing this also

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480
get a lot of wins by doing this also
 

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.509
get a lot of wins by doing this also

in your layout that says fragment and
 

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.380
in your layout that says fragment and
says go ahead and instantiate a fragment

realistically this makes people think of

realistically this makes people think of
 

00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:14.100
realistically this makes people think of

so where do you end up using that versus

so where do you end up using that versus
 

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:43.460
so where do you end up using that versus
the second form here which is basically

00:25:50.499 --> 00:25:56.379
 
all right so now these two states are

00:25:56.379 --> 00:25:56.389
all right so now these two states are

network by the way normally when the
 

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.820
network by the way normally when the
network comes back you would refresh

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:06.830
network comes back you would refresh
 

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.249
network comes back you would refresh
your feet but I'm not doing it for the

00:26:09.249 --> 00:26:09.259
your feet but I'm not doing it for the
 

00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:11.529
your feet but I'm not doing it for the
purpose of the demo so when the network

00:26:11.529 --> 00:26:11.539
purpose of the demo so when the network
 

00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:13.119
purpose of the demo so when the network
comes back is going to send the post

00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:13.129
comes back is going to send the post
 

00:26:13.129 --> 00:26:16.869
comes back is going to send the post
instantly and so is all those thing but

00:26:16.869 --> 00:26:16.879
instantly and so is all those thing but
 

00:26:16.879 --> 00:26:18.850
instantly and so is all those thing but
when you actually refresh its going to

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:18.860
when you actually refresh its going to
 

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.980
when you actually refresh its going to
add anyone to the correct order this is

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:20.990
add anyone to the correct order this is
 

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.539
add anyone to the correct order this is
because everything is time-stamped by

the server so until a post is sent to

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:26.809
the server so until a post is sent to
 

00:26:26.809 --> 00:26:28.899
the server so until a post is sent to
the server you make a best guess

00:26:28.899 --> 00:26:28.909
the server you make a best guess
 

00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:31.659
the server you make a best guess
timestamp on it so for this example the

00:26:31.659 --> 00:26:31.669
timestamp on it so for this example the
 

00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:34.960
timestamp on it so for this example the
way I do it is again it may change per

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:34.970
way I do it is again it may change per
 

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.090
way I do it is again it may change per
your application but the way this one

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:37.100
your application but the way this one
 

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.810
your application but the way this one
does is let me open the save feature

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:42.820
does is let me open the save feature
 

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.629
does is let me open the save feature
okay so when it creates it actually

00:26:46.629 --> 00:26:46.639
okay so when it creates it actually
 

00:26:46.639 --> 00:26:49.960
okay so when it creates it actually

timestamp I have this is a way to

00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279
timestamp I have this is a way to
 

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:54.609
timestamp I have this is a way to
synchronize if my client clients time is

00:26:54.609 --> 00:26:54.619
synchronize if my client clients time is
 

00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:56.680
synchronize if my client clients time is

really bad because I change your server

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:00.860
really bad because I change your server
 

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.430

ordering by the UI ordering but that may

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440
ordering by the UI ordering but that may
 

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.739
ordering by the UI ordering but that may
cause other problems so what I do here

00:27:05.739 --> 00:27:05.749
cause other problems so what I do here
 

00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:09.340
cause other problems so what I do here
is like I I assign a best case timestamp

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:09.350
is like I I assign a best case timestamp
 

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.859
is like I I assign a best case timestamp
locally and then we do it on later and

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:11.869
locally and then we do it on later and
 

00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:17.649

servers so we hit it off the network

00:27:17.649 --> 00:27:17.659
servers so we hit it off the network

again and again like another case

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:19.850
again and again like another case
 

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.419
again and again like another case
because of the persistence so I send a

this will do is the server is going to

this will do is the server is going to
save the post but it's going to crash

00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:35.619
save the post but it's going to crash
 

00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:39.210
save the post but it's going to crash
afterwards so I won't be able to realize

that I could synchronize that post so

the post to the disk but the client

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:10.690
the post to the disk but the client
 

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.509
the post to the disk but the client
doesn't know so client keeps the track

00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519
doesn't know so client keeps the track
 

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:16.229

little bit API design but I we wanted

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:27.970
little bit API design but I we wanted
 

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.509
little bit API design but I we wanted
the full demo so I I did figure out the

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:30.519
the full demo so I I did figure out the
 

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.389
the full demo so I I did figure out the
same post and updated although my son

00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399

positive and never succeeded so the way

00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:36.879

positive and never succeeded so the way
it works in this application is by

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:38.950
it works in this application is by
 

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.869
it works in this application is by
design each each element is assigned a

00:29:42.869 --> 00:29:42.879
design each each element is assigned a
 

00:29:42.879 --> 00:29:45.299
design each each element is assigned a
client ID so if you look at these

00:29:45.299 --> 00:29:45.309
client ID so if you look at these
 

00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:46.349
client ID so if you look at these
examples here

00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:46.359

visible yeah alright so there's a user

00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:50.529
visible yeah alright so there's a user
 

00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:52.470
visible yeah alright so there's a user
ID and there's also client ID this

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480
ID and there's also client ID this
 

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.169
ID and there's also client ID this
client ID is randomly generated and

00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:55.179
client ID is randomly generated and
 

00:29:55.179 --> 00:29:59.549
client ID is randomly generated and
unique per user per post so there's a

00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559
unique per user per post so there's a
 

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:02.129
unique per user per post so there's a
unique in Midas's user ID and client ID

00:30:02.129 --> 00:30:02.139
unique in Midas's user ID and client ID
 

00:30:02.139 --> 00:30:04.529

comes with a timestamp so for example

00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:42.619
comes with a timestamp so for example
 

00:32:42.619 --> 00:32:44.919
comes with a timestamp so for example
for fetching the freedom and timestamp

00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:44.929

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:47.649
for fetching the freedom and timestamp
is the timestamp of the oldest post so

00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:47.659
is the timestamp of the oldest post so
 

00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:49.330
is the timestamp of the oldest post so

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.210
you entered it checks if this for my
 

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.200
you entered it checks if this for my
user if this for my user just cause the

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:08.210
user if this for my user just cause the
 

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.940
user if this for my user just cause the
refresh rate to all this one and then

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:09.950
refresh rate to all this one and then
 

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.369
refresh rate to all this one and then
add refresh method while creating the

00:33:12.369 --> 00:33:12.379
add refresh method while creating the
 

00:33:12.379 --> 00:33:15.460
add refresh method while creating the
model it uses that timestamp or if there

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:15.470
model it uses that timestamp or if there
 

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.200
model it uses that timestamp or if there
is no time study it uses the top one

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.210
is no time study it uses the top one
 

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.369
is no time study it uses the top one
because you don't want to keep your

00:33:18.369 --> 00:33:18.379
because you don't want to keep your
 

00:33:18.379 --> 00:33:24.159
because you don't want to keep your
fetching things yeah that is mostly let

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:24.169
fetching things yeah that is mostly let
 

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:26.759
fetching things yeah that is mostly let
me see if I miss anything

00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:26.769
me see if I miss anything
 

00:33:26.769 --> 00:33:32.169
me see if I miss anything
yeah okay I think so we are going to

00:33:32.169 --> 00:33:32.179
yeah okay I think so we are going to
 

00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:34.389
yeah okay I think so we are going to
publish this code both the server side

00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399
publish this code both the server side
 

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:37.330
publish this code both the server side
and the client side to github as soon as

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:37.340
and the client side to github as soon as
 

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.940
and the client side to github as soon as
I need some clarification here and there

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:39.950
I need some clarification here and there
 

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.419
I need some clarification here and there
but and you can play with it we all be

00:33:43.419 --> 00:33:43.429
but and you can play with it we all be
 

00:33:43.429 --> 00:33:45.159
but and you can play with it we all be
happy to get polar casts or whatever if

00:33:45.159 --> 00:33:45.169
happy to get polar casts or whatever if
 

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:46.450
happy to get polar casts or whatever if
you think something could be done better

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:46.460
you think something could be done better
 

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.109
you think something could be done better
and this is nice to share and like this

00:33:50.109 --> 00:33:50.119
and this is nice to share and like this
 

00:33:50.119 --> 00:33:54.210
and this is nice to share and like this
move on from there right sure that's it

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:54.220
move on from there right sure that's it
 

00:33:54.220 --> 00:34:03.890
move on from there right sure that's it
is time for some questions

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:03.900
 
 

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:08.810
 
I think that we've got a microphone

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820
I think that we've got a microphone
 

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.970
I think that we've got a microphone
floating around perhaps sir there we go

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:12.980
 
 

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.570
 
we'll really contain tests how will will

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580
we'll really contain tests how will will
 

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.940
we'll really contain tests how will will
the project contain contain tests yes

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:19.950
the project contain contain tests yes
 

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:24.649
the project contain contain tests yes
yes actually does so I actually I should

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659
yes actually does so I actually I should
 

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.490
yes actually does so I actually I should
have showed it so if you look at the

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:27.500
have showed it so if you look at the
 

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.649
have showed it so if you look at the
hobby well they may not be great tests

00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659
hobby well they may not be great tests
 

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.320
hobby well they may not be great tests
say I'm not a testing expert but they do

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:33.330
say I'm not a testing expert but they do
 

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.450
say I'm not a testing expert but they do
this mostly their most integration test

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460
this mostly their most integration test
 

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.250
this mostly their most integration test
if you look at something more fancy for

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.260
if you look at something more fancy for
 

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.830
if you look at something more fancy for
example fetching the feet so I say we do

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:42.840
example fetching the feet so I say we do
 

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.060
example fetching the feet so I say we do
the slide back over to the computer

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:44.070
the slide back over to the computer
 

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.630
the slide back over to the computer
robot oh sorry

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:46.640
robot oh sorry
 

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.740
robot oh sorry
can we go back to the computer okay

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:51.750
can we go back to the computer okay
 

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:52.419
can we go back to the computer okay
thank you

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:52.429
thank you
 

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:57.220
thank you
so the application uses dagger this is

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:57.230
so the application uses dagger this is
 

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.190
so the application uses dagger this is
how I mock some of the API calls but

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200
how I mock some of the API calls but
 

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.550
how I mock some of the API calls but
they see H feet enough sand sand command

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560
they see H feet enough sand sand command
 

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.710
they see H feet enough sand sand command
that will be nice so short answer yes

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720
that will be nice so short answer yes
 

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.770
that will be nice so short answer yes
yeah yeah they're here that's a very

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780
yeah yeah they're here that's a very
 

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.440
yeah yeah they're here that's a very
nice test I can find okay five hundred

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:15.450
nice test I can find okay five hundred
 

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.410
nice test I can find okay five hundred
four hundred so it's like I mean this is

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:17.420
four hundred so it's like I mean this is
 

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.590
four hundred so it's like I mean this is
creating the job mocking the API so so

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:21.600
creating the job mocking the API so so
 

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.150
creating the job mocking the API so so
that if someone tries to send a post

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160
that if someone tries to send a post
 

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.160
that if someone tries to send a post
return 404 by injects the test component

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:28.170
return 404 by injects the test component
 

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.500
return 404 by injects the test component
runs the job checks the appropriate

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:30.510
runs the job checks the appropriate
 

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.340
runs the job checks the appropriate
descent so all of one of the things is

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:33.350
descent so all of one of the things is
 

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:37.220
descent so all of one of the things is
like is not even when they some outputs

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:37.230
like is not even when they some outputs
 

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.320
like is not even when they some outputs
happen as you ants it's not very easy to

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:39.330
happen as you ants it's not very easy to
 

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.200
happen as you ants it's not very easy to
test them in this example I'm using in

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:42.210
test them in this example I'm using in
 

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.270
test them in this example I'm using in
the test application I'm using your

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280
the test application I'm using your
 

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.340
the test application I'm using your
logging event bus that basically logs

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:46.350
logging event bus that basically logs
 

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.560
logging event bus that basically logs
every single event so that I can assert

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:48.570
every single event so that I can assert
 

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.690
every single event so that I can assert
on those later on yeah like there might

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700
on those later on yeah like there might
 

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.280
on those later on yeah like there might
be different or better ways to do this

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:52.290
be different or better ways to do this
 

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.200
be different or better ways to do this
but this is something that works on we

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:54.210
but this is something that works on we
 

00:35:54.210 --> 00:36:00.130
but this is something that works on we
have tests

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:00.140
 
 

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:04.839
 
so

00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:04.849
 
 

00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:08.200
 
hi um what's your opinion on using

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:08.210
hi um what's your opinion on using
 

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.150
hi um what's your opinion on using
custom views instead of fragments so you

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160
custom views instead of fragments so you
 

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.819
custom views instead of fragments so you
don't have to deal with the fragment

00:36:11.819 --> 00:36:11.829
don't have to deal with the fragment
 

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:14.799
don't have to deal with the fragment
quirks if you will so things like child

00:36:14.799 --> 00:36:14.809
quirks if you will so things like child
 

00:36:14.809 --> 00:36:17.440
quirks if you will so things like child
fragment manager or popping the back

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:17.450
fragment manager or popping the back
 

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.589
fragment manager or popping the back
stack when after us a save state so

00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599
stack when after us a save state so
 

00:36:20.599 --> 00:36:22.779
stack when after us a save state so
again I think that those are they're

00:36:22.779 --> 00:36:22.789
again I think that those are they're
 

00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:24.579
again I think that those are they're
kind of unrelated just because they I

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:24.589
kind of unrelated just because they I
 

00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:27.309
kind of unrelated just because they I
mean a fragment controls views it's not

00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319
mean a fragment controls views it's not
 

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:29.349
mean a fragment controls views it's not
a view itself I mean that was kind of

00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359
a view itself I mean that was kind of
 

00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:30.370
a view itself I mean that was kind of
what we were trying to get out a little

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:30.380
what we were trying to get out a little
 

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.190
what we were trying to get out a little
bit earlier overall I think that a lot

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200
bit earlier overall I think that a lot
 

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.229
bit earlier overall I think that a lot
of people write fragments when they

00:36:35.229 --> 00:36:35.239
of people write fragments when they
 

00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:37.660
of people write fragments when they
really meant to write a custom view so I

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:37.670
really meant to write a custom view so I
 

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.329
really meant to write a custom view so I
think that in in many cases see exactly

00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:40.339
think that in in many cases see exactly
 

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:43.509
think that in in many cases see exactly
what it is that your particular chunk of

00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:43.519
what it is that your particular chunk of
 

00:36:43.519 --> 00:36:45.759
what it is that your particular chunk of
encapsulated UI needs to express and

00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:45.769
encapsulated UI needs to express and
 

00:36:45.769 --> 00:36:47.920
encapsulated UI needs to express and
respond to if those are events that can

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:47.930
respond to if those are events that can
 

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.539
respond to if those are events that can
be coming from some alternate component

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:49.549
be coming from some alternate component
 

00:36:49.549 --> 00:36:52.809
be coming from some alternate component
that's kind of composing that pieces

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:52.819
that's kind of composing that pieces
 

00:36:52.819 --> 00:36:55.870
that's kind of composing that pieces
place within the overall UI then that

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880
place within the overall UI then that
 

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.759
place within the overall UI then that
speaks to it being probably a little bit

00:36:57.759 --> 00:36:57.769
speaks to it being probably a little bit
 

00:36:57.769 --> 00:37:00.039
speaks to it being probably a little bit
more like a view group if it's something

00:37:00.039 --> 00:37:00.049
more like a view group if it's something
 

00:37:00.049 --> 00:37:01.870
more like a view group if it's something
that really needs to respond to other

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880
that really needs to respond to other
 

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.630
that really needs to respond to other
elements of the application lifecycle on

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640
elements of the application lifecycle on
 

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.269
elements of the application lifecycle on
the activity lifecycle if it's doing

00:37:07.269 --> 00:37:07.279
the activity lifecycle if it's doing
 

00:37:07.279 --> 00:37:09.039
the activity lifecycle if it's doing
something like registering for events

00:37:09.039 --> 00:37:09.049
something like registering for events
 

00:37:09.049 --> 00:37:11.289
something like registering for events
dealing with things like that then it

00:37:11.289 --> 00:37:11.299
dealing with things like that then it
 

00:37:11.299 --> 00:37:12.609
dealing with things like that then it
may be more appropriate for a fragment

00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:12.619
may be more appropriate for a fragment
 

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:14.529
may be more appropriate for a fragment
in that case but overall I think that

00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:14.539
in that case but overall I think that
 

00:37:14.539 --> 00:37:16.930
in that case but overall I think that
people tend to lean a little bit too

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:16.940
people tend to lean a little bit too
 

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.489
people tend to lean a little bit too
heavily on fragments when they think of

00:37:18.489 --> 00:37:18.499
heavily on fragments when they think of
 

00:37:18.499 --> 00:37:25.229
heavily on fragments when they think of
one particular sub segment of their UI

00:37:25.229 --> 00:37:25.239
 
 

00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:30.069
 
hi um one question I had was how do you

00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079
hi um one question I had was how do you
 

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:33.099
hi um one question I had was how do you
handle the serialization of these jobs

00:37:33.099 --> 00:37:33.109
handle the serialization of these jobs
 

00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:35.709

either you can choose one of them which

00:38:02.289 --> 00:38:02.299
either you can choose one of them which
 

00:38:02.299 --> 00:38:08.170
either you can choose one of them which
fits your needs cool thanks

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:14.450
 
we've got one up front in this kind of

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:14.460
we've got one up front in this kind of

we've got one up front in this kind of
application would you use a sync adapter

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:15.750
application would you use a sync adapter
 

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.710
application would you use a sync adapter
or would you use like ASIC rest calls to

so for the demo so one of the things we

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:22.620
so for the demo so one of the things we
 

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.940
so for the demo so one of the things we
gave examples in the slides was to

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:24.950
gave examples in the slides was to
 

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:28.250
gave examples in the slides was to
separate your local tasks from the

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260
separate your local tasks from the
 

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.430
separate your local tasks from the
server tasks the way we do it is for

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440
server tasks the way we do it is for
 

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.540
server tasks the way we do it is for
your eye related stuff I'm using

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:32.550
your eye related stuff I'm using
 

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.000
your eye related stuff I'm using
guessing tasks I never use it for

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.010

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.380
network only for you I stop and for
network I'm using the job queue so the

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:39.390
network I'm using the job queue so the
 

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.520

jobs don't master : to network

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:42.530

yeah the sync adapter is generally

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:44.610
yeah the sync adapter is generally
 

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.450
yeah the sync adapter is generally
useful if once you have a more

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460
useful if once you have a more
 

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.100
useful if once you have a more
sophisticated account infrastructure and

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:49.110
sophisticated account infrastructure and
 

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.540
sophisticated account infrastructure and
you have some of the other machinery

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:50.550
you have some of the other machinery
 

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.610
you have some of the other machinery
that that was really kind of built

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:52.620
that that was really kind of built
 

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.740
that that was really kind of built
around so if it seems like you're going

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:54.750
around so if it seems like you're going
 

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.040
around so if it seems like you're going
through a lot of additional machinery to

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:58.050
through a lot of additional machinery to
 

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.110
through a lot of additional machinery to
work with a sync adapter then maybe

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.120
work with a sync adapter then maybe
 

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.160
work with a sync adapter then maybe
start taking a look at some more things

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:01.170
start taking a look at some more things
 

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.840
start taking a look at some more things
just like a job scheduler so on and so

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:02.850
just like a job scheduler so on and so
 

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:04.220
just like a job scheduler so on and so
forth and see if that's something that

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:04.230
forth and see if that's something that
 

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.690
forth and see if that's something that
is simpler that can still meet your

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700
is simpler that can still meet your
 

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:12.140
is simpler that can still meet your
needs when you start building all these

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:12.150

versions of data models so you might

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:16.410
versions of data models so you might
 

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.850
versions of data models so you might
have like fetch data off the network

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:18.860
have like fetch data off the network
 

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.800
have like fetch data off the network

about versioning but they actually

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.170
about versioning but they actually
 

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:45.740
about versioning but they actually
remind me something I forgot in this one
