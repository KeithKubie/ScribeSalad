00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.679
 Hey. Really extravagant. The queen is with her puppy 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.049
 Live in a castle outside the government. How much does it cost? 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:09.940
 The answer is 40 million pounds. 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.080
 This is equivalent to 65 pence per person per year for the royal family. 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.910
 Of course, it's still 23 pence to get a shield, but you don't have to pay so much. 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.250
 After all, those are your money. 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.560
 Why can the Queen take the money? Well, this is a bit complicated. 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.090
 The story begins with this man, George III. 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.250
 He is known for losing the United States. But little known - and more interesting - is 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.730
 He seems to have a mental illness called porphyria (porphyria). 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.290
 This problem has an unusual side effect: it turns your stool from a normal, uninteresting brown into a pleasant purple. 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.360
 Going over the problem - returning to the royal family to collect taxes. 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.059
 George was unable to pay his bills and his debts piled up. 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.460
 Although he has a large piece of land, 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 But the rent of the land is not enough to support his expenses. 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.829
 He proposed to Parliament: for the rest of his life, he will give up the rental income from the land. 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.380
 In exchange for a fixed annual salary and pay off debts. 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.350
 The parliament accepted his proposal, 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.960
 Because it is profitable in the long run. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.959
 Is the parliament doing the right thing? Back to the present, let's calculate the gains and losses. 

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.889
 The following ten pounds of paper money will represent 10 million pounds. 

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:13.999
 The cost of the royal family today is £40 million a year. 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.189
 The UK's income from royal land is £200 million. 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.299
 200 million income minus 40 million wages is equal to 160 million pounds of profits. 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.599
 That's right: Britain earns £160 million a year from the royal family. 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.259
 So stop your complaints about the royal family and the royal family's expenses and uselessness. 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.639
 The royal family contributed greatly to Great Britain. Make another arithmetic per capita: 

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:39.779
 The £160 million divided by the population of 62 million is about 2 pounds and 60 pence. 

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:44.009
 Because of the royal family, you actually pay less than 2 pounds and 60 pence a year. 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 But maybe that’s not enough. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.859
 Because you are an extremely greedy old thing. Why not kick the royal family and earn 100% of the income? 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.700
 Because the land still belongs to the royal family. Crazy George is not crazy enough to hand over everything. 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.469
 It’s just profit. But not only him: 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.079
 Since George III, every monarch has voluntarily handed over the proceeds of the land to the United Kingdom. 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.829
 Note: Voluntary. If the government stops paying royal life and public expenses, 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.060
 Then the royal family will have to return their land income. 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.870
 And the tax, dear monarchy, will only rise and fall. 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.140
 Plus 160 million is just the easiest money to calculate from the royal family. 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.810
 Don't forget their huge and invisible gold swan: 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.760
 Tourists. Although a bit annoying to the locals, 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.600
 They blocked the subway and refused to stand on the right. 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.740
 They put money in the UK: sightseeing, public transportation for absurd short trips, 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.390
 The hometown is thousands of miles away. Of course, they don’t just come for the royal family. 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.190
 But the most expensive is the royal family. Who spends the most? The United States. 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.410
 After buying enough maple syrup and cheap illegal tobacco, 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.970
 What is their next stop? 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.740
 United Kingdom. Americans fly over the ocean 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.490
 Look at the castle on this land that is not made of plastic. Why do Americans think French castles are boring and annoying, 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.990
 And the castle in Britain is awesome? Because the real monarchs are still using the castle. 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.520
 The Tower of London is amazing. 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.300
 Just because the guard uniform is true, 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.860
 Rather than a lame historical reappearance or modern real-life role playing. This is the embodiment of a vibrant queen. 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.160
 Everywhere you see, she is scattered with her. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.200
 The rot is magical and makes visitors stunned. 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.150
 12 million visitors spend £7 billion a year. 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.810
 Suddenly, direct income is insignificant. 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.620
 But maybe you don't have a cold on the monarch's eternal gold mine. 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.230
 You admire the republic and do not like the political power of the royal family. 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.690
 After all, the government’s rights come from the king, not the people. 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.790
 Yes, I admit that in the old days of the broken, this is indeed a reasonable concern. 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.760
 But the modern queen is not a dangerous political beast, but a cat that goes to the claws. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.069
 Her powers are limited to the resolutions of the parliament that are generally agreed to by the Kabuki Theatre. 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.569
 Nothing will change unless the royal family is expelled from the government, except that you will no longer live in the magical United Kingdom. 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.970
 It is boring in England, Scotland, Wales and the United Republic of Northern Ireland. 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.680
 English abbreviation URESWNI. It doesn't sound like it sounds like it. 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.200
 But maybe I am wrong - maybe the queen is a political time bomb, 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.980
 Just waiting for the opportunity to launch a war and dissolve the parliament. 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.490
 But before that day, God bless the Queen.
