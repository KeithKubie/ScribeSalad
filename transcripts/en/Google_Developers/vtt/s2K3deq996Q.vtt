LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.750
I'm Louis Gray broadcasting here
from the Moscone Center

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.720
in San Francisco.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.690
I have not one, but two,
distinguished guests with us

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.100
today to talk about
Google+ Sign In.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.360
We have a director of product,
Seth Sternberg.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.690
As well as director of
engineering David Glazer from

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.410
the Google+ project.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.185
So thank you both
for coming in.

00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:25.430
SETH STERNBERG: Thanks for
having us Appreciate it.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.740
LOUIS GRAY: Thank you.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.140
So this has actually been a
really incredible conference,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.600
with a 3 and 1/2 hour keynote,
full of content,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.780
back to back to back.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.210
We just had a really solid
discussion with Bradley

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.245
Horowitz about the three major
pieces of Google+ that were

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.260
introduced yesterday, talking
through the stream design, the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.960
Hangouts application, and all
the photos experience.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.030
And very recently, we introduced
Google+ Sign In.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.770
And this is kind of your baby.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.610
And so we definitely wanted to
talk to the developers--

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.360
the many thousands of developers
who are watching on

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.210
a live stream and those who
will watch after the fact.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.040
We wanted to talk about Google+
Sign In, and say what

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.530
it is and how it's impacting
developers.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.460
So maybe we could start with
that at the very beginning.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.340
You can tell us a little bit
about Google+ Sign In, what it

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.091
does, and how you guys arrived
at delivering the product as

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:09.664
it is today.

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:12.900
DAVID GLAZER: So, I think the
best way to understand Google+

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.375
Sign In is to start by
understanding what problem we

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.230
were trying to help developers
and users solve.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.500
And the problem was, we think
there's an opportunity to make

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.660
everything users do online
better by bringing the power

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.480
of Google with you when
you go to the apps and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.130
sites that you use.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.470
And at the same time, take what
you're doing in those

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.980
apps, and bring it back to
Google, to make the whole

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.500
experience better
for everyone.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.150
So in that context, what
Google+ Sign In

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.220
does is very simple.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.040
It allows you to form a
connection between who you are

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.290
on Google, your Google+
identity, and who are in the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.050
apps and sites that you use.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.050
So I go to a website, say
opentable.com, and I can sign

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.230
in using my Google identity.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.220
Open Table now gets some
information about me from

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.320
Google and has access to
other Google services.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.550
And Open Table has the ability
to send information about what

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.230
I'm doing back to
me at Google.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.760
LOUIS GRAY: And what kind
of information is that?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.590
If I'm going to sign in with
my Google+ Sign In on Open

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.350
Table or any--

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.940
I guess you've got like 50-plus

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.450
partners here in the Sandbox--

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.070
if I'm signing in to Google+
on any of these apps, what

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.410
information is being shared?

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.595
And does the user know what the
application is asking for?

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:23.070
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.040
So the user, pivoting to the
second part, yes, the user

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.860
absolutely knows what's
being asked for.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.780
That was one of the
responsibilities that we took

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.110
very seriously in building
Google+ Sign In.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.650
We heard from users we talked
to, that they trusted Google.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.440
And that they were inclined to
like the idea of signing in as

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.080
Google, because they knew that
Google was a trusted place to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.600
do that and would do
right by them.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.190
That added a big responsibility
to us to live

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.500
up to that responsibility.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.930
To continue to earn and
increase that trust.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.330
The first part of that is making
sure that users know

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.100
exactly what is happening.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.430
So specifically, when you sign
in with Google, you see the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.020
big red Sign In With Google.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.560
You click it.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.980
You get a consent dialog.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.950
It's the same dialogue wherever
you're signing in.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.700
It says Open Table--

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.330
sticking with the example--
would like to.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.560
And then there's two things.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.790
One is, what information are
you giving permission for

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.480
Google to send to Open Table.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.020
And it's your name, your profile
picture, and whenever

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.520
public information you
have put out on

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.880
your Google+ profile.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.720
LOUIS GRAY: And you
say public.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.850
One of the interesting things
about Google+ is you have that

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.520
ability to share privately You
know, Circles have been

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.450
something from Google+ from
the very beginning.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.560
DAVID GLAZER: Yep.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.570
LOUIS GRAY: So with Sign In,
we're definitely making sure

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.500
that only the content that
you share publicly, the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.450
information about you,
that that's what's

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.330
being sent to the app--

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.770
DAVID GLAZER: That's right.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.667
LOUIS GRAY: --should they
choose to look at that.

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:47.810
Is that right?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.420
DAVID GLAZER: That's right.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.050
And then the one other thing
that the app gets, under the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.570
user's control, is the list
of people in your Circles.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.840
Not the list of your Circles,
because we think that how you

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.365
choose to organize your
relationships--

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:00.030
LOUIS GRAY: But that's
up to you.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.440
DAVID GLAZER: --is
your business.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.300
LOUIS GRAY: And that's
private.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.190
DAVID GLAZER: That's right.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.830
But it's very useful in
many applications.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.910
You can have a better experience
if you're looking

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.990
for a movie to watch, knowing
what other people that you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.920
care about, what they're
doing around movies.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.120
If you're looking for news to
read, knowing what the other

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.040
people you know, what news
they're reading.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.209
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.170
DAVID GLAZER: There's a lot of
ways that developers can build

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.160
a better experience if they know
who you are connected to.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.050
So we also give the app that
information about who our

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.470
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.860
LOUIS GRAY: Now Seth, you're
talking before we broadcast

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
about the 50-plus partners
we have in the Sandbox.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.110
And we just launched Google+
Sign In, or Google Sign In,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.430
about two months ago.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.400
I mean, so what is it?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.610
How did we go about getting
those initial partners, and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.640
what is they're finding really
exciting about bringing Sign

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.500
In With Google to their apps?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.060
SETH STERNBERG: That's
a great question.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.260
So as you point out,
this is only a

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.810
two-month-old product, right.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.275
So we're very new in market.

00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:54.180
And we had 10 great
launch partners.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.150
So we actually recently went
back to them and asked like,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.600
hey, what have you
experienced?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.590
Tell us.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.610
We heard from The Fancy that
Google+ Sign In is

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.860
out-performing every other
social login on their system.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.360
Users are more engaged with
it than any other one.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.160
LOUIS GRAY: So what
does that mean?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.120
I mean, you say out-performing
or engaging-- does that mean

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.040
more people are using
it in total?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.560
SETH STERNBERG: More people
are signing in, better

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.250
conversion.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.540
On the Guardian, they told us
that on the Android, Google+

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.290
Sign In is the number one sign
in option, with 41% of the

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.450
users choosing Google+
Sign In.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.030
Then SkillPages, who just
launched three weeks ago, so

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.730
they're new, they were not an
original launch partner.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.750
Three weeks ago, SkillPages
puts Google+ Sign In out.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.970
Two nights ago, they told us
that we are now 50% of all

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.160
social login.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.690
So what's happening is users,
when they have the option to

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.810
use Google+ to sign in, are
choosing Google+ in really big

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.940
numbers, because
they trust it.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.940
They understand that it will
enable them to do great

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.390
things-- to share with their
friends when they want to, or

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.950
to really easily download an
Android app, or to bring the

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.590
best of their Google experience
with them across

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.430
the internet.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.890
But it won't spam
their friends.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:06.250
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.190
SETH STERNBERG: It's a safe
option for Google, for

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.590
users, excuse me.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.480
And it's great for developers,
because they still have really

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.110
powerful ways to write
information about what that

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.310
user's done in their apps, back
to Google, and then get

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.730
more traffic back.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.530
Now you pointed out 54.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.360
We have 54 developers here in
the Sandbox on display, and of

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.810
course many, many more than
that, that have now launched

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.930
Google+ Sign In.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.390
So we're so happy at the uptake
that we've seen, both

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.010
with users--

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.430
as witnessed by the Fancy, and
Guardian, and SkillPages--

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.500
and with developers choosing
to integrate.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.220
LOUIS GRAY: We saw I was
actually earlier today.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.290
One of our first things that
we did this morning was

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.970
highlight a number of partners
from the Google+ Sandbox.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.140
Daniel Siebert went through
and we rolled some of that

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.860
video this morning.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.230
SETH STERNBERG: Great.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.390
LOUIS GRAY: I've seen a number
of media partners who are

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.800
here, people like the Verge,
and SP Nation, Mashable.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.390
What is it about media that
makes sense to have a sign in

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.105
with Google+?

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:00.775
Why is that one of the
first places that's

00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:01.280
really taking off?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.680
SETH STERNBERG: Sure.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.760
So, you know, when you're
reading through a story or

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.440
watching a video, oftentimes you
really want your friends

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.210
or colleagues to participate
in that with you too.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.910
So one feature that we built
is it's very easy for a

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.550
publisher to click Send To My
Friends or Watch With Friends.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.970
In that post, when a user is
signed in, or the user clicks

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.190
the post and then they'll be
asked to sign in in order to

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.610
send it, that's we call
an interactive post.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.130
And it has a button on it.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.730
It's a clear call to action.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.750
So like for a video, Watch.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.070
And when your friend gets
that, and they'll get it

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.000
across all of Google properties,
right-- the

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.700
Notifier will light up on
Search, and on YouTube, and in

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.910
Maps, and in Google+,
on the Android.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.360
It will light up everywhere.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.950
When your friend gets it, and
they click that Watch button,

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.750
or they click that Read button,
they are taken right

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.800
to that article or that video
in the mobile app, in the

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.710
desktop web, wherever
the user may be.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.780
If they don't have the app,
they'll be asked if they want

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.350
to download the app.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.760
So it's a way to get your
friends involved with you in

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.730
consuming media.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.740
And hey, in the real world, we
consume media with our friends

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:10.960
all the time.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.170
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:11.890
All the time.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.430
SETH STERNBERG: Now, at the same
time, what the developer

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.160
gets out of this is not just a
share that had a very fair

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.230
call to action.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.270
But if that user has an Android
device and does not

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.240
have your Android app, the user
will be asked if they

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.820
want to install your Android
app on your website.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.060
LOUIS GRAY: From the website.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.700
Yeah.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.280
SETH STERNBERG: Right
so you're on that

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.020
machine on a website.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.130
You connect using Google+.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.929
And it says, hey, do you want
the Guardian's Android app?

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.659
And we're doing this because if
you're making a connection

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.260
with the Guardian, then
you probably would

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.170
really want their app.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.690
And of course, we only ask
if you don't have it.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.990
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.180
And we know that thanks
to the integration.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.960
One of things we fight about
with Bradley is you see two

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.600
things happening.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.230
One with Google+ being some of
that social layer, you have

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.580
that ability to understand who
the person is and it ties into

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.160
Google Play.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.860
And you know what's
on their Android.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.750
SETH STERNBERG: That's right.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.620
LOUIS GRAY: And you also have
that option to take that next

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.600
step of activity.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.990
And you have the unification
of desktop and mobile.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.960
And so one of the big things
with the design of Google+

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.400
that was just redone, but you
have that kind of getting from

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.840
desktop to the mobile experience
should be the same.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.450
SETH STERNBERG: That's right.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.960
LOUIS GRAY: And that's been
something that's been echoed

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.310
repeatedly.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.930
And you were talking about the
percentage of [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.290
SETH STERNBERG: So, yeah.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.250
So it's so powerful.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.630
It's not only do we give this,
offer you this, 40% of users

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.900
who are asked if they want your
Android app, say yes.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.120
That is incredible.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.810
If you think about lots of
developers are purchasing ads

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.905
to get Android app installs
or IOS installs.

00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:39.880
And maybe they get
1% who say yes.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.580
This is 40 times that.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:41.980
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.320
SETH STERNBERG: 40% of users
say yes, I want the app.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.530
And then even better, just
announced yesterday is when

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.780
the user then picks up their
tablet or picks up their

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.080
mobile phone and taps on
your Chicklet, you are

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.680
already logged in.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.690
So if you've connected on web,
you are automatically

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.220
connected on mobile, and vice
versa, if you do mobile first.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.610
LOUIS GRAY: And once you've
already done it one time, why

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.960
go through the process
a second time.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.280
SETH STERNBERG: That's right.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.140
Unbelievably seamless experience
for users and for

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.720
developers.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.130
They can give you so much
better experience.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.220
Because now you've got your
account, you have your

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.220
shopping cart, you have your
preferences, stories you've

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.080
bookmark, your friends--

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.550
all of that is just now
available across devices.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.146
LOUIS GRAY: Now speaking of
getting started on some of

00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:24.520
this stuff, how do developers
start with Google+ Sign In?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.650
Like where are they
suppose to go?

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.850
We've got 50 plus people
here today.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.530
I'm hoping next year we have
more than that for some

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.560
incredible stories.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.100
SETH STERNBERG: It'll be hard.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.230
We'll run out of space.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.920
LOUIS GRAY: Moscone just
for G+ Sign In.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.350
How's that?

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.020
SETH STERNBERG: There you go.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.860
LOUIS GRAY: But so, how do
people get started with

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.478
Google+ Sign In?

00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:41.728
DAVID GLAZER: Go to
developers.google.com/+.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.200
And that's the top
of the tree, and

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.170
that'll get you there.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.730
What you'll find there
are samples.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.910
You'll find the quick start.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.040
You'll find full reference
documentation.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.350
You'll find recap of the
features and benefits.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:02.030
But I can do the quick version
of the quick start right here.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.350
If you have a website, you want
to put a Sign In With

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.050
Google button on your website,
you do two things.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.800
The first thing you do is, you
put a line of JavaScript on

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.510
your website.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.460
If you're using the +1 button,
you already have the line of

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.070
JavaScript.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.340
It's already there.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.530
And the second thing is, you put
in a little bit of mark up

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.790
that says g: Sign In button,
and then provide the

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.430
parameters that we need.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.310
That's all you do
to your website.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.510
You then have to do some work
on your backend to take

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.730
advantage of users
being signed in.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.000
You have to know they're
signed in.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.440
You have to say "Hello Lewis"
when they are signed in.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.830
You have to do whenever other
capabilities you want to add.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.250
But the basics of just getting
a "Hello World" alive on your

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.150
site is as simple as I said.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.350
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.270
Just at
developers.goggle.com/plus.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.540
Now as someone who's been
running Google Developers Live

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.650
events for practically a year
now, we regularly have the

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.730
Google+ development team and
Google+ platform team coming

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.930
in and doing office hours,
showcasing partners, talking

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:58.440
about features.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.480
I know, Seth, you've joined us
a couple of times on that.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.150
So I appreciate that.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.600
And obviously, one of the things
we really want to have

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.380
people understand is that they
can connect with you both, and

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.090
myself as well, using Google
Developers Live through the

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.670
rest of year.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.510
So when you go to
developers.google.com/+ for

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.630
all the great Google+ Sign In.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.510
And when you're done,
you go back to

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.960
developers.google.com/live to
watch the kind of engagement

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.440
that we're having here,
year round.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.430
And so I definitely appreciate
you guys coming and meeting

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.210
with me at GDO at
I/O at Moscone.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.900
I think it's a really
special event--

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.280
really important for us to talk
directly to developers,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.670
like we're doing.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.220
And for those of you who want
to be seeing this kind of

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.980
content every single day,
go to YouTube.com.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.815
Look for Google Developers
and subscribe.

00:12:38.815 --> 00:12:42.920
Up next GDO at I/O, we'll be
back at 1:35 to talk about

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.070
Maps and walk through
the Map Sandbox.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.400
But until then, we'll
return you back

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.300
to your live sessions.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.090
Thank you.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.340
DAVID GLAZER: Thanks
for having us.
