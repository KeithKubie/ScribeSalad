00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.684
- [Voiceover] All right,
so we're told that vector v

00:00:02.684 --> 00:00:04.985
is equal to x comma y.

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:07.752
They're not giving us the actual numbers

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:09.684
for the x component and the y component.

00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:11.084
They're just saying that the x component

00:00:11.084 --> 00:00:12.751
is going to be the variable x.

00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:15.651
And the y component is
going to be the variable y.

00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:20.219
And the magnitude of vector v
is going to be equal to five.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.951
All right, I think I
can digest all of that.

00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:24.587
And it says, fill in
the blanks to complete

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:26.717
the following sentences.

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:31.184
So they're saying vector
w right over here,

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.418
they didn't have to actually
write the word vector.

00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:35.117
They have an arrow on top of the w,

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:36.351
so we know it's a vector.

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:41.351
So vector w its components
are three x and three y.

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:44.918
So its x component is
three times the x component

00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:46.017
of vector v.

00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:49.285
And its y component is
three times the y component

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:50.885
of vector v.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.452
Instead of having a y, it has a three y.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.785
Instead of having an x, it has a three x.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:58.551
So w is essentially
vector v being multiplied

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:00.785
by the scalar three.

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:03.521
So its magnitude is
going to be three times

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.918
the magnitude of vector v.

00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:09.953
So if vector v has a magnitude of five,

00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:14.818
vector w's going to
have a magnitude of 15.

00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:17.585
It's going to have three
times the magnitude.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.418
All right, now they tell
us vector z is equal to,

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:23.452
so its x component is negative two times

00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:26.185
the x component of vector v.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:29.785
And its y component is negative
two times the y component

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:31.553
of vector v.

00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:36.553
So you could view vector z as
negative two times vector v.

00:01:37.218 --> 00:01:41.751
Or the scalar negative
two times the vector v.

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.351
And so you might say okay
that means its magnitude

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:46.886
is going to be negative two
times the magnitude of v.

00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:48.351
But you have to remember, magnitude,

00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.051
that's always going to be positive.

00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:51.484
One way to think, when we talk about even

00:01:51.484 --> 00:01:52.751
absolute value we're really thinking about

00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:55.252
the magnitude of something.

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:56.851
We're talking about how long it is.

00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:58.618
We're not thinking about its direction.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.687
So we wouldn't think
about the negative there.

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:02.718
If we think about its direction,

00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:04.984
this negative is going to flip
its direction and we could

00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:06.718
think about that in a second.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:08.185
But if we just think about magnitude,

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:09.952
we care about the two.

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:11.885
So its going to have
two times the magnitude

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:13.551
of vector v.

00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:15.621
So instead of five, it's
going to be five times two,

00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:16.851
which is ten.

00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:18.751
So now they say, match
each vector to defined

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:21.284
to a vector that could be its equivalent.

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:22.753
So if we think about it, the vector with

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:25.452
the smallest magnitude
is going to be vector v.

00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:29.984
The other two we're
multiplying vector v by scalars

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.484
with an absolute value of more than one.

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.151
So they're going to
have larger magnitudes.

00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:36.850
So the smallest magnitude
is this one right over here.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.250
This is the shortest vector.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.819
So that would be our vector v.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.018
Now, vector w would be
one that has three times

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:47.317
the magnitude and it's
going in the same direction.

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:50.318
So, this one has three
times the magnitude.

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:52.284
It looks like three times, roughly.

00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:54.618
And it's definitely going
in the same direction.

00:02:54.618 --> 00:02:57.185
And then vector z would have
two times the magnitude.

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:58.651
But since we have, we're multiplying it

00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.518
by the negative scalar,

00:03:00.518 --> 00:03:02.118
it's going to go in
the opposite direction.

00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:03.118
And this looks like it.

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:05.417
This purple arrow looks like
it's about twice the length

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:06.584
of this red arrow.

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:08.618
And it's going in the opposite direction.

00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:12.051
So I feel pretty good about
what we have done here.

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:14.051
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.785
So, let's do this one here.

00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:20.285
Here we have a vector v again.

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:23.418
It has a magnitude of 10.

00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:24.751
And it says, fill in
the blanks to complete

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:25.891
the following sentences.

00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:30.891
Vector w now, so now
vector w, it's taking each

00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:33.718
of the components of vector
v and multiplying them

00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:35.784
by one-fifth.

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:40.350
So you can view vector w as
being equal to one-fifth,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.251
the scalar one-fifth times vector v.

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:47.485
The magnitude of w is
going to be one-fifth

00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:49.551
the magnitude of v.

00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:52.850
One-fifth of 10 is just going to be two.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.317
Now vector z, it looks
like it's three-fifths

00:03:56.317 --> 00:03:57.818
times vector v.

00:03:57.818 --> 00:04:00.317
We're multiplying each of the
components times three-fifths.

00:04:00.317 --> 00:04:03.085
So that's like multiplying
the entire vector

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:04.784
by the scalar three-fifths.

00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:07.318
So it's magnitude is
going to be three-fifths

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.217
the magnitude of vector v.

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:12.751
And so three-fifths of 10 is six.

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:16.552
All right, then they say,
match each vector defined above

00:04:16.552 --> 00:04:18.351
to a vector that could be its equivalent.

00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:21.117
So here the vector with
the largest magnitude

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:22.618
is vector v.

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:25.051
This would be vector v.

00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:26.886
And the vector with the smallest magnitude

00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:28.418
is vector w.

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:30.819
It's one-fifth the magnitude.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.385
So this has a magnitude, should be 10.

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:35.752
This should one one-fifth of that

00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:37.720
which is a magnitude of
two and it looks like that.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.818
And this should be three-fifths of the 10,

00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:42.084
which is a magnitude of six.

00:04:42.084 --> 00:04:43.161
And that looks about right,

00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:45.284
so I feel good with
what we have filled out.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:48.018
So hopefully that gives you
a sense of how to tackle

00:04:48.018 --> 00:04:51.902
these types of example problems.
