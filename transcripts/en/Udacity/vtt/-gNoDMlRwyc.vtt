00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Narrator] So, here's one possible solution: we construct p2 as a temporary particle set

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we later set p equals p2, so this is just a temporary set.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We then go through all the particles, again, and here is the tricky line.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We append to list P2 the results of our motion of 0.1 and 5.0

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
applied to the [i] particle chosen from the original particle set.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So this applies the move command to each of the particles

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
exactly the same way we applied move to the robot motion before.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
When we are done we reset p=p2.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, we've done the full recursion of applying our motion update

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to our full particle set.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you've gotten this far then you got about half of particle filters implemented,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
unfortunately it's the easy half,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.506
but the difficult half isn't that much more difficult.
