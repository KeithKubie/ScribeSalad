00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.560
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.650
interesting developer community.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.510
has asked this question.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.900
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.795
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is primarily a

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:13.210
question-and-answer show, so if
any of you out there would

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.460
like to ask questions.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.970
MIHAI IONESCU: Hello, welcome
to another session of Google

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.140
Payments live.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.340
My name is Mihai Ionescu.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.640
And--

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.390
VISHAL KUMAR: Hi, guys,
I'm Vishal.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.130
I'm a PM who works on
the Payments team.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190
And today I'll be talking to you
about one of the products

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.600
that I work on.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.240
PENG YING: And I'm Peng.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.580
MIHAI IONESCU: So, Vishal,
thank you for coming.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.700
Today's topic is the Google
Merchant Center.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.440
So what is the Merchant
Center?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920
VISHAL KUMAR: So in our payment
system, we have

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.260
several users.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.430
A lot of our users sell products
to other users.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.030
So what happens is that we have
to design an experience

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.560
for the merchants
who are actually

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.810
selling their products.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.480
This is where they would go to
see what their orders look

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.709
like and do any order management
that they had to,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.570
among other things.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.450
It's basically the experience
that we create for merchants

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.960
transacting on our system.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.750
MIHAI IONESCU: Perfect.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.040
Who uses the Merchant Center?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.160
What are the users?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.890
VISHAL KUMAR: Well, we have,
actually, quite a few

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.610
different sets of users who
use the Merchant Center.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.170
In the product that we used to
call Checkout, there are these

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.100
merchants who are basically
using Checkout out as a way

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.930
for users to pay for the goods
that they just bought.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.740
So we have quite a large number
of merchants who are

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.400
using the system over there.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.610
And since we've started in-app
payments, as you guys are

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.960
really familiar with, all the
developers who are selling

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.500
virtual goods or goods using the
in-apps payment API would

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.380
go to the Merchant Center
to look at their sales.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.940
And we also have, like, Android
developers as another

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.750
segment that would use our APIs
and hence can go to the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.600
Merchant Center to view
their orders.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.610
MIHAI IONESCU: So very useful
for quite a few developers.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.540
Can you talk a little bit about
the common use cases?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.070
How would someone take advantage
of the functionality

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.540
offered by the Merchant
Center?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.729
VISHAL KUMAR: Sure,
I would love to.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.620
So by far, the most common use
case for merchants at the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.930
Merchant Center is
order management.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.310
Merchants log in to get an idea
of the sales that are

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.480
going on on our platform,
to actually look at the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.960
individual orders, and to
perform any order management

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.160
functions such as charging the
order-- in the case of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.110
physical goods--

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.870
or canceling the order, or
refunding the order in case of

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.700
a customer complaint.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.780
This is also where they would
go and download reports.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.080
Say, for example, I wanted
to look at how many

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.280
orders I sold yesterday.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180
I could go and get a report that
would give me a list of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.980
all the orders that came through
the system yesterday.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.790
I can also look out for
exception use cases.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.910
So for example, if one of my
goods suddenly started getting

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.920
a high charge-back rate, this is
where I would go to try to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.980
diagnose the issue, understand
if a particular country was

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.680
causing the problem or
whether I was seeing

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.060
this across all countries.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.790
Another big use case is, of
course, once you've sold

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.220
products, you want to get
paid for the products.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.370
So this is where you would go to
link the account up to your

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.700
bank account and look at the
payments as we push them to

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.630
your bank account and keep
track of your earnings.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.890
MIHAI IONESCU: Thank you.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.150
PENG YING: Cool.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.520
Yeah, I have some questions
for you too.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.440
VISHAL KUMAR: Sure.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.510
PENG YING: I hear, I hear that
you're working on a new

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.465
iteration of the Merchant
Center.

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:33.180
The old one's been, I don't
know, started in 2006, 2007,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.310
and it's about five years old.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.120
And I think we've been
[INAUDIBLE] some feedback

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.910
about some of the requests from
developers, [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.060
developers.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.950
I was wondering if you could go
through maybe a preview of

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.070
what we have to look
for in the future.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.340
Some of the specific pieces of
feedback have been, like,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.120
sign-up is really difficult,
especially entering in all of

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.480
these different pieces
of information.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.710
And sometimes it doesn't
go through.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.810
And sometimes it's buggy.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.640
And if you're going
to address that.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.240
That if I'm the digital goods
merchant, then I don't really

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.690
need shipping addresses and that
kind of stuff-- and maybe

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.010
a better UI.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.730
Maybe a better tax page that's
more easily understandable and

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.029
shows me the tax I need to pay
for a specific state or

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.720
specific country.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.300
And a few other features.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.320
I mean, we've sent you the
feedback, so what do you have?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.980
What do you have
to show for it?

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.970
What's the future of the
Merchant Center?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.730
VISHAL KUMAR: So I'd love to
talk about that a little bit.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.830
Just as Peng was mentioning,
the old Merchant Center is

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.540
several years old now,
which, in Google

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.710
years, is really old.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.120
PENG YING: It's dinosaurs.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.270
VISHAL KUMAR: In a way.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.400
So what we are working on
right now is a brand-new

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.720
iteration of the Merchant
Center.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.280
We've kind of incorporated a
lot of the new UX stylings

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.950
which you may have seen across
some of our other products.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.750
And we're going to address,
specifically, some of the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.780
feedback that Peng
was mentioning.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.620
The idea is that this is going
to be a product that we will

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.350
make significant investments
over the next coming quarters.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.060
And today what I'm showing you
is just sort of the first step

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.900
into improving that
experience.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.430
We have a lot of different new
merchant functionality coming

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.860
out, and we're going to try to
make this experience richer

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.430
and better for our merchants.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.100
So without spending a lot of
time, let me sort of walk you

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.710
through some of the things that
you will see coming up

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.710
very shortly, like in the
next couple of weeks.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.030
PENG YING: Whoa, you're
prepared.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.370
A little slide deck
to show us.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.130
VISHAL KUMAR: Hey, you
know, I'm a PM.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.110
It's what I do for
a living, right?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.640
So as Peng was talking about,
one of the key pieces of

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.120
feedback that we've heard is,
basically, the fact that the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.220
Merchant Center is basically
this slightly old UI.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.730
One sec, it's kind of moving--

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.230
oh, did I push it
in play mode?

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.060
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.270
VISHAL KUMAR: Sorry, guys.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.140
So the old Merchant Center had
this issue that it was

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.790
basically built targeted
towards physical goods.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.710
So when an in-apps merchant
signed in, they would see all

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.340
these sort of settings for
shipping rates, did they ship

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.540
the product, charging for this
individual order, which

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.700
basically made no sense
in their context.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.700
So one of the things that we
did was create two UIs--

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.240
one for a digital merchant, and
then we would then take

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.590
this UI and add physical sale
functionality into the UI.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.070
So today, if you're an in-apps
developer and you come to this

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.820
page, all you will see
are your orders.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.660
And you'll be able to
see how much you're

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.070
making for these orders.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.810
You wont to have to worry about
things like shipping or

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.130
other things that probably
didn't make

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.490
sense in your context.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.980
However, the system will be
intelligent enough in the

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.250
future that if you were selling
both digital and

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.350
physical goods, it would
appropriately show you the

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.360
right options based
on the order.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.640
So what I'm showing you here
is the new look of the UI.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.780
You can see that we've got
the new UX styling.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.080
It's a lot cleaner, a lot
more white space.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.590
We've also combined the order
status and the fulfillment

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.250
status into one icon.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.500
And we're using the light box--
the kind of traffic

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.730
signal analogy.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.650
So if you see a yellow, it means
that order is sort of in

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.730
pending state.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.520
A green is an order that has
gone through successfully.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.870
And a red-- and this is probably
what the merchants

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.520
want to look out for-- are
orders that have issues.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.650
Basically, this would be
something like a buyer's card

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.550
got declined, or we had some
issue with the order because

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.680
of which we couldn't finish
processing it.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.150
I just want to show you a few
more screens to give you a

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.670
sense of what the
UI looks like.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.400
You can see, you know, it really
looks a lot better than

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.230
the old UI that we had
that was kind of

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.740
dated at this point.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.410
We've improved the search
functionality quite

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.650
significantly, actually.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.400
We've added a lot more indexes
in the back end.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.690
And you can now search by a lot
of different strings that

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.956
you couldn't do earlier.

00:08:02.956 --> 00:08:04.490
PENG YING: I think we should
be pretty good at search

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.790
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.010
VISHAL KUMAR: It's true,
this is true.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.620
This is just kind of going
down the UI list.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.640
So it has a [INAUDIBLE]
of functionalities.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.190
If you went over an order,
it would highlight it.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.560
You could actually see what
order you were looking at.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.310
You could click on it to get
a drill-down view where you

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.820
would see further details such
as-- what was the price in the

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.600
buyer's currency, in case that
was a different currency than

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.580
what the merchant specified;
what the different sort of

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.190
transaction fees that were
applied were, what their net

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.659
revenue was; potentially, an
exchange rate; and sort of the

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.429
sequence of events that
made up the order.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:39.875
PENG YING: Is there any
additional information on this

00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:42.120
page that wasn't in the
previous Merchant

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.470
Center order review?

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.430
VISHAL KUMAR: A few things
have been added.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.020
So I think the way we display
currencies has been improved a

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.740
little bit.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.860
But in this version, at least,
we're not gunning for massive

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.590
improvements.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.470
We're just trying to make sure
that we have parity, and then

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.640
we will gradually improve the
experience over the next

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.600
couple of releases.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.030
PENG YING: OK.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.270
VISHAL KUMAR: So this is just
what a cancel would look like

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.720
if you tried to cancel
the order.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.560
Again, just to kind of give you
guys a sense of the UI.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.990
It's really a much more
beautiful, sort of

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.500
easier-flowing UI.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.070
So let's talk about some other
pain points that Peng was

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.380
talking about.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.450
PENG YING: Yeah, seems like you
have a full list there.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.270
VISHAL KUMAR: I have
a few of them.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.260
You know, Peng, Mihai have been

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.420
yelling at me for a while.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.230
So I've been listening
to this.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.780
Sign-up was definitely one of
the big things that I've heard

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.140
a few complaints about.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.020
The form was really long.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.970
It was easy to make mistakes.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.170
There was a lot of extra
information that we were

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.580
asking for upfront.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.905
So what we did in this release
was just clean up this form a

00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:40.670
little bit.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.440
We had to collect certain tax
information about the

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.920
merchants, which we were
attempting to do up front.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.840
We've moved that towards
the back.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.450
And what happens is that, during
your sign-up, we don't

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.260
ask you for this information
anymore.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.230
However, when you try to link
a bank account and get

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.990
dispersed, you may get prompted
for this information,

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.710
depending on what our
lawyers tell us.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.430
I will say that we still ask
for some of the information

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.370
about your business, and this is
basically to make it easier

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.840
for our customers to actually
contact you in

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.650
case there's an issue.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.790
We'll been looking
into what further

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.050
improvements we can do.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.600
I mean, our goal really
is to make the sign-up

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.780
as simple as possible.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.664
PENG YING: Finally.

00:10:19.664 --> 00:10:20.106
This is great.

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:20.990
VISHAL KUMAR: [LAUGH]

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.550
I see Peng's happy.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.450
Let's see if we can
make him happier.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.580
PENG YING: So another thing
is what about sandbox?

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.330
Because in sandbox,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.030
transactions are processed--

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.380
VISHAL KUMAR: Right.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.620
PENG YING: So we can simplify
this further down.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.982
So if I'm just a merchant, I
want to see what's going on, I

00:10:34.982 --> 00:10:36.836
should just be able to click and
then you should just give

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:37.280
me credentials.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.430
VISHAL KUMAR: Right, just
basically one-click

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.020
credentials.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.430
So I've heard that feature
request from you guys.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.160
We're actually working
on it right now.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.420
And hopefully, in a next session
of GDL, I'll be happy

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.630
to tell you guys about what
we're doing to make the

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.820
sandbox implementation
really brain-dead

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.320
simple to sign up in.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.080
PENG YING: Awesome.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.660
VISHAL KUMAR: So kind of going
down this list, another common

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.030
complaint that I hear is
that it's very easy to

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.710
get sales tax wrong.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.640
Merchants are often not aware
of how to put the

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.690
sales tax widget in.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.920
And if any of you have tried
putting sales tax in, you'll

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.700
know that it was a pretty
painful wizard that we used to

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.790
have up there.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.580
So what we're doing in this
release is just giving you

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.110
guys a really simple
tax widget.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.240
We've broken it out into
a bunch of different

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.100
territories.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.470
And for each territory, you
can set the tax rate.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.000
Note that for US and Canada,
we actually accept taxes at

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.290
the province or the
state level.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.810
Whereas for most other countries
it's a flat rate for

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:35.610
the country.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.910
So I'm just going to quickly
give you a demo for what would

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.270
happen if I wanted to update,
say, the tax rate in Canada.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.140
So I go ahead and hit Edit, and
it would give me all the

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.570
provinces in Canada.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.990
If I checked one of these
boxes, I'd then get the

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.930
ability to, basically, put
in the tax rate for that

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.990
particular province.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.160
And I'm done.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.380
So it's really simple.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.830
Go ahead.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.660
PENG YING: Are we pulling
from our database?

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.830
Do we have, like, default tax
rates that we sync with, like,

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.570
or tax people?

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.980
VISHAL KUMAR: We actually don't
have that in the back

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.880
end right now.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.620
And it's almost sort of
intentional, because it's a

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.690
bit of a legal issue with us
keeping tax rates up to date,

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.165
and also because taxes really
depend on where the merchant

00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:23.210
does business and where
they're registered.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.370
It's kind of hard for us to
actually try to figure that

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.750
out automatically.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.780
But we are looking at, in the
future, maybe connecting to a

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.270
tax service, so maybe allowing
them to provide, basically,

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:42.090
just the ability to tell us
where they're incorporated,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.180
and we'd figure out the
taxes for them.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.200
I just wanted to point out,
though, based on what you just

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.790
said, for the US, the merchant
has the option to select

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.910
something that we call TDS.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.490
If he selects TDS, then,
basically, we automatically

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.780
calculate the tax rate for the
state and then charge the

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.890
taxes for them.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.610
However, that service is only
available in the US right now.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.490
PENG YING: So another question
that we often get is dealing

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.540
with the VAT, and how VAT is
different from sales tax.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:09.960
VISHAL KUMAR: Right.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.130
PENG YING: So how is VAT
handled in this?

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.250
Is it going to be--

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.250
would you specify the
price and then we

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.400
add on the VAT amount?

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.080
Or do you specify total price,
and specify VAT, and then we

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.490
just say, this total price
is inclusive of

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.780
this amount of VAT?

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.670
VISHAL KUMAR: So basically, what
they would do is give us

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.430
the VAT rate for the country
that they wanted to sell in.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.450
And based on where the buyer
was, we would either show them

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.430
a tax-inclusive price or
a tax-exclusive price

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.680
automatically once we know where
the buyer's location,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.740
that we would figure out the
tax-inclusive price based on

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.820
the tax rate that the
merchant gave us.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.287
PENG YING: Cool.

00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:43.690
VISHAL KUMAR: Yeah.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.790
This is hopefully going to
address some of the feedback

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.830
that we've been getting.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.820
So this is a big one.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.210
You guys have probably run into
this issue a few times.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.300
In our UI, you can export
the list of orders.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.020
You basically give us two dates,
and we give you all the

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.940
orders that came out
in that date.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.450
Until recently, we sort of had
a back-end limitation, where

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.390
we could only return about 5,000
rows from our database

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.610
at a given time.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.650
This was a limit that we had
imposed based on some of the

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.680
performance metrics
of our system.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.730
I'm glad to report that, in
the new version of the

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.090
Merchant Center, we will
hopefully be able to give you

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.910
as much data as you ask for.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.410
Of course, if you ask us for a
few million rows, it might

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.540
take a little while.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.060
But--

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.040
MIHAI IONESCU: That's
a big merchant.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.055
VISHAL KUMAR: That's a-- you
know, and we have a few of

00:14:28.055 --> 00:14:28.980
those in our system.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.730
We do have a few of those
in our system.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.250
But hopefully this will improve
things significantly

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:33.990
for you guys.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.660
MIHAI IONESCU: So no limit?

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.710
VISHAL KUMAR: That's the plan.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.090
MIHAI IONESCU: Theoretically.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.280
PENG YING: Is this a regular
order report?

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.020
So there were two order
reports in the

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.240
old Checkout, or--

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.180
yeah, Checkout, Merchant
Center.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.630
One of them was a regular
report, another one was the

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.250
report with extra details,
like billing address or

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.640
shipping address,
stuff like that.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.270
Do you know which report
this one's pulling?

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.100
VISHAL KUMAR: It does have
fields for the billing address

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.160
and the shipping--

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.840
well, since it's digital,
it won't have shipping.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.030
But it does have fields for
the billing address.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.820
But basically, those are
returned only when, A, the

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.870
buyer allows it and we're
legally allowed to do so.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.590
PENG YING: OK.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.040
VISHAL KUMAR: So yeah, the API
kind of takes care of that.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.110
And only in cases that we
can actually share that

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:20.380
information with the merchant
do we actually return it.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.870
So let's talk a little bit about
some of the new features

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.480
that are coming in the
Merchant Center.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.300
So one of the things that we've
heard from our merchants

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.330
is that they would like
better analytics.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.370
They want to understand what's
going on in the system, who

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.410
they're selling to, and
where they're selling.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.460
So in this first part of the
Merchant Center, I'm happy to

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.670
announce that we will have some
basic analytics baked

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.800
into the product.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.520
This is just an idea of what
we think we can present.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.620
And we will be adding a lot more
functionality over the

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.470
next few months to this page.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.600
I also just wanted to call out
that one of my colleagues,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.800
Mark, works a lot on this page
and will probably be talking

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.950
to you at some future session
about all the details and all

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.700
the information that
we can offer.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.830
But just as a preview, what
you're seeing over here is

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.810
sort of your historical
sales over time.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.650
You can select the time
range that you want.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.880
And we'll give you some basic
information, such as, how many

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.040
buyers came through and bought
goods from you, how many

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.120
orders they placed, how many of
these buyers came back more

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.920
than once, what was the volume
of refunds and charge-backs

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.950
that you're seeing
on your system.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.120
And then, where possible and
legally allowed, we will try

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.860
to display some demographic
information to you.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.280
So examples might be-- what is
the age breakdown of the

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.350
customers who are buying your
goods, or are they male or are

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.260
they female.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.570
Note that we don't always have
this data because it depends

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.190
on the user opting in and
sharing this data with us.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.680
But where possible, we want to
give merchants more insight

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.340
into what's going on
on the system.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.849
PENG YING: You should totally
tell me what I need to sell to

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:57.735
make the most money.

00:16:57.735 --> 00:17:00.790
Tell me the hot products
that we're selling.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.720
MIHAI IONESCU: Just
show [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.839
VISHAL KUMAR: You know, those
are exactly some of the ideas

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.550
that we're working on.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.829
I don't want to steal Mark's
thunder, though, so I will let

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.069
him come and talk about all
the goods that he's got.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.239
MIHAI IONESCU: I'm sure there
will be more to talk about.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:11.894
VISHAL KUMAR: Yeah.

00:17:11.894 --> 00:17:14.670
PENG YING: Well, so I think a
few merchants have already

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.119
integrated with Analytics.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:20.650
And can you go into how this
differs from Google Analytics,

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.094
or how the systems co-exist?

00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:25.250
VISHAL KUMAR: So I'll talk about
that really quickly.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.119
Like I said, I don't want to
steal Mark's thunder, or he's

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.369
not going to be really
happy with me.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.760
PENG YING: He's not here, so--

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.970
VISHAL KUMAR: Well, but he is
supposed to buy me a beer at

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.340
some point today, so you know.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.420
And I want my beer.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.160
So just coming back to what
Peng was asking, though,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.330
Analytics is mostly based on
sort of mapping the funnels,

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.700
keeping track of users as they
go through the purchase

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.100
funnel, figuring out how many
users came through, what the

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.130
drop-off rate was, what
the [? paid ?]

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.210
rate was.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.990
Analytics really don't have
insights into the orders

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.490
themselves.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.140
The unique information we, as
the Checkouts or Google Wallet

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.310
platform possess, is we actually
see the orders.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.410
We know where the users
are coming from.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.080
We can track what currencies
they are actually purchasing

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.030
these goods in, how they're
paying for them, basically

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.960
information about the payment
system itself.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.060
What we tried to focus on
as we were building this

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.320
Analytics page was data that
was unique to our system.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.520
So what you'll see coming from
us over the next coming months

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.250
is tighter integration with
Analytics so that you can

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.150
track both the funnel as well
as your individual orders.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.680
But in the Merchant Center
itself, the focus that you'll

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.965
see is towards the orders
that are being

00:18:29.965 --> 00:18:31.620
placed in the system.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.010
Again, I want to let Mark come
and talk a lot more in the

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.500
future about the stuff that
he's building over there.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.710
PENG YING: Yeah, I'll definitely
have him on one of

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.960
these days.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.020
VISHAL KUMAR: So a feature that
we announced at Google

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.490
I/O was subscriptions.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.590
And I just wanted to show you
guys what you can do with

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.080
subscriptions in the new
Merchant Center.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.430
If you start selling
subscriptions, which are

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.660
basically recurring payments
to users, you will see all

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.360
your subscriptions orders marked
with the Subscription

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.460
icon on the Orders page.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.340
If you drill into them, you
will see that the Order

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.020
Details page has
a similar icon.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.220
Now let's talk a little bit
about what is the extra

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.850
functionality that merchants
have on the

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.150
Order Details page.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.650
So in the old page, all you
would do with an order is

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.180
essentially refund
or cancel it.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.390
Now when you come to
subscriptions, you have a

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.290
series of orders tied to
a single subscription.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.600
Another common operation that
you might want to perform is

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.820
canceling the entire
subscription.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.580
So if the order is a
subscription order and you

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.120
chose to cancel it, you'll be
given an option of canceling

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.000
that individual order or
canceling the entire

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.010
subscription.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.780
Canceling an individual order is
sort of like refunding the

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.480
customer for maybe one period,
be that a month, or a week, or

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.880
a year, maybe because he had
some problems with the

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:54.100
subscription or the content did
not refresh, or as just a

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.310
loyal customer kind of thing.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.040
But if you wanted to ensure
that the customer was not

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.620
charged for the subscription in
the future, then you would

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.920
go ahead and cancel
the subscription.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.190
Hopefully this comes
across in the UI.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.560
These are one of the things that
we'd like users to try

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.670
out and give us feedback on.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.190
I just also wanted to call out
that the Google cancellation

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.250
policy is--

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.950
when you cancel a subscription,
we don't

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.580
automatically refund the
unused portion of the

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.740
subscription.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.690
We basically allow the customer
to have access to

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.930
that content till the
period runs out.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.946
But we do not charge that
customer again.

00:20:31.946 --> 00:20:34.700
Any questions about
this, guys?

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.910
PENG YING: Hmm, well, I mean,
it's much better because I

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.770
remember that merchants had a
lot of confusion trying to

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:41.360
cancel subscriptions.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.860
They were like-- find the first
order of all the orders

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.705
and cancel that.

00:20:45.705 --> 00:20:47.110
VISHAL KUMAR: It was definitely
something that, I

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.970
think, was not very intuitive.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.560
And this is a feature
that I've heard a

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.310
lot of requests for.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.910
So I'm sure the merchants are
looking forward to playing

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.580
around with this.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.160
PENG YING: Is there
any way to view--

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.470
I'm not sure if this is useful
to merchants, but this is off

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.370
the top of my head.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.190
Is there any way to view all
of the orders in, like, a

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.620
thread for subscriptions?

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.070
VISHAL KUMAR: So that's
a great feature, Peng.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.690
We're actually going to
be developing that.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.000
And you should see that coming
up in a couple of weeks.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.750
I actually didn't throw it up in
these marks, because I was

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.630
kind of focusing on the things
that we'll be releasing in the

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.020
next coming weeks.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.850
But this is a sort of a good
opportunity to let merchants

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.170
know that we've got a pretty
large and aggressive road map

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.570
for what we plan to do with
the Merchant Center.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.690
We are trying to build a
one-stop shop for the

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.860
merchants to come in, and track
all their orders, and

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.880
track all their exchanges with
the Google Wallet at one spot.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.630
PENG YING: Cool.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.350
VISHAL KUMAR: So I wanted to
lastly talk a little bit about

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.990
some of the feedback that we've
heard around reconciling

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.140
orders to the disbursements
that merchants receive.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.120
So what we're doing in this
release is actually just the

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.630
first step over there.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.530
We've basically improved the
look and feel of the Payouts

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.060
page so that you can now get a
sense for what your earnings

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.750
were on a particular
day and what your

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.110
disbursements are like.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.250
But what we really need
is a way to link an

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.550
order to the payment.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.890
So the way the Google payment
system works is that we get a

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.000
series of orders from
the merchants.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.510
At some point in time, we
raise an invoice, which

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.900
basically tells us how much
we owe the merchant.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.800
And then we use the information
that the merchant

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.390
gave us to actually pay them.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.900
What we're going to do is
introduce a page that will

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.650
allow you to link all the
orders that went into a

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.920
particular invoice.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.450
And we will also tell you
how much we paid out

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.166
against each invoice.

00:22:42.166 --> 00:22:43.270
Does that sound good?

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.476
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, that
sounds perfect.

00:22:44.476 --> 00:22:45.750
It was very confusing.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.350
VISHAL KUMAR: All right.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.470
Yeah, so you know--

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.190
PENG YING: That's much easier
reconciliation.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.210
VISHAL KUMAR: So that's kind
of everything that I just

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.470
wanted to touch on today.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.060
Before I hand this back to Peng
and Mihai, though, we

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.510
really need your help to test
this new Merchant Center.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.040
We're going to launch this
experience in the next couple

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.310
of weeks, and we want merchants
to sign up and play

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.340
with it and tell us what
they think about it.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.550
So if you think this is
something you'd be interested

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:15.630
in doing, email me or email
us, rather, at this alias.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.642
It's mc-feedback@google.com.

00:23:18.642 --> 00:23:20.400
We monitor this alias.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.920
We'll respond to any questions
that you send over here.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.600
And if you're interested in
participating in our beta,

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.690
we'd love to hear what
you have to say.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.530
Just before I leave, a
couple of caveats.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.200
So currently, the new experience
will only work if

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.640
you're an in-app merchant.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.980
If you're selling physical
goods or you're selling

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.360
Android apps, this experience
will not be available to you

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.740
for about another couple
of months.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.190
And the other thing I would
say is that if you're a

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.970
customer who has been on our
system for a while, you will

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.740
not see your legacy
disbursements in this payout

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.690
format that I was just
talking about.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.160
We will, however, link to a page
where you can see what

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.020
you've got disbursed
for in the past.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.810
So a couple of caveats, but I
believe a big step forward.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.270
And I'm really looking forward
to what you guys have to say

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.170
about the system.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.590
PENG YING: So at a high level,
the main benefits are a really

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:17.290
easy-to-view overview page,
great subscription support, a

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:22.700
better order reports, or
unlimited order reports, and--

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.800
MIHAI IONESCU: Analytics?

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.680
PENG YING: Yeah, analytics.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.490
So you can see--

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.390
VISHAL KUMAR: Great analytics.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:31.150
Yeah, I mean I think, as Peng
was saying, we really improved

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.160
the user experience.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.610
I think users will find the
UI to be fluid, a lot more

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.750
intuitive, easier to
find information.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.100
There's a lot of in-context
help that will be

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.900
available to you.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.920
There are tool tips that help
explain what's going on.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.630
There are hovers so that
you understand

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.340
what the icons mean.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.390
We spent a lot of time thinking
about how to make

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.290
this UX more desirable and
usable for merchants.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.470
And then we've definitely

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.690
addressed some of the feedback--

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.650
specifically making the sign-up
a lot easier, giving

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.050
merchants analytics so they
have an insight into what

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.615
they're selling, giving
subscription support, which

00:25:05.615 --> 00:25:08.930
has been a pretty common ask
from a lot of our merchants.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.460
And we'll also be doing some
additional work around

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.060
addressing some of
the feedback that

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.510
Peng was talking about.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.680
MIHAI IONESCU: So
quick question.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.090
You said this is only available
for in-app merchants

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:22.780
in the near future.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.080
What happens when a merchant
sells both physical and

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.830
digital goods?

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.300
VISHAL KUMAR: Right, so that's
a great question, Mihai.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.370
In the first launch we won't
be able to support those

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.630
merchants on our new platform.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:39.300
However, like I said, this is
just the way we've decided the

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.680
roadmap should work, because
we have to go and work with

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.280
each team to make sure
that the new

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.610
experience works for them.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.270
So every week, we're trying to
get more and more of those

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.470
merchants onto our platform.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.140
And basically, in a couple of
quarters I expect everybody

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.480
will be on this new
experience.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.170
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:58.625
VISHAL KUMAR: Yeah.

00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:00.110
MIHAI IONESCU: Well, thank
you very much, Vishal.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.140
I hope everyone enjoyed
the new preview of

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.570
the Merchant Center.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:09.850
And quick reminder, if you
want to participate in

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.460
beta-testing the new Merchant
Center, send us a message to

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.130
mc-feedback@google.com and
we'll respond to you.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.946
And we'll tell you how
you can test it.

00:26:19.946 --> 00:26:22.960
Great, so we have a
few more minutes

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.880
to answer some questions.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.210
Want to stick around
for questions?

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.680
VISHAL KUMAR: Sure.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.040
MIHAI IONESCU: Thank you.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.580
So let's see here.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.380
We have a few people who
submitted questions on our

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.890
moderator page.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:39.580
The first question is about
payment support in different

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.380
geographies.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.100
What is the timeline for opening
up payments in other

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.630
geographies, specifically
France, India,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.092
other European countries?

00:26:49.092 --> 00:26:53.340
It's not clear if this refers to
in-app payments or Android.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:53.920
PENG YING: Or Checkout.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.860
MIHAI IONESCU: Or Checkout.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.310
But let's assume it
refers to digital

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.870
payments or in-app payments.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.960
France, it's supported on both
Android and in-app payments.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.370
India, it's not supported
on either.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.100
To give you a context, we offer
in-app payment support

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.580
in 31 countries on Android and
18 countries on digital goods

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.320
payments for the web.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.770
We are adding new countries
all the time.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.070
It is a laborious process,
not from a

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.420
technical point of view.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.790
That is the easy part.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:33.040
But we have to follow the legal
requirements for money

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.650
transfer in each one
of those countries.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.660
So for some countries, it's
taking longer than others.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:47.640
But we have been adding new
countries at a very nice pace.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.890
Usually, new countries are added
to Android, and then

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.370
they shortly follow on
in-app payments.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.090
So keep an eye on the
announcements, new

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.270
announcements from us.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.080
We will be adding
new countries.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.270
And I think the next couple
of questions--

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:04.080
PENG YING: Vishal, do you have
any more insight into

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.920
expanding internationally?

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.720
VISHAL KUMAR: No, unfortunately
not.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.350
PENG YING: You're a
product manager.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.180
I thought you guys were supposed
to know everything,

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.100
have insights group.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.330
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, the next
couple of questions are also

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.770
asking about the ETAs on
launching payment support in

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:18.660
new countries.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.680
And as I said, we'll
keep you posted.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.010
PENG YING: Rules and
regulations.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.890
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.100
And then we have a
question about--

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.180
this is in-app payments
for the web.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.640
Is there a way to remove the
pop-up when the user first

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.160
initiates an in-app payment
transaction?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.380
So the pop-up you're seeing when
you're first trying to

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.710
make a payment is needed
to log you in securely.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.040
So it's a security feature.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.990
If you're logged in, then you
won't see the pop-up.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.660
We're looking at ways to
minimize that impact and find

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.830
a way to have you perform
the transaction

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.280
entirely within the page.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.010
So we're working on that.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.070
Stay tuned.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.960
PENG YING: And something
about-- do you know?

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.720
I think it's something about
risk-based authentication

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.400
instead of just regular
authentication.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.110
MIHAI IONESCU: There are ways to
minimize the impact of that

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.270
and make it a better
user experience.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:18.880
But at the same time, we're
very careful about not

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.130
affecting your security
and identity.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.595
PENG YING: Of course.

00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:25.495
How about that, you have any
insight into that either?

00:29:25.495 --> 00:29:26.960
VISHAL KUMAR: Clearly, I'm the
one who's supposed to have

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.570
insight into everything, huh?

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.804
PENG YING: Just focus on the
Merchant Center, man.

00:29:30.804 --> 00:29:31.730
All right.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.910
MIHAI IONESCU: OK, well--

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:33.680
PENG YING: We don't have
any more questions?

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.410
MIHAI IONESCU: We don't
have any more

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.000
questions for this week.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.790
And we're out of time,
so we'll see

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.690
you at our next session.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.150
PENG YING: Well, in two
weeks we have a

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.450
great session for you.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:45.480
We're inviting the product
manager for Google Wallet.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.835
So if you have any
Wallet-related questions, when

00:29:48.835 --> 00:29:53.580
we put up the next session,
ask them in the moderator.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.440
And with that, I think
we're done.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:55.770
MIHAI IONESCU: Thank you.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.260
VISHAL KUMAR: Thanks, guys.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.560
MIHAI IONESCU: Bye.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:56.860
PENG YING: See you.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:12.600
