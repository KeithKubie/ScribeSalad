Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.680
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360

we got here. An exploration made possible

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.714

- [Ajit] Good afternoon. My name is Ajit
Varki. I'm the co-director of the Center

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.540
for Academic Research and Training in
Anthropogeny, or CARTA, along with Rusty

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.160
Gage, my co-director, and Margaret
Schoeninger couldn't be here today. I'd

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.200
like to welcome you to this very special
event. As you probably know, some of you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.980
know, CARTA is dedicated to the search for
explaining our origins. Who are we? How

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.500
did we get here and where are we going?
And some terms. So, much of our activity

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.880
has to do with public symposia,
interactions with the public and also

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.020
private discussions involving a
trans-disciplined group of scientists from

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.270
all across the world, spanning many
disciplines. But the other aspect of our

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.000
work that you may not be as aware of is
that we focus a lot on the future

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.460
generation. We have a group of specialty
students in this Specialization Track for

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.210
Anthropogeny. And the other thing we have,
which is very special, is a group of very

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.230
well-known advisers from all across the
world. So, once in a while, we tap on one

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.730
of these advisers to come and visit us. In
this case, we are bringing in a very

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.710
special guest, one of our advisers, who's
also going to interact with our students.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.100
But since this is all about students and
not about me, I'm going to hand over to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.390
Pascal Gagneux, who's our associate
director, who runs the Specialization

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.240
Track in Anthropogeny. Pascal?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.480
- [Pascal] Thank you very much, Ajit, and
welcome again to all of you for this great

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.980
afternoon. I am very happy to introduce
professor Francisco Ayala, who grew up in

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.590
Madrid, Spain. And during high school,
fired up by an especially enthusiastic

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.190
science teacher, developed a passion for
science. But then went on to study Physics

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.520
and Theology at the University of
Salamanca. Physics in Madrid and then

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.780
Theology at the Pontifical Academy in
Salamanca. And during his studies of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.860
theology, he came across an interesting
book called, "Le Phénomène Humain, " that

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.920
was written by a Jesuit paleontologist,
Pierre de Chardin. And of course, "Le

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.340
Phénomène Humain" is "The Phenomenon of
Man, " and it is what CARTA is striving to

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.800
explain. What is it that makes us this
very strange ape, among other apes, but

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.220
with our very, very special attributes
that will be discussed today. Reading “Le

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.840
Phénomène Humain” sparked his interest in
Evolution and Genetics. And so, he

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.630
actually came to Columbia University, he
was very fortunate to have some advisors

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.880
in Spain that knew Theodosius Dobzhansky,
one of the major architects of the Modern

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.400
Synthesis of Evolution, who was a
geneticist interested in actually

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.780
observing and empirically measuring what
was going on in natural populations of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.840
organisms that are busy evolving. And of
course, the work horse of naturally

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.910
evolving organisms was Drosophila. So long
before the advent of isozymes or

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.890
restriction enzymes or DNA sequence,
geneticist were very busy observing

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.760
generations after generations of these
tiny, little fruit-flies that annoy you,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.990
around your bananas near your kitchen. And
selecting for new phenotypes and wondering

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.460
what it is. They could see the chromosomes
but they couldn't read the DNA yet. Once

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.910
there were restriction enzymes, they could
start cutting the DNA at specified places,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.020
still not being able to read the actual
sequence. So, years of years of study, a

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.900
PhD on the genetics of Drosophila
continued, lead professor Ayala to look at

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.900
a variety of other organisms, and then
with the aid of more modern techniques.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.540
Among these organisms, featured some very
prominent protozoans, like Trypanosomes,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.330
in this case T.cruzi from South America
that causes Chagas disease that might be

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.130
one of the things that ail Darwin for so
long. It turns out, these organisms are

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.870
diploid, but they're mostly asexual. So,
here you have organisms with a lot of

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.530
variability that forgo sex for most of the
part. And it turns out, all these

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:21.270
organisms are parasitic. So, contributions
to the biology of these Trypanosomes

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.720
continued. So did contributions to this
major disease-causing organism, in this

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.820
case a merozoites of a Plasmodium
falciparum, the major disease of our

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.950
species. And by now, with help of
sequence...full on genome sequencing, it

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.040
was possible to actually retrace the
history of organisms, such as these

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.390
protozoa, that have been plaguing
human-kind for a very long time. And even

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:53.790
reconstruct the evolutionary history that
jumps between species. But, of course, the

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.800
fact that the book, one of the things that
sparked Francisco Ayala's interest in

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.170
evolution and genetics was The Human
Phenomenon makes him a card-carrying

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.150
anthropogenist, in terms of trying to
understand what it is that makes us such a

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:15.000
bizarre paradoxical ape. And I thought,
given today's topic, I would not end

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.620
before reading a short chapter out of
Dobzhansky's book called, "Mankind

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.800
Evolving, " from 1962, published a year
before I was born, and this is out of the

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.670
library of my late father, in which
Dobzhansky makes a very important thesis,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.810
namely that "Human evolution has two
components: the biological, or organic;

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:43.110
and the cultural, or super-organic. These
components are neither mutually exclusive,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.040
nor independent, but interrelated and
interdependent. Human evolution cannot be

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.580
understood as a purely biological process,
nor can it be adequately described as a

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:00.280
history of culture. It is the interaction
of biology and culture. There exists a

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:08.200
feedback between biological and cultural
processes." So, we'll have the pleasure to

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.210
hear professor Ayala talk about ethics and
morality today. And, of course, he is a

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.300
very well-know Evolutionary Biologist. He
has been called, rightly, the "Renaissance

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.630
Man of Evolutionary Biology, " and is a
recipient of many, many prestigious

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.220
honors, including the National Medal of
Science; he's a member of National Academy

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:33.800
of Science of the United States, of
Mexico, the Collège de France, Russia, and

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:43.410
Serbia and that's just a very small list
of the many declarations that he has been

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:49.520
given. So, without farther ado, let me
introduce Francisco Ayala on "Evolution of

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:59.120
Ethical Behavior and Moral Values:
Biology? Culture?"

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.490
- [Francisco] It is a pleasure to be here.
I have come from time to time to lecture

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:10.230
at UC San Diego. And, of course, I'm a
regular member of CARTA so I come for the

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:15.560
CARTA meetings again from time to time, as
often as I can. On occasion, I miss a

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.170
meeting because I have other obligations.
So, thank you very much for inviting me.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:29.680
Thank you Ajit and Pascal and Ingrid.
Anyway, it is a pleasure to be here. This

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:37.730
is the Universal Tree of Life. It was duly
constructed 40 years ago with ribosomal

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:43.650
RNA genes which tells you the power of
molecular biology. That includes

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:50.070
everything that exists on Earth. You are
all familiar with bacteria. And of course

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:57.160
we tend to think of bacteria as organisms
that cause diseases, but bacteria are very

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.240
helpful to the rest of life, including
ourselves. We estimate that humans have

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:10.980
about one billion human cells. We have
about 10 billion bacterial cells because

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:17.560
bacterias are much smaller than eukaryotic
cells, which are what human cells are. So,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:25.530
we have then this archaea that are very
microscopic organisms, very small like

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:31.420
bacteria who have been discovered as a
group just about the time, anywhere before

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:38.100
this tree was built. A couple of species
were known that were thought to be unusual

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.650
kinds of bacteria. But then you guys
discovered that actually there are very

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:53.410
numerous archaea. This tree is designed
with a convention that the length of each

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:59.880
branch is approximately, in a very rough
way, proportional to the diversity of the

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.420
organism in the branch. So you see the
branches of bacteria, we have almost as

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:10.620
many branches of archaea, and then of
course, we have the eukaryotes; the

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:16.830
plants, animals and fungi, as well as many
microscopic organisms, including some that

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.550
cause the severe diseases, as Pascal was
pointing out. And by the way, thank you

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:29.720
for the introduction. If we now look at
the animals, look with the small fraction

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:37.030
of the total organisms that exist on Earth
that the animals are. The animals are

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:44.740
organized in about 35 so-called "phyla, "
and within each phylum, there are some

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:52.470
classes. And here, we are going to look at
one, the mammals, is one of the classes.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:59.540
And see here, we have a number of
branches. Coming here in this branch; to

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:06.320
rodents, to rabbits, and the primates. So
here is where we belong in one of these

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:16.470
branches. So, we are again a very, very
small fraction of the total animals. One

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.620
species among so very many, and the
animals are a small fraction of the total

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:28.110
of life. Now, if we look at the primates,
we find ourselves here at the end of this

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:33.250
branch, having separated from the branch
that goes to the chimps, which are, of

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.070
course, our closest relatives, closest
living relatives, about seven million

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:42.030
years ago. The chimpanzees are more
closely related to us than they are to the

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:49.920
gorillas, than we are to the gorillas.
Now, the question is, what happened since

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.800
our separation from the lineage, and of
course the chimpanzees. And here I have a

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.800
representation, again, about a few years
ago, of a member of a species in the

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.960
lineage that used to be called "Hominids,
" now they are called "Hominins." So,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.630
starting about seven millions years ago,
we have a series of species, you know with

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.410
exotic names, Paranthropus or the
Pethicus. And we come in to

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:22.960
Australopithecus, and eventually Homo,
this Hominid man in Latin, and there's the

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:30.110
name of our species, as well as several of
our ancestral species. So, we, our

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:37.340
ancestral lineage, became bipedal shortly
after the separation from the lineage that

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:43.690
goes to the chimpanzees. So starting about
seven million years ago. So we have a

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:50.850
feature that distinguishes us clearly from
all the primates and the ape, particularly

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:58.500
more closely related primates, the apes
which is that bipedal gait. Then, we also

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.860
have, as another very distinct feature,
morphological feature: our large brain.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:09.520
The bipedal gait probably started, at
least partially, already seven million

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.780
years ago, or so. But the brain does not
start to increase in size until about, the

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:24.560
time of Homo habilis, about two and a half
million years ago, or so. So, here we have

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.650
one of the Australopithecine species, the
so-called "Lucy, " Australopithecus

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:37.140
afarensis, living about four and half
million years ago, or so. And it is clear

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:46.160
that it is bipedal by just looking at the
hip bone. You can see the shape of it. If

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.150
we compare it with a hip of a human and
the one of the gorilla, maybe apparent in

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.590
a moment, and this apparently already here
that she had to have walked, as we do

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:06.160
walk, with a bipedal gait. By the way, I
have enlarged here relatively speaking the

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.110
size of the hip of Lucy, because Lucy, as
we will see, was much, much smaller than

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:17.820
we are. So here you have the way a gorilla
walks or a chimpanzee, resting on the

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:24.610
knuckles, this knuckle-walking it's
called. In relation to very long arms, you

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:32.040
need a very long hip as we saw in the
previous drawing. And here we have our

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:40.550
human hip. And here we have Lucy. Again,
she had to walk as we walk with a hip bone

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:49.180
the way she had it, she had to walk just
bipedally as we do. Now, the other feature

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:57.340
that I have pointed out as distinctive is
morphological feature, the large brain.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.860
There is always a relationship between
different parts of the body with respect

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:08.080
to size. It's called "allometric
relationship." There is some kind of

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.510
equation that describe the change in size
of one part, the change in size of one

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:20.150
part relatively to other part as they vary
in size. So, what I am showing here with

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:28.040
this cartoon, is that the reason why we
have larger brain, which is as I said

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:38.120
started to grow at the time of Homo
habilis and may have been up to 600 cubic

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:43.690
centimeters or 300 grams. For much of the
previous history was about 300 to 400

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:49.720
cubic centimeters, the same size as the
brain of a chimpanzee or a gorilla. But

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.120
then, about two million and half years
ago, the brain started to grow. And what

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.660
I'm trying to show with this cartoon is
that it is not a question of allometric

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.020
growth. It's not only really because we
are bigger, we have bigger brain. Because

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.750
here we have another Australopithecine,
like robustus, that in terms of

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:18.360
volume-mass were as large as we are. And
yet their brain was still small. We have a

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.620
brain about 1,400 cubic centimeters, four
times the size of the brain of a gorilla

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:32.100
or chimpanzee, or more. And a little more
professionally ways or scientifically I

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:39.260
have shown in this slide that the growth
of the brain something that happened very

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:45.780
special in the evolution of Homo. So here
we have the body weight for various

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:51.020
animals, primates. And here the brain
size. So we look at the chimp and a

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:57.590
gorilla first, gorilla becomes three times
heavier than a chimpanzee, the brain also

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.160
increases somewhat. Australopithecus
afarensis, Lucy, and Orangutan and other

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.570
Australopithecines feed there. But look
what happens when we come to Homo habilis,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:15.730
Homo erectus, or Homo sapiens. This triple
in size of the brain seems to happen, have

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:21.340
happened with relatively small increase in
body size. So it's not an allometric

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.410
growth. It's something else that was going
on. And what was going on, that's the

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:33.740
question. Here is a hypothesis of one of
the things and may have been not the only

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:42.320
one that explains why the brain becomes so
large. So we have bipedal gait for several

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:48.520
million years, what was happening with a
bipedal gait is we were thus...we were

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:55.200
changing very greatly were the arms and
the hands. Our arms are much more elastic

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.640
and much more moveable than those of the
chimpanzee or a gorilla. And particularly

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.010
the hand. Even a Chimpanzee cannot do
this, and although they seem to have five

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:11.920
fingers as we do, they cannot manipulate
objects the way we do. And they cannot

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.270
build objects the way we do. And they
don't have the sensitivity to the

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:23.630
temperature, roughness of surfaces and the
like. So, what is being proposed in this

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:29.110
slide, this hypothesis is that as a
consequence of the evolution of the arm

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:35.770
and the hand, our ancestors started to
build tools, not only use tools, but also

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:44.070
build tools. Now, building a tool requires
forming mental images of realities that

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:51.710
are not present. We build a knife because
we are going to use for cutting. We're

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:58.760
going to use it later. An arrow is built
for the purpose of hunting. Now, forming

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.860
mental images of realities that are not
present is a distinctively human attribute

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:13.570
and I will elaborate a little more later.
So, who were able to make the better

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:20.970
tools, those who were smarter, they were
more able to anticipate the future, the

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:26.250
realities that were not present, the
future use of the tools. So, the ones who

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:31.040
were smarter they made better tools. And
the tools help them to survive and

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:41.680
reproduce. So, this sort of feedback
cycle, then you have the brain becoming

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:49.950
larger and larger and tools being more and
more complicated as time goes by. There

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:57.190
are two other hypothesis that are I would
advance, to justify the increase in brain

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:03.760
size. But I don't want to deliver them
now. I would mention just one because it's

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:12.310
going to appear in a moment, is the
"cryptic ovulation" in human women. And

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:17.660
there are species, at least among the
primates, is the only one in which the

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:25.540
females have cryptic ovulation, that it is
not visible, not obvious. When, in most

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:34.180
primates, and most certainly apes, when
the female goes into estrus, the external

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:40.720
genitals enlarge. And very often acquire
varicose. So, the female is advertising,

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.890
"Now I'm fertile." So a male comes, mates
with that female. And from the

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.600
evolutionary point of view, there is no
reason for him to stay there because if

00:21:51.600 --> 00:22:00.160
they had mated when she is fertile, the
probability that she would have been, had

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:07.450
become pregnant, that the mating would
have been successful is almost 100%. So

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:13.340
from the evolutionary point of view, it's
better for this male to look for another

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:19.880
female so that his genes can be
transmitted to as many progeny as

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:26.130
possible. Once ovulation become cryptic,
the male doesn't know when the female is

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:33.770
fertile. So the only way to make sure that
the fertilization has taken place is if he

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:39.160
stays there with the woman. So that gives
rise to the... It is the origin of the

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.390
nuclear family, and of course, the nuclear
family eventually gives, is the basis of

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:51.150
the evolution of societies. So I think the
cryptic ovulation and also social

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:57.640
organization that also accounts, in good
part, for the enlargement of the brain.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:04.010
But I will not deliver that much more
except in passing again. Here, we have a

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:12.840
list of anatomical features that
distinguish us from the apes. "Bipedal

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:19.060
posture, " I have said enough about that.
"Opposing thumbs." I also pointed out that

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.010
this is an attribute that we have that is
really important for tool-making. "Large

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.970
brain, " of course. "Reduction of jaws and
remodeling of the face." That of course

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:34.880
happens because as the brain became
larger, for the child, baby to be able to

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:42.220
pass through the birth canal, some part of
the head had to be reduced. And that

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.180
happened to be the jaw. Of course, the
jaws of a chimpanzee or a gorilla

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:55.020
protrudes. Ours, they are much smaller. By
the way, also, a human baby is more a much

00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:01.320
earlier stage, biologically speaking, than
the chimpanzee baby or a gorilla baby. So

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.890
then, we have here "cryptic ovulation"
which I already have spoken about. "Slow

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:12.740
development." And "modification of the
vocal tract and larynx, " so we can speak.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.600
Chimpanzees cannot speak, not only because
they don't have the ability to have

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:25.060
language, but also they cannot emit the
sounds as we can. So now, a list here of

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:31.750
some of the behavioral differences between
us and the primates: "Intelligence."

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:37.740
First, abstract thinking. That is, we are
able to think about things that do not

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:45.010
exist in reality, you know, beauty for
example. We also have this attribute of

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:54.460
categorization. It is that we see
individual objects as members of the

00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:00.550
general category. This is a very, very
powerful adaptation because, say you have

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:07.110
this fruit here, this is an apple, this
other one is a pear. When I see them and I

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.740
know to which category they belong, I know
a lot about their properties. It's a very

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:19.270
important feature of human intellect. And
then, reasoning and the power of logical

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:25.760
deduction which is very instinctively
human. Very briefly, of course we have

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.730
"Symbolic (creative) language." The
socialist who discovered symbolic language

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.870
also with this all and they communicate
symbolically. But this all determined by

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:41.190
their genes is not creative. We have
"Self-awareness and death-awareness." I

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:47.150
will say a couple of words about that. We
are aware that we exist as individuals.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:53.660
And because we are aware that we exist as
individuals, we are death-aware. We are

00:25:53.660 --> 00:26:00.850
aware that we will die because we see all
the members of our species, other humans,

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:07.170
they die. We are the only animal, I will
propose, although not everybody will agree

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:15.080
with me, that has self-awareness. And my
argument is that we know that we are the

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:21.610
only ones who have self-awareness. The
dog, or a horse or a bird do not know that

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:26.580
they exist as separate individuals because
if they would know that, they will have

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.540
death-awareness. I mean, they would have
that awareness, they will practice

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.170
ceremonial burial of the dead because you
know that you are going to die, you want

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:42.070
to be treated with respect when you die.
And that's what leads to the ceremonial

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:48.300
burial of the dead. [Inaudible 00:26:44]
at least for a few hundred thousand years.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:55.100
But we are the only ones who practice
formal burial of the dead. Then you have

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.860
"tool-making and technology." I hardly
need to say anymore. "Science, literature,

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.170
art, ethics and religion, social
organization, legal codes." So now, I'm

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:13.340
going to discuss the issue of ethics
explicitly. Now, when philosophers talk

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:19.050
about ethics or morality, they distinguish
three kinds of issues. One which is called

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:26.340
"Metaethics, " which is "Why we ought to
do what we ought to do." Why is there are

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:33.620
ethical behavior? Then Normative ethics
which are the rules. "What we ought to

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:40.090
do." Maybe not to kill, not to steal. Then
Practical ethics, that is "Moral norms

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:46.560
applied to particular situations." Is it
acceptable to kill the baby in order to

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:53.360
save the life of the mother? Or the ones
not as transcendental as that. But we are

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:02.920
continuously dealing with practical ethics
in our lives. The Metaethical Doctrines.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:08.390
Here, I have listed a few proper book
about, a philosophical book about, ethics

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:13.800
my list and also whom I list, two dozen of
them. But here, to have you an idea of

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.430
some of the kinds of doctrines that exist.
One, is "moral realism." The people who

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:25.170
believe that moral facts exist in the
world, that moral things are not that we

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:31.500
invent, but that they are existing in
reality. Killing is bad by itself. Then,

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.510
there is of course a "divine command, "
which is very important for people of

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:41.610
faith. The reason why killing is bad is
because God tells us that we should not

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:48.980
kill. And we have the Ten Commandments.
Then, "utilitarianism, " which is that

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:55.100
things are judged morally in terms of
their consequences with respect to other

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:01.370
individuals. The more individuals benefit
from a behavior, the more acceptable this

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:07.350
behavior is, morally. And then, this
"positivism, " which says there is no

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.690
rational foundations for morality, they
are useless issues arbitrarily made either

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:17.690
by individuals or by society. Also these
are the traditional and is still

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:24.650
occurring. Some of the Metaethical
Doctrines. And then we have Darwin. In

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:31.790
1859, he published "The Origin of
Species." At the very end of the book, he

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:38.790
has a short sentence. He says, "This idea
of life will be thrown up on the Origin of

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:44.740
Man." Out of the ideas that he presented
there. And indeed, that happened 12 years

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:53.490
later, when he published in 1871 "The
Descent of Man, " which were ethics is an

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:59.000
important consideration. So, what happens
is, once evolution came about, Theory of

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.110
Evolution, now there was a new way of
explaining morality. A result of

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:12.790
biological evolution. And we have two
schools, as it were. There are the people

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:20.080
who say we have morality, we have ethics
because of biological nature, because we

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:27.580
are human beings and thus determined in
our biology that we will see some actions

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:33.140
as being moral. And then there are the
people who say, "No, no. Morality is more

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.120
than a question of culture. It's not
biologically determined. It's a question

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.880
of cultural traditions, religious, or
otherwise." Now, usually, philosophers

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.510
argue that morality is mostly cultural.
Biologists, and evolutionists in

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:55.370
particular, argue that morality is mostly
biologically determined. What is happening

00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:03.880
in these arguments is that they are
talking about two different things. We

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:11.220
have this two...these distinctions that I
am pointing out here. "The capacity for

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:20.550
ethics." That is why we judge some actions
as being moral and not always. This

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:25.960
capacity which is very different from the
Codes of Ethics, the "norms by which we

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:31.110
judge a particular action." This actually,
in terms of the classical ideas about

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:36.770
ethics, the capacity for ethics has much
more to do with metaethics. And then,

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:43.690
codes of ethics have much more to do with
normative ethics. If we distinguish these

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:50.240
two, the conclusion that I will grow is a
capacity for ethics is biologically

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.830
determined, but the norms of ethics, the
codes of ethics are the result of culture.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.750
So, again, the argument between
philosophers and scientists, they're

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.960
talking about two different things, each
one of them is right about their own

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:11.990
things, their own ideas. So, to clarify
what I mean by this distinction alone,

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:18.000
imagine it's clear enough. Capacity for
ethics. We think about language is like

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.800
the capacity for symbolic verbal
communication. Then we have the Codes of

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.740
Ethics which relate more like to the
particular languages. It is clear that the

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:34.290
capacity for symbolic communication is
different from the language that we speak.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:39.620
And we will say, this is biologically
determined, this is not. And there's the

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.160
argument that I need to make, the capacity
for ethics is biologically determined. The

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:54.170
Codes of Ethics are not. For there being
ethical behavior, we have to have a list.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:33:05.840
We have to have these three abilities
joinly are necessary conditions for the

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:11.110
argument ethical behavior. The ability to
anticipate the consequences of one's

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:16.270
actions. Ability to make value judgments.
And the ability to choose between

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:22.250
alternative courses of action. We need the
ability to anticipate the consequences of

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:28.530
one's actions for there being morality.
Pulling the trigger, in a sense, is not a

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:34.430
moral action. Pulling the trigger is
immoral action, if I anticipate that by

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:39.590
pulling the trigger, I'm going to shoot
the bullet that is going to kill my enemy.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:44.450
So in terms of the consequences of the
actions and because we are able to

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.930
anticipate the consequences of our
actions, that this is one of the

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:53.750
requirements for there being morality, as
I have pointed out as one of the

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:59.570
attributes related as distinctive feature
of the ability to anticipate realities

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:09.180
that are not present. And where does the
capacity come from? From our more advanced

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:15.210
intelligence. I already made the argument
that it is as a consequence of bipedal

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:21.400
gait that we eventually lead into
tool-making, which led to an enlarge brain

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.860
because people who are making tools are
being more successful than the ones who

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.780
are making, more able to make tools is
because they were smarter. So, you have

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:39.420
this feedback loop. Then we have the
ability to make value judgments. Value

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:46.960
judgments is when we consider one thing as
better than other. Value judgments exist

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.140
not only in morality, you know good versus
evil, of virtue versus sin. But we value

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.470
judgment with respect to many other
aspects of reality. You have economic

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:02.790
value judgments, artistic value judgments,
gastronomic, you know you prefer pears

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:07.380
rather than apples. So, we are making
value judgments all the time. And again,

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:14.540
that is related to our ability to form
categories, to see individual behaviors,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:20.970
individual realities as member of general
classes. The second attribute that I was

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:26.520
listing among the attributes of human
intelligence in one earlier slide. And

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:35.600
then, the third, ability that we made to,
for there being morality is free will. If

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.190
I don't have the possibility of not
pulling the trigger, that pulling the

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:45.110
trigger will not be a moral action. The
digestion of food or the circulation of

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:51.630
the blood that's not a moral actions. We
cannot control it. Only, if I have control

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:56.740
over an action can I judge this action as
being either good or evil. I can then make

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:06.000
a value judgment. So, those are the
capacity for ethics. I have stated that it

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.450
is, we have capacity for ethics because we
have these three fundamental abilities.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:17.800
Now, about the codes of ethics, norms by
which we judge a particular action. And

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.530
again, I'm going to remind you of the
distinction between these two

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:28.500
characteristics by comparing them with
language, where the distinction is very

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:36.750
obvious. So, the codes of ethics, they are
the result of cultural evolution. Now,

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:44.110
first we have in culture, what we call
culture, at least two dimensions. One is

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:51.150
individual actions, individual realities.
Like ideas, skills, habits, values,

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:56.730
beliefs. And then, we have culture as an
important set of components which are

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:05.390
social: inventions, technology, languages,
humanities, moral codes. So we have these

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:13.360
two sets of a characteristics. Cultural
evolution is made possible by a large

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:21.480
brain and is mediated by language. I think
those two things are very obvious. But we

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:29.950
will be delivering them a little more. So,
there is cultural evolution. It's not that

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:36.050
there is culture. As a culture evolves and
evolves following very similar to

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:42.820
biological evolution that the requirements
are the same. There has to be heredity,

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.900
they have to be transmitted from one
individual to another. There was to be

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.400
variation so there can be selection of one
way or another in the process of

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.180
evolution. And then there has to be
differential reproduction, natural

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.530
selection in biology, that these...some
traits, some behaviors may be transmitted

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:11.780
more effectively than others. Now, there
is heredity with respect to culture, but

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:16.520
it's a kind of heredity that's very
similar, very different from biological

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.770
heredity. Biological heredity has, what I
call here, vertical transmission. That is,

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:28.030
from parents to children. Cultural
heredity goes horizontal as well as

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:36.460
vertical. We can transmit our convictions,
our values, our ideas to people of our

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.460
generation, early generations, later
generations, whether they are related with

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:47.650
us or not. Again, biological evolution can
only be transmitted from parents to

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:52.820
children. We can transmit them to the
whole of the environment. There is another

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.930
very important difference which I am
setting it up here by calling biological

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:04.120
heredity, Mendelian, cultural heredity,
Lamarckian. Biological heredity is

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:10.680
Mendelian. Mendel is the first one who
discovered the existence of, what we now

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.680
we call genes and how they were
transmitted from parents to children. And,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.100
biological heredity can only be
transmitted from parents to children.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:29.560
Lamarck famously in the year in which
Darwin was born, had published in 1809 a

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.630
book in which he had presented
evolutionary ideas. He had very

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:40.030
distinctive ideas about heredity,
was...came to be called Lamarckian

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:45.380
heredity. That you don't only transmit the
genes that you have inherited from your

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.820
parents, when you have a recent mutation.
But you can transmit also the attributes

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.940
the that you acquire. When you go to the
gym and develop big muscles, your children

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:03.390
will be born with big muscles. Well, we
know that that's not true with respect to

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:07.970
biological heredity. But it is with
respect to cultural heredity. What we

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:15.710
transmit to other members of society of
our culture, are not only the ideas that

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:21.280
we got from our parents, but also ideas
and values that we may have gotten from

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.560
the whole human environment. So, in that
sense, what we learn through our life can

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:34.150
be transmitted, so it's Lamarckian
heredity. Many different characteristics

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:40.260
because these two of the fact that it is
Lamarckian. The acquired traits can be

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.930
transmitted and that it is transmitted
horizontal, meaning that culture is

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:52.110
transmitted much more efficiently without
comparison than biological heredity. Then,

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:56.080
there's variation. Remember for there to
be evolution, we have to have heredity, we

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.280
have to have variation, we have to have
differential reproduction. And it is clear

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:05.930
that there is variation with respect that
the ideas or values among individuals and

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:15.310
there's obviously variation among culture,
among tribes, nations. When we think about

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:21.530
a group as homogenous as a group that we
have here, we will surely find variation

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:27.970
with respect to certain moral values. I
mean, some people, some of you may be

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:33.680
definitely against abortion no matter
what, and others may say, "Well, to save

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:40.940
the life of the mother, maybe abortion is
morally acceptable." And so with other

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.190
things less significant. Obviously,
there's lots of variation among

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:51.750
individuals. And much more so among
groups, this will be very obvious now.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:59.370
These days when we are experimenting the
tragedies along international boundaries,

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:07.780
battles have been happening all through
history. And I variation not only exists

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:15.190
between groups at any given time, but also
among groups. For example, look at the

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:25.070
behavior of the crusaders, the Crusades in
the 12th, 13th centuries. The way in which

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.870
people were behaving in the name of
Christianity, in the name of God, we will

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:34.660
find that terribly shocking and of course
it will be terribly unacceptable to us.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:40.940
So, we have heredity. We have variation.
And of course, we have natural selection

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:48.590
because some variants are transmitted more
efficiently than others among individuals

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:55.380
or among groups. And I have a list of
things that are differentially transmitted

00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:04.180
with ideas, skills, values, languages,
ethical codes, religious beliefs. As I was

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:10.080
walking here, I was walking with somebody
who was surprised that in the Basque

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:16.190
country where my parents come from, which
is a population that, about one million

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:21.480
and a half people in Spain and a little
less than a million in the French part. So

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:29.040
there are several provinces in each. That
there are seven very different dialects,

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.580
which one might consider a different
language. Well, if you go to New Guinea,

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.860
you find hundreds and hundreds of
different languages. Or you go to the

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:45.340
Maya, there are hundreds and hundreds of
different languages. Each small tribe has

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:52.100
a different language. So, there are lots
of variation. And of course there is

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:58.500
variation in ethical codes and in
religious beliefs. How do we have cultural

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:07.880
selection, differential reproduction?
Well, it is clear, again, that some ideas

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:14.010
are transmitted more effectively than
others. With respect to religion, I point

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:19.790
out here, this particular event in the
history of Christianity. As you know, the

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:26.020
early Christians, many of them have come
from Israel to Rome which was the Roman

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:33.980
Empire, which represented most of the West
at the time, they were being persecuted

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:40.870
until the year 325, when Emperor
Constantine becomes a Christian, becomes

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:48.420
converted and declares Christianity the
religion of the Roman Empire. So suddenly

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:54.770
most of the Western world, over night, so
to speak, becomes Christian. There's

00:44:54.770 --> 00:45:02.550
cultural selection at an extreme. And of
course, there are also another way in

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:09.310
which cultural selection occurs which is
assimilation among tribes. It occurs among

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:18.480
the Maya, occurs in New Guinea among the
different tribes. Now, cultural evolution

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:25.190
has distinctive features with respect to
biological evolution which I list here

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:32.580
some of the most significant ones. First
of all it's more rapid, potentially can be

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:39.200
transmitted in a new invention, in a new
mutation a cultural mutation, can be

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.580
transmitted to all of mankind in one
generation. The iPhones that we were

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:51.500
turning off earlier. Sometimes my
undergraduate students take my iPhone, I

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.920
don't have it now because they asked me to
remove it so it won't ring while I'm

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:01.178
lecturing. So I tell them, "What kind of
iPhone do you think your parents were

00:46:01.178 --> 00:46:05.570
using?" They all look at me surprised,
they start to look at each other and they

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:09.810
say, "They were not using iPhones." Well,
there's the point. Here, you have

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:15.140
something that, it's so many parts of
mankind, the majority of people have them.

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.190
But, anyway certainly in our world. And
yet, one generation ago, they didn't

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:25.070
exist. Nothing biologically, no matter how
beneficial, can be transmitted so

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:32.560
effectively. Very importantly, mutations
of these inventions and discoveries are

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:38.200
directed. Biological mutations, it depends
that they occur when they may occur

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:44.110
accidentally. And usually, they occur only
rarely and only very few of them are

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:49.580
beneficial. The majority are harmful
because we invent and discover things that

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:57.230
we think are beneficial to us. And
finally, there is group selection. Group

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:05.200
selection is when something benefits no
particular individual for the group to who

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:13.440
it belongs. Group selection, strictly
speaking, cannot take place in animals for

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:22.920
the following simple argument. Assume that
you have two groups. One has a mutation, a

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:29.170
change, this time I'm talking
biologically, that benefits all the

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:36.380
people, all the individuals in the group.
Normally, this altruistic behavior, the

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:40.650
person who wants to act in a way to
benefit others, that of course involves a

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:48.580
cost, at least a cost of carrying out
those actions. If you have that in a

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:57.950
population, the beneficial mutation is not
going to prosper because the person who is

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:04.110
behaving altruistically benefits all the
others, but at a cost to himself or

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:09.150
herself. So he will be selected against.
That's not so with humans because we

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:15.530
understand that we have something that is
beneficial for the group that we all are

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:21.800
going to benefit including I, myself as a
member of the group. So, groups that have

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:27.820
beneficial mutations, cultural mutations,
tend to be more prosperous than groups

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.760
that don't. So you have group is another
selection, another mode of selection that

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:41.740
exists with respect to culture. The final
stigmas that I want to weigh is... Very

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:47.230
importantly, for the last few millennia,
humans have adapted, more often, by

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:51.130
fitting the environments to their genes
than by fitting their genes to the

00:48:51.130 --> 00:49:01.770
environments. What I mean by that, we came
from Africa, our ancestors came to, say

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:08.800
what is Europe or America for that matter,
probably no more than about 100,000 years

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:16.630
ago. Now, the colonizers of Europe, were
tropical animals adapted to the tropics to

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:24.420
an optimum temperature of about 25
Celsius. And yet, 100,000 years is not a

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:30.550
lot of time for biological evolution. It's
perhaps 4,000 generations or so for

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:38.780
humans. And yet, humans have colonized
Antarctica and Siberia and other parts

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:44.640
where the temperature is much colder. They
are able to, humans have been able to

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:52.420
colonize Siberia and, I don't mean
Antarctica, I mean actually the Arctic

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:59.990
region, Greenland and others. So humans
have been able to colonize Siberia or

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:07.530
Scandinavia not by changing their genes so
that they can live at colder climates,

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:13.660
colder temperatures, but rather by
clothing and housing. So, we are modifying

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:20.700
the environment according to the needs of
our genes. The people who live in Alaska

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:26.940
and in Siberia and in Scandinavia are as
adapted to a climate

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:35.540
temperature...tropical temperature as we
are. But they modified their environments

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:41.220
so as to adapt their environments to the
needs of their genes. You know, we travel

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:48.560
through rivers and oceans more
effectively, much more effectively than

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:58.610
any fish, not because we have gills or
fins, but because we use boats and we fly

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:03.100
much more effectively than any bird. We
don't have wings, but we build flying

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:09.580
machines. So, for the last few millennia,
and for the foreseeable future, human

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:16.260
evolution is going to be mostly cultural
precisely because it happens so much

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:23.890
faster. And of course, this is one of the
reasons why we may expect that morality

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:31.840
also will be...and ethical values will be
evolving over time. We can also already

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:39.140
see that happening. There are behaviors, I
will mention only one and I hope I don't

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:44.270
offend anybody. You know, when I was
growing up in Spain, we went to the

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:49.760
movies, the Hollywood movies, and there
everybody was smoking, including women

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:56.210
were smoking and then women in Spain
started to smoke. That was considered a

00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:04.070
nice thing to do. Today, most of us
disapprove of smoking as a dreadful thing.

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:12.960
In fact, it makes me think that for the
last year, we have had over 300 people

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:23.260
killed in these mass atrocities. That's
only one per day. About 10,000 per day die

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:29.670
from smoking. So, no wonder many of us
consider smoking not acceptable, morally.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:34.240
I'm using this, by way of example. I think
it's very obvious the moral values are

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:42.790
evolving and will continue to evolve. So,
again, the conclusions that I have been

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:47.960
drawing, I have been elaborating is that
capacity for ethics is a result of

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.080
biological evolution. The codes of ethics
are the result of cultural evolution. And

00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:00.050
very briefly, as I said that I was going
to do, two quotations from Darwin, because

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:05.180
the way I read Darwin, he was not always
fully consistent and not necessarily

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:12.900
elaborated his points as much as he could
have. But his position was very much one

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:19.420
that I have been advancing here. Here you
have this quotation from The Descent of

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:29.430
Man: "An animal that will eventually
advance socially in its instincts could

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:35.980
inevitably acquire moral sense or
conscience, as soon as its intellectual

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:42.280
powers had become as well, or nearly as
well developed, as in man." He's saying,

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.870
you have intelligence, the kind as we do,
advanced intelligence, you will have

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:52.090
morality. So, this is biologically
determined. But, he's saying that that

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:56.720
doesn't mean there'll be the same moral
values as we do. This animal who will

00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.820
become very intelligent will have
morality, but the values will be,

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:08.380
probably, different. So again, values,
determined by culture. This is the book

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:15.530
where I elaborate these ideas, published
in 2007 and I'm proud to tell that

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:21.020
tomorrow I plan to mail to the publisher,
Oxford University Press, the second

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.351
edition of this book. Thank you very much.

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:36.480
- Thank you very much, Francisco. We have
time for some questions.

00:54:37.325 --> 00:54:41.830
- [Man 1] I'm sorry. Some people talk
about an arc of moral progress and the

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:47.030
implication is that ethics revolving,
there are things today that we look back

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:50.380
on with shame and horror. Like it took
thousands of years before people figured

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.700
out that slavery was a bad thing. And for
a long time, nobody thought it was a bad

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:58.710
thing. And now everybody thinks it's a bad
thing. And there are people in this

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:02.550
audience that, they dissect animals and
crush their spinal cords and I think in 50

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.300
years we're going to look back and say,
"That's a bad thing." Do you believe that

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:10.560
there is an arc of moral progress that
evolution is driving us towards a

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.090
consensus about what's right and what's
wrong? Or is it just going to be

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:16.230
universally variable, depending on your
culture?

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:21.870
- I think, since I'm an optimist, that
there is progress, evolutionary progress

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:26.710
that is going to wake with respect to
culture. With respect to biology,

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:32.440
biological evolution is so slow. That's
not something that we will see in our

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.520
lifetime and the lifetime of our
grandchildren or the grandchildren of our

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:44.910
grandchildren, over thousands of years.
You know, after all, evolving on different

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:50.500
climates for the last, at least 100,000
years. And yet, we have virtually not

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:56.490
changed. We have changed in some features,
color of the skin, configuration of the

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:01.270
body, which are very directly responding
to the resonance of light and to other

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:06.000
features of the environment. But,
culturally, yes, we are going to continue

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:12.420
evolving, with less progress or not is
going to depend on your point of view. I

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:20.280
think that by and large, when we progress,
that I was saying and I will reiterate

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:27.140
now, I think we are becoming morally more
subtle, if you wish, more sophisticated,

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:29.550
more demanding.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:35.120
- [David] Francisco, David Bren. Thank
you. Excellent talk. I was wondering,

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:41.100
though, if you think that, the thing that
causes so many species to overshoot in

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:47.470
some trait or another trait and you showed
Descent of Man, Darwin said was sexual

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:54.460
selection. And often it's visible in an
exaggerated physical trait. And I was

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.680
wondering if you think that sexual
selection may have been responsible for

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:05.120
some of the overshoot, intellectual
capacity overshoot, in humanity. And I'd

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:10.010
like to site one physical exaggeration
that's almost never mentioned, and have

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:15.290
you comment on it. And that is the fact
that usually it's the male that shows some

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:23.760
exaggerated trait, and therefore we
suspect sexual selection. But in humans,

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.790
blatantly, the gender that has been
sexually selected for physical attributes

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:35.690
that make it more different than apes,
that make that gender seem more different

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:41.380
than the basic ape plan is clearly the
females. They are less ape-like than we

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:47.620
are, than we males. And I don't think that
I'm going to be hit by any of the women

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.490
here for saying that.

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:50.840
- No, they are certainly smarter than we
are.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:59.580
- But it suggests that we've been
subjected to sexual evolution.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:06.170
- Well, there's no question that there is
sexual selection, as you have pointed out,

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:12.790
in humans. And there are people who think
that sexual selection may have played a

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:21.250
major role in evolution of ethics. I do
not see it that way. I see the evolution

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:25.880
of morality in a different way, both with
respect to the capacity, as well as with

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:31.900
respect to the norms because they
contribute. There is sexual selection, but

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:38.980
I don't see it as a driving force in the
case of morality. But some people disagree

00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.802
with me.
