00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
&gt;&gt; What's interesting about reporters and
the press and all is, if you're on the other

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.599
side of it is, people spend an awful lot of
time criticizing writers for how quickly they

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.150
write, how little due diligence they do, and
how if you will random some of their coverage

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.750
and so forth.
And you hear this over and over again.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.289
There is at least one exception to that.
And probably the person who is the most disciplined

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.410
and the most detailed reporter of current
culture, current facts, and current companies

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.510
that I have ever met.
His name is Ken Auletta.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.160
Ken, of course, is the author of about about
11 books, somebody who we have known well

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.510
over the years, someone who I've known in
some of my previous roles as well.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.100
In the technology community, has been covering
the technology for almost as long as it's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.310
existed, along with the media industry, which
is another one of his great interests.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.110
And Ken is one of those people who goes to
the events and then talks to the people back

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.050
behind the event and try and figure out what's
happening.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.369
He became interested in the question of the
media, which is sort of a fundamental question

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.770
of our time.
And when he told me that he was going to work

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.549
on this, I figured he would work on a book
about what is generally known as "old media."

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.590
But in fact, what he decided to do is to use
Google as, if you will, a story or a metaphor

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.530
for the changes that are occurring.
And I figured, "Well, we'll see a good book

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.240
out of that."
But what is particularly interesting about

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.200
Ken is the level of detail and the level of
discipline and the level of reporting that

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.270
has gone into his coverage of the set of seminal
events, all of which we have lived through.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.600
From a Google perspective, this is one of
the most accurate chronicals of the journey

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.399
that we have been a part of.
And I'm sure that the other companies that

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.130
he's covered in his book, and so forth, had
the same level of precision reporting and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.729
fact-based analysis that Google, I think,
stands for.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.130
It is a great privilege for me to introduce
Ken Auletta to talk about his book, "Googled:

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.509
The end of the world as we know it." Ken.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.440
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.330
Ken Auletta: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thank you. And thanks, Eric.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.470
He forgot to mention my Nobel Peace Prize,
but what the hell, you know?

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.190
I have regards from Microsoft where I was
two days ago.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.950
I was speaking to an audience like this, and
they speak very fondly of all you folks. [laughter]

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.300
And I should tell you -- there's a story I
tell at the beginning, I think, of Chapter

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.080
Two of an interview that I did with Bill Gates
in 1998.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.470
And I said, "Mr. Gates," I said, "When you
think about the future, what do you worry

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.890
about? What's your nightmare?"
And I expected he would say, "Netscape."

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.770
He was about to go on trial for violating
the antitrust laws, which he was found guilty

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.890
twice of doing.
I thought he would say, "Oracle, Sun, Apple."

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.000
He didn't say that.
He thoughtfully rocked back and forth gently,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.310
and he said, "I'll tell you what I worry about,
Ken."

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.550
He said, "I worry about someone in a garage,
who is inventing some new technology that

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.700
I've never thought about.
And that's my nightmare that that's going

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.561
to challenge Microsoft."
Well, in 1998, we know who was in a garage

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:40.090
 -- Worldwide Google Headquarters written
out front in hand letters.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.160
And they have become -- as I again confirmed
on my trip on Monday -- their worst nightmare.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.650
And I decided that -- as Eric alluded to -- that
I wanted to write about a company that was

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.880
really riding the top and helping create the
digital wave.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.460
And that wave was crashing into a lot of traditional
businesses that I had spent a fair amount

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.631
of time reporting on for the New Yorker and
a book.

00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:15.220
I had actually done a book in 1991 called,
"Three Blind Mice," which is a book about

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.349
how the television networks missed the technological
threat that was facing them, which was cable

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.960
 -- which had two revenue streams and which
could do things that the broadcast networks

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.870
couldn't do, and which were dependent totally
on, as you know, advertising.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.620
And they made some of the same mistakes that
I found the media in this century made in

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.849
ignoring -- and being complacent about and
not treating with alarm -- the digital revolution

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.620
that you people represent.
So I came here really to try and understand,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.960
Who is this company Google?
How did it come to be? What's different about

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.599
its culture?
What's unusual about Google? Why is it innovative?

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.569
Is there a secret sauce?
And I also decided that, part of the narrative

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.539
would be -- I didn't know what the answer
was, but I knew that I wanted to write a narrative

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:18.770
that told your story, but in the context also
of how you begin to change from just a search

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.379
company to -- what you came to call yourself,
which is -- a media company, and how gradually,

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:33.979
you started to bump into -- be it book publishing,
or newspapers or advertising or telephone

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:44.469
companies, or television companies, or Microsoft.
And how most of these other industries really

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.039
ignored you.
In fact, I begin the book with the story of

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.340
a visit that Mel Carmason, who was then running
Viacom, which was the second largest media

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.370
company in the world -- CBS, MTV, Simon &amp; Schuster,
etc.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.199
And how we came here and he met with Eric
and he met with Larry and Sergey.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.289
And he thought maybe he'd do some kind of
a deal, maybe even acquire you guys or something

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.120
like that.
This is before you're public.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.340
He had no idea what kind of revenues or growth
potentials you had.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.539
And so, he explained his business at one point
 -- as Eric described to me -- he tried to

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:25.440
sell a Superbowl ad to Google, which was going
for $2 million for a 30-second spot at the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.680
time. It's now 3 million, but the way.
And of course, Eric and Larry and Sergey were

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.699
appalled at the idea of spending that kind
of money.

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:38.129
And you had no idea -- no one's clicking -- you
don't know, you know, who is watching the

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.099
ad, who is buying your product.
And it seemed like a very inefficient system.

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:49.069
But they let Mel Carmason speak, and then
they described the Google business.

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.009
How you actually -- there wasn't waste.
You could tell who was clicking, you know,

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:59.150
who was buying, and was much more intelligent.
And then Carmason said, "Wait a second. That's

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.469
very -- we don't want that kind of efficiency.
We want to get people all caught up in the

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:09.289
sizzle of buying TV ads and that's what really
matters.

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.719
We don't want the advertisers to know what
they're getting,"

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:17.120
And, of course, Eric and the Google people
were appalled by that.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.710
And Carmason, at the end of the 3-hour visit,
leaned over in his cufflinks gleaming, and

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.539
he said -- pardon the language, but actually
I can't use that.

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:34.729
C-Span is here. So I'll be polite -- he said,
"You guys are messing" -- he didn't use the

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:41.249
word 'messing' -- "with the magic."
And, of course, at the T.G.I.F. that Friday,

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:45.099
Larry and Sergey and Eric tell the story,
"We had an interesting visitor this week."

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.719
And "You know what he said to us? 'You're
messing with the magic.'"

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:54.639
And of course, that's what you do here.
And so, among the things I learned on my visit

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:59.699
is what engineers do.
And if you start from the assumption -- as

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:04.539
the three guys who run this company start
from -- that the old ways of doing things

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:09.279
are often inefficient, and you could achieve
greater efficiency.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:13.309
And if you think about the business I'm in
 -- the printing business -- totally inefficient.

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:19.439
The idea that you're killing trees, expensive
paper, expensive printing presses, and expensive

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:25.599
distribution vs. doing it online in multimedia,
if you want me to say, that's a pretty inefficient

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:28.520
system.
So the engineer comes in and says, "Why?"

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.680
Why does it have to be that way?
Why can't we sell ads and know who we're selling

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.709
to and who's actually buying and charging
based on clicks rather than you think they

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:44.529
have an impression that you've made on them?
And why can't you digitize all the books ever

00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:47.380
made?
And why can't you have Google news and aggregate

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:54.120
25,000 news sources from around the world?
Etc. etc. etc.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.680
And, of course, as you do that, you start
bumping into traditional media companies and

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.920
they get very upset.
And the truth be told, you were very late

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.220
to understand, as a company, that you're upsetting
these people.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:15.550
You were pushing the envelope of say, copyright.
You were pushing the issue of fair use and

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.060
you wanted to be able to do a search -- and
a search is wonderful.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.120
I love the idea that the -- now eleven -- books
I've written could be searched, and people

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.519
can have access to maybe a book that didn't
sell so well of mine -- can be brought back

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.560
alive because of Google.
That's terrific.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.070
On the other hand, I'd like to be consulted
as an author before someone puts my book online

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.620
and makes it available.
And at one point, I tell the story in my book

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.810
of my second interview with Sergey, and he
comes in the room and he says to me, "Ken,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:51.310
let me ask you a question."
He said, "Why don't you just publish your

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.871
book for free online?
Just put it out there. Many more people will

00:09:55.871 --> 00:09:58.529
read it."
I said, "Well, that may be true that many

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:01.790
more people would read it, Sergey.
But let me ask you a question."

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.800
I said, "Who's going to pay me to write this
book?"

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.310
I'm now on a leave from the New Yorker to
do a book.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.050
So I mean, I need to earn a living, right?
"And, who's going to pay for my trips out

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.510
here?" I made many trips out here.
"And who's going to pay my airfare and the

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.510
hotel?
And who's going to edit my book?

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.529
And who's going to send me on a book tour
like I'm on now?

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:24.209
And who's going to index my book?" Sergey,
at that point, wants to change the subject,

00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:29.899
because the truth is, he was approaching it
like an engineer does -- or someone who doesn't

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:34.259
know the book publishing business.
But he was also approaching it, I would argue,

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:37.600
as someone who didn't have a full appreciation
of copyright.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:45.330
And an appreciation that you need the cooperation
of people who own the content in order to

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.410
share it.
I want to share my content, but I also want

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.199
to make sure that I can earn a living, because
that's how I make my living.

00:10:52.199 --> 00:10:58.569
And so, one of the reasons you got sued initially,
by the Publishers and Authors Guild, was exactly

00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:04.980
for this reason -- that Larry had this brilliant
idea starting in 2002 to digitize all the

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.970
books and, Wouldn't it be great?
And it would be great.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.399
And you got the permission of libraries, but
you didn't spend enough time -- as Google

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.699
executives admitted to me in the course of
reporting this book -- seeking permission

00:11:16.699 --> 00:11:22.449
from the people who own the copyright -- be
they publishers, or be they authors.

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:28.509
Obviously, you bump into, when you buy YouTube,
you bump into Viacom which decides -- and

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:33.030
I think they're trying to hold you up -- but
nevertheless, they sue you for a billion dollars,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.120
because they're saying, "You can't take John
Stuart off the air."

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.519
So I saw that, and I saw basically, I think
 -- in the course of the two-and-a-half years

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:52.050
I spent -- that you were brilliant engineers,
but you often are narrow in your approach

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.959
to the world.
And copyright is one issue.

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:57.500
I would argue you're sometimes narrow about
the privacy issue.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.509
And one reason you're getting static from
 -- not just the U.S. government, but -- governments,

00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:05.740
particularly in Europe, is on that privacy
issue.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:12.350
I know Eric is very sensitive to that.
But the truth is that there is a belief -- and

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.709
I encountered this and I report this in the
book -- is a belief that, if you look at -- I

00:12:16.709 --> 00:12:20.200
spent time on Facebook.
You say, "How can people be concerned about

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.240
privacy?" People put anything on Facebook,
right?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.490
So you kind of become convinced that privacy
is not a big issue.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.750
But it might be, because you collect a lot
of information about people -- not by name,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.160
unless it's, you know, some of your sites,
but mostly, you don't have their name.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.819
But you have a lot of information about them.
And people get concerned.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:48.490
So you now face -- I would argue that -- three
issues that you deal with that arouse the

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:54.959
concern of governments around the world.
One issue is concentration of power.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:13:00.019
And, to go back to Microsoft, when I was interviewing
Microsoft for the book I did when I covered

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:06.310
their trial, one of the things that was quite
astonishing was how out of touch they were.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:14.300
And Bill Gates almost pleadingly talked to
me about, How could you think that we are

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.770
not doing good?
How can my government think that Microsoft

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.810
is not doing good?
He thought, if 95 percent of the people were

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.459
using his operating system, it was like he
was building one track that worked for every

00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:33.560
railroad all over the world.
So he was a common source he was providing.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:42.459
He wasn't thinking that, in fact -- and it's
one of the distinctions I make between my

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:47.089
visit to planet Microsoft and my visit to
planet Google.

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:55.230
Microsoft were cold businessmen.
Gates and Baumer and company wanted to destroy

00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:00.230
Netscape.
I came away from my visit to your planet thinking

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:05.380
you're not cold businessmen.
You're cold engineers. [laughter]

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:11.879
And, but you're not -- you don't mean to harm
people -- but inevitably, as Larry Page said

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:15.069
to me at one point.
I said, "Is it true that you will sometimes

00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:20.009
bump into traditional media?"
And he said to me, without any glee -- if

00:14:20.009 --> 00:14:24.149
Bill Gates were answering the question, he
would have been gleeful in 1998.

00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:30.209
Larry said to me, "I wouldn't say sometimes.
I would say 'always' bump into."

00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:34.300
You're engineers, and you're figuring out
ways to do things more efficiently.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.000
The old media world tends to do it, oftentimes,
inefficiently.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.550
There are a lot of people doing that.
I learned something else.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.800
Let me finish the other point.
So, one is "concentration of power."

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.470
Americans don't like powerful companies, and
you are a powerful company today.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.301
And, not only a powerful company, but -- as
happened with Microsoft -- you've got a lot

00:14:54.301 --> 00:14:59.829
of industries that want to create competition
or lessen your power or use the government

00:14:59.829 --> 00:15:04.819
to attack and weaken Google.
And they have a lot of influence -- telephone

00:15:04.819 --> 00:15:08.319
companies do and advertisers do and television
companies -- in Washington.

00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:11.040
But not just here.
You're talking about Europe and you're talking

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.500
about China.
There you bump into authoritarian governments

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.529
who want searches that don't have anything
about tanks in Tiananmen Square.

00:15:19.529 --> 00:15:23.290
So you're dealing with that issue.
You're also dealing with the copyright issue,

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:28.410
which is something I argued you weren't particularly
sensitive to and that governments are concerned

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.060
about.
And you're dealing with the privacy issue.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:39.389
And that too, is an issue that different governments
deal with different ways.

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:44.040
So I would worry about that, if I were you,
more than I think you -- I think you're late

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:50.670
to understand that menace to you -- the government
menace to you -- as I think traditional media

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.829
was late to understand the digital menace
to them.

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:57.939
I learned something else.
I learned as I sat in the engineering meetings

00:15:57.939 --> 00:16:02.500
here that I was allowed to sit in.
And I probably understood half the words that

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.360
were spoken.
I mean, you could have been speaking Swahili.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.389
I didn't, literally, understand what was -- but
I had the luxury of time to ask people, "Tell

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:16.110
me what that word means." or something.
But I kept on thinking, as I'm sitting there,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:21.749
of Terry Simel at Yahoo in 2003 -- and I know
he wasn't an engineer.

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:27.769
Or John Sculley at Apple in the mid-, late
80's and the early 90's, and he wasn't an

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:31.860
engineer.
And is that why these two companies, for instance,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:38.040
fell behind in engineering, because the people
at the top -- unlike Eric and Larry and Sergey

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.029
 -- couldn't understand the language that
their engineers were speaking?

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:50.029
But, as I listened to the engineers in those
meetings, and as I listened to Larry and Sergey

00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:53.939
and Eric asking provocative questions of them
and saying, "But wait a second.

00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:58.990
I heard what you said, but that doesn't make
any sense because of x, y, z."

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:06.020
I kept on thinking that, in fact, the engineers
were the content creators at the company.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:12.049
You don't think of engineers as content creators,
but in fact, I came to think of many engineers

00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:16.689
at places like Google as the Martin Scorsese's
of this world.

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:20.360
The applications that you're creating become
content.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:26.640
And if I spend two hours doing Google search
or on Google maps or one of your other products

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.741
 -- if I spend two hours on that, I'm not
spending two hours on CBS or with a book.

00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:37.789
And if I spend time -- Facebook is content
 -- anything that occupies your attention,

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:42.490
I would argue, is content -- including how
content changes for the Internet.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.900
It's not the same; storytelling is not the
same, etc.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:53.419
So I learned that in my visit here.
I also learned, as I went from here back to

00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:59.520
the world of traditional media -- to book
publishers and television executives and movie

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.210
executives and music company and newspaper
and magazine and Microsoft and advertising

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:10.000
agency and telephone companies -- and I interviewed
those folks.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.430
I came to realize how retrograde they had
been.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:19.140
There are two types of people in the world,
I think -- particularly people who are dealing

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.179
with challenges.
There are people who lean back, and there

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:26.549
are people who lean forward.
The people who lean back are the people who

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:33.350
are protective, defensive, worrying about,
How do I preserve what I have?

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:38.700
The people who lean forward are proactive,
and they're people who say, "This is a challenge,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.049
and I'm going to seize the day.
I'm going to be an optimist. I'm not going

00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:46.090
to be a pessimist.
I'm going to forge forward. I'm not going

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.490
to whine.
I'm not going to complain, 'Oh, woe is me,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.470
Google is killing me. The Internet is harming
me.'"

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:58.460
And in fact, we hear more of that whining.
And it really makes me sad, because I actually

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:04.950
think that many people who are whining -- particularly
say, people with the New York Times are doing

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.900
God's work.
The blogosphere is never going to replace

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:15.100
the kind of reporting and expenses that the
New York Times invests in a place like Afghanistan

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.120
today.
Or that some newspapers -- most newspapers

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.740
are not very good newspapers I would argue,
but there are some that are wonderful newspapers.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:29.770
And sometimes spend two, three, four months
to investing an investigative report or covering

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.590
state and city capitols.
And in the digital world, you have a way of

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.860
proving who is reading or watching what.
And what editors in the digital world -- one

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.260
of the dangers -- and Larry Page and I talked
about this, and he's thought a lot about this

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.450
issue.
He said to me once, he says, "I worry that

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.480
people are going to -- editors are going to
see or publishers are going to see that people

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.890
are interested in Britney Spears, but they're
not interested in government news.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.710
And those papers will start covering what
is most popular with people."

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.800
And that worries him. It should worry him.
It worries him in terms of search. You need

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.799
good search information.
So he said to me -- as did Eric -- that, "We

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:11.151
really want to see if there's some way to
help the New York Times."

00:20:11.151 --> 00:20:15.779
And in fact, at one point, they acknowledged,
when I asked them this question, that they

00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:20.370
discussed internally the idea of buying the
New York Times -- at Google.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.919
They never talked to the New York Times about
it and they never did anything about it, because

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:28.860
in the end, they decided that you have to
be -- as a search engine -- you have to be

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.930
a neutral Switzerland.
You can't take sides.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:36.149
And you can't be perceived as favoring one
content over another.

00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:40.299
And in fact, one of the things that actually
enthralled me in the reporting of this book

00:20:40.299 --> 00:20:46.910
 -- and I look at my friend David Crane, who
I spent many hours with -- and most people

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:54.190
I interviewed here, I would ask, "Where did
these two founders of this company get the

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:59.390
clarity that they had?
How did they come, at 25 years old, to say,

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:04.860
'I'm going to have a simple home page.
I'm not going to allow Visa to spend $3 million

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:10.610
to have an ad on my home page.
And I'm not going to build what Yahoo and

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.450
AOL were doing, which was a portal.
I'm not going to try and trap people.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:19.080
They're going to do a search, and I'm going
to send them to this search destination that

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.500
they want.
And advertisers? I'm not going to milk them.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.799
I'm going to charge them an e-Vickrey Auction
and only a penny more than the second and

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:32.950
then the third highest bidder.'" right?
And how did they know that building trust

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.590
of the user was essential?
And if you think about -- if you have that

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.929
as your guidance, you automatically know you
can't buy the New York Times.

00:21:41.929 --> 00:21:46.610
Because, if you buy the New York Times, you
may be helping save a great institution, but

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.960
you're undermining the trust you need to function.
Just as I would argue that you should be worrying

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.679
 -- much more than I know you did, certainly
when I finished reporting this book this spring

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:04.270
 -- about governance.
And if you think about it -- as brilliant

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:09.320
as many of the engineers at Google are, as
brilliant as the founders are and Eric is

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:21.640
 -- there is a, like Bill Gates at Microsoft,
they are not necessarily the best people to

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:28.490
determine things that are not easily measurable.
That is to say, something like people's fears.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:35.310
If people fear Microsoft, as they did, or
they fear Google -- as many do, and certainly

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:42.720
other companies do -- that's a fear that can
build and infect and go to Washington, go

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.970
to the European Union, go to other countries
that you're dealing with.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.910
And that's not something that -- as Sergey
said to me when I asked him about this -- he

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.679
said, "Look, we're not strong in the emotional
intelligence department."

00:22:56.679 --> 00:23:02.760
And that's true.
So where does that lead me?

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.890
What do I take away from this book?
I call this book, "Googled," because I think

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:15.760
Google has basically changed the world.
As Hal Varian said to me -- at one point he

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:24.059
said, your chief economist, he said to me
that, "The Internet made information available.

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:31.260
What Google did was make it accessible -- the
great navigation assistant for the universe."

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.880
And that changed the world -- changed my life
as a writer and reporter.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.080
I mean, I have a library at my fingertips,
and every day I thank the fact that I can

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.750
have a Google at my fingertips.
And the thought that I can have books, as

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:49.409
well as scholarly journals, available to me
too, it's just -- it's very efficient for

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:53.370
my time.
I'm like getting up and going to the New York

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.140
public library.
And I could work at night or early morning.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:02.809
And it's just fabulous, but the reason for
the subtitle of my book, "The end of the world

00:24:02.809 --> 00:24:09.340
as we know it." is that, the world -- the
traditional world with all those media institutions

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:14.549
I spoke about -- is forever changed. And that's
a profound change.

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:18.899
And some of that is wonderful. And some of
that is not so wonderful.

00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:24.970
And when I hear bloggers say what's important,
for instance, about journalism is just preserving

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.340
the journalist.
And you could have one individual do good

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.600
journalism that's enough.
And in fact, bloggers can do wonderful things

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.080
and one individual can do wonderful things.
I think of people like I.F. Stone, for instance,

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.320
doing great reporting.
But journalism -- really good journalism -- is

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:50.230
a team effort, just as Google is a team effort.
And you need editors, and you need -- in New

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:56.370
Yorker's case -- copy editors and fact checkers.
But when you do an investigative report or

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.940
I go out and do a piece for the New Yorker,
I have lots of people that are constantly

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.660
involved in my life.
And when I hand that piece in to them, they'll

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:11.179
say, "Hey, Ken you buried the lead, it's really
in Paragraph 20, not where you put it." Or,

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:15.179
"I think the story is a little off.
I think you really need more of the following."

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:20.309
I would go back and do a little more reporting.
That's the nature of the way journalism really

00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:23.870
works.
A team is essential for great journalism.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:29.049
That's the truth of the New York Times.
You can't replicate that unless you have the

00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:33.130
resources of some kind of institutional support
to do that.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:38.260
And if we lose that, we lose a lot in our
society, in our democracy, and the kind of

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:44.440
checks and balances and trying to keep governments
and powerful institutions honest.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:51.380
But I came away thinking -- to finish my remarks
and welcome any questions you may have -- I

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.600
came away thinking, "You're a really great
company."

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.830
And I mean that; I'm not saying that just
to placate an audience, and just to prove

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:10.559
it, you also are tremendously challenged.
And it seems to me, you face both external

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:16.070
threats and internal threats.
The external threats are the obvious competition

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:21.210
 -- Bing, other search engines, though Bing
has not done as well as certainly they expected

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.220
to.
And when I was reporting this book in May

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.720
of '08, I went to a Microsoft conference and
literally Microsoft executives were whispering

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.720
to me, "We have a game changer here.
We're going to announce something called 'cashback',

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:41.700
and it's going to change the world."
Has anyone heard of cashback since then? Nada.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.920
So you have to worry about Facebook and Twitter
and the form of vertical search that they

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.010
might do.
I mean, it would be a much more valuable search

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:54.980
for me to be able to consult -- if I want
to buy a camera -- 20 friends in Facebook

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:59.340
with Twitter, than getting 10,000 answers
from a Google search.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.799
I mean, I did a search -- I describe in the
book -- I said, "Who is the real William Shakespeare?"

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:08.850
I punch it into my Google search box.
And how many answers do you think I got?

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:16.580
Anyone have a guess?
How about if I said 5 million?

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:21.679
That's preposterous. That's totally inefficient.
It violates every rule you say you believe

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:25.179
in at Google.
And you couldn't give one answer to that,

00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:30.980
because it's a controversy whether William
Shakespeare actually did exist or was someone

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.630
else.
But 5 million guys? Uh-uh.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:39.570
So vertical search is a threat.
Government is an external threat to you. Governments,

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.450
I should say.
And you got to worry internally about your

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.842
size.
Can you move with the same speed as you always

00:27:46.842 --> 00:27:50.940
have, the loss of good people, and you got
to worry about hubris.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.270
And I saw this in Microsoft too.
And I know all the differences -- I think

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.610
I know at least some of the differences between
you and Microsoft.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:03.840
People are locked into their operating system.
You're one click away from escaping Google.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:09.350
I understand that.
But when you're that successful, as you've

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:15.970
been, and your life is really pretty -- I
mean, you're given lots of things from your

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:23.429
laptops to your food to your buses etc. -- it
is very easy to lose sight of the real world.

00:28:23.429 --> 00:28:29.100
And if you're an engineer and maybe living
in this tight community, you have the advantage

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:35.060
of being on the Internet, which Microsoft
avoided and didn't have, you know, that kind

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:42.140
of exposure that you have to other opinions.
You're at risk. And it's worth probably thinking

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:47.440
about.
In any case, in my visits to your planet -- and

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:55.419
I'm not coming back in any regular way, though
I'll miss the food.

00:28:55.419 --> 00:29:01.139
I learned a lot, and I thank you for that.
I mean, I had nothing but hospitable people

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:04.509
and wonderful interviews here.
Thank you. Welcome your questions.

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:07.390
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:16.240
Ken Auletta: And just raise your hand, I'll
call on you if you got any thoughts.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:30.019
If not, we'll -- [pause] yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. [pause] I wish I knew.

00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:38.690
I wish I knew how you save the New York Times.
I mean, I think newspapers are going to try

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.830
and create a payroll, and I address this issue
in my book.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.980
I think they have to try to figure out how
to get another stream of revenue, just as

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.500
you do.
I mean, I think the notion of being totally

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:53.059
dependent on one source of revenue -- advertising
 -- I'll tell you a story, for instance.

00:29:53.059 --> 00:30:01.040
Eric Schmidt -- in my 11th interview with
Eric last December, I said to him, "I just

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.809
left John Hennessy, the president of Stanford,
and he said he thinks the original mistake

00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:10.809
that was made with the Internet was not having
either micropayment or subscription -- not

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:15.920
just being reliant on advertising.
Do you agree with Hennessy, who is on your

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.070
board?" He said, "I do not. I think free is
the best model."

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:25.619
And my last interview with Eric, which was
April of this year -- so four months later

00:30:25.619 --> 00:30:28.269
 --
I said, "Eric, do you still agree with what

00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:33.950
you said to me in December?" And he said,
"I don't. I've changed my mind."

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.309
And if you think about -- Chris Anderson wrote
a book called, "Free."

00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:41.610
It came out, the editor wire came out in July.
He added a chapter at the end of that book,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:45.409
which is called, "Coda."
And essentially, what he says in that last

00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:49.389
chapter seems to contradict much of what he
said in the rest of the book.

00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:53.370
He said, "Free is not the answer."
And I think what happened -- the recession,

00:30:53.370 --> 00:31:01.570
which began in late 2007, really was a wake-up
call for Silicon Valley and people whose businesses

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:07.809
were digital or -- to realize, you were making
the same mistake the broadcast networks made.

00:31:07.809 --> 00:31:14.140
You were going back to the future and relied
on a source of revenue that was shrinking

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.049
 -- advertising.
And you had to figure out some way of getting

00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:19.559
another source.
The New York Times has to try and figure out

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:22.289
another source of revenue.
They've come to Google -- in fact my last

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:27.840
visit when I left Eric's office, I came downstairs
to the cafeteria in 43, and who was in the

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.690
cafeteria in 43?
Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the chairman and publisher

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:37.179
of the New York Times.
And he was going up to see Eric and the founders

00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:42.159
to try and -- Is there some way we can pump
more advertising dollars, some other -- obviously,

00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:45.860
they'd love Google to pay them a fee for the
content.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.730
So far, there hasn't been a good answer.
Some, but the danger is, if they create a

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:56.009
payroll, as they're going to, what if every
newspaper -- and every newspaper won't -- have

00:31:56.009 --> 00:31:59.100
a similar payroll?
So people will then get information from the

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.649
wire services.
Maybe they'll get it from the Christian Science

00:32:01.649 --> 00:32:06.330
Monitor, which is six days a week online,
or the Seattle Intelligentsia, which is only

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.350
an online publication.
So you skirt the payroll, and you reinforce

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.860
the notion that news is a commodity, which
is exactly what the papers are trying to combat.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.190
That's one problem.
The other problem is, How do you educate -- how

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:21.110
do you change the culture of the web, which
is a culture that basically says, "Information

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.799
should be free"?
Then you got the hacker question.

00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:30.090
People who will hack around your payroll.
So I read what Murdock said in Australia to

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:36.269
SKY TV that, you know, "We're going to stop
Google from searching."

00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:39.759
I think of that in two ways.
One is that Murdock doesn't even -- you know,

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:43.149
his e-mails are printed out so he can read
them.

00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:46.169
He's not -- seriously, by the way.
Two, he's negotiating.

00:32:46.169 --> 00:32:52.090
He's trying to put you guys on the defensive
and get you to pay something -- as others

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.899
have gotten you to pay them.
You're paying 125 million to the book publishing

00:32:55.899 --> 00:32:58.649
industry.
And in fact, Google is coming to realize,

00:32:58.649 --> 00:33:02.190
as you have with YouTube, that you need professional
content.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:07.289
The engineers at YouTube made a mistake.
They thought user-generated content would

00:33:07.289 --> 00:33:09.500
be the way.
It's great, all this traffic.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.269
The truth is, the advertiser doesn't want
their friendly ad next to some dog pooing,

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:16.620
you know?
So you have to have more professional content,

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.289
and you have to pay for it -- as you're starting
to, and you're starting to generate more income

00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:25.919
at YouTube because of it.
But I don't know -- I wish I had a good answer

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:28.800
for that question.
I wish New York Times had a good answer for

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.520
that question.
But, I would rather be the New York Times

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:38.029
than the St. Louis Post Dispatch, or the Detroit
News or, you know, San Diego Union -- a lot

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:42.250
of other newspapers.
Times has some advantages, but they have a

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:46.040
particular problem -- like a lot of papers
do -- they have a huge debtload, and the debts

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.600
are coming due, and they got to pay them,
and can they?

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:57.470
Q [inaudible]

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:06.720
Ken Auletta: Well, some of them are benign,
and some of them are less benign.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.600
But one of them is that -- if I come here
and ask any one of you -- if I put my pad

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:21.760
out, and I say, "How much does an engineer
make?" Or, "How many people from India?

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:28.329
How many Indian citizens or were born in India
or of Indian descent work at Google?"

00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:33.690
Or you ask any factual question -- I may as
well be talking to a CIA agent.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:39.839
I don't get an answer.
So the notion of transparency has its limits

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:43.399
at Google about that.
And some of that, I know, comes from Larry

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:50.090
Page, who all his life -- he read a book very
early in his life about Tesla, who arguably

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:55.669
invented electricity, but because he was very
generous and shared his secrets, wound up

00:34:55.669 --> 00:35:01.260
dying a very bitter and poor man.
And Thomas Edison got all the credit.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.599
And so, Larry Page talks about this.
He's talked not just to me, but he's talked

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:10.240
about that elsewhere.
The importance of keeping things secret.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.650
And there are secrets that are worth keeping.
You keep your black box for your algorithm

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.280
is the determined search is a secret for good
reason.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.109
You don't want people to game the system.
If they did, you would lose the kind of trust

00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:30.079
that's essential to your success.
The other contradictions are, there is a genuine

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:39.619
idealism here, and when the slogan, "Don't
be evil," was created by Paul Buchheit, that

00:35:39.619 --> 00:35:45.730
resonated on this campus, because you can
embrace that as being true -- as befitting,

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:50.560
you know, who you were -- your self-identity.
But then, in the real world, you make compromises,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.700
like you did in China, right?
And that, you know, that's a contradiction

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:02.319
 -- inevitable.
And here you are with all your idealism.

00:36:02.319 --> 00:36:07.660
You've hired some nice-priced lobbyists in
Washington -- contradiction.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.180
Those are just some of the contradictions.
But the truth is, that's the adult world,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.670
you know?
And the adult world is full of compromise

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:21.220
and contradiction.
And it doesn't mean it's evil, but it doesn't

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.440
mean it's good either.
And you think about it, "Don't be evil," is

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.960
really a slogan.
I mean, it may satisfy you and all that, but

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:36.850
I was at a T.G.I.F. meeting here, and someone
said -- Larry and Sergey were up on the stage

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.450
 -- and they said, "How could you close the
Phoenix office?" This was in the fall of '08.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:46.270
"It's evil." You know?
Well, to the people in the Phoenix office,

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.300
it may have seemed evil, you know?
I don't think it is.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.230
I mean, I think they're making a business
decision, but again, evil is often in the

00:36:52.230 --> 00:37:02.170
eye of the beholder.
So it's kind of self-righteous in a way.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:08.960
Yes, sir.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:15.750
Q [inaudible]

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:26.079
Ken Auletta: I think it's much more the changing
business than it's Google.

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:30.150
Google is really a surrogate for the Internet,
and music is a classic example.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:34.930
I mean, if you think about how the music companies
 -- I would argue -- committed suicide.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:39.360
They weren't murdered.
And the suicide is to have a business model

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.190
that says, "We are only going to sell CDs.
You have to buy all of the records in this

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:49.569
album, even if you don't like them."
And along in 2001 comes iTunes, and they say,

00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:51.839
"Hey, just for 99 cents you could buy any
song you want.

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:55.950
You could actually listen to a portion of
it before you decide to click and buy it."

00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:00.119
Where was the music company?
Why didn't they make a deal with the online

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:03.510
stuff that the people -- what do you call
it?

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.829
What was the company that they sued? Napster,
yeah.

00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:09.950
Why didn't they make a deal with Napster?
Why didn't they buy Napster, you know? And

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:13.630
do that?
Why did they resist? Why did newspapers, for

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.760
instance?
If you go back, newspapers can tell you honestly

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.910
that 15 years ago to a dozen years ago, they
had online editions.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:26.140
But if you go back to that point in time -- and
I was writing about this at that point in

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.881
time -- the online edition reported to the
newspaper editor not to -- they didn't have

00:38:31.881 --> 00:38:36.941
a separate online editor who was conversant
with the Internet and realized that the Internet

00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:41.300
was just not a print model.
It was a multimedia, and it was a different

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.710
medium than the newspaper.
Not only that, but you couldn't break a story

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.900
in your online edition until it appeared in
the next morning's newspaper.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.290
It's insane.
And by the way, Craigslist.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:58.619
I mean, the New York Times -- people approached
the New York Times and other newspapers with

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:03.200
the idea of a digital classified.
Newspapers used to get one-third of their

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:10.520
advertising revenue from classified advertising.
Before Craigslist was born, it was proposed

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:17.000
to the New York Times and others to create
a digital consortium to sell classified ads

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.400
online.
"Oh, no. We don't have to do that." Hello?

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:27.869
You know, so I don't -- again, this is the
'cold engineer' point I was making as opposed

00:39:27.869 --> 00:39:33.829
to 'cold businessmen'.
You didn't set out to disrupt and kill businesses.

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:38.240
You are disrupting though -- people.
Inevitably, the digital world disrupts them;

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.280
the Internet disrupts them.
And you either lean forward and figure out,

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.369
What the hell do you do about it?
And it would have been better if you thought

00:39:46.369 --> 00:40:10.809
about lean forward ten years ago than now.
Yes, sir.

00:40:10.809 --> 00:40:25.640
Q [inaudible]

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:43.500
Ken Auletta: So let me understand.
So you're saying that, if you pay $35 a month

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:49.620
for your broadband connection, that you consider
that paying for news?

00:40:49.620 --> 00:41:01.589
Q [inaudible]

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:27.910
Ken Auletta: Right. Well they can, but a basic
problem they face is that, you know, Google

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.109
is providing many more readers for the New
York Times or Washington Post through your

00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:35.710
Google search or Google news.
You only give a headline, basically, of what's

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:39.569
in the paper, and you have to click on the
New York Times link to take you to the New

00:41:39.569 --> 00:41:41.930
York Times.
And the New York Times then is allowed to

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:47.800
sell advertising off of that.
The basic problem is that the advertiser will

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:54.660
only pay about ten percent of what the advertiser
will pay for the same ad in the newspaper.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:42:00.339
So the revenue you generate online, even if
you had many more readers reading the New

00:42:00.339 --> 00:42:06.819
York Times -- because, if you add the online
edition, the income -- if they close the print

00:42:06.819 --> 00:42:11.530
edition and save all the money, not enough
revenue would come from the online to make

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.859
up for the lost subscribers and lost advertising
from the print edition.

00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:22.290
And that's a conundrum that newspapers face.
Now, it may be that some day that it won't

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.359
be ten percent.
It'll be 50 percent and the economics will

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:28.150
work.
But right now, the math doesn't work for newspapers.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:32.609
So they've got to figure out -- well, if they
can get money from the ISPs, great.

00:42:32.609 --> 00:42:35.300
But, you know, if they can get money from
you guys, great.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:40.930
If they can figure out some way to charge
micro-payments or subscription for online,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.870
great.
And if they can't, not so great. And it may

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:55.170
be they can't.
Yes, sir.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:43:01.670
Q [inaudible]

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:18.559
Ken Auletta: I did detect hubris on this campus.
And particularly, if you think about government,

00:43:18.559 --> 00:43:22.210
which I don't think this company was particularly
sensitive about.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:29.220
In part, because you are full of the idealism
and the kind of sense that, "We don't do evil.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:33.750
We're God's creatures.
We're advancing and we're doing wonderful

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.140
things."
And you do do wonderful things.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:41.700
But, you also are a giant powerful company,
which is bumping up against issues that really

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:45.800
matter to people like copyright and privacy
and power -- concentration of power.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.819
And people really -- advertisers are worried
you have too much power.

00:43:48.819 --> 00:43:52.050
Book publishers are worried that you're going
to be selling books against Amazon -- which

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:56.359
you are going to be doing, as you know -- and
that you'll have control over price point,

00:43:56.359 --> 00:43:59.760
just as they were about Wal-Mart and Amazon
having that kind of power.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:05.990
So people want competition, and there is a
certain hubris I think that infects -- it's

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:10.800
in the leadership of this place -- in the
belief that you're very close to the Obama

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.650
administration.
And you are.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:16.920
You have people like Eric, who's an advisor,
people like David Drummond, who's an early

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.859
supporter, people who've left Google to go
work in the administration.

00:44:20.859 --> 00:44:26.130
And I've literally heard -- I've been reporting
a piece on the Obama -- I'm at the New Yorker

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:30.720
now and reporting a piece, and I've literally
heard people saying, "God, you've got to go

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.120
down.
Anything we want we can get from the Obama

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.970
administration and the FCC in terms of open
net and all those other things."

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:45.510
I think what you miss -- what the hubris misses
in this case is that Democrats tend to be

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:51.150
pro-regulation -- the more so after what happened
on Wall Street and a sense that it was the

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:55.660
lack of regulation that led us to some of
the Wall Street and banking excesses.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:02.160
Well, there's the same concern that you need
more government intervention to prevent things,

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.250
A.
B, we've already heard the head of the Justice

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:10.520
Department's Antitrust Division -- Christine
Varney -- say that she is going to look very

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:15.390
closely at companies like Google, and about
their market power and market concentration

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.900
issues.
And I think you delude yourself if you think

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.290
that you're not in for some tough years ahead
because of your friend in the White House,

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:28.690
who made a wonderful presentation here in
2007.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:33.390
And I think, you know, you would be blind
if you don't realize that -- not to mention

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:39.089
all the other government bears that threaten
you all over the world, including totalitarian

00:45:39.089 --> 00:45:42.740
governments.
Yes.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:49.490
Q [inaudible]

00:45:49.490 --> 00:46:05.410
Ken Auletta: There's a great book I would
urge you to read by Clayton Christensen, and

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:10.440
it's called "The Innovator's Dilemma."
He's a Harvard Business School professor.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:16.460
And he makes the point, and he talks about
many companies in this book -- like Sears

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:25.280
and Roebuck -- that essentially had a great
business and they tried to protect that business,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:34.740
and they saw new technologies coming around
and the Wal-Marts and buying by catalogs etc.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:40.089
Or IBM, which says that, "We're in the hardware
business, and let's give our software.

00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:46.400
Let Microsoft do it."
And Microsoft -- '98 -- my story with Gates.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.140
I mean, they're protecting their package software
business.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.990
And suddenly the Internet's coming along and,
Do we invest in that?

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.540
And do we take money from our existing business
to do that?

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:05.450
That's the innovator's dilemma.
Do you sacrifice your existing business to

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:10.750
make a bet on what you think might be the
future, but might not be.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:16.030
It's a wonderful book with many, many vivid
examples of that innovator's dilemma.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:23.079
And you're going to face that here, you know?
I mean, one of the reasons that I was told

00:47:23.079 --> 00:47:29.260
that you did make a bid to buy Twitter last
spring was because you're worried about the

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:34.540
possibility of vertical search that we spoke
about before.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:39.599
And, you know -- that I don't think is a diverture
from your existing business and in fact, it

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:43.990
arguably enhances your existing business,
but you're going to have those issues.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.609
For instance, the issue of, Do you do more
content at YouTube?

00:47:47.609 --> 00:47:52.309
Do you have to own content and invest in content
in order to have the content that advertisers

00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:55.400
are going to want to buy?
And what does that -- does that, at some point,

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.609
undermine the trust that you need for your
success in search?

00:47:59.609 --> 00:48:05.780
Maybe. That could be an innovator's dilemma.
Yes.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.780
Thank you.

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:06.781
