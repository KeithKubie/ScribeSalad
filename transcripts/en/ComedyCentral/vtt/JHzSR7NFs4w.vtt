00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.200
This is it.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.820
Wow.
Casa Josh.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.030
Oh, this is so nice.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.470
You're nice to look at,
to not to look at,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.170
to,
I mean of course to look at.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.510
I have to stop talking,
stop talking, I'm sorry.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.610
You're nervous. It's okay.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.620
I'm a little nervous.
Have a seat.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.320
Okay.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.260
I'm just amazed you
were even on the app.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.350
Well, you know,
it's almost cuffing season,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.050
so a girl's gotta be in the
apps, foraging for winter.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.770
I guess, but you're
Alexandra Daddario.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.280
You're beautiful.
You're successful.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.500
How are you even single?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.250
Look, I mean dating
is hard, Josh.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.980
It doesn't matter who you are.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.320
Let's just relax.
We can have a good time.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110
Okay, how about some music?

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.890
I've got a really cool jazz
playlist I think you'd like.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.130
I love Jazz.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.360
Amazing.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.790
In fact, if you put Jazz on,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.440
I might have to slip into
something more comfortable.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.440
Okay, Jazz it is.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.820
I'll be right back.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.550
Okay, bye. See you soon.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.040
Come on, Josh.
Don't screw this up.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.690
Hey, did I ever mention
how I saw Baywatch

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.620
50 times in the theater?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.640
You didn't, but cool.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.810
I'm an idiot.
What's wrong with me?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.640
Oh, that's more like it.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.400
That's not what I was expecting.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460
Yeah, well my panda
one's in the wash so.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.510
Is this a furry thing?

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.210
So, what were we talking about.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.740
Oh yeah, dating,
it sucks so much.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.960
I'm so sick of all
the head games.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.710
Right, right.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.810
You know what, I poured some
wine, how about we toast?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.500
Oh, great. Oh, but fair warning,
a little wine makes me go crazy.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.460
Cheers.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.930
Cheers.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630
Whoa.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.690
So, the governments
run by lizard people right

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.380
and they're the same people
that are keeping Tupac

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.790
in the alien pyramids.
Oh, and Matthew McConaughey

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.390
is actually a robot
made of whiskey and plexiglass.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.760
I have proof,
do you want to see it?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.020
Here.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.250
See what?

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.730
Look.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.080
You brought that on our date.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.970
The answers are all here.
Open your eyes, Josh.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.360
Okay, I think we should
just call it a night maybe.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.110
This has been great,
but I, no.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.770
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.490
What?

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.190
I'm so sorry.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.130
I told you that wine
makes me go a little crazy.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.929
I didn't say
anything naughty did I?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.750
No, not naughty so much as
really factually irresponsible.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.370
Oh, can you forgive me, please?

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.640
Oh course.
Okay, great.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.890
Se la vie.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.400
Oh, my God, you speak French?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.690
Un peu.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.890
Okay, well if you speak
French though,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.380
I'm warning you
I might do things

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.840
I'm ashamed of, wild things.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.150
What are you doing?

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:15.960
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, not that.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.020
That's my favorite plant.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.870
What were we talking about?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.940
You know what? I think we should
call it a night, that's it.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.200
Oh my God, no, no, no, wait.
I scared you away.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.490
I was trying to be sexy,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.560
and I scared you away
by being too wild, I'm so sorry.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.850
No, that's not even it.
Actually I was kind of turned on

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.820
by you ripping
the apartment apart.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.040
Really?
Yeah.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.880
Well, then what's the problem?

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.630
I was thinking about it,
I can't be with someone

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.900
that thinks that the government
is run by lizard people.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.430
Everybody knows
the government is run

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.550
by the illuminati, obviously.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.950
The signs are there Alexandra,
everybody knows it.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.410
Vin Diesel told me.
Look, it's all right here.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.640
Don't you see.
Look at it.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.100
I've been working
on this for months.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.720
You are so ignorant.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.920
You'll know soon enough.
Everyone will know.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.700
Bye, Josh.
