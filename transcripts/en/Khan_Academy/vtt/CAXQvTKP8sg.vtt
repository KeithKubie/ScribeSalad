00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:01.788
- [Instructor] Let's
say we're a professor at

00:00:01.788 --> 00:00:03.999
a university of a statistics class

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.168
and we administer an exam

00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:08.462
and we're curious about the relationship

00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:11.899
between the amount of
time that students study

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.321
and the percent that they
get correct on the test.

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.853
So, what we do is we
grade all of the exams.

00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:19.322
We set up these buckets.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.286
The time studied, zero to 20 minutes,

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.698
21 to 40 minutes, 41 to 60 minutes,

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:25.909
or greater than 60 minutes.

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.490
So, those are our buckets for
the amount of time studying.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.642
And then, we also create
buckets for the percent correct.

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.444
So, zero to 19% correct,

00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:36.681
20 to 39% correct, 40 to 59% correct,

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:40.848
60 to 79% correct, or 80 to 100% correct.

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:43.887
And then, we figure out what percentage of

00:00:43.887 --> 00:00:45.687
our entire student population

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:47.942
falls into each of these categories.

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:52.109
So, for example, 2% of our
students studied 21 to 40 minutes

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:58.249
and got between 80 and 100% on the exam.

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.462
16% studied for more than an
hour, more than 60 minutes,

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:06.638
and got between 40 and 59% on the exam.

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:07.865
So, what I have, right over here,

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:09.499
this is a two-way table.

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.587
It's describing a joint distribution.

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:13.960
The joint distribution between...

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.250
You can view these as two variables.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.057
The time studied and the percent correct.

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:24.355
Now, what we're gonna introduce
ourselves to in this video

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:28.531
is two new ideas outside of
just the joint distribution.

00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.620
One is the idea of the
marginal distribution.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.584
I will write this in green.

00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:36.417
Marginal distribution.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:42.153
And this is the idea
of, "Okay, I can see...

00:01:42.153 --> 00:01:46.320
I can break down my class based
on both of these variables,

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:51.689
but what if I only care
about the distribution

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.697
of just the percent correct.

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.112
I don't wanna break it
down by time studied."

00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:57.748
Well, if I wanna figure out

00:01:57.748 --> 00:02:00.042
the distribution of percent correct,

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:02.911
I can just total up each of these rows

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:07.078
and I would end up with this
distribution right over here.

00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:12.001
And, just to make it clear,

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.168
I would see that 20% of my
students got 80 to 100% correct.

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:21.821
I would see that 30% of my students got

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:25.096
between 60 and 79% correct.

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:27.799
I see that 35% of my students

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.460
get between 40 and 59% correct.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.689
I think you see where this is going.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.479
10% of my students got
between 20 and 39% correct.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.605
And then, finally, 5% of my students

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:41.772
got between zero and 19% correct.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.370
All we did is we totaled
up each of these rows.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.618
And, notice, these now add up to 100.

00:02:48.618 --> 00:02:52.785
This describes the distribution
of the scores in my class.

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:56.885
If someone were to just
give you this column,

00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:00.523
you would say, "Okay, 20% of
my students got 80 to 100%."

00:03:00.523 --> 00:03:02.121
you don't know the breakdown by

00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:03.880
how much they actually studied.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.729
You would say 5% got between
zero and 19% on my test,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.285
but you wouldn't know what the breakdown

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:12.967
of that 5% based on how much they studied.

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:14.522
So, this type of distribution...

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:16.486
It's called a marginal distribution,

00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:19.353
because you can view it as
it's written in the margin

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:22.544
right over here that we total these rows

00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:24.266
and we write it in the margin.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:25.782
Now, there's another
marginal distribution.

00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:27.952
We could figure out the distribution

00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:31.594
of the amount of time
people studied in my class.

00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:34.010
And so, if we cared about that,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.940
that we would total up
each of these columns.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.615
We would total up each of the columns

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.989
and look at this right over here.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.322
We would say, "Okay, 7% of my class

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:46.901
studied between zero and 20 minutes.

00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:51.038
15% of my class studied
between 21 and 40 minutes.

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:54.313
43% of my class studied
between 41 and 60 minutes.

00:03:54.313 --> 00:03:57.095
35% of my class studied
more than 60 minutes.

00:03:57.095 --> 00:03:58.678
More than an hour."

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.926
And, if I just look at
this marginal distribution,

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:05.076
this marginal distribution
of the time studied,

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:08.060
I'm not able to get the
breakout of that 35%

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.944
that studied more than an hour.

00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:11.951
If I just looked at that
marginal distribution...

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.933
Once again, it's called that

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:14.201
because I'm writing in the margin,

00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.899
in this case, below our table.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.109
If I just looked at that
marginal distribution,

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.198
I would not know the breakdown

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.698
by the actual percent correct.

00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:26.276
Now, there's another type of distribution

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:28.691
that's related to these
joint distributions

00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:30.453
or you could say these two-way tables.

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:33.603
And that's thinking about the
distribution of one variable

00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:37.285
given what bucket you fall
in for the other variable.

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:39.002
So, let me write this down.

00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:43.169
So, if I wanna say the
distribution of scores given...

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:53.904
All right let me write it this way.

00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:57.821
Distribution of scores
among those who studied,

00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:06.392
let's say, more than 60 minutes.

00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:07.945
So, where would I get that?

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:08.778
Well, it's all right.

00:05:08.778 --> 00:05:10.116
I'll go to the column of the people

00:05:10.116 --> 00:05:11.558
who studied more than 60 minutes

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:14.042
and then I'd find this
distribution of scores.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.230
And I see it right over here.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.180
Among the folks who studied
more than 60 minutes,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.097
I have this distribution of scores.

00:05:22.553 --> 00:05:24.969
So, in that group, 10% got 80 to 100,

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.652
5% got 60 to 79, 16&amp; got 40 to 59,

00:05:28.652 --> 00:05:32.819
none of them, 0% got 20 to
39, and 4% got 0 to 19%.

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.992
And so, this distribution of one variable

00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:40.594
given a bucket that you're
falling into another variable.

00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:43.173
This is called a conditional distribution.

00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:45.303
'Cause you're getting a
distribution conditioned

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.595
on a value of another variable.

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:51.762
So, this right over here is
a conditional distribution.

00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:57.288
So, the big idea here, you
have this two-way table.

00:05:57.288 --> 00:05:59.865
We're trying to relate
how two variables...

00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:01.827
We're trying to study how two variables

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.506
relate to each other.

00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:05.062
If we care about just the distribution

00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:08.214
of one of the variables, for
example, the time studied,

00:06:08.214 --> 00:06:10.320
we can sum up the columns here

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.691
and we would get this
marginal distribution.

00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:15.144
If we cared about the
distribution of percent correct,

00:06:15.144 --> 00:06:17.723
we could sum up the rows
and get that distribution.

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:20.919
And, if we wanted, in the
case that I just talked about,

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.906
the distribution of one variable...

00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:25.298
The distribution of one variable,

00:06:25.298 --> 00:06:27.303
in this case, the distribution of scores,

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.061
the distribution of percent correct,

00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:31.430
given a certain value conditioned on

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.657
a value of another variable.

00:06:32.657 --> 00:06:35.873
Well, that's going to be a
conditional distribution.
