00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.980
I've been sewing,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.990
along with a friend of mine,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.740
a Klein bottle hat. My question for the Klein bottle hat

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.411
requires that I inset a zipper.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:15.540
Which is why my trusty old Pfaff has a zipper foot.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.879
Why would I want a zipper in a Klein bottle?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
I've been told over and over again that if I cut a Klein bottle in half,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.580
I'll get two Möbius loops.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.140
So let me unzip my Klein bottle

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.890
into

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.680
two pieces of fabric, ja? Here's one half of the Klein bottle.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.450
Here's the other half of the Klein bottle. Check this out. This half Klein bottle has a half a twist.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.390
This edge comes over, around, and then goes under.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.169
This is a Möbius loop. Yeah, it's wider in one part than the other, but it's a Möbius loop.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.259
This is also a Möbius loop. It looks almost the same, with an interesting difference. Check this out.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.978
This also is a Möbius loop, except where this one goes over, this one goes under.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.930
If this is a right-handed Möbius loop, this is a left-handed Möbius loop.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.569
I can zip these two Möbius loops together. This guy zips into here.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.840
And,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.290
with only a little bit of finagling,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.799
come on, finagle. So here's a fabric Klein bottle.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.909
Two Möbius loops, one left-handed, one right-handed,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.739
together, makes a Klein bottle. My head's too big still.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.509
Which is why I've begun making a bigger one of these. So I've got out the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.529
fabric, a zipper foot, have a long zipper, so my next week's project is to make a

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.479
bigger Klein bottle hat that will be properly

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060
fitted to me.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.320
And I hope will be like my knitted Klein bottle hats, that, you know, actually work properly.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.120
!!!!

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.420
Yeah, if I take a fabric Klein bottle and cut it in half, I'll get two Möbius loops.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.119
What happens if I cut a glass Klein model in half?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.000
Check this out. Come here. Keep keep going, Brady. Come on. Keep going, come on!

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.860
[frantic exclamations]

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.140
Let's go down.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.560
Okay, so how do you cut a Klein bottle in half? First thing you need is a diamond saw.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.739
Okay, here's a diamond saw, right here. Look along here, there's a diamond blade. Flip it on,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.600
and I can cut practically anything.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.940
I have a tile.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420
I can cut.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.889
It's a diamond saw, so it cuts through tile like butter. Cuts through glass real easy.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.599
Well, what I'd like to do is take a Klein bottle,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.450
put it in here and cut it.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.529
Problem is, to cut glass as fragile as this, I have to go very slowly.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.910
So,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.600
I can't push it with my hand because I'd be going v-v-v-v.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.320
I need a way to guide this carefully in a straight line.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.120
I built a linear table that will, instead of having nice expensive

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.850
linear bearings,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.710
I just used a couple drawer slides, a couple pieces of Plexiglass, a hinge,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.129
and everything's held together with the usual things like this.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.639
I can take a glass Klein bottle, put some Velcro on the bottom and then put a magnet inside of it.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.190
Little magnet right there.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.850
Magnet will be held here. Velcro is held there.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.129
Everything is held together, I hope like this.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.470
Okay, I now have a Klein bottle held in place,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.320
and all I need to do is bring it this way, it'll slice by way of the,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.080
by way of the diamond saw.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.679
So instead of just slicing it by pulling with my hand,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.109
I have a threaded rod, and the threaded rod will be pulled along by way of a drill

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.260
which is computer-controlled. I have a little Arduino that will...

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.120
[1.21 Jeegawatts!]

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.460
Half a Klein bottle. Another half of a Klein bottle.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.040
So, we now see two half Klein bottles, put together,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
one complete Klein bottle,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.960
two halves.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.810
Okay, this is fresh from the diamond saw, so it's covered with dust - glass dust. But let's look at this carefully.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
I'll start my finger right here,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.160
carry around here,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
around, around,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.030
around and back. This has one edge.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.279
Right? One edge. I start here, loop around,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.509
over here, along here, back across

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.979
to here. One edge. How about, how many sides does it have? Well, let's start right here.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.949
I can go all the way over to here.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:04.530
around, and if that wall weren't in the way, I'd be right back to here. It's a Möbius loop. It's got one side,

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.190
one edge, a half twist, and if I were to look carefully, I'd notice that this one,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.180
this Möbius loop has the opposite handedness of this Möbius loop.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.340
So, slice a Klein bottle in half,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:28.710
you end up with two Möbius loops. Glass Möbius, they're glass Möbius loops, admittedly, but it's the real thing.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.009
Okay, I built a machine that'll slice a piece of glass. That'll slice a Klein bottle.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.650
Let's cut a camera in half.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.829
Got an old Russian Zenit 35 millimeter camera.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.620
Ran it through my machine.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.728
Have a sliced camera.

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.859
And the lens, of course, is the cool part.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.520
A four-element lens, three of whi-

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:04.119
two, oh, five-element lens, glued together like this, straight out of my slicing machine. Since this is numberphile,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.840
and it's math, is to talk about the wonderful mathematics of

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.360
lenses.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.989
Ah, there is wonderful mathematics in a zoom lens!

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:21.639
Tracing rays and figuring out where the focus is. Making sure that the fo- that no intermediate focus lies on the edge of a lens.

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.949
Making sure that there's

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.760
that all rays from around the edge come to the same focus. I'd love to talk about it.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.000
Maybe some other time.
