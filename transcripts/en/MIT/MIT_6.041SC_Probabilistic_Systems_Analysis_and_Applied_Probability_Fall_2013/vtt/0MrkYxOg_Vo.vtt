00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
 

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.750
In this problem, we're dealing
with buses of students going

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.450
to a job convention.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.190
And in the problem, we'll
be exercising our

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.400
knowledge of PMFs--

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.050
probability mass functions.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.060
So we'll get a couple of
opportunities to write out

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.210
some PMFs, and also calculating
expectations or

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.700
expected values.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.340
And also, importantly, we'll
actually be exercising our

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.510
intuition to help us not just
rely on numbers, but also to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.850
just have a sense of what the
answers to some probability

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.930
questions should be.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.850
So the problem specifically
deals with

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.710
four buses of students.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.070
So we have buses, and in each
one carries a different number

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.630
of students.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.960
So the first one carries 40
students, the second one 33,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.790
the third one has 25, and the
last one has 50 students for a

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.480
total of 148 students.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.670
And because these students
are smart, and they like

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.210
probability, they are

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.170
interested in a couple questions.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.370
So suppose that one of these
148 students is chosen

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.880
randomly, and so we'll assume
that what that means is that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.360
each one has the same
probability of being chosen.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.120
So they're chosen uniformly
at random.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.580
And let's assign a couple
of random variables.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:28.100
So we'll say x corresponds to
the number of students in the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:40.010
bus of the selected student.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.830
OK, so one of these 148 students
is selected uniformly

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.670
at random, and we'll let x
correspond to the number of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.310
students in that
student's bus.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.310
So if a student from this bus
was chosen, then x would be

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.750
25, for example.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.340
OK, and then let's come up with
another random variable,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.430
y, which is almost
the same thing.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.789
Except instead of now selecting
a random student,

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.920
we'll select a random bus.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.110
Or equivalently, we'll select
a random bus driver.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.390
So each bus has one driver, and
instead of selecting one

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.320
of the 148 students at random,
we'll select one of the four

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.620
bus drivers also uniformly
at random.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.110
And we'll say the number
of students in that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.930
driver's bus will be y.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.940
So for example, if this bus
driver was selected, then y

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.820
would be 33.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.640
OK, so the main problem that
we're trying to answer is what

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.270
do you expect the
expectation--

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.910
which one of these random
variables do you expect to

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.050
have the higher expectation or
the higher expected value?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.280
So, would you expect
x to be higher on

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.050
average, or y to be higher?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.620
And what would be the
intuition for this?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.910
So obviously, we can actually
write out the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.990
PMFs for x and y.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.780
These are just discrete
random variables.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.170
And we can actually calculate
out what the expectation is.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.190
But it's also useful to exercise
your intuition, and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.260
your sense of what the
answer should be.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.420
So it might not be immediately
clear which one would be

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.640
higher, or you might even say
that maybe it doesn't make a

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.280
difference.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.350
They're actually the same.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.800
But a useful way to approach
some of these questions is to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.360
try to take things to
the extreme and see

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.440
how that plays out.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.580
So let's take the simpler
example and take it to the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.260
extreme and say, suppose a set
of four buses carrying these

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.370
number of students.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.620
We have only two buses--

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:49.280
one bus that has only 1 student,
and we have another

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.280
bus that has 1,000 students.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.370
OK.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.840
And suppose we ask the
same question.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.880
Well, now if you look at it,
there's a total of 1,001

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.850
students now.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.770
If you select one of the
students at random, it's

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.040
overwhelmingly more likely that
that student will be one

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.140
of the 1,000 students
on this huge bus.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.630
It's very unlikely that you'll
get lucky and select the one

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.140
student who is by himself.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.210
And so because of that, you
have a very high chance of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.930
selecting the bus with the
high number of students.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.710
And so you would expect
x, the number of

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.490
students, to be high--

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.590
to be almost 1,000 in
the expectation.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.840
But on the other hand, if you
selected the driver at random,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.880
then you have a 50/50
chance of selecting

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.430
this one or that one.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.210
And so you would expect the
expectation there to be

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.160
roughly 500 or so.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.740
And so you can see that if you
take this to the extreme, then

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.240
it becomes more clear what
the answer would be.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.650
And the argument is that the
expectation of x should be

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.930
higher than the expectation of
y, and the reason here is that

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.250
because you select the student
at random, you're more likely

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.410
to select a student who is in a
large bus, because that bus

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.920
just has more students
to select from.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.910
And because of that, you're
more biased in favor of

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.980
selecting large buses, and
therefore, that makes x higher

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.910
in expectation.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.580
OK, so that's the intuition
behind this problem.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.240
And now, as I actually go
through some of the more

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.100
mechanics and write out what the
PMFs and the calculation

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.640
for the expectation would be to
verify that our intuition

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.400
is actually correct.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.020
OK, so we have two random
variables that are defined.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.940
Now let's just write out
what their PMFs are.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.270
So the PMF--

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:58.240
we write it as little P of
capital X and little x.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.740
So the random variable-- what
we do is we say the

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.970
probability that it will take
on a certain value, right?

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.210
So what is the probability
that x will be 40?

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.030
Well, x will be 40
if a student from

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.810
this bus was selected.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.870
And what's the probability that
a student from this bus

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.570
is selected?

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.230
That probability is 40/148,
because there's 148 students,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.160
40 of whom are sitting
in this bus.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:35.470
And similarly, x will be 33 with
probability 33/148, and x

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.750
will be 25 with probability
25/148.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.120
And x will be 50 with
probability 50/148.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.030
And it will be 0 otherwise.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.750
 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.440
OK, so there is our PMF for
x, and we can do the

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.920
same thing for y.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.060
The PMF of y--

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.160
again, we say what is the
probability that y will take

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.150
on certain values?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.900
Well, y can take on the same
values as x can, because we're

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.580
still dealing with the number
of students in each bus.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.910
So y can be 40.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.390
But the probability that y is
40, because we're selecting

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.290
the driver at random
now, is 1/4, right?

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.260
Because there's a 1/4 chance
that we'll pick this driver.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.960
And the probability that y will
be 33 will also be 1/4,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:35.840
and the same thing
for 25 and 50.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.260
And it's 0 otherwise.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:49.690
OK, so those are the PMFs
for our two random

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.950
variables, x and y.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.630
And we can also draw out what
the PMFs look like.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:14.730
So if this is 25, 30, 35,
40, 45, and 50, then the

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.650
probability that it's
25 is 25/148.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.290
So we can draw a mass
right there.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.130
For 33, it's a little
higher, because it's

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.440
33/148 instead of 25.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.260
For 40, it's even
higher still.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.220
It's 40/148.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:39.380
And for 50, it is still higher,
because it is 50/148.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.620
And so you can see that the PMF
is more heavily favored

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.410
towards the larger values.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.610
We can do the same thing for
y, and we'll notice that

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.690
there's a difference in how
these distributions look.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:00.460
 

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.280
So if we do the same thing, the
difference now is that all

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.500
four of these masses will
have the same height.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.240
Each one will have height 1/4,
whereas this one for x, it's

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.710
more heavily biased in favor
of the larger ones.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.410
And so because of that, we can
actually now calculate what

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.740
the expectations are and figure
out whether or not our

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.600
intuition was correct.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.760
OK, so now let's actually
calculate out what these

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.610
expectations are.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.880
So as you recall, the
expectation is calculated out

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.830
as a weighted sum.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:45.490
So for each possible value of x,
you take that value and you

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.070
weight it by the probability of
the random variable taking

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.080
on that value.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:59.920
So in this case, it would be
40 times 40/148, 33 times

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:10.650
33/148, and so on.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:20.760
48 plus 25 times 25/148
plus 50 times 50/148.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.810
And if you do out this
calculation, what you'll get

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.820
is that it is around 39.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.070
Roughly 39.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.910
And now we can do the
same thing for y.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.650
But for y, it's different,
because now instead of

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.650
weighting it by these
probabilities, we'll weight it

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.920
by these probabilities.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.600
So each one has the same
weight of 1/4.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:55.390
So now we get 40 times 1/4
plus 33 times 1/4.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:01.130
That's 25 times 1/4
plus 50 times 1/4.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:06.030
And if you do out this
arithmetic, what you get is

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.310
that this expectation is 37.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.930
And so what we get is that, in
fact, after we do out the

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.090
calculations, the expected value
of x is indeed greater

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.110
than the expected value of y,
which confirms our intuition.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.310
OK, so this problem, to
summarize-- we've reviewed how

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.650
to write out a PMF and also how
to calculate expectations.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:33.540
But also, we've got a chance to
figure out some intuition

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.840
behind some of these problems.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.480
And so sometimes it's helpful
to take simpler things and

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.250
take things to the extreme and
figure out intuitively whether

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.520
or not the answer makes sense.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.530
It's useful just to verify
whether the numerical answer

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.950
that you get in the
end is correct.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.440
Does this actually make sense?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.850
It's a useful guide for when
you're solving these problems.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.310
OK, so we'll see you next time.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.560
