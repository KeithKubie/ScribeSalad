Hi I'm John Green; this is Crash Course World
History, and today we're gonna talk about

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.180
one of our most requested topics ever, the
Vikings.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.860
Me from the past: Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Finally
we get to talk about Thor and Mjölner. This

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.990
is one of my areas of expertise! I've read
all the comics! Like both Thor and The Avengers.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.970
John: Here's a crazy thing that happens in
the next twenty years me from the past, the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.240
Avengers and Thor become like, not nerdy.
Like right now me from the past, in 1994,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.230
you are suffering mightily for your love of
Mjölnir, Thor's hammer, but in the future

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.230
loving Mjölner is like, cool.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.580
[Intro]

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.240
Alright so this is Crash Course, so we're
mostly gonna skip the blood and guts and thunder

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.600
and lightning and sailing and dragons and
all that stuff that you can get in Game of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.980
Thrones.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.840
Instead we're gonna try and figure out what
we actually know about the Vikings and how

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.380
we know it.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.120
As it turns out, we actually know quite a
bit about the Vikings. They were people from

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.190
Scandinavia, modern day Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark, who sailed around the North Atlantic

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.579
and Baltic regions and briefly to North America,
raiding, trading and spreading their influence

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.960
to places as diverse as Ireland and Greenland
and Normandy and Kiev during the so-called

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.590
"Viking Age" between 750 and 1100 C.E.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.109
The Vikings were great sea men. What did you
think I was gonna make it through this video

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.340
without saying seamen once?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.020
They were able to cross the Atlantic without
the aid of a compass or triangular sails.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.390
They were fearsome warriors. Although their
reputation as bloodthirsty wild men of the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.479
North is probably exaggerated. You gotta remember
that history is shaped by those who wrote

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.990
it, and all of those like bloodthirsty men
of the North narratives were written by like

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.369
victims of Viking raids. So history isn't
always written by the winners, but when it's

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.909
written by the losers, they're really bitter
about the winners.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.499
Viking expeditions were a mixture of raiding
for booty, trading for goods, and eventually

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.810
searching for land to settle on.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.279
Like most people in most places at the time
the Vikings were primarily agriculturalists,

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:01.520
and when they settled in places like Iceland
and Greenland it was to grow crops and raise

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.700
animals.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.789
So how do we know all these things? Basically
the same way we know about most of the pre-modern

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.450
world, through a combination of archaeology
and writing.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.610
There is of course guest work involved as
with most pre-modern history, and some modern

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.810
history, and we need to be careful not to
take what we dig up or read at face value,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.040
but we do have a pretty good record about
the Vikings.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.480
Like archaeology tells a lot about how the
Vikings lived. The most dramatic examples

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.560
are, of course, the ships that have been discovered
through which we know a lot about what the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.970
Vikings like to trade, for instance.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.349
But with the Vikings we also have a pretty
substantial written record. Although we need

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.819
to be careful with it for a number of reasons,
the first is timing. Much of what was written

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.209
about the Vikings comes from the 13th century,
after the Viking age.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.650
And it was written by authors who had an interest
in making the Pagans seem as different from

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.150
them as possible to highlight the civilizing
role of Christianity.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.560
Now the Vikings were not illiterate; people
knew how to read and write runes, but most

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.909
of these runic inscriptions are really short
and don't tell us that much about Vikings.

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.269
It's nothing about like about Thor's hammer
or what ever it's all like "I trade three

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.849
sheep for two loads of lumber!"

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.549
Some of you Viking fans, and I know that's
most of you, are saying, "but what about the

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.849
sagas?" We tend to use the word saga to describe
anything that's long and drawn out but when

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.629
you're talking about Vikings it means something
very specific.

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.019
A saga is a long, narrative epic written in
Old Norse from the 13th century or later.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.659
And the date tells you something right away,
the sagas were written centuries after the

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.700
Viking Age. So we have to be careful when
using them as historical sources.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.480
The sagas we associate with the Vikings are
called the sagas of the Icelanders, which

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.890
look like this in Icelandic. And they purportedly
describe Viking travels and adventures in

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.450
the 10th and 11th centuries.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.269
People used to see them as relatively accurate
historical documents, but now most historians

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.459
recognize them as fictions. Like Viking historian
Teva Vidal, who provided much of the information

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.489
for this episode, says it's best to think
of the sagas as a kind of pseudo history.

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.599
They don't provide a completely accurate picture
of what it was like to be a Viking or what

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.090
happened to Vikings, but they can provide
some useful detail.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.159
Alright let's go to the Thought Bubble, and
while you're there by the way I'm gonna grow

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.870
a Viking beard and change shirts.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.620
Now your stereotypical Viking is a burly blonde
or redheaded fellow with a big beard and a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.329
bigger sword who learned the important lesson
that it's not about killing dragons; it's

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.700
about learning to train them so they can execute
your wishes.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.870
But the real stereotypical Viking was probably
a hard bargaining trader enmeshed in a complex

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.300
network of pan-European trade. I know how
you guys like it when I talk about trade.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.740
So at the beginning of the Viking age, the
Viking's primary interaction with the rest

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.220
of Europe was through raiding.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.860
Alright, hold on Thought Bubble; the Vikings
didn't have horns on their helmets. Sorry.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.310
Anyway, this bit about raiding was especially
true on the coast for obvious reasons. In

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.830
heavily forested places without many large
settlements, raiding was not a very good option.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.960
The earliest recorded Viking targets were
often monasteries, like the one at Lindisfarne

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.360
that was attacked in 793. Monasteries made
good targets because they were relatively

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.389
isolated, full of treasure, and monks usually
aren't very good fighters, except, of course,

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.580
for Shaolin monks.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.080
Now the Vikings were able sailors, but they
didn't quite make it far enough afield to

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.810
raid kung fu monasteries.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.590
Anyway, this brings up two important points.
First, the Vikings were not motivated by religion

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.960
even though they sacked monasteries; they
were after loot. Second and more importantly,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.599
Viking raids were not intended to destroy
people or towns, although, they have that

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:16.259
side effect.

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.750
So after an initial phase of raiding and terrorizing,
the Vikings realized there were better ways

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.139
to get rich. One was extortion; they built
up such a reputation that often times they

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.190
didn't need to actually raid a place to get
them to give up their goods.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.720
Eventually, though, the Vikings turned to
trade and settlement. Which as we've seen

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.090
over and over are the most reliable paths
to wealth. Not necessarily the most fun. Thanks,

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.800
Thought Bubble, and thanks for getting some
of the blood and the guts and especially dragons

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.419
in there.

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.900
So Viking settlements, like their raids and
trading missions, were about gaining wealth,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.039
this time in the form of usable agricultural
land. Like they weren't colonizers interested

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.870
in creating Viking states or a Viking empire,
and how much Vikings influenced the places

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.849
that they raided was pretty varied.

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.330
In England, where the Vikings established
a territory called the Danelaw, there was

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.680
a hybridization between the Britons and the
Scandinavians, while in Normandy and Russia,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.370
where Vikings were always a small minority,
they blended with the dominant culture very

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.599
quickly. In regions where they could become
a majority of the population like Iceland

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.009
and Greenland, Scandinavian culture came to
dominate which is why we see such close cultural

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.430
affinity between these regions of Scandinavia
proper today.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.720
Like those Icelandic sagas we were talking
about? People living in Iceland can read them

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.470
today because they're written in the same
Icelandic. Whereas if English readers try

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.289
to read the Canterbury tales, which were written
hundreds of years later, it's difficult to

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.789
even get the fart jokes.

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:41.750
So much of the reason we seen Greenland, Iceland,
and the Faroe Islands as part of a larger

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.180
North Atlantic Viking world is because they
were all tied together by trade.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.020
The Vikings established trade in manufacturing
hubs in places as diverse as Hedeby, Roskilde,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.610
Birka, Dublin, and York. So the Vikings- ohhhhh!
It's time for the open letter.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.990
But first let's see what's in the globe today.
Oh look, it's a Viking longboat beating against

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.099
the current, borne back ceaselessly into Nova
Scotia.

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:08.340
Hey there Leif. So your dad, Eric the Red,
was exiled from Iceland to Greenland because

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.220
of manslaughter. Now I know what you're thinking,
kicked out of Iceland for manslaughter? I

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.099
thought that's how people got TO Iceland.
I'm just kidding, Iceland, I visited you once

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:16.960
and you were amazing!

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.050
Anyway, Leif, you decided that Greenland was
not far enough afield and you took the Vikings

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.000
all the way to North America. Where in North
America? We're not quite sure, but we're pretty

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.169
sure that you did go there. There was some
raiding, some trading, some strife with the

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:35.419
indigenous people. And then, you didn't settle
the land and kill 95% of American Indians,

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:41.669
and for that Leif Ericson, I say good job!
Best Wishes, John Green.

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:46.110
So anyway the Vikings traded all sorts of
things including tools and weapons and jewelry

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.879
and building materials and also soapstone
which they use to make cooking vessels, whereas

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:55.110
like we would probably use, like, ceramic
pottery, or these days you know steel or that

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.689
wizardry that non-stick pans are made out
of.

00:07:57.689 --> 00:08:02.330
Man, it would suck to be a Viking. You've
got soapstone pots, no horns on your helmet,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.199
and like all you can do is travel from Dublin
to York. Best case scenario, you get to go

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.689
to Canada, which, you know, not that great.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:13.259
But Viking trade was often able to turn what
had been a cultural bathwater into like a

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:17.949
big important commercial center. Kiev was
probably one such center before it had been

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:19.310
a Khazar trading post.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.169
Another was Dublin, which was probably a fishing
Village before the Vikings turned it into

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:28.259
a thriving center of trade. Dublin eventually
grew so large and powerful that the Dubliners,

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:32.349
not the James Joyce short story collection,
but the actual Dubliners, were able to kick

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:33.329
the Vikings out.

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:37.690
Okay wait we should also probably talk a little
bit about mythology and the Norse pantheon

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.700
because you know, Thor.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.440
As with much of our knowledge about the Vikings,
our understanding of Norse mythology mostly

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.440
dates from after the Viking age. There are
some artifacts like Thor's hammer pendants

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.370
and picture stones from Goathland. But most
of the myths that you might know come from

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.860
later, written accounts like the Prose Edda
from Iceland and you know, Marvel Comics from

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.290
New York.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.029
So most of the people who were describing
Viking religion were Christians, and they

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:06.610
characterized the Vikings as Pagans because,
you know, they could only describe religions

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:13.610
in terms they knew of and that was like Christianity,
or Pagan Greco Roman you know Gods of Olympus.

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:19.010
So it can be tempting to draw an equivalence
between Norse mythology and Greco Roman mythology,

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:24.829
but that's not really about Viking religion;
it's more about like the way Christians imagined

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:25.570
Viking religion.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.730
Yes, I realize that the Greek pantheon and
Roman pantheon are different. I just want

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.510
to emphasize that any resemblance between
the Greco Roman and Norse mythologies are

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.500
mostly coincidental.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.230
I mean yes, there is a God responsible for
thunder in both of them, but there is a God

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.790
responsible for thunder in most polytheistic
religions. Now of course we know thunder,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.170
as my four and a half year old son told me,
is dinosaurs walking around heaven.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.720
So in the end when it comes to Viking religion,
we have a lot of stories from after the Viking,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.440
but we don't have a lot of knowledge about
how they actually practiced and worshiped.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.740
So there's a brief introduction to the role
of Vikings in world history. I know you probably

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.440
wanted more blood and guts; there was a little
bit of blood and guts but, you know, it's

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.180
mostly trade.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.630
The eventual success and influence of the
Vikings was really about settlements and the

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.500
exchange of goods, and, in the process, the
exchange of cultures.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.490
But of course fighting and killing get a lot
more attention than trade, which maybe one

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.750
of the reasons that we remember the Vikings
so vividly. I mean, they made their biggest

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.540
influence in Greenland and Iceland, and nothing
against Greenland or Iceland, but we're talking

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.870
about a combined populations somewhere in
the neighborhood of half of Columbus, Ohio.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:33.630
So we may remember the mythology and the barbarian
attacks because that's kind of what humans

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.440
are wired to remember, but for me, the real
lesson of the Vikings is that they show in

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.190
microcosm something that happens again and
again in world history. When raiding gives
