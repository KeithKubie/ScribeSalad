Video compression works in slightly different ways.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.620
Each video is a sequence of images and

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.250
each image can be compressed with spacial redundancy,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.040
exploiting aspects that humans tend not to notice.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.650
Also there is temporal redundancy. Between any

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.380
two video images, or frames, there might be

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.200
very little difference. So if this person was

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.210
walking towards a tree, you might see a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.350
version of the image that's almost the same,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.400
except with the person shifted slightly to the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.610
right. Video compression uses a combination of static

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.190
image compression on what are called reference frames,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.360
or anchor frames, sometimes called I frames, and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.660
derived frames, sometimes called P frames. The P

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.910
frame can be represented as the I frame, compressed. If we take the I frame and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.570
divide it into blocks, we can then see that the P frame is almost the same

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.510
except for a few blocks here that can be represented

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.580
in terms of the original I frame blocks, plus a few motion vectors.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.050
A common video compression format that's used on the internet is called MPEG.
