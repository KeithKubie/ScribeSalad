00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is this approach is much better because now from the external part

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
everybody else sees exactly the same thing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But internally, I can write the calls to the function in a convenient form

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and they still get returned in a way that the rest of the program can deal with,

00:00:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and I don't have to change the rest of the program.
