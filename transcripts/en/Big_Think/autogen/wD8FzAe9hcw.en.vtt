now they realize that's just the first
 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.759
now they realize that's just the first
part and now it means starting to do

things online that you otherwise would
not be able to do offline and that's

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379
not be able to do offline and that's
 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.619
not be able to do offline and that's
what a lot of companies are discovering

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629
what a lot of companies are discovering
 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.039
what a lot of companies are discovering
now the ones that are the incumbents in

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:45.049
now the ones that are the incumbents in
 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.340
now the ones that are the incumbents in
the offline world they're just starting

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350
the offline world they're just starting
 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.710
the offline world they're just starting
to discover that that's just the first

part of being online is being digital
and now we're getting into the piece

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070
and now we're getting into the piece
 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.049
and now we're getting into the piece
where it's about being connected being

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059
where it's about being connected being
 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.119
where it's about being connected being
connected in a way that you otherwise

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129
connected in a way that you otherwise
 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.520
connected in a way that you otherwise
wouldn't be able to be connected being

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530
wouldn't be able to be connected being

formerly known as the audience but you
can take that into education and you can

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
can take that into education and you can

because the technology exists now to be

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539
because the technology exists now to be
 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.959
because the technology exists now to be
able to engage with individuals and also

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969
able to engage with individuals and also
 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.899
able to engage with individuals and also
get the massive amounts of data that

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909
get the massive amounts of data that
 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.359
get the massive amounts of data that
come from that so that's a significant

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369
come from that so that's a significant
 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.969
come from that so that's a significant
shift that's occurring right now some of

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979
shift that's occurring right now some of
 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.859

the immersive video 360 video experience

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869
the immersive video 360 video experience
 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.529
the immersive video 360 video experience
that we've done have been of Syrian

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539
that we've done have been of Syrian
 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.639
that we've done have been of Syrian
refugee camps so that you get more of a

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649
refugee camps so that you get more of a
 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.160
refugee camps so that you get more of a
visceral feeling for what that feels

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
visceral feeling for what that feels
 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.679
visceral feeling for what that feels
like what it looks like by being able

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689
like what it looks like by being able
 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.330
like what it looks like by being able
and by the way it's not just the video

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340
and by the way it's not just the video
 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.929
and by the way it's not just the video
the sound being able to get 360 sounds

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939
the sound being able to get 360 sounds
 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.570
the sound being able to get 360 sounds
so that when you turn your head you're

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580
so that when you turn your head you're
 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.330
so that when you turn your head you're
you hear things in a different way so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340
you hear things in a different way so
 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.470
you hear things in a different way so
that experience has to come together and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
that experience has to come together and
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.130
that experience has to come together and
that is much richer has much

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
that is much richer has much
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.160
that is much richer has much
more information packed in it which

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
more information packed in it which
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.740
more information packed in it which
gives you more context for the story

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
gives you more context for the story
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.809
gives you more context for the story
right now let's not forget that whether

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819
right now let's not forget that whether
 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.100
right now let's not forget that whether
it's straight linear video or VR

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
it's straight linear video or VR
 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.530
it's straight linear video or VR
oftentimes you're still trying to tell a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
oftentimes you're still trying to tell a
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.370
oftentimes you're still trying to tell a
story

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380
story
 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.490
story
it isn't just visiting the Grand Canyon

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
it isn't just visiting the Grand Canyon
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.520
it isn't just visiting the Grand Canyon
and being in your living room but you're

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
and being in your living room but you're
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.080
and being in your living room but you're
in the Grand Canyon and you're looking

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
in the Grand Canyon and you're looking
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.880
in the Grand Canyon and you're looking
around that's that's not a particular

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890
around that's that's not a particular
 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800
around that's that's not a particular
story but when you're doing journalism

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
story but when you're doing journalism
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.120
story but when you're doing journalism
about hey what does life in a refugee

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130
about hey what does life in a refugee
 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.910
about hey what does life in a refugee
camp look like there's a narrative there

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
camp look like there's a narrative there
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.330
camp look like there's a narrative there
there's a story and so being able to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
there's a story and so being able to
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.259
there's a story and so being able to
immerse yourself adds more texture more

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269
immerse yourself adds more texture more
 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.650
immerse yourself adds more texture more
richness to that experience but still

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
richness to that experience but still
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.110
richness to that experience but still
you have to do it in such a way that it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120
you have to do it in such a way that it
 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.100
you have to do it in such a way that it
doesn't detract from being able to pick

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110
doesn't detract from being able to pick
 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.140
doesn't detract from being able to pick
up the story and that's where I think

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
up the story and that's where I think
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.780
up the story and that's where I think
this is tricky because I think that the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
this is tricky because I think that the
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.620
this is tricky because I think that the
technology is ahead of the storytelling

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
technology is ahead of the storytelling
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.440
technology is ahead of the storytelling
around it because I think storytellers

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
around it because I think storytellers
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.289
around it because I think storytellers
still feel more comfortable in tight

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
still feel more comfortable in tight
 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.690
still feel more comfortable in tight
linear narrative right they've already

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
linear narrative right they've already
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.990
linear narrative right they've already
written a script and they're just out

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000
written a script and they're just out
 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.069
written a script and they're just out
there to shoot things according to the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079
there to shoot things according to the
 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.729
there to shoot things according to the
script right versus being able to open

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739
script right versus being able to open
 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.210
script right versus being able to open
that up and then how do you do that

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220
that up and then how do you do that
 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.300
that up and then how do you do that
while maintaining the storylines that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310
while maintaining the storylines that
 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.520
while maintaining the storylines that
you want to provide people are still

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
you want to provide people are still
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.970
you want to provide people are still
figuring that out the example I give to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980
figuring that out the example I give to
 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.720
figuring that out the example I give to
folks is like when grand theft auto came

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730
folks is like when grand theft auto came
 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.229
folks is like when grand theft auto came
out you know as a video game and it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239
out you know as a video game and it
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.630
out you know as a video game and it
wasn't just a set of missions that you

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640
wasn't just a set of missions that you
 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.360
wasn't just a set of missions that you
progress through but they created a

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
progress through but they created a
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.509
progress through but they created a
world and you can roam freely throughout

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519
world and you can roam freely throughout
 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.500
world and you can roam freely throughout
the world and that world was then

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
the world and that world was then
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.940
the world and that world was then
loosely coupled to these missions so

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950
loosely coupled to these missions so
 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.029
loosely coupled to these missions so
sometimes you were just roaming around

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039
sometimes you were just roaming around
 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.390
sometimes you were just roaming around
experiencing what that was about and

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400
experiencing what that was about and
 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.900
experiencing what that was about and
then you'd go back into mission

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
then you'd go back into mission
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.779
then you'd go back into mission
progression mode then you jump out and I

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789
progression mode then you jump out and I
 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.999
progression mode then you jump out and I
actually think that's the way

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009
actually think that's the way
 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.629
actually think that's the way
that we operate we're yeah we're not

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639
that we operate we're yeah we're not
 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.159
that we operate we're yeah we're not
always in transactional mode yeah we're

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169
always in transactional mode yeah we're
 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.959
always in transactional mode yeah we're
transacting we're progressing and then

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969
transacting we're progressing and then
 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.409
transacting we're progressing and then
we're experiencing everything around us

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419
we're experiencing everything around us
 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.790
we're experiencing everything around us
and I think that's what VR 360 video

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800
and I think that's what VR 360 video
 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.960
and I think that's what VR 360 video
gives us the opportunity to do
