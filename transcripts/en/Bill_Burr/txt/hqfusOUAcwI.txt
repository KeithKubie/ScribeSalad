Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast at Ah, ah, just chicken in on you. I'm checking in on you this cause I care. Okay. And this time when everybody else is just thinking about themselves in their issues, I'm the person that cares about everybody else and now I'm going to tell you about it because that's what the world is about. Now, the world is not about trying to go out and go. You don't do a good thing unless everybody knows you did a good thing. Here's me helping an old lady across the street. Hang on, granny. Look into the look under my phone while I take a selfie of what a good fucking person I am. Um, and then I, then I hashtag it humble. Um, just had the most amazing experience helping an old person across the street, which I documented on my smartphone. Hashtag humbled hashtag learn from your elders. Oh, I am in an extra cunty mood today. I'm not gonna lie to you. It has nothing to do with the hipsters. It's got nothing to do with the Manchurian candidate. Hey, by the way, you know, I want to apologize to everybody in England, the UK, the, what else do you call it? The fucking, uh, there's something empire. Great Britain, right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Specifically or pacifically depending on your education. I would like to apologize to the football fans of the premier league. I've been making fun of it saying it's fucking stupid. They, you know, and, and, and Man City, they'd played a bunch of shit pump teams and they're just going to keep winning. And this is going to be like no excitement whatsoever. And just when you thought this pasty freckled Yak was right, what happened? Man, city loses to the powerhouse that is Tottenham. Oh No, wait, Tottenham, I could've told you fucking three years ago they were going to lose that game. Nothing sends shivers down the fucking spine of football fans as they shove fucking newspaper Rep fish into their faces.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       Like the phrase we have Tottenham next. It's amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       They fucking lost. So I don't know what's going on. So now, you know, I think Liverpool could actually tie.

Speaker 2:          00:02:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       And that that would be amazing. Right after all of this running around and grabbing your legs and screaming in agony, the end of the year, you got two champions putting a whole new fucking meaning to. We are the champions. We are the champions, the premier league, Booboo, booboo. Uh, no one is fucking better except for that other team do, do, do, do we, uh, the chair and so is the other city. I for the life of me don't understand how you have a fucking league that the entire world is watching and you don't, you're not, you're not going to have these two teams play each other. We are the champions done of the world, but so was man city. We tied as champions.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       So then what's going to happen, you guys are both going to walk around in your cities, which your championship hats for 2019, and then you run into each other on the fucking tube or the train or wherever the fuck you are. And then it's, it's like literally like one of those stupid fucking feel good stories on Facebook. So-And-So had a twin that he was unaware of. He's now 63 and he went to a mall on Long Island and ran into this fucking jerk off. That was his brother that he didn't know. Right. I always think that's hilarious when siblings meet each other in their sixties that they didn't know existed. And now what are you going to talk about? You know, I had my gallbladder removed too. You really are my brother. You want to go play fucking catch. Um, I don't have shoulders that work anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       You also dodged the draft. Oh my God. How could you not be related? So that's what's going on right now. And I, I tried looking up to figure out, uh, you know, the standings and all of that shit in the premier league. Every one will be champion this year. Alright. Standings the same way. It can end in a zero zero tie. You can have two champions. Do, do, do, do. All right, so right now Liverpool has two more points, but I've learned that that doesn't mean shit unless, you know, like how many games are left and I gotta be honest. I don't give a fuck. I don't, okay. I'm still rooting for Liverpool. I'm still paying attention. But if the end of all of this fucking shit, these fucking two assholes aren't going to play each other and Man City could, could,

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       could not win it because they lost that totter ham. Right. Could I get bit pip a ham on a sandwich, please? Um, I dunno. Whatever. You know what I'm doing? I'm doing, what I fucking hate people do when they come to this country is they just come here and they tell me how fucked up it is. Like I as an American don't realize it. It's like, dude, I fucking live here. Can you stop country splaining to me while you man spread across to me. You toxic foreign male Caucasian. Whenever the fuck these fucking broads a bitching about this week.

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       Anyways, there's a big strike that's supposed to be happening out here. I'm hoping they're gonna win the writer's guild. You know, these fucking piece of shit agents did. They actually fucking started packaging deals with them making more money than the fucking person were allegedly working for. It's just classic them. And you know what they do? They go to bed, they fucking sleep fine. You know? You know what's funny is none of my agents have brought this up. Like, yeah, I mean, I wasn't a part of it and it's despicable.

Speaker 3:          00:06:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Hey Nia, we would just say no, you haven't been on the podcast and forever. I know.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       Oh Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       You could not sound less. Uh, I dunno. Missing of the podcast. What's going on with your gorgeous, you look in great. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:06:58       Oh, thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       You know, I'm a Zombie. That's something I know. Nia woke up, I woke up this morning and the first thing is says it was just like, oh my God. Oh the sleep until midnight. And then I couldn't go to sleep until 4:00 AM. And you know, and you want as a husband to be like, well that sucks for you. But you know what that means. You got to go get the little rug rat. I did. I made a Waf. I came in here this morning. She goes, I go, I go, hey buddy should go, I want waffles. Now, the first thing right out of the gate, she came in with a breakfast or I want waffles. All right? But I'm a strict dad, so you know what I did? I went right downstairs and I made her waffles. That's right. Yeah. You're eating a healthy breakfast. What'd you say, sweetheart? You want waffles? Okay. Absolutely. Anything for you. But then I did make waffles for you, Nia. I did not because you've been crushing it on your diet and there's all kinds of sugar and shit in that. You don't need it. And I didn't want to be the guy that handed you the crack pipe.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       Nia, this off Mike thing that you're doing on the podcast is about as exciting as watching Liverpool and man city not play each other for the championship. Everyone is champion in soccer. If you fall down, we'll fucking stop the game for 20 minutes, Booboo, booboo. Um, the more you watch soccer though, you're more, you can see how much it hurts, you know, and they get the spikes going. Like most salad was on that breakaway and that guy just basically peel the skin off the back of his calf. But I love that he was on a breakaway and he kept going. Most salad actually looks like he's like, it looks like the Judd Apatow of premiere league soccer. Nothing. You just gonna walk out. No, I was about to be like you said what they look, they look like each other. He's the best player in the, in the soccer league.

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       Yes. Um, Nia always looking out for me. Always looking out for me. Did you just say something about Tara Reid? Um, anyways, uh, Stanley Cup playoffs started now for all you English people over there. You probably Roy. What's that? Is that like everybody sorta just mills around playing each other and then the end they, you know, like whoever has the most points wins right now. Everybody English just like, that's a fucking terrible, I'm going to compound it with a bad accent. Right way. He'll fall. Could talk like that Mike. Um, yeah. Started last night. The islanders, big win and over time over your Pittsburgh Penguins, OT loss, OT loss. Uh, San Jose Sharks. I fell asleep. I think they were handling the nights it pretty well. It's four to one. Um, and I didn't see what happened with Nashville. No, wait. Yeah, that was, yeah. Okay. Sorry. I watch. I got a kid now. I don't know what the fuck's going on. Um, but I'll tell you what, as much as I have a child, as much as I'm a dedicated father, I still had time to go onto my little fucking garage with my wonderful, beautiful Gretsch broadcast to set. And I was there. I was working on that, uh, that Soundgarden song,

Speaker 3:          00:10:18       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       never the machine again.

Speaker 3:          00:10:23       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       Which is a nine. I saw a site, I figured out that it was in nine, and then I figured out the main groove and then that second groove where he goes on the toms, I can never fucking here where he's at. So I had to watch some kid on Youtube, play it. Um, but I, I'm able to the whole song though, what I love about the whole songs, it's, it's in nine and then it feels like it's switches, but it never does. He's just fucking with the time. It was almost like he was either playing double time at first and then regular time or he was playing regular time and then half time, which I think is what he's doing and just the way he comes up with the drum parts. Matt Cameron, the overrated underrated for this week. Matt Cameron, Drummer for sound garden, Pearl Jam and a, whoever's next band is going to be whoever they are going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Um, I don't know, I always thought he was like wasted and Pearl Jam that he could play all these different time signatures. And as far as I know pearl jam just plays in for, you know, so that's like you got like some fucking amazing like I dunno, wide receiver and you just have them on special teams. Is that what it is? Bill? You non-musician Khan? Who the fuck are you to tell one of the biggest bands ever that they're wasting one of the great drummers of all time. You know, I've got a lot of fucking balls first. First he attacked the Premiere League and now you're giving shit to fucking whoever puts together. Pearl Jam. Um, will they fishermen is that they came up with Pearl, you know what a pearls come on and visit oysters. I can never remember. It is pretty amazing that we somehow found those fucking things. Crustaceans buried in the fucking sand and the goddamn ocean and our stupid nosy ass as we like the broad set of species. You know, your fucking wife just sticks. They're fucking nose in everything. Everything is curious to them. They say they're curious. It's like, no, you're nosy. You're snooping around.

Speaker 4:          00:12:24       It's fucking nuts. All right. Uh, where do pearls come from? [inaudible] that's where he is, right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       Why is my internet this fucking slow? Have they just decided that I have to buy a new fucking, although clams and mussels can also produce pearls. They do. So they don't do so very often. Everything has to be inclusive. We're not staying more nuts in clans and muscles aren't as good as oysters.

Speaker 4:          00:13:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       As oysters grow and internal organ called the mantle use is minerals from the oysters food to produce a substance called now who gives a shit? Somebody sat and figured that out. Somebody opened that up and found it and was like, you know what, I'm going to give this to the fucking woman in the tribe. I want to bang and it was shiny and the other women didn't have it and she liked him and the dude got his fucking prehistoric dick sucked and the trajectory of that, those butterfly wings flapping turned into all that bullshit you see on TV with Tiffany's.

Speaker 4:          00:13:37       You know

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       as a man, if you ever produce one of those, when are you going to get her the ring commercials like you really dish something should happen to you. You should lose something. I'm not saying physically, but you should depth some. We should take your flat screen away for like six months. No sports packages. But then again, what kind of man who is in Dysport? Well, a lot of them because they're all about the fucking money. Like these fucking Goddamn agents out here. What a bunch of cunts I gee, you know, it's not the AEAs steel. It's that you'd go to bed at night with a smile on your face. [inaudible]. That's what kills me about the fucking agencies out here. They don't even have any guilt of what the fuck they do. Just like every other fucking corporations. It's just fucking unbelievable.

Speaker 5:          00:14:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       I'm fucking believable. And they know they got everybody by the fucking balls. February's going to fire their fucking age. Do they know? They know they did it. You did it. Congratulations. Congratulations. Go get your fucking infinity pool. You're fucking greedy. Cons. I'll tell you, that's not just this business at any time. You come up with an idea, all right, and you get in business with somebody else. You think that they're working with you. I swear to God, I swear to God, but at the end of the day, you're going to end up fucking work for them. Every time you think you're not the whore walking the block and you think you finally got in the car and now you're the pimp, you're not, you're fucking walk in the block for somebody. It's fucking ridiculous. May they all die of fucking a fucking heart attack today when they go out and eat their fucking surf and turf lunches, gree cons. Um, oh no, I can only get so fucking mad about it. But what do you expect? What do you expect? You know, that's, that's what they do. It's what they do. It's what they do.

Speaker 6:          00:15:20       They're all about

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       the fucking money. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       maybe that's what artists can do to fight back because we're not organized enough. Maybe we should just fucking, you know, and they still would kid. It's not that you can say to him, Hey, what's up? You're greedy. Current. They'd be like, hey, how are you just riding my may back. Um, anyway, uh, moving on. So the Bruins play the Toronto Maple leafs, uh, once again, this and you gotta think at some point Toronto has to push through. Will this be the year? Um, I am rooting for those guys, but not this series. Um, and if they beat my Bruins and I will, I will root for them because it's getting ridiculous. You know what is amazing though, and it really just goes to show you how nice people are in Canada on the surface, even though it's probably arguably more racist up there than it is down here.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       And I know that that's a big statement, but somebody has to offset Michael. What's his face there? Is it Michael Moore? I remember his fucking ridiculous cartoon version of what Canada was like. Everybody leaves their doors unlocked in your urine. GC phase, gingerbread houses up there. Jeez, I understand that. He's too fat to actually go and do some fucking research, which is why all his documentaries or just op ed pieces. But the, that whole didn't that fucking moron. He should go fucking interview one guy of color who tried to make it in the Nhl and just have him tell some fucking stories to play in minor league hockey up there and what people said fucking last week to I'm on the ice. Um, anyway. Oh Jesus. Going after England now going after Canada, talking about fucking broads bitch and then us bill, what's less? Let's let out Salvador, the look, if you fucking people going to be down there, so in a close together, goddammit, you do it rack. Um, all right, here is another question I have. No, so here's the thing. Um, this goes to show how nice they are. Surface on the surface level of, um, in Canada is, I remember when the rangers have been wanting since 1940 everyone used in the 80s. Everyone was chanting 19, 1940. So they were 40 something years in nobody chance 1967 maybe cause it's 67. It's just too long. Now I'm paying 40 doesn't have a good rhythm here. 1967.

Speaker 2:          00:18:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       That's like when, when the red sox finally won and Yankee fans couldn't chat 1918 anymore. So then now they just go pause. They went, they used to be 1918 and now they go, Boston sucks. They turn a one syllable word to a two syllable because they're too fucking dumb. You can't think of a fucking insult with two syllables. I don't know. Maybe I, I don't know. I don't understand. Why isn't anybody cheating? It was always fucking shit. Now a year, nobody chanted 1906 and 1907 at the cubs. But everybody chanted 1918 I got, I gotta tip my cap, the Yankee fence. We're actually ESPN the way they fucking overhyped all of that, and of course them, they didn't get to the real, you know the real story about it. You know what I mean? Where it was just like, yeah, we would just say horribly inept franchise, and the Yankees were not good owners. They didn't know what the fuck they were doing. Right. They didn't do that and that the Yankees were just this amazing organization that picked Michael Jordan for decades in a row, bottom one time,

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       and

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       no one's ever going to fucking do that again. All right. You got the Green Bay packers. Green Bay packers are on their way. They went from Brett [inaudible]. All right. To Aaron Rodgers. Now an errands done. I asked you this. When Aaron Rodgers has done, if they have another hall of fame quarterback that wins one or two super bowls three times in a row, I don't think anybody's ever done that,

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       right?

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       I don't think so. No, they haven't. Nobody's ever fucking done that.

Speaker 2:          00:20:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       What is amazing too is they have three that did. They have the greatest quarterbacks of all time. Collectively, Bart Starr, Brett Farve, Aaron Rodgers, who can do better than that. Terry Bradshaw. Ben Roethlisberger. Then you got nothing. We got Tom Brady in my heart. Also says Steve Drogan drew Bledsoe. But you know the stat people won't allow that. Um, Bob Greasy Dan Marino to have three. Three is hard. Well, let's see here. Roger Starbuck.

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       Nope. Nobody else

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       there. Wait a fucking minute. God knows the bears and fucking browns. You don't have to think about them. The lions Bobby Lane. That's it. Hi. Come on in buddy.

Speaker 7:          00:21:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       Hey. Hey. Did you like the waffles? Yeah. Um, yeah. What are you doing today? Come on up on the bed.

Speaker 7:          00:21:25       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       that's okay. Come on. You want to hold that? All right. I'm, I'm talking about is anybody other than the packers have three hall of Fame Quarterbacks, Huh? Hell, you want to say hello? Say Hello. Hello? Say Hello. Say hello everybody as she's getting shy. Um, yeah, I gotta I gotta give it up to the Green Bay packers in which makes sense because they've won the most NFL titles and super bowls.

All right, so this is why he's going to be, he's got the punchline in Philly. April 11th, 12th the 13th. He's at Raleigh Improv on the 18th, the 19th and uh, and the 20th all you people down south don't sleep on him just because he's fucking a New Yorker. Then he's at the New York Comedy Club on the 26th and the 27th of April. All right.

He is now officially a headliner and all you got, it's just people have to discover that. So he's learning, uh, it's Kinda cool to actually talk to him cause I remember being where he's at, where he's like, you know, certain areas, they know who he is and he does great. And then you go down south and nobody knows who you are. Same way for the southern comic comes up north. It's like you went to a different country at first tell, everybody starts to know who you are. Imagine Ron White probably had that issue at some point during his career before he, uh, became the superstar that he is. Um, so catch Paul Versey now and you can say, I saw him when I saw him when, uh, but anyways, he had this hilarious tweet.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       He's always talking shit. He goes, I haven't smoked a cigar for 17 days, which I'm very proud of him. And then he, then he writes, tell me I can't do 30, which is fucking hilarious. Not only because there's people out there trying to get off phentenol and there's people evidently getting sold into slavery in Libya and all he's trying to do is not smoke a fucking cigar and a Jacuzzi for a month that stay strong, Paul. But what I love is he goes, tell me I can't do 30. Almost like he was trolling people on the Internet and everything that I saw for the most part was negative. People were sending him pictures of cigars or they just write gay. And it just, I don't know. It's just like you, it's like you walked into a boxing ring with your chin out. God, I date and punched me in the fucking Chin.

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       They just mean the internet is just mean. You don't go to the Internet for support. Um, but he hasn't smoked a cigar and 17 days. And evidently he now thinks I know him in his head. He thinks he's doing, he's like what Reggie Miller used to do. The Knicks, like he's just buried in threes stealing the inbound pass running past the three d other side of the three point line and hitting another one. Um, but I am proud of him too, cause that's what, you know, I'll be honest with you to all the cigars. Paul is not smoking. I'm smoking. So I got to kind of lay off. Um, but I'm just not feeling like I want to, cause that's like my only advice I really have right now. Oh, freckles is coming up on 140 days and no fucking booze. Um, 20 goddamn weeks. And I got to be honest, in much as I bring it up to you guys, I always bring it up to you guys. I know you're sick of it. I just bring it up to you cause I want, I want to, I want to be held accountable. No, I seriously, I just want this, I want to keep going with this thing. So I said I'm doing a fucking calendar year, January 1st to December 31st and I'm actually thinking of going to my birthday next year.

Speaker 3:          00:29:32       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       I Dunno. I get weird with this shit. Like now it's like, all right. You know, I don't want to like, I don't want to end the streak.

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       Tell me. I can't fucking make it to 140 days people. Um, anyways. All right. I think that's going to be the podcast here for this week. Congratulations to all the football fans in Europe of the premier league. You must be going absolutely crazy right now knowing that there's an incredible chance is that, uh, there could be two champions this year or maybe there isn't. I'm trying to look at. My F is for family script that I have to read here in an hour. The table read. I'm just going to get there early I think cause I can can read this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:30:22       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       it won't open for me. Um, anyways, episode nine everybody this time next week we're going to be reading episode 10 and then seasoned number four has been written and we still have to do all the punch ups in the editing and all that. That takes another fucking nine months. But you know the big stuff, the big heavy lifting is out of the way. All right, well that's it and podcast. All right, it's done. But there's going to be a little musical interlude here.

Speaker 8:          00:30:50       Um, and then we're going to play your greatest hits. Another half hour bonus of a greatest hits Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast from, uh, earlier this year, 10 years ago. I don't know when I started doing this things. All right, have a great weekend. Your cuts go

Speaker 7:          00:31:16       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:31:34       [inaudible] call for Z

Speaker 1:          00:31:39       of course was saying Babe Ruth was the greatest baseball player of all time. And then he said all the usual shit. He basically repeated shift that he heard on TV, the, he played at the dead ball era. Right. And a law head was also trying to tell me, you know, yeah, he, and I was just saying, listen, I'm not saying he's not one of the great players of all time, but he's not the greatest of all fucking time for the simple fact. He didn't play against the greatest. All right? He played in a segregated league with the Pedro Martinez, the Mariano Rivera's. Okay. The Josh Gibson's, they weren't allowed in the fucking league. He didn't have to compete against Reggie Jackson even to have to compete against these guys. They weren't allowed in the league. He was playing and basically a softball league. Okay. We're the top third. What I would say would make, you know, would make the major league baseball nowadays. Okay. But I get it. You've got to think like two thirds of them won't even fucking been there. Then they tried to do that shit. Well, Bill, it was only 10 teams. There's three teams now. Yeah. And there was all solely fucking

Speaker 10:         00:32:40       2 billion people on the planet. Now there's 7 billion. All right, so I'll, I'll, I'll knock off like I'll give him an extra 10% on his fucking numbers then like, give me a fucking break. All you gotta do, do he play baseball when people died of tuberculosis, he played baseball. Like there was a hit song, but at the time

Speaker 11:         00:33:07       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:33:07       and that song was written in the 1890s and everybody thought it was too fucking crazy. What, what is this devil music? God dammit. She, what happens when you add them off the plantation? They get up here. They couldn't even handle it. Bad APP APP. App. APP, APP, App yet [inaudible] he played baseball. That was a hit. Baba Du, Du, Du, Du, Zara de de de, de Beauvoir. Dabu Ba boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. You know, people would just hear it and then sit around wondering when they were ever going to hear it again because they had no device to play it on. Yeah. That idea. Dabu Babu, right. That guy came to town and everybody stood around him and I played, played a fucking piano. You see how they worked out back then? Head, shoulders, knees and toes. Knees and toes. Head, shoulders, knees and toes. Knees and toes. And only white guys. No blacks are Puerto Rican, head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes. Those big, dumb fucking gloves. They looked like little people hands. Give me a fucking break. Not to mention Babe Ruth's. I mean they built a stadium towards his strength. That right field fence. Okay, you can, you can make a cop show.

Speaker 12:         00:34:27       Yeah,

Speaker 10:         00:34:28       with two toddlers and they could do the classic scene where the fucking cop chases the perp down the alley and he gets to the chain link fence and fucking jumps over it. You could, you could fill net with two toddlers with the right field fence in Yankee stadium. The House that Ruth built. Alright, you backed up to catch a fly ball and hit you like mid thigh and you fell into some guy's lap. Right? So anyway, give me a fucking break. All right, from 1930 [inaudible] I'll give it to you. All right? But if you played in the teams, he played in the arts, she played in the 18 hundreds and even into the twenties go fuck yourself. All right. And I feel like every look, every like, um, major sport has their three stooges error. We're one team won a bunch of fucking championships. All right. I love the Boston Celtics, but give me a break. You look at them in the 1960s. I mean, it looks like it looks like a game being played at the y, you know, some Christian rec league. All right. The fucking Canadians want a bunch of Stanley cups when you know, you had first dibs on any guy within a 300 mile fucking radius in a 16 league.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       They had first dibs on anybody in French speaking Quebec. And we, we had, you know, we had first pick, like the best guy from Vermont. Gee, did you go on a run? It's fucking ridiculous. Okay. And then the Green Bay packers who were actually the fucking Yankees of football, you know, they, you know, they were winning titles when the Canton bulldogs, we're still in the fucking legal right. Okay. Wait, am give me, come on.

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       Football was like a genie. I think they play with a pumpkin back then. I mean, give me a fucking break. All those genes, the whole store, the history, the blah, blah. The only ones that I will then I will, I will recognize their championships without a grain of salt. I would say, uh, any of the New York Yankees from like the 1930 [inaudible] for the simple fact they went babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle. That's just, nobody's, nobody's ever going to do that again. You're not going to get the Jordan of your error four times in a fucking roll. All right? You're just not going to do it. So without a doubt, I respect all of that type of shit. But you know, at the inceptions of these fucking leaks when crazy legs, Johnson runs around googly eyes fucking Ulysses and could give me a fucking break. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       He played in the deadbolt ever. Do you don't understand. This guy had more devils who was on the mound? My great grandfather coming out of the bullpen and all freckles [inaudible] was that the song they played when he came in said or Inter Sandman? They weren't facing cut fast balls back then. I'm sure there was guys throwing 90 a hundred miles a fucking hour, but just the, the amount of bombs that were in that fucking league back then. I don't really want anyone to hear it. There was, there's a, there's a guy in the hall of fame. Ooh, good luck in baseball. He kept a section of rope that was used in an actual lynching. Okay. This is how long ago these fucking people played and you're going to sit there and act like in the inception of these fucking leagues.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       You know, I, I look at it obviously in every era there was a Jordan. All right, but just like the techniques and everything, some of the records that were set back then, they didn't have a fucking heavyweight fight. It would go on for like a day. They'd have like a fucking, you know, a 90 round fight. Okay. Now listen, you're getting punched in the fucking head. Well what kind of technique are you using? Phil did bare knuckle fucking the people. I want to hear it. I didn't want to hear all right. The competition now is so much more insane that I, I just think it would immediately, but I guess they would compete at the same level but like just the fact that it's now everybody gets to compete and not to mention like, I mean you could get fucking fathers out there. I try and they try to teach their kid how to

Speaker 10:         00:38:36       throw a curve ball to get, you know, get the family out of the trailer park when the kids like six years old stunting the growth of one of his fucking arms, you know, cause they live in a fucking trailer and somebody's got a growth on their face that they want to have again. They want it removed. Then are those kids going out there? You know, back in the day you went out and you played catch with your little kid. Now you go out there and from day one you try to teach them how to switch it. It's insane. All right, so whatever I'm just saying, so whatever. If you do, you guys think Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player, right? It's so hard to say because all you can go by is this guy's fucking stats. Who you play back. You know, it was probably a guy better than fucking babe Ruth, but he got polio. You know what I mean? Having just a, it's all right. I'm done. I'm done.

Speaker 9:          00:40:03       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:40:03       wow.

Speaker 10:         00:40:09       Hey, what's going on? It's built burn. It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, April 11th, 2011 2011 2011, whatever the fuck I got to say all this goddamn year. Um, how the hell are you Joe Nye some bright eyed and bushy tailed. I'll tell you why. I'm going to tell you why right now. Cause I tried to do the podcast last night. I just, I just can't do it on the days I travel, you know, flew across this country once again from Philly all the way out here. And I'm like, all right, it took an early flight, seven 30 in the fucking morning, I'll land 10 30 la time somehow I'll take a little old man nap in the afternoon. You know the old man take a nap. You know what I mean? Will you lie in the fetal position with your hands in the prayer prayer pose between your fucking milk white thighs. If you me sitting there and you bbds and a tee shirt and black dress socks on, faced in towards the cushion. That's an old man nap.

Speaker 13:         00:41:13       Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:41:13       And then somewhere through what you roll over on your back, start breathing out your fucking mouth and, and I just, you know, that's what old people do and they all guys do you need do it right in the fucking living room. So no one could watch TV, just dominate in the house. Yo man balls just hanging out this side yet. Tighty whities um, that was the plan. That's what I was gonna do. Then you always end up getting cold too. I never understood that. If I lie on the couch awake and I'm not moving, I never get cold. But the second you fall asleep, you get, you get it. You don't Chile. Why did you go Julie? We just leaving. Um, AH, Jesus. I hate myself this week. I'm not even it. I'm not even going to fucking get into this shit. How fucking on funny I was last night on the podcast.

Speaker 10:         00:42:06       I try to record this in for like 20 goddamn minutes. I to the point I have to put up one of the outtakes at the end of this. I've never done that. I want to put up an outtake of me just quitting on a story. Um, I'll put that up at the end, but before I, before, before I get into the rest of the podcast, ladies and gentleman, um, I've got a couple of things I have to hype. Um, like tonight for all you people in Los Angeles, I'm going to be doing a benefit for a all the victims of the earthquake slash tsunami. Um, over there in Japan. I'm going to be doing it at the Catalina jazz club. Um, tonight. [inaudible] it's at six, seven, two, five sunset boulevard. Just east of Highland. All right, I'm going to have the Lincoln everything up on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

Speaker 10:         00:42:55       The show starts at 8:00 PM, uh, it's called cabaret cares songs for Japan. So it's actually comedy and a, and some music. So there'll be some Broadway stars down there. Uh, daisy Egan's the one who actually put it together for those of you who are into Broadway. Uh, she won a Tony Award when she was 11. Alright. Sang at Carnegie Hall and killed it at 11. All right, got got the fucking award from a, who's that? That checked there? That I said that women should still be dressed in like a breakfast, a breakfast at Tiffany's. What the Hell's her name there? Uh, the one that looks like a little fucking a, not a rat. Not a hamster. What's a cute little fucking big brown? I'd wrote it.

Speaker 10:         00:43:53       That's what she looks like to me. She looks like, Oh God. I wish I could have gone on a date with her and said that to her, you know. Ready? She's starting to like me and, and just look across. Are trying to say some pepe le Pew like Romantic Shit, you know, come here, my little brown, I'd wrote it. I fuck you ever notice how fucking racist at is Pepe Le Pew? I never noticed I talk about that on the podcast. Well I don't care if I did get a wing an hour every week. You're not going to fucking repeat yourself sitting in your Goddamn cubicle. How many times you told that fucking joke? Two guys will be doing a book. You know, just waiting for a new employee so you can hit him with the same old fucking stories. How dare you? How dare you question me. You motherfucker in your Goddamn cubicle, Huh?

Speaker 10:         00:44:40       What are you doing? Ah, you hate yourself right now because she ate the whole Cinnabon. Cause you lie to yourself. I'm going to cut it in half and I'm not going to do it. And what happened? You cut it in half and you saw that sugary goodness. Huh? Just fucking come and down in the fucking Baker. TJ's that's on top. Just dripping down the side. And what you went down on it, you went down on it like some core, just got off a bus in a strange city. That's what you did. Now you had your sugar rush, you like, yeah, I'm going to fucking, I'm gonna make it through the whole day. Cinnabon, the poor man's 12 hour energy. Hey, can somebody please explain to that commercial to me when those guys take that 25 hour energy, whatever the fuck it is, they take it and the guy goes, yeah, all right, I'm ready.

Speaker 10:         00:45:25       And then he sits down, puts his feet up on the table and reads a newspaper. I thought it's supposed to make you go work once the deal. Oh God. Am I going to suck on this one toe? You know what? Fuck you guys every once in a while have a bad set. I think I'm going to bond this week. So anyways, getting back to what I was talking about. So I had planned on taking a nap and old man fucking nap by the way, strip it right down to my underwears and sleeping on the couch like a fucking the old man than I am. But uh, the masters, the masters was on and I had to watch it because Rory Macintyre from Ireland look like he was gonna win the damn thing. You know? Plus I'm always rooting for tiger, you know, because I have issues with women.

Speaker 10:         00:46:14       I have such issues with women that I actually think that at their women meetings where they trash guys, they actually have like a little counter on how many tournaments it's been since tiger actually won in. They're trying to sit there, you know, it's a fucking braid. Their Harry muffs just sitting there is the braid their hair, Harry must. Right. And they're just sitting there and going, you know why? You know why he, I think when, because in every good work, every good man [inaudible] woman, I know this saying that shit. So I'm fucking ruining for tiger. Even though I had a bet with Keith Robinson, every year we bet the masters and every year he picks tiger and then I pick a white guy, you know, it's sort of fun with racism and I send them Texas like white power and this is a white man's game and you're not taking over this one. We'll give you, we'll give you football, we'll give you basketball. Your black people actually took over baseball there for a minute. Then they just stopped giving a shit. You know? It's too boring. I don't know what it was. I liked that. When they do those things on, on, on sports shows, we have to get more African Americans. End of the day of a baseball, they don't like it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       You know

Speaker 10:         00:47:40       what the fuck? Why are you going to force a fucking sport that you know what it is, is because baseball sucks as they left. Actually, no, the Latinos saved. What am I a def jam comic? What's with all the race shit this week, Bill? Yeah, but see a white person played baseball about, Fuck God, His jersey. I'll snug up on his nuts and shit. Um, do you guys see a,

Speaker 10:         00:48:08       what's his face? Uh, Manny Ramirez tested positive again. Ah, sucks. Then he just steady fucking skid. Addled I'm retired. I'm going to go to Spain with my dad. I didn't like how palpate barn was giving him shit. I thought that was a conti move. I get it. You're obviously didn't like the guy when he fucking played and your team, but you don't have to be a content. Throw the guy under the bus saying all this shit that these guys are already going to say. It's kind of like this, this asshole here in the uh, one of the, of those guys in the New York Post. You know those guys, they a hours. You are as you one of those guys on around the horn. That show that just makes absolutely no sense. I don't understand that show. I don't understand how the points work. I don't understand why that guy who sounds like somebody imitating somebody stupid, you know, hosts the show is, is always clicking.

Speaker 10:         00:49:05       Why he's in charge of the scoring. I don't understand it. I don't, I don't get it. And it's always like four guys talking at once. And uh, I, like Wally says his name, I add, I've got, I don't get that fucking show. I think this guy's one of those guys on that shelf. So anyways, if you, if you watch the, uh, the masters, which I've watched for the last three years, I went to it last year, two years ago, I watched Kenny Perry. I'm watching this guy just, you know, it looks like a regular guy. I'm like, oh great, he's going to win the masters. And then I watched just the fucking wheels come off the entire last day and the guy completely chokes and I got to tell you something. Golf is the worst game to choke him. You know, if you're a goaltender in the NHL and you let up a bad goal, I mean, how long does that take?

Speaker 10:         00:49:51       You know what? Fuck, in a split second, you let up another bad one. People bull. Yeah, I mean what we have a bad period. They take you out of fucking gay. It's maybe a half hour of a life. That's a long fucking time. You missed the big shot. You call the fucking time out like Chris Weber or whatever. Right. It's fucking over done. You walk off the court. That's it. I guess he gets shit for, it's still bill Buckner ball rolls through his fucking legs in the fan that match wet. All right. How long did that take dude? You choke in golf? I guess I'm talking about the game itself. I'm not talking about the amount of shit that you get afterwards cause that's usually lifelong cause I heard that bill Buckner had to move to like Idaho was some shit. But what I'm saying is going through the agony of the choke is anywhere from a split second up to a button, I don't know, 2025 minutes, but in golf it's hours, hours and hours. It's three hours watching this kid just all over the fucking course and you know what is 21 years old? I thought he handled it tremendously. He handled it tremendously. One point he kind of laughed and shook his head that one hole when he was standing in between a couple of houses. I've never seen houses on a golf course before my life. That's how bad his shot was. It ricocheted off.

Speaker 10:         00:51:11       His ball landed in like a kitty pool. I'm telling you folks, it was off the golf course. Ah, Jesus, I suck this week. Um, so this dish fucking rights, uh, his shirt was stained in the front. Everybody shirt was stained. You playing fucking golf in the sun. Fucking fat. Fuck you. Goddamn show was probably staying when you typed this. Listen to what this guy said. It was staying in the front, untucked in the back. A little boy lost Rory mcilroy trudged up the final holes at Augusta national and Sunday afternoon as if looking for somewhere to cry. His swagger had shriveled up into, or stoop is boyish. Smile became nod lips. And I want to ask some anybody else watch it to anybody. See at any point where he was going to cry, I thought he held his composure. Granted, he played fucking horrific. He definitely maybe, you know, started to panic or whatever.

Speaker 10:         00:52:09       I'm not a golfer. I Dunno what the fuck happens, but he didn't look like he was going to cry. I hate these. I hate these fucking sports writers. You know what I mean? You already have a word count, so you gotta throw in another adjectives in there. He's 21 fucking years old. And then what happens is when something like this happens in sports, then these fat fucks sport writers who sucked in gym class, you know they did. You know they were the kids who got like the bloody nose and playing dodge ball. Then they just start turning up the fucking pressure. You know? That's what sucks about choking those because now everyone's going to be sitting there going like, you know, you had that collapse at the master's, barely had time to reflect that. Even at the end, I thought he'd said it. Well, he says, what's going to, what are you, what are you thinking about right now?

Speaker 10:         00:52:59       And he just said, listen, it's too early. It's too early to reflect. I want to just happen. Talk to me in a couple of days. I thought it was really fucking mature, whatever. So I support the guy. I hope he fucking, when's his God damn thing again? But fuck, I lost 50 bucks cause tiger ended up having a higher score than Rory. I just picked the top white guy. I started watching the second day. So then I bet with Keith and now I owe that son of a bitch. 50 Bucks, you know, kills me is he's just going to blow it on another itchy sweater. All right, let's get into the podcast here for this week. Uh, where the hell am I here? But by hype to thing. Oh, another thing I have to hype. The other thing I have to hike this week as people have been asking me, um, I have a date at the punchline in San Francisco on Monday, May 9th.

Speaker 10:         00:53:46       And people are asking me when the tickets go on sale. They go on sale this Friday, April 15th. All right. That's the deal. Go to the, uh, the punchline, San Francisco website, which of course I don't have that fucking information, but you could Google it, right? Anyways, let's talk about my weekend. I had two awesome shows. Had to have some shows. I did one at the records theater and Towson, Maryland. And, uh, then the next one I did was at the tower, the tower theater in, uh, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Legendary venue I might add. Okay. And you know, I'm all about the history. David Bowlby, uh, recorded a live album, their first tie, Bruce Springsteen got a check for five grand was standing up or after you stood on that stage and performed, um, average white band record, their live album. Uh, the fuck is it called cut the cake, pick up the pieces.

Speaker 10:         00:54:42       I can see your Pussy, lips, whatever the fuck it's called. Dad All was all recorded there. So I got to go down there and become part of that fucking history. And uh, it was awesome, man. I want to thank everybody who showed up both to the Maryland Gig and two, the one out in Philly, um, Maryland Gig was amazing and then Philly just completely took it to a whole nother level. Um, it was just an awesome, awesome crowd. And uh, actually had some lady, some lady came up to me at the end of the show and I had run out of DVDs. I didn't bring enough. And uh, she was all bummed out. She goes, you know, my son was supposed to come tonight but he's on house arrest.

Speaker 10:         00:55:31       Saigon. It's too bad. I ran out of DVD. She's like, that's all he wanted. He just wanted to meet you and get a DVD. So now my liberal side, I'm starting to feel bed and I go, all right, why don't you know, uh, maybe you send me an email, maybe I can send one out to Oma, whatever. Right. And she goes, oh my God, I would really appreciate that. And I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute. What did he do? You know, I don't want to send it out to some fucking pedophile. Some attempted racist, some guy who's a steel and music online. I'm fucking with you. So I guess it turned out some 18 year old kid punched his 11 year old brother. So her son Fuck head that he is not kid. Her son, 18 years old went over and beat the shit out of the 18 year old cause he beat up his fucking 11 year old brother.

Speaker 10:         00:56:17       And because we live in such a pussy time, because that kid basically got his ass kicked for doing what he did. This kid ends up on house arrest. Can you, can you believe that kind of a fucking country. Who Do we live in where the 18 year old older brother of an 11 year old who got beat up by an 18 year old can't then go over and kick the shit out of that 18 year old without sitting in his own fucking house, missing a comedy show. You know? So now I have to mail them a fucking DVD. That's another goddamn branch off a tree in the rainforest. And well, what did that fucking kid learned? The other kid, what did he learn that is, because he's probably gonna have a lawsuit, right? That is profitable. His way of earning income is to walk around and beat up 11 year olds who have older brothers.

Speaker 5:          00:57:11       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:57:11       Oh, I tell you the hypocrisy. Um, so anyways, I was sitting out there in, uh, I did this gig out there and uh, upper Darby, Philadelphia, doesn't that sound nice? Upper Darby, upper class, upper, we're up on a hill. We're looking down on the poor people. Um, that's not what Philly is like in Upper Darby. It was one of the most horrific neighborhoods I've ever driven through. I'd never been like, you know, I don't mind driving through the projects during the day because the people I see out, I'm like, all right, these are just fucking hard work. And people coming off from their jobs. It's when the sun goes down, you know, basically any way you're at, when the sun goes down, that's when the fucking assholes come up. Both in the inner city and out in the suburbs. You know, there's no serial killer walking around the suburbs out in the broad daylight. He comes out at night. This is one of the few neighborhoods during the fucking day. You can see, I can't even explain it. Like, I dunno, go Google some pictures. Upper Darby in Philly, it's, it's unbelievable that Americans have to fucking live this way. I actually will do. My opening joke was after driving through that neighborhood, I was like, what the fuck is New Orleans bitch? And above, you know, in order to look like these, these fucking houses they look like,

Speaker 5:          00:58:29       yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:58:29       You know the end of all in the family when they go and down that horrific street of houses in Queens, that's what it looked like. It looked like a, except they were all rusted out and I swear to God I thought they had like 10 roofs or something.

Speaker 5:          00:58:47       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:58:48       So anyways, long story short, I have a 7:30 AM flight the next fucking day. Oh by the way, the reason why I got lost going over there is because I was using my smart phone and I'm using the little map thing and I swear to God, that fucking thing.

Speaker 5:          00:59:04       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:59:04       I'm going back to maps. The rand McNally, you know what I liked about the rand McNally at no point when I was looking at it, did it shut off? Did it go black? The screen went black and then I had to scroll my thumb down at while. I'm still trying to continue to drive. The whole fucking was horrific. I'm just, I'm, I'm completely, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say we have enough technology. What do you guys think? Am I crazy?

Speaker 10:         00:59:32       Like that three d TV, let me ask you guys, are you re you guys really going to go out and buy those fucking things and then there's going to be the tipping point where more people have them than don't have them. So then eventually I'm not going to be able to see shit on my regular fucking TV. Three d TV is to be, is it, is it not fucking clear enough with the HDTV? Is it not clear enough that I can see the fucking Cartlidge inside the nose of the fucking newscaster mean? They kept saying that when I was watching the masters with layers, they go the masters then three league like I really need to be sitting there Bendon back. Like I'm watching the matrix is the golf ball goes flying over my fucking head. You know your living room outside life is in three d go for a fucking walk. It's a total scam. Think about how much you want it. I want to tell you guys this, right? Just think about this shit. Think about all the shit on three d. All right. Do you want to watch this? Dt need to watch two and a half men in three d like, wow. I feel like I'm sitting on the couch with them. Do you need to watch the news in three d? I'm going to tell you right now, sports in three d is going to suck.

Speaker 10:         01:00:44       It's going to suck. I'm gonna tell you right now it's, it's, it's gonna. I already think what the Hd TV, it's all, it's, it's getting to the point where it's so clear. It's like HD is like clearer than real life. I don't know. It's like, it's like a fucking acid trip. I remember one time I was watching this baseball game with this other comedian.

Speaker 14:         01:01:05       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:01:05       And we were sitting there watching the game when HD TV first came out, we weren't even watching the game. He was pointing at somebody and like the third row, go and look at that guy shirt. Look how fucking orange has shirtless. And it was, it was literally an orange that did not exist in real life. So what happened? Everybody bought those fucking three d, uh, bought the flatscreen TVs. You know, now old people with their little square TV from the greatest generation. They got to go out, buy a flat screen TV that break in there fucking hip as they try to put it up on top of their old fashioned radio where they used to listen to FDA and his fireside chats, right? They finally get the fucking thing up there. The bankers took them their entire retirement and now you can't. You're going to go out and buy three d TVs. It's going to fall down on their fucking old heads and that's going to be yet,

Speaker 10:         01:02:04       please people, please don't buy those three d TVs. It's a fucking scam. What's going to happen with your old flat screen TV? What are you going to do with that? Just going to throw it out. It's going to end up in the ocean is talking about this this weekend. We're going to be able to walk to Europe on, on old flat fucking TVs. You don't need it is what I'm trying to tell you. I've never, I can't remember the last time I fucking prayed that a, uh, that uh, technology was going to bomb the way I have with those, those d fucking TVs. All right. And I don't want to hear any of you fucking can send me emails talking about the discovery channel and how the fucking do from the God damn rainforest frog is going to drip off right into your fucking lap. And if you smoke some weed, man, how fucking cool that's going to be.

Speaker 10:         01:02:50       And then all the Frat Boys, who would've, well, porno porno with three d. What about fucking a real girl? What about that? You know, all right, I'm going to give you pour enough. I will give you porno cause you know, it's going to be great. I can't wait for that fucking sex suit to come up. You know, they're working on that like a full body sex suit is actually scientists working on that, having mature conversations, uh, you know, like not snickering at all talking about these, these fucking, as they're developing like dissections and basically what it's going to be. Do you remember that, that little onesies that Arthur funds are rarely used to wear when he be in his garage working on some fucking 1940s rusted out hunk of Shit. Remember that, that thing that he would wear it kind of dirty version of like those jumpsuits that the caddies were at the masters.

Speaker 10:         01:03:43       You know, of course Brittany would wear one, roll it up and have her titties hanging out of it and talk, you know, saying like, oops, did I just touch your Dick again? Whatever the fuck she used to sing about. Right. Hey, do you know when rolling stone, they had the top one hardest 100 artists of all time and Madonna was like 50 something and I was going to get upset, but I was just like, you know what, how many pop stars can last fucking 30 years? But then I thought there was justice because they had like other famous artists writing, like you know, like Questlove would write the one for prince you two would write the one for like a, you know, fucking rolling stones or whatever. But I thought it was really fitting that Brittany Spears wrote the one from Madonna, although it should have been lady Gaga. She's doing a fucking songs, right? Like fucking word for word. She's doing a mash up without, without Mcdonald's lyrics over at the top. Is that what the fuck she's doing? Anyways? Let me get back to what the fuck I was talking about here, which I can't even remember.

Speaker 14:         01:04:49       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:04:50       The fuck is wrong with my brain this week. What the fuck was I just talking about?

Speaker 14:         01:04:59       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:04:59       Oh Jesus Christ. You know, so you know what? I'm fucking Rory. Whatever the fuck his name is, right McElroy right now. Okay. I had this whole fucking thing when it's the final days of the masters and I'm just limping my way through 18 holes of this fucking podcast. This podcast right now is in between those two little, just like Rory was on the fucking 13th or the 15th fucking Hole, whatever the hell it was. What happened to all fat, tits, Phil Mickelson, I wanted him to win another one. I'll tell you, it killed me that I wasn't there at the masters. If you ever get a fucking chance, you got to go. I went last year, I've been to a super bowl and it's never really bugged me that I didn't go to another one. It bugged me for the first couple of years, but once the game was over and I still had two grand in my pocket and I didn't have to go to a, uh, an airport and stand in line and do that horse shit again and fly home.

Speaker 10:         01:05:51       It's never bugged me. But this one's seriously bugged me that I wasn't there. You got to go once in your life. You've got to go down to Augusta, but I've got to tell you to say it's one in one of the shittiest fucking, uh, it's not even in a shitty neighborhood. It's just like, you know you don't, when they show that when you drive up and you look at the Georgia Pines, whatever the fuck they are, when you drive up to the clubhouse, first of all, as a spectator, you're not allowed to drive up there and you never see it. You're not allowed to walk around that side of it. That's just for the players in the members, but right outside of that like a half a mile away is like a fucking waffle house at Denny's at JC Penney's, just like just that shit. Mcdonald's ace hardware store, the way they shoot that thing is they shoot the masters the same way they shoot like Elvis's house. Like when you look at Elvis's house, it looks like it's just like it's in Savannah, Georgia or something and then you go to Elvis's house and I swear to God there's like an, I hop like right next door and I was like, yeah, that makes sense. That's why he was so fat. He could just walk down his driveway and go get some pigs and blankets and he just go over there. You know.

Speaker 10:         01:07:08       Was Elvis the first fat coke head. You know, they talk about that. Like most people do coke, the they're not, uh, they fucking lose weight or some shit, you know, I dunno. You know something, he got fat too. Before we really had all the preservatives in there. He was just fat on some, what the fuck was he eating? Peanut butter and fucking banana fried sandwiches on his fucking jet. Splitting his jumpsuits. Oh, another jumpsuit bringing it back around again. That's exactly what those, those, those caddies got those jumpsuits a, they all had a mission is the cake. And they could come down on one knee. That's what they should do. Come down on one knee holding out the Cape. Is Somebody fucking Putz for the master's? That would add some excitement, wouldn't it? All right, let's get back to Philly. So anyways, so I got up, I got a 7:30 AM flight.

Speaker 10:         01:07:57       All right. So I'm thinking, all right, that means I gotta get up at fucking five 30 return the rental car and all that horse shit. Why don't I stay at a hotel right next to the airport. So my travel agent gives me the whole list of, uh, of options of where I can stay. So I'm like, yeah, fine, fuck it. All right. I checked them out and one of them is the Sheridan Sheridan, respected name, a very quality hotel. I say I'm going to stay there. And the price reflected that it was a quality hotel. It cost me like, oh, you know, 180 bucks or something like that was a lot of fucking money. So a one 99 something like that, you know, fulfill, he, that's a lot of fucking money considering I was right outside upper Darby.

Speaker 10:         01:08:42       So anyways, here's my travel tip for you. Do not ever stay at the fucking Sheridan at the Philadelphia International Airport. It is a beyond ghetto, Sheridan and I, and it's so fucking ghetto that I, I knew it was a fucked up Sharon before I even went into it. I pulled up and it looked fine. I got out of my car, it looked fine. And as I walked into the place, as I was walking in, these four chicks were coming out and they just look like horse from a reality show. Awful tattoos on their feet. Tidies up and pushed together these cheap ass look stripper shoes. And I went out though. Oh No, not, not, not, not a bad hotel. Please God, please. I start praying to the travel guides. Please, please don't let this be a bad hotel. You know how Mike Way, but you know at first I was like, all right, what, what are these like call girls? So they just get done servicing some fucking married business guy on the road. Is that what they did? But it was like 12 noon. It's like, no, no, no. Call Girls are up at 12 noon. All right. They already wiped fucking washed off. The vaginas hosed them down at like eight in the morning and now they just fell asleep face down in a fucking pile of glitter and they're not going to wake up again to like five in the afternoon. That's how it works. And they wake up, they fucking, you know,

Speaker 10:         01:10:02       I dunno what they do. You know, they put some fucking vitamin E on the, on the ligature marks around their neck from the night before.

Speaker 14:         01:10:13       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:10:15       Do you know, you know what's fucked up about ligature? Nobody ever uses that statement unless somebody's got choked to death. You know? Linkature my know what does never any ligature marks, because you know why? Because these girls who are into that type of shit, if they survive the encounter, they fucking, they were that little, uh, that little ass got the next day around their neck. You know, the hoary one, a choker. That's what they were to cover it up. You have to have a girl wants you to do that once you to choke her. I remember one time I was with this girl, right, and she a shoe, all this type of shit. Do you want me to slap her in the face and all this, all this crazy shit that, uh, there are all these fucking women's shows they never address. They never addressed the amount of fucking women that liked that. They like it rough. It's fucking insane, unless I just keep picking the same kinds of fucking women, but it's ridiculous the amount of fucking broads that I've gone out with, you know,

Speaker 15:         01:11:14       fucking women's Lib, fucking Blah, blah, blah. My career comes first. If we get married, I'm not taking your last name, Yadda Yadda, fucking Yada, right? Then you get them in, you know, the fucking all pro women. There's pro women that, and I'm making my own money and fucking, you know, in a couple of other fucking lyrics from some stupid Beyonce song, right? All at fucking horse shit. You're going to respect me eyeball to eyeball, the images of women on TV, all that fucking horse shit. And then you get them back to your place and lo and behold, they have a rape fantasy, you know, am I the only guy by the only fucking guy. So anyways, so I was seeing this fucking broad, right? And she's going to fucking college. She's getting her Mba and all that type of shit. So this is the first girl she ever asked me. She told me that she wanted, uh, me to choker and I was like, no, I'm not doing that.

Speaker 14:         01:12:11       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:12:11       And she's like, why not? And I said, well, cause I'm not fucking gonna call the cops. Like how am I going to talk my way out of that if you fucking pass out and I got my fingerprints around you, God damn neck and your naked body. I mean that just sounds like one of those fucking things from, even if you come around, I'm going to have some sort of fucking assault charge and then you're going to feel guilty because everybody's going to know because the cops are there. So then you just going to be like, yeah, I didn't want him to do it. So you can somehow skip away with your fucking integrity. I'm not doing it.

Speaker 15:         01:12:46       Of course I did. Of course they did. Eventually. But there's a technique I can't actually, you gotta you gotta be, you gotta make sure you're up a little higher and underneath and you gotta you gotta do it and then not be doing it, do it. And then not doing it. Don't just fucking grab it. Like you don't grab their next like fucking David Tyree in the helmet. Catch you. Don't, you don't want to do that cause you're going, you're going to choke him out. Uh, you know, unless you're really good at CPI, how the fuck fucked it ended up talking about that shit. That's it really. You know something? I'm going to talk about that in my act. Jesus said I'll bring this psychos out. Um,

Speaker 10:         01:13:23       I'm going to talk about that. My Ex, you just heard a fucking preview of a joke. I really want to bring that up. The amount of fucking women they got that thing right. They're all independent and that type of thing. And then you get him in the bedroom like you want it. They want you to get kicked the shit out of him. But they got that, does that, that fucking line. They want to feel the man's power but still feel like safe.

Speaker 14:         01:13:43       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:13:43       Overpower me. But like do it in like a nice way, but not nice, but nice. Do you know what I made? I know exactly what you mean. You filthy fucking whore.

Speaker 15:         01:13:56       Uh, all right, I have to get up. I gotta get off this subject. This is just going to get too freaky to be talking about this by myself.

Speaker 10:         01:14:04       Uh, this is the choke 'em out podcast, everybody. So anyway, so I see these fucking, just these, these whores father didn't stick, you know, George Foreman Grill, Eaton fucking just, just never had a chance for girls just coming out. Just never had a fucking chance. And you know, just dressed like fucking trucks, doc fucking whores. And the sad thing is, is they think they look good and they don't even realize the vibe that they're putting out. They don't know any better. They don't fucking know any better. All right? There was a rusted out car in their front yard that day. They were born and they never had a fucking chance. You know,

Speaker 10:         01:14:49       the only fucking male voice that was in their household when they was growing up was the Billy Best that the deaf, they're fucking dad left behind. You know what I mean? Just, they just never had a fucking chance. So that was my first red flag and I was gone out. God, maybe, maybe they use some sky miles. Is that how they got in here? And I just walked in the second I walked in, I, I just, I can just tell the caliber of human being that was in there straight across the board here. Alright. The caliber a white person, the caliber of black person, the caliber of fucking male, female gps can tell. You know what I mean?

Speaker 14:         01:15:27       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:15:27       Saw some black dude, you know, when they get their hair braided but they don't have enough money to fucking get it braided enough so they got all those little hairs sticking out of it, you know, cause you can't see the scalp in between the braids, you know, it's not looking fucking right. It's just not looking right. The fucking white dude with the chief Anderson little suit, the fucking creased up Brown loafers with this gold lamay horseshit on the front of it. You know, shoes look like they cost 11 bucks and I'm just going on now. Ah, God least let the fucking room be cleaned, you know? So I check in the lady behind the counter. She was nice enough, you know, I don't know how she ended up at this fucking Sharon and maybe she has stepped out of line at the big a stockholders meeting.

Speaker 10:         01:16:09       This is, this is there still Sheridan side barrier. So then I go up to my room and uh, it's weird. It had like one of the, it almost looks like a little house. She come walking in, there's a door and right next to it there's this big window for some stupid fucking reason. If I want to overlook half the elevators in the fucking poor excuse for a pool that they had. So the blinds were down, right. So I open it up and it's a sweet, I'm like Nice. It was a nice room. It wasn't bad at all. So I'm in there for like five fucking minutes and I hear this knock on the door, right guy fucking knocks on the door. He was covered in foam. So that's what it sounded like. And I opened the door and there's a guy standing there with his giant coffee table and he goes, and he's trying to walk in with this giant cocktail.

Speaker 10:         01:16:56       I'm like, Whoa, whoa. I go, you got the wrong room. I didn't order a table. He goes, not, oh, this, this tables is your, your, your room's missing a table like it is. They go, yeah, yeah. The last people who are here broke the other table. I was like, Jesus Christ. What? Did they have? Like a party or something? Anyway, yeah. I thought he was going to say no. He went like, yeah, and I go, well, they fucking fumigate the place now. I think everything's been just on. I'm, you know, I'm laying in fucking angel dust and cocaine and Shit, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:17:27       Yeah,

Speaker 10:         01:17:27       yeah. It keeps getting worse. Then I'm sitting there for another couple minutes and then I just hear this lady telling this story, right? Yeah. They did this mother fucker fucking track. Tell me that mother fucker can't come off it. I said, mother Fucker, mother fucker with a motherfucker, and I'm like, is that it leads? Is it at least a guest? Is it at least the guests and I fucking open the blinds to my window and she's one of the people cleaning the rooms.

Speaker 5:          01:17:55       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:17:56       Just cursing up a fucking storm loud as fucking hell. Like all broke Pete, Bro. People are the loudest fucking people because they live near the freeways. They live near the subway. They used to shouting over shits and she's out there. This mother fucker trying to tell me what time it is baby. Right. And just screaming

Speaker 10:         01:18:18       and you know how much I curse. Okay. I was offended and you know how much I curse? I was just like, Jesus Christ, can you please, I might have kids someday. Can you please stop cursing like that? But I didn't say shit cause I, I mean at that point I knew what was gonna happen. I would've been like, oh, I just would've been like, excuse me, could you do me a favor? Could you use now? Might've, well, why don't you Maggio business? Ain't nobody talking to you baby. Right. I didn't want to go through that whole fucking thing at her screaming at me. Plus she was so fucking big, she probably could've just choke, slammed me and we would have had to have a new fucking table in my room, third fucking table that week. And I'm a conservationalist is that the right word? So I'm like, all right, fuck it.

Speaker 10:         01:18:59       Whatever. So I don't say ship. So then I go out to go do my show and of course I'm using my stupid smart phone. I get lost. I'm driving through upper Darby and it's just like, well, you know, a fucking, the white guy driving through there looking down at his phone and yeah, I can't see it. Can't stay the same where I am. You know, I did everything but roll down the window. Excuse me, hustlers. Could you just stop hustling for a second? I could just wondering if you could directly and the direction of this theater that I'm performing in tonight. You know, horrific. So, uh, I was so fucking mad. I really got to get my temper together. I was so fucking mad. I could feel myself when my screen, every time I had to go to make a turn, I'm looking down at my map and the fucking phone would go black, you know, to save the battery.

Speaker 10:         01:19:46       And it was always what I needed to make a decision. Then I would miss a turn and it got to the point I was squeezing my phone and I knew what I was, I was going to take it and I was just going to smash it down on the uh, whatever you call that, the, the, the fucking thing that you're not a gear shift or I guess it is geared, the thing, you put it in gear, it's not a stick. You know what the Fuck I'm saying? I was just going to smash the screen on that and I knew that, that I, I had my temporary control enough that I knew I couldn't do that shit. So what I did was I just started screaming over and over again, fuck you at my phone. I was yelling, fuck you at my, in my car yelling, fuck. You would've found blow. That's what my voice is all scratchy right now. Not because I had, I screamed for two shows is because I was screaming at my cell phone. So anyways, I finally ended up getting there. I ended up doing the show. It's fucking phenomenal. And whenever, whenever I, I do a show at a place like that.

Speaker 4:          01:20:48       MMM.

Speaker 10:         01:20:49       You know, there's always some guy's been working the theater for like 2030 years and I always walk up to the guy, go, you don't have to say any names, just tell me some stories. And this guy was telling stories about, you know, hanging out with motley Crue back during the hair metal days and going out to strip clubs. And he said he was there when guns and roses came through on the appetite for destruction tour. He said afterwards he was standing in their tour bus and they're looking out their windshield at a sea of groupies. And at 1.1 member, I'm not gonna name names, looked out and said, what's up with those two? And the guy said, oh, that, that's actually, believe it or not, those aren't sisters. That's a mother. And a daughter and I guess they were really hot and the dude was like, oh yeah, bring them on the bus.

Speaker 10:         01:21:39       Do it in my next life. I want to be a fucking musician. Just to have the opportunity to have that level of groupie. Ugh, just fucking unreal. So anyways, so I drove to upper Darby. He was just unbelievably depressing that people have to live that way. Fellow Americans have to live that way and that we're always sitting here fucking acting like we give a shit about other countries and we need to help out. We don't. All right, well we, I mean you give a shit or I give a shit, but our government doesn't. We're working our way in there to help them out. Air quotes so we can take their natural resources. All right. That's how it is. That's what the fuck is really going on. If you ever wondered why, all right, they don't give a fuck about upper Darby, new New Orleans or whatever.

Speaker 10:         01:22:24       Fuck it. All those blue collar towns that are failing out there in Ohio, they don't give a shit about him cause they already own them. So if there's any oil to be had, they can just go in and suck it out of the ground. Yeah. Did that make any fucking sense? So anyway, so I go back to my ghetto ass fucking Sheridan. All right. I come walking in there and uh, and at this point, it's one in the morning. Now, if it was one in the morning and I was at a nice hotel, that'd be the usual thing. There would be some people hanging down at the bar, you know, drinking, getting ready to cheat on their spouses. Dress nicely though. All right. But because was a ghetto fucking Sharon and I went down there and most of the people in the lobby, we're children running around screaming like one in the morning, kids just running around. I felt like I was in fucking Atlantic city. You know, those gamblers degenerate gamblers, they don't fucking handle their kids. Right. Right. So just as see a fucking children. I mean, I was waiting for fucking, you know,

Speaker 12:         01:23:28       yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:23:29       Yoga was missing with somebody there, you know, gathering them like you could, you could have had a children's choir. That's how many fucking kids were there. So I could go up the elevator and I, and I get out, get out of the elevator and I walked back up to my little, you know, I told you the front of the room looked like a house and there was a door. And then there's the window. And as I'm looking, I'm at the doors. I'm looking down to take out my hotel key. I looked down and on the window sill is a three quarter eaten chicken wings sitting on the fucking window sill. I got pictures to prove it. They're all going to be up on the m m m m podcast.com. Whatever the fuck it is. Is that the name of the website? I know the name of the fucking website.

Speaker 10:         01:24:13       The Hell's wrong with me? Yeah, the MM. The MM podcast.com. Uh, if you go up there, I'll have all these pictures, the pictures of, uh, the tower theater and all that. I didn't take any pictures when I was driving through upper Darby could for obvious fucking reasons. I didn't want to be, you know, I just, I would not want to be taking pictures down there cause people either think you're a cop or you're just documenting their level of poverty, which would be Fuckin and knowing to me if I was in that situation. So anyways, with that, that was my, Oh and then the next morning I woke up and uh, I dropped my car off at budget. It was fucking hilarious. One of these hilarious racial moments here is I go to get on the bus, the bus drivers, black five white guys get on it. He asked us where we're going, I go USA or this guy says this, so blah, blah blah.

Speaker 10:         01:24:59       So we're driving in that and he's listening to this preacher because it's Sunday morning and the guy, you know, he's talking about, you know, people need to be into Jesus and blah, blah, blah, all this, you know, regular Jesus Shit. Right? But then all of a sudden he starts talking about Obama and around he's just starts kind of trashing white people just go, oh, we should be given thanks. Did Jesus, that a strong black man is president. It's not afraid to stand up to the white supremacy. We run it in this country and he's got it cranked and I'm sitting there fucking and all I did just cause I wanted to have the laugh. I just turned around and looked at all the other four white guys and there everybody's just sort of sitting down and looking at that wingtips like rally. What exactly is the call here?

Speaker 10:         01:25:47       What can we say something, you know, excuse me, we're not all white supremacy. You know, like what exactly is the proper response to that? Because I thought it was, I dunno, I, I actually thought it was fucking hilarious. I wish I could remember what the guy's saying. Ah, Jesus. Now I'm fucking bomb. And again on this fucking podcast. All right, let's, let's get through the rest of the, uh, what am I going to do? And I gotta do some, Oh, hey, wait a minute. Fucking NHL playoffs are coming up. Everybody. Are you excited? Are you like me? Do you like watching hockey Bruins? Canadians? Once again, we're playing those fucking cops up there with all their championships. Do you know the more I read about the history of the NHL, the less impressed with the Montreal Canadiens? I am. I mean I used to kind of give him shit cause I'm like, dude, you dominated a 16 league and they didn't even dominate the 16 league.

Speaker 10:         01:26:38       It's like them and Toronto. Montreal and Toronto basically had the same amount of cups right through the early sixties. I, Montreal was ahead but not by much. Um, and then I found out later that the Canadian teams had, but we know I couldn't give them shakers. A Bruins were there too. So it's like, well why didn't you guys do it? And I found out one of the main fucking reasons is, is the way the league was set up, any French born Canadian player, the Canadian teams had first dibs on those guys. That's why they got all the fucking great guys. So it's like Toronto and Montreal would just like the Yankees and red sox fucking buying up everything. I don't respect them. I don't respect those championships. What do you think about that? Montreal? Um, and then what happened? All of a sudden you didn't have first fucking a choice, right?

Speaker 10:         01:27:34       And now, look, now you don't go on a run anymore. You want it 93 one in 86 and that's it. And don't even talk to me about the seventies. Okay. I don't want even fucking hear it because that was still the fallout of the old, the old system. You had to give those, those expansion six teams a chance to get on their feet. And once they did, that was the end of you guys. So I'm not fucking impressed. So fuck you and all your fucking cops here come the Bruins and you know what? Keep your fucking head up or we're going to slam you into that. Turnbuckle whatever the fuck they call it again, that son of a bitch up, they're fake. And his father cause the worst concussion ever. Three days later, he's at the movies. He's at the movies. All right, I'm just fucking with you.

Speaker 10:         01:28:15       Okay. Uh, Bruins Canadians going to be an awesome series and a carry prices playing great. So it should be, uh, should be phenomenal. I don't think the Bruins are gonna win the Stanley Cup. I just don't think we have enough guys. And I just think that despite the fact that we have two great goaltenders, I just think that there's a lot of goaltenders playing great. Kerry prices playing great. A Henrik Lundqvist is playing tremendous. Uh, who else? Who else is playing good out there? Oh, you got, you've got what's his face up there and buy? Can't ever remember the fucking name. Who plays, who plays goalie up there in Buffalo? Bill Murray. Is that what it is now? We call him Bill Murray. Bill Murray. And then you got fucking Roberta Lou Longo and his cousin, uh, Theo flurries third cousin who plays out there and fucking Pittsburgh. I'm the worst. I can when I, whenever I have to remember a name, I can't remember her fucking name. So whatever. I think it's good. I think it's going to be a think it's going to be great. I just don't see it. I think I will be really happy if we can actually make it to the eastern conference finals.

Speaker 4:          01:29:16       You know,

Speaker 10:         01:29:18       that's my thing. This is, you know what, Hey, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm beaten down as a fan. As long as we don't go up three games to none and then lose four in a row. Again, I'm going to consider this year of victory, but I do not on any level want to lose to the hated fucking habs. Um, and I'm fucking with you a bunch of cups, but not really. Okay. Let's get onto advice this week. Everybody. All right. Hey Bill, I always feel like you give great advice. Well, thank you. So I thought maybe you could give me some on this situation. I was in a local shop a few weeks ago and there was a little hottie work in there. Um, I had seen her there once before and both times she really caught my attention. I had the urge to ask her out while I was there, but I was too busy be enough. And I did. And I did not say anything to her other than some idle nonsense about sunglasses. I was looking at, oh, that's the worst. Uh, the little bit we did talk though, she seemed really cool and really nice. My advices. How can slash should I ask her out without looking like,

Speaker 4:          01:30:19       mmm.

Speaker 10:         01:30:20       Coming off like a creeper, a douchebag. I'm a good looking guy, have a great career as an attorney. But when it comes to ladies, I can be shy. Sometimes seeing is that, you know, that's a very strong thing that you're able to admit that. But every guy just went, ah, I wasn't mad at you fucking fag go up and say something to her. That's, that's how guys handle. We just beat it out of each other. Okay. We said, watch, I'm trying to work on,

Speaker 4:          01:30:43       yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:30:44       Leah says, every once in a while you see a girl that blows you away. And uh, this time I wanted to do something about it.

Speaker 4:          01:30:51       Uh, all right.

Speaker 10:         01:30:53       All right, dude. This is what you gotta do. You gotta, you gotta get, you've gotta work on your self esteem. Okay? You know, you're a good looking guy and you have a great career. Believe it or not, that's game set and match. Do you know the amount of fucking not even good looking guys who have a shit job and they are just scumbags, but they're assholes who are out there fucking crushing it every God damn weekend cause you just had the balls to walk up and talk to these women. You know, this is what you gotta do. You actually know what you gotta do. He said you can be shy sometimes, but you're saying you're working on it. So there you go. Just keep working. It looked dude, she probably light. If you're a good looking guy and your fucking attorney, he actually said something here. I'm hoping to see you. What Caroline's in May if I have my dick had friends can get this shit together if they can't. Maybe with your stellar advice, I can even bring this hardy to the show. Why don't you just do that?

Speaker 10:         01:31:48       Go in there and make her laugh. Joke around with her on anything and just, just fucking lay it on the line. Listen, I'm really attracted to you. I think you beautiful. I ever the fuck you want to say it and just say, you know, I think it's always good if you have somewhere that you're going, just say, I'm going to this comedy show I love, you know, I'm really into this standup comedian. I have an extra ticket which you'd like to go to. Women like going to stuff, you know, gives him an excuse to get dressed up. It gives them an excuse to not feel fucking guilty when they're blowing you later cause they actually went to some sort of ball or some shit, you know? Oh God. Yeah. Even with advice them off for this week, but the essence of it is there. All right.

Speaker 10:         01:32:27       You already talked to her. Just go in there again. You're not going to come off like a creep. I actually think that it's easier to pick somebody up and get that number. At least back in the day. I have no game left anymore cause I've been in a relationship too long. But I always found that it was easier for me to get a girl's phone number on the a at the fucking Jim. Jim's a little bit harder, but like I do it on the ice to get it on the subway. Oddly enough, I had a better chance there than I did in some meat market bar because I, I was never good when females had their guards up when they knew what play I was running. Some guys can do that. They like the old packers. Like everybody knew the packer sweep was coming and they, Forrest Gregg still fucking ran over here.

Speaker 10:         01:33:12       And some guys are like that. Even when women know they got there, they're fucking guard up and they know what the fuck they're doing. They could still plow through it. They run over, the guys just run right over those girls like Forrest Gregg and next thing you know, they're laying on their backs with their legs up in the air and they get the Dick. I was never that guy. I was, I snuck up on you. I waited for something stupid to happen that I could comment on. And then I get the girl laughing. And then when her fuck her defenses were down, I'd uh, I'd wrestle her cell phone up from per fingers. No, I would have, I'd somehow get her number. So what I would do is I would just go in there and, uh, I'll just keep reexplaining this 20 fucking times, do get tickets to my show.

Speaker 10:         01:33:51       Right. Look at me, I'll make a little money out of this advice. So now you've got, you've got somewhere that you got to take her, take her rod, you know, a little thinner. The skit comedy shows, she's already fucking laughing halfway through my Aqi do the old, you're laughing your ass off. Don't try to put your arm around his shoulder. That's old school right. You put it right on a fucking thigh, you know, then you sorta start creeping up there with your fingers, you know, like just sorta thinking about something going pinky ring, Middle Index. He just sort of work your way up like an inch worm. And next thing you know, if you're, if you're, if your fingers are Nimble enough, you know, you stretch out your picky, it's Kinda rubbing right on her clit there.

Speaker 12:         01:34:27       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:34:29       And then you get made fun of me cause you guys are fucking walking out during my closing bit to go bang at the fucking w around the corner to it's right there. It's a lay up to fucking lay up. All right, next one. Hey Bill, huge fan of the podcast and all your stand up and have made all my friends big fans of yours as well. I really enjoy the relationship. Advice for Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All right. People ask me is starting to address the fact that I've never been married. Why am I taking your fucking ex advice? Right? Here's my situation. I'm 29 recently from medical school after a good number of years honing my boning skills in the free market, I'm ready to calm down and have a serious girlfriend. Ironically. Um, the girl that I'm dating and wanting to get serious with was actually my college girlfriend and first love.

Speaker 10:         01:35:13       We dated throughout college but broke up before attending different medical schools. During our years together. I cheated a lot, but to my knowledge never got caught. A big part of the reason I was so promiscuous, besides being your typical piece of shit, cocky asshole guy full of tests testosterone was because she was very sexually inhibited, no blowjobs the routine conventional positions sex about once every other day and that just wasn't cutting it for me. Now, when every other key now in every other category, she was amazing fun to hang out with, but still lady like carrying respectable, educated, fashionable and extremely beautiful. So like I said before, we broke up for about five years and our back dating again and the sex is exactly the same now, while I'm grateful that some guy didn't completely smarter out during our breakup, I did explain it did expect some sort of sexual maturation, um, blow jobs remain few and far between and pretty subpar.

Speaker 10:         01:36:14       Even for a black chick. This guy's black, by the way, before you think this is something fucked up. Um, what makes it even more difficult this time around is after banging my fair share of broads in our off season, uh, my sexual prowess has grown significantly. It's hard because I really want to be faithful this time around and take the relationship more seriously, but I fear I'm not going to be sexually satisfied. My grace fear is ending up like one of my father's friends who I always hear complaining about how shitty their sex lives have become after marriage. Um, how I should have had all my fun now and Blah, blah, blah, stereotypical castrated, Merryman background noise. Uh, fuck that extra sad shit. I'm not getting married unless I know my wife is going to be a lady in the streets in a freak in the sheets.

Speaker 10:         01:37:02       How do you like that old African American mantra? Uh, my question is how serious should I take this problem? Should I be patient and hope that I can liberate her sexually or should I bail and keep searching for a god-fearing dinner? Cooking super freak if you don't mind asking. Uh Oh, if you don't mind asking Nia as well. I'd like to hear what the sister has to say. Oh Shit. I should have read that to her by the way. I'm also black. So when you get to, is it racist, racist, racist? No, I'm allowed to say sisters. Uh, all right. Um, you know what? I really wish I read that part of what I had her in here, but she's not around today. Um, what should you do? All right. Number one, don't cheat on her. Uh, well you should do is you should, you should communicate this tour. Uh, obviously not the way you just said it to,

Speaker 15:         01:37:57       um,

Speaker 15:         01:37:59       oh Jesus. This is, this is tough. I, I'd have to ask you some questions. Let me ask you this. Do you feel she has the potential? That's, that's what that would be. My number one thing is, ah, this is how I would do it. All right. Fuck this. All right. Now and now I'm back on track. This is what I would do. First thing I would do is I would, I would see if she has the potential. All right. If she's a good kisser, if she has a good touch, if when you're banging her, you don't feel like you're fucking riding in a, God did the back of a delivery truck.

Speaker 15:         01:38:36       The rhythms there. She has is she has the basic tools. Alright. Cause some people, they just don't, they, they're not blessed with the touch then. Not Good. Kissers you know, and a lot of females, not a lot, but you know enough are, that's another thing they never bring up. They always talk about how guys don't know shit in bed and you just blah blah blah blah. But there's a lot of women out there who they don't know shit either. Not saying that bad or whatever, but in some of them just, I just never going to be good. So if you feel she has the potential then, then there's hope. So what you have to do is you have to basically what I used to tell my friends, we used to joke around, just say you got to tap into her inner whore. All right? And the, there's a couple of ways to do it.

Speaker 15:         01:39:23       One of them. And it's very delicate dude. It's like one of those fucking action movies where you'd sit in there trying to clip the right fucking wire is, it's, you know, eight seconds left. Um, there's a couple ways you go about it. Uh, one of the ways is, well first of all, this does a couple of rules. One, as she's trying to open up with you sexually or whatever, don't ever judge anything that she wants to, to uh, try and don't ever make fun of anything that she said. It bet if she says some dumb shit, which she's probably going to say, cause you sound like you're way more experienced if she's trying to talk dirty for the first fucking time and she says some dumb shit, do not laugh. Simply turn her around and doggy style and then you get your laugh up.

Speaker 13:         01:40:15       All right,

Speaker 15:         01:40:19       you got to do the quote. But don't ever do that. That is like someone is never more vulnerable than in that specialty of female. You can't, you can't do that. And then what she I would, I would do is I would just basically figure out what she's into, try to figure out what, what some of her fantasies are. All right. So that that's how I would start at, find out what some of her fantasies are. And you start getting her down that road. And then as you're going down that road and you're not judging her and you're not making fun of any, you just supportive as she goes down that fucking road. Um, then she'll gain confidence and then Dan, hopefully that'll happen. And one of the ways to kind of lead her down the road is try to tell her some of the shit that you're into that you've never done with her.

Speaker 15:         01:41:02       Then I'll go all the way down to the road. You know, your five years of fucking horrific shit. You did just always be a couple of paces out in front of whatever sexual shit that she admitted that she wanted to do. So that way her shit doesn't seem as freaky because it's a couple of steps behind you, but you don't completely freak or the fuck out by, you know, talking about some German porn shit. All right, so that, that's what, uh, that's what I would do. All right. And that's what I have been doing throughout the years. Nia. Look who just walked in. Somebody actually asked your advice because he will working out. Do you want to do this? Okay. All right. You know, what do I have? I don't have my other microphone, so we actually have to be over here and let me ask you this shit real quickly.

Speaker 15:         01:41:50       I'll give you the basic overview. All right. There was a guy, right? He sees this girl, they like each other. The heisted, the college sweethearts, everything about her. Um, was, was great. They have fun too. She's needs a little under the weather here. All right. Are fucking allergies are kicking up. Let me hear your voice. Say Hello. Hello. Okay. And you worked out what? A fucking trooper. All right. Real quick. So everything hanging out, they'd laugh at each, at each other's jokes. The whole shit was perfect, but then they went to different medical schools. All right? So they broke up for a while. And during the, you know, the five years, I guess this guy cheated a lot when he was with her. And now five years have gone by, he got his free cow. Uh, if you saw the look of disgust on her face, he did all this shit.

Speaker 15:         01:42:37       So now he's back together with her. All right. And he was kind of hoping like it's a sex was kind of lame, like when he was with her missionary position. Very like if you like, if you're gonna make like a, like a high school video on how to have sex, the mail takes out his penis. What aroused? Like they were having that kind of sex and no blow jobs whatsoever. So now he's gotten back together with there. He wants to be serious. He's gotten all these, hopefully all his bullshit out and now he's back with their in the sex is basically the same. Now there's a couple of blow jobs. So he's wondering how does he get her to tap into her inner whore? Should we pursue said he pursue this relationship? Like how, okay. How does a guy do that? Like how, like I said, basically how I do it. Oh, she's already saying, give me the mic. All right, go ahead. Uh, well first of all, it just because you enjoy sex in different ways. Does it make you a horse so she doesn't have to tap into our inner whore? Just more, uh, freedom sexually? Has he tried to talk to you? You don't need to clarify it. Okay. I'm not saying she's a horror. We understand this. Okay. I felt the need to clarify. Did he try to want to put your fists in the air for women right now?

Speaker 10:         01:43:52       Okay. Uh, did he try to talk to her about this before and she just ignored it? I don't think he's talked to her about it yet. So it's, you know, it's the first step is that he's got to talk to her. That's what I said. Look at that. Why don't we switch it up a little bit and I wonder why she didn't give him blow jobs. Maybe she just doesn't like giving blood. Maybe she doesn't know how, but it can be fun to explore together. So he should, yeah, you should ask her about it. Just say, you know, what's the worst is when women say they can't do it cause they have TMJ. And it's like, what? They don't like to do it. Some people don't like to do it, you know, it's not, it's not that great for the other person, but it's like, some people don't like it.

Speaker 10:         01:44:29       Some guys don't like to go down and girls, some girls don't like to go down and guys, it's just a preference thing. Okay. All right. So you basically said what? I said, I thought you would've come in here with some shorter that make you feel bad. No, but I just see, I thought I would be coming at it in a different, more rational, sensitive way. But she said the same thing, Huh? Yeah. But not as sensitively. I said all the Horse Shit. Yeah. You know. All right. Yeah, that's, I don't know what I thought it was going to continue. I don't mean it like that. I just said in a mean way. Can we come over here and get a hug? Get a hug. I'm coming towards the end of the, uh, the podcast. All right. All right. There you go. Now get outta here. Cause you've been, you've been, you've been more than helpful.

Speaker 10:         01:45:10       All right. She just gave me the finger. Now you know what it is, and yet whenever you're on the podcast and then the podcast segment ends. I don't know how to smoothly transition you out of here because we don't go to commercial. Why don't I just go ladies and gentlemen, Nia, Nia, everybody. Thank you so much, Nia. See you next time. See you next time. You were great. And now what the fuck just happened to Mike? I hate computers. It just signed me off and I was on a nice little fucking roll here and now I can't. I can't get back into my, my, my fucking,

Speaker 5:          01:45:48       okay.

Speaker 10:         01:45:48       How is this easier? People I want, I want people to, now I have to go into my fucking, my stupid apple works. All right. Here I am. Fucking all right. I'm going to read one more of these and that's going to be the podcast for this week. All right. Uh, hey bill, I need an outside perspective. My wife left me a year and a half ago to go blow college guys and spend her newly raised salary on clothes and purses. Not Kidding. That's what she did. After nine years and two kids, I found out that she had two short affairs after each kid was born, then left me with our five month old baby and two year old I had been raising without her. Anyways, Jesus, Oh gee, I'm a year later, she finally started trying to share custody. She didn't have her hit her half of daycare. I'm sorry. People every once in a while I go back to my bed reading habits.

Speaker 10:         01:46:43       Let me just take a breath here and step back, focus. All right. A year later, she finally started trying to custody. Okay. So after she's gone up, she left him with two kids to go blow college guys and uh, spend all her money. She just got on our newly higher salary. I'm a year later, she finally started trying to share custody. She didn't have her half of daycare, um, bill for a few months, even though she doubles my income. So I told her she could pay me back. Now the conch gets or tax return, it tells me to fuck off. She's not repaying me. She's going to get a car to replace the one she totaled in a Dui. Jesus, where did you meet this winter? I'm pissed off and can't blast or in the job. So what do I do? I'm thinking of hiring a crackhead to spray paint deadbeat on her fucking car from one asshole to another. Thanks bill. The podcast and all three cds of helped me through a lot of tough shit by laughing off the retarded shit that this court does.

Speaker 4:          01:47:42       MMM.

Speaker 10:         01:47:43       All right dude. Uh, yeah. You, you picked a winner here. This is like, this is one of these ones that you should ask Dr drew about. Um, who's amazing and he would hit his half court shot and tell you exactly what's going on. This, there's something going on with her where she has affairs right after she has kids. I don't know what that is, but that's triggering something inside of our, um, I dunno if she gets freaked out with the level of responsibility and she wants to, I dunno. Do a bunch get, get, go. So her oats in a female fucking way. Phil Might, I dunno. You know, some, sometimes women have babies and then they had that postpartum depression. She has some sort of postpartum like you know, hedonism that she just goes out and she just turns into the fuck fest 2011 so

Speaker 10:         01:48:37       what you have there, do you have damaged goods? There's no way you can ever fucking trust her again. You got two kids. So, um, don't do anything to her. All right. This is like in sports when when somebody comes up and slashes, Yah, the ref never sees it, but when you retaliate, you always end up getting the fucking five minute major. This is what's going to happen. She's going to do all this dumb shit. You're going to hire people to do stuff or I know you're not going to literally do that, but you can try to exact some sort of revenge and I dunno if the decent person always seems to get caught. So I would avoid doing that.

Speaker 4:          01:49:13       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:49:13       This is how you get your revenge is I, I would just focus on being a great dad for those two kids. In all honesty. I know that's a ton of work. And it's easy for me to say when I don't have any kids and I never ever bad mouth their mother to them. Never do that. You know, have a buddy of yours where you can just vent and just talk about what a crunchy is as you're punching the bar, but never do it in front of your kids. Cause that's still their mother. Eventually they'll figure out what an irresponsible horse she is and there's going to be, that's going to be your great payback is in that moment. Not only are they going to realize what an irresponsible whore their mother is, is they're going to realize what a great dad they have and a, which is obviously going to be priceless.

Speaker 10:         01:50:07       Um, and in the meantime I would ask myself is if this, this, this lady, if this is the kind of person, have you met a girl like this a number of times is it's just bad luck or do like every woman, every woman that you've dated is like this. Because if that is the case, there's something about these kinds of women that you're attracted to. And as I've use that analogy, you keep fishing in the same poisoned pond. Uh, I think because you got two kids that you want to go out and go meet a winner, I go out to that debt shit where you're going to meet a decent girl, go out, go take a cooking class. I just gave are near for birthday a fucking almost a goddamn year ago. She finally got around to it, a couple of gourmet cooking classes and she went there and it's kind of like a little scene, you know, people bring wine in your cooking, there's all that fucking people, a taste and shit.

Speaker 10:         01:50:57       All the senses of go in that pussy getting wet in the room. You go in there, you fucking knock a couple out or whatever. Join a softball league. I don't know what all those, a lot of boozing was softball, you know, probably going to get some bloated whore there. You might want to stay away from that. Maybe that's where you go to vent about what a fucking whore you're wife is. But Dude, you know what? You're a great fucking guy. You're doing the right thing. Is sticking with your kids and your even supporting her even though she's making more fucking money. She's a loser. All right. She's a fucking loser and she's out of your life and your kids will be 18 one day and then this bitch will be out of your life. So who gives a fuck? All right. In the meantime, yeah, focus on being a good dad.

Speaker 10:         01:51:40       Get yourself in great shape. I don't know. Find some fucking way to do something social. Go meet a great woman. I can see there's plenty of great women out there. It's just like guys, they're out there. Go find one and just ask them during the day. Just be like, by the way, are you a, are you an irresponsible whore? Because I, I really just got out of a relationship with an irresponsible whore and I'm not trying to trying to do that and talk about cheating. Ask if they've ever cheated on somebody. Here's another great question to ask. Ask if their parents are still together. That's a great one to ask. The parents are still together. If they get along with their parents, they come from a strong background. That's a good one to ask. Um, that's a good place to start off and that's it. I'm done trying to be doctor bill here for the week. Um, our and six minute podcast, once again, I'm going to be down at the the

Speaker 15:         01:52:28       Catalina jazz club. Um, doing a benefit for all those people out there in Japan, fellow human beings who also live on a fault line just like I do. Um, so, uh, hopefully somebody out there, we'll do a fucking comedy show for when La falls into the ocean, so I'm paying it forward. All right, so come on down. All the proceeds will go out to help the victims of that. This Catalina Jazz club down on Sunset Boulevard, um, I just tweeted about it, uh, at Bill bird.com. I think that's it. Uh, we got all the youtube videos. They didn't get a chance to describe the youtube videos this week, but they're fucking hilarious. Um, some guy has a potato gun that he shoots a bunch of pubes onto a passed out guy. That's one of them and it just goes from there. It just goes from there. So I'll go to the man podcast to watch all that.

Speaker 15:         01:53:18       If you want to see the pictures of the tower theater and me working with uh, Joe to Rosa, the teen idols sensation from the opiate Anthony Program. I have all of those and I have a picture of that fucking chicken wings sitting on my window sill just in case you think I was making it up. Mafucka ah, that's it. Everybody have a great week. I'll fuck yourselves and I'll talk to you next week. Oh wait, I don't hang up. Don't hang up. I almost forgot. I almost forgot I told you that I was going to bring in the, uh, the outtake from my failed attempt at the podcast last week. This is like a special track. Remember that back in the day when you'd buy like a CD and they'd say they'd be like 15 songs, but it would say 16 tracks and they would just let the tape run and run and run and run.

Speaker 15:         01:54:01       And then you'd, you'd find the A, that little gym at the end. I think this is, this is the podcast version cause I already signed off. Um, all right, just to set this up, this was me last night after getting like four hours sleep flying across this country and then watching the math is, and I'm trying to tell that Sheridan story. And up until this point, it just had not been funny. And I think I'm at the part of the story where the guy, uh, was bringing the new table to, to replace the broken table in. And a, I was trying to explain it in a funny way. It wasn't funny and I just, I just fucking tapped out. Uh, and this is the clip. Hope you enjoy it. I'll talk to you next week.

Speaker 10:         01:54:45       I was like, Jesus Christ. Then I heard an argument between a man and a woman. As I was walking back downstairs, and later on that night when I came back from my Gig, there was a fucking half eaten chicken wing sitting on the window sill on my room. I got a picture of it,

Speaker 2:          01:55:04       you know,

Speaker 10:         01:55:06       I actually, you know something, when I knew she, I knew something was up. When I went to check into my room, uh, there was a knock at my door five seconds later, and the guy goes, oh, hey, and he's got this big table. I'm like, dude, you got the wrong room. I didn't order a table. He said, no, no, no. He said this, this table belongs in your room. He goes, somebody broke it here last night. And I was like, Jesus, what was their party here? Or something? He was like, yeah. I go, well, did you fumigate the place or is it just all Jizan coke residue in here? And he just left, shook his head and left. And that's when my ass knew was in a ghetto

Speaker 8:          01:55:44       as brothers shared and baby

Speaker 16:         01:55:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:56:03       [inaudible].
