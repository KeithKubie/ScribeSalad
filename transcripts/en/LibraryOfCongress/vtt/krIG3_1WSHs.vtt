00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.206
&gt;&gt; Richard Holmes is best known as
the world's preeminent biographer

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.393
of the romantic era poets.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.873
He not only tells the tales of these
writers, he absorbs their lives.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280
He projects the romantic
sensibility.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.610
His two volume biography

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.130
of Coleridge has been called
the near masterpiece of empathy.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.890
But after studying the
romantic era for years,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.853
Holmes realized something.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.840
There was a powerful
largely overlooked influence

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.730
on the romantic culture and
on the writers of the time,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.136
and that influence was science.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.620
He explores this theme in his
new book, The Age of Wonder:

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.500
How the Romantic Generation
Discovered the Beauty

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.046
and Terror of Science.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.496
Holmes was born in
London and educated

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.056
at Churchill College Cambridge.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.190
He began his career as a journalist.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.750
For 20 years, he was
a feature writer

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.750
and a reviewer for the London Times.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.956
His first book, Shelley: The
Pursuit, was published in 1974

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.183
and won the Somerset Maugham Prize.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.283
That was followed by his
first volume on Coleridge.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.370
Next came an account of the
friendship between Samuel Johnson

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.256
and the poet Richard Savage.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.910
He's also written two
volumes of memoirs focusing

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.763
on the craft of biography.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.693
One reviewer has described
his latest, The Age of Wonder,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.970
as a big hearted river of a
book in which the twin engines

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.010
of scientific curiosity and poetic
invention pulsate on every page.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.333
In Holmes' view, romantic era
scientist and poets shared a vision.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.316
Both held to the hope
for human improvement.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.140
Coleridge believes that
science had a poetic side

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.906
because it too had
a passion for hope.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.370
Some observers believe Holmes'
newest book has a lesson

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.070
for us today.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.356
It can serve as a model for bringing
the sciences and the arts together

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.183
so we can all grasp the beauty
and terror of modern life.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.423
Holmes might agree for he has said
scientific breakthrough's promised

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.416
benefits but also raised fears.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.913
It was such in the romantic
era and it is still today.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.280
Please join me in welcoming
Richard Holmes.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.246
&gt;&gt; I would just like to
introduce Suzy [phonetic],

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.200
who is our signer today.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.290
&gt;&gt; It's a great pleasure to be here.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.996
I've just flown in from London.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.063
Why I'm the only man in
the tent wearing a suit?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640
[ Laughter ]

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.856
&gt;&gt; I probably will take
it off later on, right?

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.156
And I'm tremendously grateful
to two major institutions,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.646
of course the Library of Congress,
which I want to say something about,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.986
and also the Washington Post which
I want to say something about.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.453
But there's a third institution and
this requires me to put this hat on.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.356
And you can't read it but it
says Junior League of Washington,

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.863
and they are the young ladies who
at the signing in have been looking

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.963
after you in the hats,
the white and black hats,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.683
and they've just elected
me the only male member

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.343
of the Junior League of Washington.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.570
[ Applause ]

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.753
&gt;&gt; And the point about them,
you-- many of you will know,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.993
they do wonderful work
helping people challenged

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.503
in their reading abilities
of all ages, alright.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.390
And they go fund gathering.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.696
And if you want to help them,
go straight on to the net.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.736
It's jlw.com and make a
contribution because that is one

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.706
of the major themes as I
understand at the festival, books,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.553
reading, helping people to read.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.590
So that's JLV-- the JLW.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.546
I have to say, I had a certain
disappointment arriving here

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.140
in Washington because I
understood that it was traditional

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.463
that the rain poured down.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.790
You probably-- some of you wish
the rain was pouring down, alright,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.903
but it was-- I had a special
joke arranged for this

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.016
which I'm gonna tell anyway,
alright, which has to do

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.586
with writing and some of you may
have been to the big festival

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.093
in England, in Wales, in fact
the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.380
and there traditionally
also the rain pours down.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.210
So to get to the tent, you
have to wade through mud, okay,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.690
and this was happening to me 2,
3 years ago and just as I got

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.636
to the tent, remember this is Wales,
a voice called out and you'll have

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.843
to do this with a Welsh accent,
"fine weather for biographers."

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.090
[ Laughter ]

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.586
&gt;&gt; And then he added,
"plenty of feet of clay."

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
[ Laughter ]

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.266
&gt;&gt; Very, very true.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.533
So, nonetheless I'm very
glad that it's shining today.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.663
I wanted to say this about the
Library of Congress which is one

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.830
of your great national institutions.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.560
For the first time, I had
a chance to get to see it,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.433
and one of the things I came
away with was the Jefferson,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.223
the Thomas Jefferson Library.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.223
It's so impressive
partly because it's small.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.370
It's not too monumental.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.370
It's possible to have it in
probably a room and a half.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.393
And Jefferson organized his library

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.483
under three headings,
not Dewey organization.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.683
He organized it under memory,
reason, and imagination.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.556
And I thought about
this and I thought

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.356
that roughly defines the
task of a writer like me.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.863
For memory, we are going
back into history to discover

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.066
and particularly the history
of science in this case.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.580
Reason, we try to understand
and explain the science

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.966
that has been done in the past.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.036
And imagination, we try
to bring it to life.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.313
So for me, there is Jeffersonian
concept, memory, reason,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.706
imagination, very, very important.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.150


00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.563
When I arrived at customs
and immigration,

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.740


00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.410
the officer looked very carefully at
me and then said, "Professor Holmes,

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.383
what is the purpose of your visit?"

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.140


00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.370
Now, have you understood this right?

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.703
The purpose of your visit.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.750
This seems to me like a
metaphysical question.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.863
Like, what is the purpose
of the universe,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.976
and I hardly noticed him stamping
my thing and sending me out, okay.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.480
And so in a way, that's
what I want to talk

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.223
about this very few
minutes the purpose

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.950
of the visit, the purpose
of writing.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.133
I've been steady.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.860
I was told that I should spend 20
minutes not talking about my book

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.073
and then 10 minutes
answering questions

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:43.663
about not talking about my book.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:45.996
So, we'll see how we
get on with that.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:47.833
So, I thought I'd do this
in this shape of form.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.160
I'm going to use questions.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.886
People have actually asked me in
very the brief time I've been here,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:57.723
and the first one was, "Mr. Holmes,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.783
did you come from London
by hot air balloon?"

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.170
It's on [inaudible] with
the cover of the book

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.780
to which my quick answer was,
well, the first hot air balloon

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.746
across the atlantic from England to
America was described by none other

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.540
than Edgar Allan Poe in
the New York Sun in 1844.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.433
Three English pilots, including
the famous Charles Green,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.550
and they overflew Greenland and
they landed on the shore somewhere,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.476
I think in Massachusetts.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.543
This was the biggest scoop
the New York Sun had ever had.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.060
And then Edgar Allan Poe
realized and revealed

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.236
that it was a complete hoax.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:43.610
They had never crossed the Atlantic.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:45.343
It was the first of
his stories of mystery

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.010
and imagination that was in 1844.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.006
But the first person who
flew the English Channel,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.946
it was an English balloon

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.400
but the pilot was an
American, Dr. John Jeffries.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.976
So that's a little bit of
history which appears in my book.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.063
And the first woman aeronaut
was an actress, Mrs. Sage

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.603
and she has a great
comic turn in my book.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.926
And at the end of this
week coming, I'm going--

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:22.753
so it's maybe the last
you ever see of me,

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.953
to the international balloon fiesta
in New Mexico to fly with the winner

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.746
of the American hot
air challenge cup.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.390
Bye-bye. [Laughter] Second question,

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.363
can you remember your
long subtitle, alright.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.166
In fact, it's amazing.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.390
I just noticed it's not on
the cover of the book, okay.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.976
Anyway, the long subtitle is how the
romantic generation discovered the

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.133
beauty and terror of science,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.000
and that is in a way
my first serious point

00:09:59.420 --> 00:09:59.820
because this is a history of
age in the century of science

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.306
that the notion that science is
both beautiful and threatening

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.200
and menacing is a key
idea to grasp and one

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.896
that we have absolutely inherited.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.230
&gt;&gt; And one of the themes of my book
is to see how this began in Europe

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.140
and in England in the
late 18th century.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.303
I'll give you one example of
this, that there's a passage

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.943
or chapter describing the
invention of the minus safety lamp

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.236
which I'm sure some
of you [inaudible]

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.226
by the chemist Humphry Davy,
a brilliant piece of invention

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.733
which I tried to describe which
prevented the deep mine explosions

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.186
of methane, a beautiful
invention benefit to mankind.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.220
But what happened?

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.953
As a result of that lamp minus,
we're sent deeper and deeper

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.810
into the minds and gradually
the casualties grew again.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.566
So it's a double-edged sword,
and that would be an example.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.923
There are others, but that's
just one for the book.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.190


00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:09.936
Question, would you describe
your book differently

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.283
to a science graduate
or an arts graduate?

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.020


00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.546
To a science graduate, I would say
this book weighs 9.958 kilograms.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.006
It's 5 centimeters thick.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.673
It's 485 pages long.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.273
It's got 72 footnotes and it's
got 306 lines of poetry in it

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.683
which is the point I
began to look skeptical.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.586
How would I describe
it to an arts graduate?

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.473
Well, I'd say this
is a group biography

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.923
and it takes a particular period

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.936
between Captain Cook's first
navigation of the globe, 1768,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.683
and Charles Darwin
setting out in 1831,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.206
famous voyage to the
Galapagos Island.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.473
So it's that period
of time about 60 years

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.456
and it emphasizes the friendship and
the contact and the letter writing

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.806
and the inspiration that moved
between literary writers and poets

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.720
and the scientists of the period.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.180
Now, sometimes people
say, are you sure?

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.950
Are you sure about this?

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.743
Then we'll give you one single
proof and I want to read a poem.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.306
I promised my self I'll read a
poem, and this-- let me set it up.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.473
First of all, it's by a woman poet,

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.740
and this is again a very
important theme of the kind

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.470
of history I'm writing because I
think that women have been written

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:39.393
out the history of science certainly
in the 18th and 19th century,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:42.806
and I think there's a
lot of recovery to do.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.316
And this poem is by Anna
Barbauld and she was working

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:48.910
as an assistant to Joseph Priestley.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.376
As you know, his laboratory
was burnt down and he came here

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:56.903
to the land of the free, it's
Philadelphia, and he worked there

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.563
for the finer years of his life.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.830
This was when he was
still in England

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.230
and he was doing experiments
with a vacuum.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:07.656
Some of you may have
seen the famous picture

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.583
by Joseph Reiter Darby [phonetic]
which is a bird fluttering

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.063
in a big glass vacuum tube
and the idea was to experiment

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.466
with what was the mysterious
gas in the tube

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.113
that kept the bird, the dove alive.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.990
And Priestley in fact was
on the trail of oxygen.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.600
He used all kinds of
animals and one was a mouse.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.160
So he had laboratory mouse.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.123
And Anna Barbauld began to
worry not so much about oxygen

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.860
but about the mouse
and so she wrote a poem

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.843
which was called the Mouse's
Petition to Dr. Priestley found

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.643
in the cage where he had
been confined all night

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.800
by which we understand the
mouse, not Dr. Priestley.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.973
So you have to imagine that just
like today, experimental cage,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.020
this mouse was scheduled to undergo
the oxygen test the following day,

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.350
and when Priestley came
down, he found this poem.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.136
I just wanna quote a
couple of lines from this.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.296
And this is Anna Barbauld who
was very well read in science

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.320
but suddenly putting herself in the
place of a non-volunteering mouse.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.060
And this is what the mouse
says to the scientist.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.410
For here forlorn and sad I sit
within the wiry grate and tremble

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.440
at the approaching morn
which brings impending fate.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.913
The cheerful light, the vital
air of blessings widely given,

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.136
let nature's commoners enjoy
the common gifts of heaven.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.723
The well thought philosophic mind
to all compassion gifts and cast

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.566
around the world an equal eye
and feels for all that lives.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.056
So there is possibly the first
animal rights poem, alright.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:13.986
And very interestingly, it came
out of this scientific laboratory

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.546
in 18-- 1773, and that's just
one tiny example of the thing

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.776
that happens throughout my
book, and what interest me

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.750
so much is the connection
between the writer--

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.936
the literary writer
and the scientist.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.406
Question, why did you
change after writing--

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.223
after waiting for 40 years

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.290
on literary biography
to science biography?

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:43.493
I felt there was a slight tone
of reproach in that question.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.400
Why did-- why did you do that?

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:50.106
The quick answer is I'd written

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.633
about the poet Samuel
Taylor Coleridge,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.270
the one who took the opium,
you remember Kubla Khan,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:58.996
and it turned out that
as a young man,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:05.130
his great friend was Humphry Davy
who is gonna be the greatest chemist

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.416
of the age and become
president of the Royal Society.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.503
And I discovered when Davy was
experimenting with a new kind

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.783
of gas, nitrous oxide, which
is also called laughing gas,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.666
he called for volunteers
and amazingly among them,

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.336
hot from his opium experiments,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.446
was the 24-year-old
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.493
So you have to imagine, the
scientist and the poet breathing

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.753
in the nitrous oxide and
then dancing, knocking people

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:36.860
over in the street, writing
poetry under the influence.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.236
It's all there in the book and
it's there in the notebooks.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:48.176
So that friendship made me think if
that's Coleridge and Davy, the poet

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:49.116
and the scientist, maybe there's
a much bigger story there.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:52.916
So, that was one of the
things that set me off.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.716
I should also say I
had an amazing chance

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:58.716
when I started to write this book.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.050
I got a summer fellowship at
Trinity College, Cambridge

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.903
and that is Trinity is the
great-- it's Newton's College.

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.003
It's the great scientific
college in England.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:15.370
And it-- there you-- when you
dine, I was there for 6 months,

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:17.516
you just sit anywhere on the table,
okay, that that long table is

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.493
in their place, you don't know
who you're gonna sit next to.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.073
And I have to say in
the time I was there,

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:25.426
there were six Nobel Prize winners
and I sat next to each of them

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.000
and it was very interesting
to try and ask some questions.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:32.973
And one of the things I found is

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.130
that unlike many literary
professors,

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.150
the scientists loved explaining
things and they were really good

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.953
at doing it, and that was something
that fascinated me, converted me,

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.366
and now let me give you one
pure example of this that I sat

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.003
down one evening next to a Russian
mathematician who spoke no English

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.000
at all and the one thing I knew is
that he knew about Evariste Galois,

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.120
the great romantic mathematician.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.183
So that was the one
thing I turned to him.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.116
I said, Evariste Galois, and
this wonderful smile spread

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.843
across his face and then
he leaned across the table

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.560
and managed this college
table with all the silverware,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.686
alright, don't you think?

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.896
And he drew all the silverware
over him and he began to lay

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:24.216
out an algebraic box with the
knives and the forks and the pepper

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.403
and he explained without using any
words, Evariste Galois' theory.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.170
It cost chaos, the waiters had to
come and intervene in the end, okay,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.060
but-- [Laughter] And that was just
one example and that changed me.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.136
I thought this is something
to meet people like that.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:46.186
It's something I must write about.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.980
Question, are scientists
madder than poets?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840


00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.833
The answer is it's fully
[inaudible] my book.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.813
The answer is no and yes sir.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.740
And that story William and
Caroline Herschel, again,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.146
I emphasized Caroline Herschel, two
astronomers, brother and sister,

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.773
a kind of William and
Dorothy Wadsworth

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:13.656
of astronomy is extraordinary,
very passionate,

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.290
very interesting relationship,
full of ups and downs

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.126
and extraordinary exchanges.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.376
Caroline became the first really
efficient woman astronomer

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.143
of the period, in fact
got a government pension,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.510
and she did a wonderful thing.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.090
She kept a journal just
like Dorothy Wadsworth

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.396
of William Herschel's observations
and they are there in the archive

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:39.850
and it's something
I was able to use.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.036
I have to say the first page,
they were both from Hannover.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.396
It was written in German.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.463
I thought my luck was out.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.396
And then from then
on, as she was working

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.930
in England, she wrote in English.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:51.786
So their story shows a kind of
passion which I would certainly

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.740
as bright and strong as
anything of the poets.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.706
&gt;&gt; Question, did you
get any fan letters?

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.243
Well, I got a fan letter from
NASA and they pointed out that

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.700
in the footnote on page 295 where
I described the Hubble telescope,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.246
I had got one figure
9.91 percent out.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.260


00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.036
But as it referred to the cost of
the Hubble, they were not pleased.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.690
[Laughter] I also-- I had a
wonderful former fan letter

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.146
which is relevant now from
Harold Varmus who is the--

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.906
a Nobel Prize winner in medicine
who's gonna be talking initially

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.133
after me in another tent who said
that he'd recommended my book

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.963
to the freshmen of Amherst College,

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.950
and the result is I think it broke
the bank because the department had

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.370
to buy 459 copies of it, alright.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.923
And so that's the kind of fan
that you really like, alright.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.770
Special story telling methods.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.290
Yes. One is to keep to
length and to keep to time

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.856
which I'm rapidly running out
from, but let me describe one thing

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.223
in the book is the use
of the vertical footnote.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.506
Everybody ask me what's
a vertical footnote?

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.833
The main body of the story you
tell is in chronological time

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.546
but continually, you want to
drop out of that time and go back

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.566
to what happened before or go
forward to see the influence,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.093
hence a footnote which
describes the Hubble telescope.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.466
So that's one technique in a way
that I thought I pioneered slightly

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.746
in using literary methods

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.613
to describe scientific
effects, the vertical footnote.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.580
What are you going to write next?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.270
I don't have to answer
that question.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.636
So that rapidly moves us on to the
tenth and the last and this is this.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.110
I think I got two [inaudible].

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.776
The other institution
that is responsible

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.366
for me being here is the Washington
Post which I have huge respect for,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.480
and they asked this question
which is a serious one.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.633
Can writers change the world?

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.340
And I just want to
finish with the draft

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.620
of the piece I sent in
the blog about this.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.953
I have a literary Irish aunt,
a fiery fan of James Joyce,

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.353
who once dismissed this
question with a snort

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.866
of derision signed in Irish.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.190


00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.116
[Laughter] Writers don't
have to change the world.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.283
Sure, it's changing
fast enough anyway.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.800
They should try and
slow it down instead

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.590
or maybe make it go backwards.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.240
So considering this response, I've
slightly reformulated the question,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:04.970
when did people stop
believing that writers could

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.390
or should change the world.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.233
Because up to the mid
19th century in Europe,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.080
this was an automatic assumption,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.213
part of the enlightenment project
central to the idea of progress.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.796
Knowledge is power
said Francis Bacon.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.543
In 1820, the poet Shelley
who I've written

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.763
about could still hopefully
say poets and philosophers

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.686
of the unacknowledged
legislators of the world.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:30.760
So I have to tell you the late poet
W.H. [inaudible] Auden said, well,

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.053
that makes writers sound rather like
secret policemen, okay [inaudible].

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.893
But Shelley's exact contemporary,
Humphry Davy who I've mentioned,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.336
he put a different view and this is
something I want to leave you with.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.910
It wasn't writers but
maybe it was the scientists

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.210
who are changing the world and he
said, if you compared Shakespeare

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.763
or Francis Bacon, Milton or Newton,

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.376
who do you think had
changed the world more?

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.623
Very interesting question and
I think there is an answer now

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.680
which says from the 20th century
with penicillin, air travel,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.400
and nuclear power, 21st
century mobile phone, internet,

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.133
planet change, et cetera, that
might be the proper response.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.783
But then, I think writers
have inherited a new form

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.143
of this question.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.010
Is it changed for the
better or for the worse?

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.320


00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.116
Is our world the kind we want
or the kind we should have

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.783
or the kind we have foolishly lost?

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:43.176
Do we have reasons to hope or to
fear, to dream and wonder or simply

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.533
to laugh at the absurdity
of the whole thing?

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.713
By posing such questions and
exploring all possible answers,

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.853
writers are no longer
asked to change the world.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.846
They are asked continually
to re-imagine it,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.110
which is a far more radical request.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.566
But I'm not sure that my Joycean
aunt would approve all the same.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.433
Thank you very much.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600
[ Applause ]

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.703
&gt;&gt; I think we got time for
just a couple of questions.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.296
Are there any in the romantic
generation net today you believe

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.510
would be or could be or
should be scientifically,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.600
clinically categorized as
manic-depressive, bipolar,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.213
schizophrenic, and/or in some
other category of mental illness?

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.433
&gt;&gt; Okay. I guess there has been a
whole thesis written about this,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.146
the mental or bipolar thing
of writers or scientists.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.470
My answer to that would be no,
but what is very, very noticeable

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.183
with someone like Davy
or the Herschels

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.440
or Mungo Park explorer is
a kind of recklessness,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:10.596
a passionate recklessness that they
would push and sacrifice themselves

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.673
to find the truth to
pursue their science.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.490
I give you one example from
Davy and you can tell me

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.843
if you think this is
manic-depressive or not.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:20.746
When he was testing those gases,
they didn't know what they were,

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.400
he inhaled carbon monoxide.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.276
It is one now used
for committing suicide

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:30.986
in the car and the backyard, okay.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.313
That gas, they didn't
know it, and he inhaled it

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.393
and he virtually killed himself.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.480
He came back and he re-inhaled it
and he wrote as he was breathing,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.766
his pulse rate, his visionary
distortions and this note,

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.520
I do not think I shall die.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.740
Now, what kind of extremism is that?

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.113
And that happens again and again
at this period and it's a kind

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.733
of recklessness with which I
think science has still driven.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.270
So that's my slightly
depressive answer.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.240
I reckon we've got-- have
we got one more minute?

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:10.953
One more minute, one more question.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620
Sir.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.530
&gt;&gt; I'd be interested in
your view of Stephen Hawking

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.443
as scientist and as popular writer.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.510
His new book is selling like
hot cakes here and in England

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:24.150
and I'd be interested
in your reaction to him.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.043
&gt;&gt; Okay. You should have
asked that 25 minutes ago.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.416
Very good question.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.823
Okay. The new book is
called The Grand Design

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.943
and it's become controversial
partly because it sounds

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.276
like an atheist track, alright.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:40.410
That's one of the problems there.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:42.610
This is what I'd say
about that book.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.876
It's a problem that begins
in the 19th century that more

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.076
and more science is expressed
in terms of pure mathematics,

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.866
and pure mathematical
setups are very difficult

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.700
to imagine or visualize.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:55.230
And when you get to string theory
or M-theory, it is very difficult

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.770
to know, is the scientist
speculating

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:03.846
or is it something
that can be proved?

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.180
And I think that's a
very, very big dilemma

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.760
and I just finally add one
more thing very important

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.400
which I call displacement, and
this bare on the two cultures.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.586
One of the things that's happened
since Copernicus removed the earth

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.063
from the center of the solar
system and said it was the sun,

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.556
science has displaced us more
and more in terms of time,

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:30.130
how small we are in terms of the
universe, how irrelevant we are

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:35.143
to a quantum universe, that is
to say they're very, very small,

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.033
and also to the very, very big, and
also in terms of time and evolution.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.736
We seem to occupy a more
and more displaced space and

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:46.520
yet at the same time, we are
developing beautiful theories

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.366
and we are writing
and we are here today.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.670
And I think there is the division

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.136
between the science
culture displacing us

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.313
and the literary culture trying
to put his back and put meaning

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.386
into everything around this.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.253
There's the difference
and that's my time.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.853
Thank you very much.
