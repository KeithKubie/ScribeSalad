00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.380
Much like how Snow White was mostly fueled on emotions, "Pinocchio" was very similar.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.040
It's not even really based on a fairy tale; it's based on a book.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.260
And a very odd, deranged, dark book as well.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.480
Yeah, the movie's dark too, but good god...the book's downright sadistic.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.680
Where in a fairy tale, you just know it's sort of a magical world where magical things can happen, this world treats it a little differently.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.720
I mean, there are magical things, like the Blue Fairy that brings a puppet to life.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.240
But then how about the fact that there's just a fox and a cat walking around like normal people?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.340
I remember how blown away they were that they saw a puppet boy walking around, and all I could think to myself is,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.660
"Why isn't anybody blown away that there's a giant fox and a giant cat just walking around?"

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.780
Well, it's just that kind of world where things like that can happen.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.020
And if there's anything Disney is good at, it's having us go along with things that don't make sense.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.120
And this movie does it pretty well.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.960
Geppetto makes a puppet boy, wishes one night that he were real, and the Blue Fairy comes and makes it happen.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.600
It's ironic, because probably the film should be centered around Geppetto.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.400
He's the one that has a past, he's the one that actually has some character.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.740
Pinocchio is just sort of born with his personality, so the fact that he has to learn lessons and be given a conscience is kind of strange because

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.920
the Blue Fairy just sort of made him up, didn't she?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.640
If you want him to learn lessons, why didn't you just have it where the lessons were already learned?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.460
But again, I'm totally overanalyzing this.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.640
Pinocchio comes across a bunch of strange adventures and learns a bunch of lessons along the way.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.600
And the visuals they use to have him learn these lessons sticks with us even today:

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.880
the nose growing longer when you're lying, turning into a donkey when you've been bad...

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.480
You don't forget strangeness like this that often.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.440
Pinocchio's a pretty likable character, and I like the fact that they do make him--for lack of a better term--a real boy.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.760
He isn't just pitch perfect; he is gullible, he does want to do bad things sometimes.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.440
It doesn't mean he's a rotten kid; it just means he's a kid.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.160
What sets him apart, though, is that he does learn his lesson and he does try to do better.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.180
He has a conscience named Jiminy Cricket, who, I'm just gonna say out there, I never enjoyed.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.620
Even as a kid.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.000
Yeah, I know that means I have no heart and I'm goin' to hell or whatever you want to say, but I just don't like this guy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.020
[Jiminy singing] "When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong, give a little whistle."

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.120
I just didn't find him that charming, I didn't find him that funny, his voice sort of grated on me.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.920
But he sings that one song, and everybody's putty in his hands.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.400
I don't know. I was always waiting for Pinocchio to step on him.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.040
Again, the creepy imagery is sort of upped in this movie, much like it was in Snow White.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.620
Except this time, instead of everything always turning out okay, this time it wasn't always okay.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.000
A bunch of misbehaving boys are brought to an amusement park and then turned into donkeys, where they're gonna be used in mining shafts.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.620
And that's it. You never see them again.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.420
The guy running the place is never defeated, the boys can't talk anymore.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.760
God knows what they're doing with the ones who can.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.140
It's pretty friggin' grim as kids' films go.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.300
The rest, however, does come back to the typical Disney formula.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.540
After a relatively exciting climax, Pinocchio gets smashed into a bunch of rocks and loses his life.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.980
Again, he can spin his head around, but some rocks kills hi--I don't know.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.560
But the Blue Fairy comes back and sees his sacrifice and brings him back.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.640
Everybody in the audience is filled with joy, and of course Jiminy Cricket sings that song that nowadays is almost causing some controversy.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.840
Okay, not major controversy, but people have been debating whether or not this is a good message.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.300
This is the song that Disney used all the time. It's practically their biggest trademark.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.600
But some people think that it just promotes laziness.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.480
Or a lying belief that everything will be okay if you just believe hard enough.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.640
While you could make that argument, I have yet to see a kid that totally fell for this.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.380
Or even more depressing, an adult.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.220
I think kids are smarter than we give them credit for.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.320
Kids are always gonna be aware that there's bad things in the world.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320
There's things they're gonna be afraid of.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.480
And that closing their eyes and wishing isn't always gonna solve their problem.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.140
I think most people connect to it because it's a symbol of hope, rather than realistic planning.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.320
That sometimes unexpected good things can happen, and they can come out of nowhere.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.400
They can come when you least suspect it.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.280
So never give up the idea that all hope is gone.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.460
I don't know. That's what I got out of it, and I think that's what most people get out of it.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.700
And I think that's what most people get out of the film as well.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.460
It runs the Disney gamut that most of us enjoy.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.300
At times, bright and colorful, but at other times dark and scary.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.940
Threatening and doubtful, but always with that ray of hope that sees us through.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.580
Doesn't always make a whole lot of sense, but they create a world where it doesn't need to.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.040
It's a world where anything can happen, even when you least suspect it.
