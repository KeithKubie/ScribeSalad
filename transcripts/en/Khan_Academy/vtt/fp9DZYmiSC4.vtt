00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.430
We're asked at how many
points do the graph of y

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.560
equals sine of theta and
y equal cosine of theta

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.680
intersect for theta
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.480
And 0 is less than or equal
to theta which is less than

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.410
or equal to 2 pi.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.485
So we're going to
include 0 and 2 pi

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:19.140
in the possible
values for theta.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.630
So to do this I've set up
a little chart for theta,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.450
cosine theta, and sine theta.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.590
And we can use this
and the unit circle

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.830
to hopefully quickly
graph what the graphs of y

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.560
equals sine theta and y
equals cosine theta are.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.770
And then we could think about
how many times they intersect

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.630
and maybe where they
actually intersect.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.642
So let's get started.

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:42.100
So first of all, just to be
clear, this is the unit circle.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.250
This is the x-axis.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.680
This is the y-axis.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.050
Over here we're going to
graph these two graphs.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.950
So this is going
to be the y-axis.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.360
And it's going to be a
function of theta, not

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.960
x, on the horizontal axis.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.060
So first let's think
about what happens

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.790
when theta is equal to 0.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.084
So when theta is equal to
0, you're at this point

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:02.750
right over here.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.166
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.870
You're at this point right
over here on the unit circle.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.280
And what to coordinate is that?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.470
Well that's the point 1 comma 0.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.910
And so based on that,
what is cosine of theta

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.040
when theta is equal to 0?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.690
Well cosine of theta is 1, and
sine of theta is going to be 0.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.529
This is the x-coordinate
at the point

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.070
of intersection with
the unit circle.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.580
This is the y-coordinate.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.940
Let's keep going.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.130
What about pi over 2?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.580
So pi over 2.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.540
We are right over here.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050
What is that coordinate?

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.710
Well that's now x is 0, y is 1.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.180
So based on that,
cosine of theta is 0.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.420
And what is sine of theta?

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.000
Well that's going to be 1.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.220
It's the y-coordinate
right over.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.710
Now let's go all the way to pi.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.750
We're at this point
in the unit circle.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.850
What is the coordinate?

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.900
Well this is negative 1, 0.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.250
So what is cosine of theta?

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.740
What's the x-coordinate here?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.260
Which is negative 1.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.120
And sine of theta is going to
be the y-coordinate, which is 0.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.720
Now let's keep going.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.780
Now we're down here
at 3 pi over 2.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.780
If we go all the way
around to 3 pi over 2,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.350
what is this coordinate?

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.790
Well this is 0, negative 1.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.050
Cosine of theta is
the x-coordinate here.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.230
So cosine of theta
is going to be 0.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.900
And what is sine of
theta going to be?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.000
Well it's going
to be negative 1.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.100
And then finally
we go back to 2 pi,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.470
which is making a full
revolution around the circle.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.330
We went all the way around
and we're back to this point

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.340
right over here.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.360
So the coordinate is
the exact same thing

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.400
as when the angle
equals 0 radians.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.420
And so what is cosine of theta?

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.590
Well that's 1.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.110
And sine of theta is 0.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.320
And from this we can make
a rough sketch of the graph

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.420
and think about where
they might intersect.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.700
So first let's do
cosine of theta.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.400
When theta is 0-- and
let me mark this off.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.840
So this is going to be
when y is equal to 1.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.000
And this is when y is
equal to negative 1.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.431
So y equals cosine of theta.

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:23.930
Let's see...

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.060
theta equals 0.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.700
Cosine of theta equals 1.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.100
So cosine of theta
is equal to 1.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.590
When theta is equal to pi
2, cosine of theta is 0.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.750
When theta is equal to pi,
cosine of theta is negative 1.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.740
When theta is equal to 3
pi over 2, cosine of theta

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.870
is equal to 0.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.410
That's this right over here.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.065
And then finally when theta is 2
pi, cosine of theta is 1 again.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.910
And the curve will look
something like this.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.170
My best attempt to draw it.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.140
Make it a nice smooth curve.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.450
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.700
The look of these curves
should look somewhat familiar

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.020
at this point.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.660
So this is the graph of y
is equal to cosine of theta.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.890
Now let's do the same
thing for sine theta.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.990
When theta is equal
to 0, sine theta is 0.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.600
When theta is pi over
2, sine of theta is 1.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.520
When theta is equal to
pi, sine of theta is 0.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.140
When theta is equal to 3 pi over
2, sine of theta is negative 1.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.620
When theta is equal to 2 pi,
sine of theta is equal to 0.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.360
And so the graph
of sine of theta

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.870
is going to look
something like this.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.140
My best attempt at drawing it.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.560
So just visually, we can
think about the question.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.900
At how many points do the graphs
of y equals sine of theta and y

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.190
equals cosine of theta intersect
for this range for theta?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.704
For theta being between 0 and 2
pi, including those two points.

00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:11.120
Well, you just
look at this graph.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.911
You see there's two
points of intersection.

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:16.430
This point right over here and
this point right over here.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.430
Just between 0 and 2 pi.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.620
These are cyclical graphs.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.640
If we kept going,
they would keep

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.848
intersecting with each other.

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:27.340
But just over this 2
pi range for theta,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.730
you get two points
of intersection.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.230
Now let's think
about what they are,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.650
because they look to be pretty
close between 0 and pi over 2.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.622
And right between
pi and 3 pi over 2.

00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:43.830
So let's look at our unit
circle if we can figure out

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.970
what those values are.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.830
It looks like this
is at pi over 4.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.050
So let's verify that.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.080
So let's think about what
these values are at pi over 4.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.230
So pi over 4 is that angle, or
that's the terminal side of it.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.410
So this is pi over 4.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.080
Pi over 4 is the exact same
thing as a 45 degree angle.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.400
So let's do pi over
4 right over here.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.020
So we have to figure out
what this point is what.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.450
What the coordinates are.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.695
So let's make this
a right triangle.

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.160
And so what do we know
about this right triangle?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.830
And I'm going to draw
it right over here,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.913
to make it a little clear.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.240
This is a typical type
of right triangle.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.060
So it's good to get some
familiarity with it.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.510
So let me draw my best attempt.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.236
Alright.

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:31.610
So we know it's
a right triangle.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.200
We know that this is 45 degrees.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.650
What is the length
of the hypotenuse?

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.990
Well this is a unit circle.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.780
It has radius 1.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.610
So the length of the
hypotenuse here is 1.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.830
And what do we know about
this angle right over here?

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.460
Well, we know that it
too must be 45 degrees,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.670
because all of these angles
have to add up to 180.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.580
And since these two
angles are the same,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.990
we know that these two sides
are going to be the same.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.260
And then we could use
the Pythagorean Theorem

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.290
to think about the
length of those sides.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.150
So using the
Pythagorean Theorem,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.000
knowing that these
two sides are equal,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.720
what do we get for the
length of those sides?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.056
Well, if this has length a, well
then this also has length a.

00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:16.680
And we can use the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.207
And we could say a
squared plus a squared is

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:21.540
equal to the hypotenuse squared.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.660
Is equal to 1.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.940
Or 2a squared is equal to
1a squared, is equal to 1/2.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.550
Take the principal
root of both sides.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.150
a is equal to the
square root of 1/2

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.899
which is the square
root of 1, which is 1,

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:35.610
over the square root of 2.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.730
We can rationalize
the denominator here

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.580
by multiplying by
square root of 2

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.380
over square root
of 2, which gives

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.252
us a is equal to-- in the
numerator-- square root of 2.

00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:46.710
And in the denominator,
square root

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.390
of 2 times square
root of 2 is 2.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.960
So this length is
the square root of 2.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.970
And this length
is the same thing.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.700
So this length right over here
is square root of 2 over 2.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.570
And this height right
over here is also

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.800
square root of 2 over 2.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.860
So based on that, what
is this coordinate point?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.370
Well, it's square
root of 2 over 2

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.200
to the right in the
positive direction.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.520
So x is equal to square
root of 2 over 2.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.747
And y is square root of 2 over
2 in the upwards direction,

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.080
the vertical direction, the
positive vertical direction.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.180
So it's also square
root of 2 over 2.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.410
Cosine of theta is
just the x-coordinate.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.410
So it's square root of 2 over 2.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.830
Sine of theta is just
the y-coordinate.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.620
So you see immediately that they
are indeed equal at that point.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.679
So at this point they're
both equal to square root

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:41.549
of 2 over 2.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.409
Now what about this
point right over here,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:48.600
which looks right in
between pi and 3 pi over 2.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.660
So that's going to be-- so this
is pi, this is 3 pi over 2.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.040
It is right over here.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.540
So it's another
pi over 4 plus pi.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.500
So pi plus pi over 4 is the
same thing as 4 pi over 4

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.840
plus pi over 4.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.635
So this is the
angle 5 pi over 4.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.610
So that's what we're
trying to figure out.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.810
What are the value of
these functions at theta

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.350
equals 5 pi over 4?

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.829
Well, there's multiple
ways to think about it.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:25.620
You could even use a
little bit of geometry

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.240
to say, well if this
is a 45 degree angle,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.390
then this right over here
is also a 45 degree angle.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.940
You could say that the reference
angle in terms of degrees

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.749
is 45 degrees.

00:09:36.749 --> 00:09:38.290
And we could do a
very similar thing.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.980
We can draw a right triangle.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.460
We know the hypotenuse is 1.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.180
We know that if this is a right
angle, this is 45 degrees.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.560
If that's 45 degrees, then
this is also 45 degrees.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.650
And we have a triangle
that's very similar.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.490
They're actually
congruent triangles.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.680
So hypotenuse is 1, 45, 90.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.820
We then know that the
length of this side

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.340
is square root of 2 over 2.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.631
And the length of this side
is square root of 2 over 2.

00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:08.100
The exact same logic
we used over here.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:16.090
So based on that, what is
the coordinate of that point?

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.690
Well, let's think
about the x value.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.099
It's square root of 2 over
2 in the negative direction.

00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:22.640
We have to go square
root of 2 over 2

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.160
to the left of the origin.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.810
So it's negative square
root of 2 over 2.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.610
This point on the x-axis
is negative square root

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.980
of 2 over 2.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.220
What about the y value?

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.180
Well, we have to go square
root of 2 over 2 down,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.880
in the downward direction,
from the origin.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.540
So it's also negative
square root of 2 over 2.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.240
So cosine of theta is negative
square root of 2 over 2.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.560
And sine of theta is
also negative square root

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.560
of 2 over 2.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.060
And so we see that we do indeed
have the same value for cosine

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.040
of theta and sine of
theta right there.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:04.050
They are both equal to
the negative square root

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.770
of 2 over 2.
