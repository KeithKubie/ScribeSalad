00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] How did
Ronald Reagan's policies

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.270
affect the government and economy?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.050
- What Ronald Reagan believed
is that good programs,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.860
he had been a New Deal democrat,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.280
he believed that what had happened was

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.590
good programs that had
tried to help people

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.590
who needed the help, the
poor, the infirm, the elderly,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.720
those programs had ballooned,
and what had happened was

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.700
they were no longer prioritizing help

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.770
to those who needed
it, but they had become

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.700
a kind of system where those
who made the loudest noise

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.750
got the most government,
got the most money

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.700
and got the attention from the government,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.160
and that that in fact stopped
helping people in need

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.650
and ended up hurting
people, ended up sort of

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.190
entrapping them in government dependence.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.981
And so what he said was he was
going to do two big things.

00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:47.810
Or three big things actually.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.610
He was going to cut taxes,
and what that was going to do

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000
was shrink the amount of available money

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.700
towards government, which
he was then going to also do

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.860
by cutting spending, and he
was going to cut regulation.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.260
So it was essentially
paring down government,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.907
which he thought was inefficient towards

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:06.580
giving resources to those who need it,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.920
he wanted a lot of that power
to go back to the states,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.530
and he also believed
in an economic program

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.280
that both cut money from domestic spending

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.440
but also cut taxes, which he believed

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.720
would actually generate more revenue

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.040
because of something called
supply-side economics,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.300
and so his both economic theory

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.520
and his theory about shrinking government

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.130
were kind of matched
up in his first budget

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.063
and in his first major tax cut.
