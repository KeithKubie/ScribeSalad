00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.870
- [Voiceover] Owls have
a very robust diet.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.720
In fact, larger species
of owls are known to eat

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.720
skunks, rabbits, and even porcupines.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.210
So this was written in a very,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.450
or the punctuation here
seems very strange.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.783
Especially this semicolon
right over here seems wrong.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.720
And then even putting the
comma after the "and" there.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.830
So let's look at the other options.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.660
So I definitely want to change this.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.500
So here, owls are known to eat

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.130
skunks, comma, rabbits,
comma, so far so good.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.580
And, and then they put another comma.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.800
Well, this seems off.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.380
So because of that I'm gonna rule it out.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.130
Or it doesn't seem off, it is off.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.088
You wouldn't put the comma after the and.

00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:42.410
So here, skunks, comma,
rabbits, semi-colon.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.250
Well, I didn't like that from the get-go.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.230
Skunks, comma, rabbits, comma, and even.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.140
Yep, that's right.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.860
You put a comma after each
listing you're listing

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.050
until you get to the and,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.100
and then you just list the last thing.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.893
This is the one that is correct.
