00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.060
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.670
Welcome to Authors
at Google Cambridge.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.890
And welcome to Pride Week.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.970
It's my enormous pleasure
to kick off Pride Week here

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.870
in Cambridge by introducing four
exceptionally talented writers.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.590
They happen to be trans women.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.790
They are part of the growing
group of Topside Press writers

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.000
who are giving voice to
people whose voices have long

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.400
since been denied in
the publishing world

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.950
and who are changing lives
even as we stand here.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.900
Today, we have four writers who
are part of the Topside Press

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.670
Northeastern Tour.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.560
Two writers will be
back in Cambridge a week

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.795
from tomorrow, the 17th, at a
location whose name I forget,

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:14.320
but who Red Durkin can
probably remind us of.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.430
But this morning, we welcome
Imogen Binnie, Red Durkin,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.040
Casey Plett, and
Jeanne Thornton.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.235
Imogen Binnie writes a
monthly column in "Maximum

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:29.320
Rock'n'Roll" magazine as well
as the zines "The Fact That

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.160
It's Funny Doesn't Make It A
Joke" and "Stereotype Threat."

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.520
She was a contributor
to the Topside Press

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240
"The Collection-- Short Fiction
from the Transgender Vanguard,"

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.620
which I highly recommend.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.430
She was recently named a
recipient of the 2014 Betty

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.950
Burzon Emerging Writer Award.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.000
Also, her novel
"Nevada," which is

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.140
available in the back of
the room after the talk,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
has been the recent subject
of not one, not two,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.430
but three video games
produced at one of our most

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.490
prestigious engineering
universities,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.110
Georgia Tech University,
alongside another classic

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.530
of the genre, James
Baldwin's "Giovanni's Room."

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.660
So there you have it.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.830
If you never thought you
would see a video game based

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.830
on "Giovanni's Room"-- I
never did-- we're both wrong.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.650
Red Durkin is, for
obscure reasons,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.660
sadly by default, the prettiest
and funniest stand-up comedian

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.960
in New York City now.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.550
RED DURKIN: According to
the comedian reporter.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.762
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:48.040
MALE SPEAKER: She's also
a very talented writer

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.530
and a dogged activist.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.941
She is the managing
editor of PrettyQueer.com.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.090
She has written
nine zines and was

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.635
featured in the final issue
of Punk Planet magazine

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:04.290
and contributed to
"The Collection."

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.590
Casey Plett has just
published a collection

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.270
of stories, "A
Safe Girl to Love,"

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.950
the dedication of which is
particularly near to my heart.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.640
Previously, she wrote a
column on transitioning

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.330
for McSweeney's
Internet Tendency

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.350
and contributed to
"The Collection."

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.850
And Jeanne Thornton
is the author

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.600
of "The Black Emerald," which
is forthcoming later this year,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.640
and "The Dream of
Doctor Bantam,"

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.840
which was a Lambda
Award finalist for 2012,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.630
as well as the web comics
"Bad Mother" and "The Man

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.230
Who Hates Fun."

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.200
Please join me in welcoming
these four very talented

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.702
writers.

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:46.132
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.040
JEANNE THORNTON: Hi, everybody.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.060
I'm Jeanne Thornton.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.310
Oh, that's creepy.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.740
I don't want to look at that.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.455
OK.

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:07.830
So I'm going to read to you
from the beginning of my book

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.170
"The Dream of Doctor Bantam,"
which is in the back.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.990
And let's just go.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.260
Let's just get this started.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.029
OK.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.320
It's the beginning of the book.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.358
You need no context.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.649
There's the drawing of an IHOP.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.601
It's cool.

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:26.880
"When Tabitha Thatch argued,
her little sister Julie

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.640
always thought about cats.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.682
It was rare that Tabitha
argued, much more common

00:04:31.682 --> 00:04:33.140
that she agreed to
rules or demands

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.240
her mother or the
world imposed on her,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.490
and then did the opposite
of what she'd agreed to.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.940
But when she did argue,
her jaw relaxed open

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.210
and her voice,
high-pitched and ragged,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.500
folded in on itself
in 100 tissue paper

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.580
layers of connotation,
implication, meaning,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.300
all of her yowling 'protest' in
a way that you couldn't ignore.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.441
You could listen to Tabitha
arguing like a cat for hours.

00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:58.440
Julie-- her own voice
like a dog's, she thought,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.836
short and hoarse and barky-- had
listened to Tabitha for hours.

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.210
You could listen
and you would be

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.520
struck by how raw and
vibrant that voice was.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.817
But then you would realize
that Tabitha was just

00:05:08.817 --> 00:05:10.400
saying she was going
to go to the mall

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.110
and buy Adderall to
swallow with beer

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.651
and then hang around the food
court talking about the Misfits

00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:15.570
with some college kid.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.970
In a raw and vibrant and catlike
way she would tell you that.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.500
And you would believe in her.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.930
Linda, Tabitha and
Julie's mother,

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.930
had never been vulnerable
to Tabitha's voice.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.686
And Julie had always hated
Linda a little bit for that.

00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:30.310
They were fighting
now, Tabs and Linda.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.800
Their voices came through
the walls of Julie's bedroom

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.621
like foreign talk
radio on the AM dial.

00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:37.120
Julie sat up on the
edge of her bed,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.290
recently stripped of its
alphabet-patterned case

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.870
and replaced with a more
grown-up deep green color

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.140
that reminded her
of rainforests.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.810
She felt her long hair sticking
up in crazy roller-coaster

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.960
loops at the back of her head.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.304
The air of the room
was somehow just wrong.

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:54.720
Like Lucy in 'Voyage of the
Dawn Treader,' she had slipped

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.220
into another dimension, one in
which she was not able to get

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.497
any sleep before her
algebra test the next day,

00:05:59.497 --> 00:06:01.830
one in which the red digital
clock was blinking midnight

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.800
at her in some sick parody
of 'good morning.' She went

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.890
into the hallway, still in her
white Apple Records T-shirt

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.450
and boxers, sat on the floor
outside Linda's bedroom,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.229
curled her legs up to her
body, and listened to them.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.520
Everything has to have a
reeeason, that's your problem,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.580
Tabitha was saying.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.810
What if my reason
is that I just want

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.790
to spend all day lying
in a field or something?

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.540
And writing long letters
to ex-boyfriends?

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.190
What if that's my reason?

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.560
I don't give a shit what
your reason is, Linda said.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.180
I don't care how
boring or irrelevant

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.740
you think your
classes are, either.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.890
You think I don't spend
eight or nine hours a day

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.350
doing boring and
irrelevant stuff?

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.770
I think you're
spending right now

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.150
doing boring and irrelevant
stuff, said Tabitha.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.120
Does right now count toward
those eight or nine hours?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.470
It's called
survival, said Linda.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.650
You do what you have
to in order to survive.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.620
It's not called
fun or quit school

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.910
so I could go out with boys and
work at a fucking video arcade

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.900
and smoke pot in
the house all day.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.250
At least smoke
pot in the garage.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.430
I'm an adult, said Tabitha.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.000
I can possibly make decisions
without subjecting them

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.760
to some neurotic
process of analysis

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.730
about what might
possibly go wrong or--

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.060
You're 17, said Linda.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.500
And the video arcade is a good
job, said Tabitha, mother.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.010
Linda laughed.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.750
Julie buried her cheeks deeper
into her bare bony knees.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.230
There are no good
jobs, Linda said.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.580
There are only lucrative
jobs that you hate.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.270
Your job is neither
lucrative, nor do you hate it.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.952
I'll move out, said Tabitha.

00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:29.660
That got a laugh.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.160
That's cool.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.682
I like this place.

00:07:31.682 --> 00:07:32.890
"I'll move out, said Tabitha.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.932
I'll move out, and maybe
Julie will come with me.

00:07:34.932 --> 00:07:36.973
And you won't have us
hanging around all the time

00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:38.287
making your life miserable.

00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:39.370
You're stoned, said Linda.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.536
I'm not going to argue with
you while you're stoned.

00:07:41.536 --> 00:07:44.330
Ewwww, you're
stoooooned, said Tabitha.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.910
Get out of my room, said Linda.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.420
go to bed.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.860
And you're going back to
school in the morning.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.100
You're going to tell them
you changed your mind

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.683
about leaving.

00:07:49.683 --> 00:07:52.690
Ewwww, get out of my
rooooom, said Tabitha.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.870
The TV came on immediately,
some infomercial.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.910
There was a snort
and then a stomp.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.792
And then Julie's eyes were
blinded by the lamplight.

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:04.000
Tabitha stormed into the
hallway and slammed the door

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.220
behind her.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.810
She turned and her eyes fell to
the ball of Julie at her feet.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.520
She stopped before her sister.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.770
What the fuck are you doing
in the hallway? she asked.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.470
Were you spying on us?

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.240
Yes, Julie said.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.960
Tabitha stared down at her.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.457
Julie stared back up.

00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:22.790
When Tabitha got like this,
you could not be reasonable.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.650
You only had to match
her, crazy for crazy.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.280
Even in the dark hallway,
Julie thought her older sister

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.169
was very beautiful-- her
hair, hay-blonde like Julie's,

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.630
bleached and highlighted
in pink like celery stalks

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.380
in red water.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.701
Her skirt torn, her
stockings striped,

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:40.909
her shirt full of rhinestones
like the constellations

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.032
that Julie liked to
memorize from books

00:08:43.032 --> 00:08:45.240
and try to see through the
fluorescent haze of Austin

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.860
streetlights.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.819
The rhinestones
spelled out NO FUTURE.

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:52.110
Tabitha put her hands on her
hips and pursed her mouth.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.384
Her lips were painted in
red and outlined in black.

00:08:55.384 --> 00:08:56.800
The epaulets of
her leather jacket

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.544
rose and fell as she breathed.

00:08:59.544 --> 00:09:00.460
Come on, Tabitha said.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.849
Let's get out of here.

00:09:01.849 --> 00:09:02.640
Where are we going?

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.940
Julie asked.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.330
Anywhere but here, said Tabitha.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:05.460
I don't know.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.330
We'll get pancakes.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.260
Come on.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.010
Julie got up, the
shoulders of her T-shirt

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.130
nearly even with
Tabitha's epaulets.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.520
Somehow, at 13, she had
become as tall as her sister

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.005
when she wasn't
paying attention.

00:09:17.005 --> 00:09:18.760
Let me go get
dressed, she asked.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.550
You'll take forever,
said Tabitha.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.360
Come on, trust me.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.070
Let's just go.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.175
It's the millennium.

00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:26.300
Julie's flip-flops were
stacked under the coat rack

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.800
by the door.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.510
She put them on and
followed Tabitha out

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.120
into the front yard,
crossed the lawn

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.529
in her Apple Records
T-shirt and boxers.

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:34.070
Her legs shivered
in the spring night

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.820
and every window in
every neighbor's house

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.450
could have been an eyeball.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.880
She got into the car
next to her sister.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.910
She lit a cigarette, a
tulip of fire surrounded

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.340
by the black petals
of her painted nails.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.860
Against the light her eyes
were red at the edges.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.970
She turned the key.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.920
They didn't talk as they
drove down 2222 and merged

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.040
onto the highway bearing south.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.760
One of Tabitha's
Smashing Pumpkins CDs

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.020
was blaring quietly.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.250
Tabitha tossed her filter out
the window, licked her lips,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.330
and then looked over at Julie.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.130
Shit, she said.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.130
I can't take you to get
pancakes in your boxers.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.337
I must be losing my mind.

00:10:08.337 --> 00:10:10.420
She giggled again, and she
veered off the highway,

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.540
throwing Julie's shoulders
against the seatbelt.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.280
Be careful, Julie hissed.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.850
They fishtailed
under the overpass.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.120
The CD played on.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.430
Tabitha flicked her blinkers
off and on in time with it

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.820
while Julie stared at her,
dug her nails into her seat.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.510
They pulled into the parking
lot of an all-night Wal-Mart.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.060
Tabitha opened the door
and swung her legs out.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.950
What are we doing
here, Julie said.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.590
What dress size are
you? said Tabitha.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.715
I have no idea, said Julie.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.064
Can we just go home?

00:10:33.064 --> 00:10:34.105
No, said Tabitha happily.

00:10:34.105 --> 00:10:34.980
Come on, guess.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.520
You have to know
your dress size.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.040
Four, Julie guessed.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.230
Four, nodded Tabitha.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.730
She took the keys out of the
ignition, tossed them to Julie,

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.610
and shut the door.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.940
You can listen to the CD
if you want, she said.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.460
Just, if you do, leave the
window rolled down a little.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.710
Otherwise gases and stuff
will come in from the engine

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.490
and they'll kill you.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.530
She gave a two-fingered
Cub Scout salute

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.270
and then jogged off
toward the store.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.920
Julie sat alone in the car for a
minute, listening to the engine

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.230
creak and settle
and needing to pee.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.390
And then she picked up the keys
and turned on the CD player.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.466
There was a new song,
quiet and creepy.

00:11:11.466 --> 00:11:13.840
A man was pushing a shopping
cart filled with bulky trash

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.385
bags near the curb by the dark
part at the edge of the store,

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:19.199
a gray hood bunched
up around his skull.

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:20.990
She looked at the
window, half-rolled down,

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.680
and wondered if you could smell
the gas from the engine killing

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.721
you and if the sleepiness
she felt in her temples

00:11:25.721 --> 00:11:28.259
meant that it might
already be too late.

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:30.675
She turned off the CD, but
that only made the dread worse,

00:11:30.675 --> 00:11:33.840
and she couldn't figure
out how to turn it back on.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.620
You took forever,
she said to Tabitha

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.380
when her sister hustled
back into the car

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.100
and handed her a fat
white shopping bag.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.280
Size four, said Tabitha.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.160
Put 'em on.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.110
There was a pair of
jeans in the bag.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.310
Where am I supposed to
put them on? asked Julie.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.250
Jesus, said Tabitha.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.090
The back seat.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.736
Where else do you
change clothes in a car?

00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:53.402
Julie tapped her
fingers against the bag

00:11:53.402 --> 00:11:55.600
and then clambered
between the seats.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.920
The leather in the back
reeked of pot and incense.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.794
And she stretched her
legs out over the piles

00:11:59.794 --> 00:12:02.770
of forgotten school papers
that filled up Tabitha's car.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.720
A skeleton keychain, long
abandoned, dug into her behind.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.610
The windows are open, she said.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.650
Right, said Tabitha.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.900
People only notice parked
cars if the windows get all

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.400
fogged up.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.390
So even though it may seem like
the exact wrong thing to do,

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.380
if you're getting, like,
physical with a boy,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.963
you'll want to leave
the windows open.

00:12:17.963 --> 00:12:18.580
Remember that.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.280
You're stupid and
stoned, said Julie.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.160
I'm never getting
physical with a boy.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.720
With a girl, then,
Tabitha shrugged.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.219
Whatever.

00:12:24.219 --> 00:12:26.210
It's the millennium.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.232
Julie flushed in the dark.

00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:31.970
You're stoned, she repeated.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.570
Then she closed her eyes.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.220
She pretended that
she was not sitting

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.500
in a parked car with her
sister, and she shrugged off

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.050
her boxers.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.650
She hurried the new
jeans on, arched her back

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.840
to struggle with the last two
inches of hip and the snaps.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.650
They're too tight, she breathed.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.530
Size four my ass, said Tabitha.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.140
Come on, squeeze 'em in there.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.085
She still managed it, snapped,
zipped, tried to breathe,

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:55.900
and succeeded.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.110
She sat up-- still OK.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.110
She opened the door and
began to circle the car,

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.630
walking the pants on.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.220
The jeans were boot cut,
screenprinted neon flames

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.640
rising from the cuffs.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.660
She winced as her
bare soles pushed

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.380
against the
cracked-glass asphalt.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.260
She was walking commando
through a parking

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.160
lot at night in tight
jeans she had just

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.080
gone out and bought
with her sister, why

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.430
not, snap, like that.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.090
And Tabitha was
behind the wheel,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.732
stoned and fiddling with the CD
player, giving her a thumbs up

00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:23.190
and nodding in time with "Cherub
Rock" out of the speakers.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:27.004
And she looked at her
sister and she loved her.

00:13:27.004 --> 00:13:28.170
You like 'em? asked Tabitha.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.310
They're not like cutting off
circulation in your legs?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.316
They're the best pants
ever, Julie said.

00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:35.690
You make them
work, said Tabitha.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.472
Come on, let's get pancakes.

00:13:38.472 --> 00:13:40.180
And so they pulled
out of the parking lot

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.620
and onto the highway like a
jet screaming in takeoff--

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.640
a jet that sounded
like Billy Corgan

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.775
and stank like an ashtray
at a renaissance fair--

00:13:47.775 --> 00:13:49.850
and Julie decided
that there would never

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.040
be a better moment than
this in her entire life."

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.568
Thank you all very much.

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:57.958
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.236
RED DURKIN: My
name is Red Durkin.

00:14:05.236 --> 00:14:10.570
I've got about an hour's sleep
in me, so this will be fun.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.910
It'll be great.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.130
Also, I was introduced--
I'm a comedian,

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.930
but my writing is really
not very funny, so.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.600
I'm going to read my story
from "The Collection," which

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.010
is titled "A Roman Incident."

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.690
And all you need
to know about that

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.350
is that it's the term for
when somebody throws up

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.420
during an eating contest.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.050
"To Charlie's immediate
left stood a man

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.550
who had once eaten 21 pounds
of grits in 10 minutes.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.270
All along the table
in front of her,

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.870
clad in the same free
T-shirt she wore,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.480
adventurous amateurs
stood shoulder-to-shoulder

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.100
with vetted professionals who
made their living rushing down

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.590
enough food to kill civilians.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.970
Charlie prayed--" oh, jeez.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.860
Ah, it went away.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.406
All right.

00:14:57.406 --> 00:14:59.280
I'll try to not let that
happen again, sorry.

00:15:01.752 --> 00:15:03.460
"Charlie prayed that
in 10 short minutes,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.040
she'd have earned a place in
the fellowship of the latter.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.270
Icy terror filled
her empty stomach.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.770
She could afford to
lose some of her nerve,

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.340
but none of her appetite.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.930
She closed her eyes and
counted down from 10.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.680
At zero, the world
completely exploded.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.690
Lights flashed, buzzers blared,
and a crowd of thousands,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.240
surging like a bore tide,
crashed into the security gate.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.860
Their cacophonous excitement
splashed onto the stage,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.010
along with waves of their beer.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.640
Charlie was face down in her
fourth mouthful of chicken

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.410
when Pavlovian reflex gave
way to human awareness

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.830
and she realized
what was happening.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.640
The Hooters World Wing Eating
Championship had begun.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.390
Her destiny was at
the bottom of the pile

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.480
of poultry parts
in front of her.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.320
She couldn't afford
to be reckless.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.790
Every wing had to be
clean in order to count.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.120
So she quickly rendered
each one to polished bone

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.980
before moving on to the next.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.970
Behind her, a gorgeous
girl in emphatically tight

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.590
orange shorts held a
scorecard above her head.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.900
The woman bounced and
smiled and cheered,

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.950
faking her enthusiasm
the way Charlie

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.010
imagined her mother
had taught her.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.560
In part of her heart,
Charlie would always

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.240
bear a hateful jealousy
for women like this.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.490
She begrudged them their
big, friendly breasts,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.170
their happily bulging
hips, all the legible parts

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.470
of their bodies that spoke
'woman' in every language.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.460
Charlie's inscrutable
frame would never

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.530
carry that confident
kind of currency

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.200
and she scored the pretty
girls for their oblivious luck.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.320
When she was nine, she'd posted
a note on the fridge that said

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.910
'Charlie is a girl and she
needs new clothes.'" Oh, god,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.580
now what's this doing?

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.037
Will you save me?

00:16:41.037 --> 00:16:42.620
IMOGEN BINNIE: Oh,
yeah, that's weird.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.400
Do y'all know anything
about technology?

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.324
RED DURKIN: Is this
is a tech-savvy crowd?

00:16:48.324 --> 00:16:49.740
IMOGEN BINNIE: OK,
should be good.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.160
RED DURKIN: OK, great.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.800
Thank you.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.880
IMOGEN BINNIE:
[INAUDIBLE] web thing.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.176
RED DURKIN: So to
recover a little bit,

00:16:58.176 --> 00:16:59.300
Charlie hates pretty girls.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.270
"When she was nine,
she'd posted a note

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.099
on the fridge that
said 'Charlie is a girl

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.380
and she needs new clothes.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.930
End of discussion.'

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.430
Some years earlier, to get
out of an intervention,

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.680
Charlie's father had
declared that the words 'end

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.240
of discussion' meant exactly
that in the Eaglehorne

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.060
household.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.750
It was family law.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.760
The phrase had been
employed when she was 12

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.980
and demanded to go on hormones
and most recently at 17

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.790
when she declared her
intention of becoming

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.760
a professional speed eater.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.750
One minute down, one
bowl of wings eaten.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.510
Charlie's heart
kicked like a mule.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.820
Anxiety throbbed in her temple.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.940
Her jaw stiffened too quickly.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.280
She knew if she didn't calm
down and steady her pace,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.960
she'd be lucky to
finish at all, but she

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.600
was operating on a level
baser than prudence.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.330
It was the reptile
part of her brain

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.090
that was grabbing and
chewing and swallowing.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.475
She couldn't hear
the sloppy roar

00:17:50.475 --> 00:17:54.420
of the crowd or the grunting
gluttony of the competition.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.190
Like the few other
women onstage, she

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.160
was pelted with the
countless ugly words

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.670
for 'girl' that fly so
easily from the mouths

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.430
of angry drunken men.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.610
She blocked it out.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.420
She'd had practice.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.830
Tears and snot
gushed down her face.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.230
She was soaked in a marinade
of sweat and Buffalo sauce.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.000
Grab.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.660
Chew.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.770
Swallow.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.830
Each spicy wing tasted
more like Styrofoam,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.150
and her cheeks bulged
with unchewed meat.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.130
Every bedraggled second
took a lifetime to pass.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.610
It was beginning
to feel like home.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.910
She'd been raised by a
pair of New England hippies

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.760
who'd moved to Alabama because
they liked the leaves in autumn

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.050
and equated dirt roads
with rustic honesty.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.730
The Eaglehornes settled in
a truck-stop town outside

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.850
of Montgomery called
Hope Hull, which

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.980
was an appropriate name
for a place so utterly

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.990
gutted of anything worth
looking forward to."

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.750
Oh my god, it just did it again.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.355
So I chose to read this story
because my other stories are

00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:50.480
really gross and upsetting.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.250
And now I'm like, ah, should've
just been gross and upsetting.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.580
"The Eaglehornes settled in

gutted of anything worth

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.210
The 'Charlie is a
Girl' campaign had

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.400
been one of the most
successful political movements

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.640
in its entire history.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.300
As a home-schooled
hippie whelp growing up

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.680
on the fringes of
an outskirt town,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.810
she was practically
invisible to anyone

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.920
who didn't share
their meals with her.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.640
Between her mother's
home-style lopsided haircuts

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.230
and her father's surprisingly
successful approach

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.660
to homeopathic endocrinology,
those lucky enough

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.070
to lay eyes on her
were neither certain of

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.070
nor curious about what
they were looking at.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.870
Her parents claimed
her as their daughter

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.190
and, so long as you
didn't have the audacity

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.400
to dye your hair pink or the
nerve to be dark skinned,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.200
Hope Hull's residents were
a proudly credulous bunch.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.290
Charlie suddenly realized
she couldn't remember

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.050
last time she'd taken
oxygen into her lungs.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.230
She wondered how long her
animal mind had been screaming.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.020
All the pain and confusion
she'd foisted on it

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.000
were immediately hers
to deal with again.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.160
Four more minutes had passed,
four and a half more bowls.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.950
55 wings in all.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.690
The top half of her body
was covered in gore.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.850
Her jaw glowed
white-hot with pain,

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.810
her esophagus burning
with the sensation

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.200
of being strangled
from the inside out.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.560
She tried to swallow, but
the blockage in her throat

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.230
only shuffled in place.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.530
She snatched a cup of water from
the table and gulped it down.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.240
The lump lurched mercifully.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.590
As it finally moved to take its
rightful place in her stomach,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.530
she gasped a great mouthful
of air and the agony

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.540
all over her body
began to register

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.010
on an all too conscious level.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.140
Her fingers hurt.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.540
She took another deep
breath and closed her eyes.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.830
She forced herself
to master the pain.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.910
She refused to go back to
hustling arrogant rednecks

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.580
at the off-ramp
burger joints that

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.160
composed Hope Hull's economy.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.700
At one time, those
moments have been

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.940
proud and meaningful victories.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.550
Now, they felt more
like the glory-day nails

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.130
in her inevitably
mediocre coffin.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.800
She was willing to eat her way
out of that shit-splat town,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.960
even if it killed her.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.880
She picked up another
wing just in time

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.250
to catch a blur of green
glass in her periphery.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.980
The bottle cracked her just
above the eye and everything

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.090
went white in an instant.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.690
Charlie had been hit
before, of course.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.740
By her mid-teens, she'd traded
her bean-pole adolescent

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.550
androgyny for a sexlessly
amorphous obesity.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.980
To the idle and idiot
youth of Hope Hull,

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.280
Charlie was a chimera
of cardinal social sins.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.550
She was fat, opinionated,
and ineffably weird looking.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.160
She had the disturbing habit
of reading for pleasure

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.950
and her free-spirited
Yankee kin might as well

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.470
have been Martians.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.140
The girls spit in her hair
and laughed at her back.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.470
The boys called her a faggot
because she confused them.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.650
They punched her,
she punched back,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.880
and, slowly, they all learned
how to fight together.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.100
Her sole companion
was a pig-nosed girl

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.970
named Lulu, who brazenly
forced the friendship

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.840
to garner disapproval
from her pig-faced family.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.800
In fluttering flashes,
the world began to focus.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.520
She'd staggered
back from the table

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.470
but was still in
the competition.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.080
Precious seconds had been
lost to semi-consciousness,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.340
and she warded off wary medics
to keep from losing more.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.190
The red in her eye might
well have been Buffalo sauce.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.590
Her throbbing head
reminded her of home.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.890
She wanted to sleep.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.070
She needed to eat.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.300
She split the difference
and looked around.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.010
Four more minutes
to go and only eight

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.590
of the original 20 competitors
still stood on the line.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.060
For the first time she could see
that, just past the grits eater

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.710
and a bloated man wearing
novelty sunglasses,

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.500
stood Sonya Thomas,
The Black Widow.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.360
She was a svelte
Korean-born woman

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.370
who had managed a Burger
King before becoming

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.970
the second highest ranked
gurgitator on Earth.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.430
She held a dozen world
records and, according

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:52.920
to the scoreboard,
a chicken wing

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.630
that would put her 26
points out of reach.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.150
Charlie's stomach suddenly
felt like a much smaller place.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.720
Somewhere outside
of her body, she

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.780
could see herself chewing again.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.020
She had never planned
on beating Sonya Thomas,

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.000
she had only prayed
she wouldn't show up.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.830
Some people want to
kill their idols,

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.980
but Charlie didn't want a fight.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.800
She just wanted to
get out of Alabama.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.470
A mechanical waltz
settled over her body.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.160
Grab.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.780
Chew.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.870
Swallow.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.190
She struggled to distract
herself from the replete pain

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.440
and doubt welling
up in her guts.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.360
She thought back to home and
the perpetual motion of her life

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.140
as a Podunk pariah.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.020
In the dregs of
her diffidence, she

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.950
knew that she'd
fed the beast, had

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.970
let the hurt go deeper
than skin and had grown

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.190
fatter, weirder, even
meaner as a result.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.930
She'd craved the hard touch of a
town that would never claim her

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.045
as their own, never love
her, never brag about her.

00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:49.130
Her hope had been shining
through an ever-clenching

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.540
pinhole, but in
that lens she'd seen

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.910
The Widow competing
on television.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.380
Charlie recognized her kindred
in strife, another misfit

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.820
among rubes.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.080
She saw in Sonya Thomas a
whisper of freedom, a liberty

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.320
to dance on the edge of
womanhood and thrive.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.030
Charlie's training had started
the spring she turned 17.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.780
Her parents met her intentions
of becoming a major league

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.820
eater with a skepticism
bordering hostility.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.460
17 years of
semi-responsible parenting

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.080
had severely moderated
the Eaglehorne idea

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.130
of acceptable life-goals.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.610
Really, they worried that
their chronically unpopular

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.450
daughter's plan to etch a living
shoving food down her throat

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.700
was a proposition in suicide.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.840
She'd had to declare
the discussion ended

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.340
more than once.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.020
In fact, she'd never
been further from death.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.150
Her regimen was
modeled on what she

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.360
could glean from her
idol's sporadic television

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.340
appearances and the internet.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.970
It was surprisingly in step
with the recommendations

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.410
of modern medicine.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.540
Eight hours of sleep at night,
daily jogs, and a strict 1700

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.590
calorie diet filled with
fruits and vegetables.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.910
Of course, eating all that food
at once isn't in many fitness

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.860
manuals, to say nothing of
her biweekly all-you-can-eat

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.220
'workouts,' but the overall
improvement in Charlie's health

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.620
was undeniable.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.980
By the fall, she'd
lost 78 pounds

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.720
and gained the
beauty and confidence

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.160
of a girl who truly believes
she has control over food.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.500
Her public enthusiasm
of eating competitions

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.600
did her few favors
with her peers,

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.500
but her reclaimed
featherweight kilter

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.170
and the off-brand
hormones her father

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.690
bought online had given her
a peculiar prettiness that

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.690
at least kept boys from
throwing rocks at her.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.930
Her friendship remained
a social pitfall

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.890
Lulu alone was willing to risk.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.050
With 30 seconds
left, something was

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.270
very wrong and getting worse.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.210
The 83 wings she'd
somehow swallowed

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.450
were now in open revolt.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.240
Terror tied a knot in her
stomach, making her nausea

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.170
feel all the more urgent.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.100
She'd eaten beyond her means.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.980
Charlie was going to throw up.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.120
Her breath came
in shallow gulps.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.960
She wobbled drunkenly as
her strength began to break

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.680
and she closed her eyes.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.100
Clammy certainty enveloped her.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.800
Vomiting was intractable
and inevitable,

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.370
but desperately
needed to be stalled.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.930
If a drop of her sick
touched the table

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.490
before the clock ran out,
she'd be disqualified.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.590
A great wave of
adrenaline washed up

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.960
the last bit of resolve
she'd so jealously buried.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.030
It was immediately followed
by the half-digested ambitions

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.080
at the back of her throat.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.440
Charlie's hands
shot to her mouth.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.280
A gleeful explosion
of pleasure roared out

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.260
of the voyeuristic crowd.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.970
Her shoulders heaved
as though she'd

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.090
been shoved by an invisible
hand and she teetered slightly

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.160
forward.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.360
The drool in her mouth
tasted like batteries.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.230
The mess in her guts came
flooding out over her lips

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.240
and into her waiting palms.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.060
She shuddered violently as
she buckled and began to fall.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.200
The final buzzer screamed
out over the chaos.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.980
The Championship was over.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.290
Charlie's world
strobed into blackness

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.640
and she collapsed
unconscious into a pile

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.020
of puke and victory.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.070
In her hallucinations, Charlie
watched the Big Bang spew forth

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.090
and begin to eat itself.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.580
She perceived a cycle of
consumption, the tidal glut

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.560
of energy that crushes stars
and digests the cosmos.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.450
At the center of each galaxy
sat an endlessly hungry mouth,

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.170
a black hole that bolted
down creation and waited

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.210
for the final
buzzer of doomsday.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.320
Serenely, she
recognized creation

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.710
as an elaborate eating contest.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.090
The thought made her happy.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.920
She woke up to the bright white
glow of tarp in the sunshine.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.340
Her head lay on a
starched, sterile pillow,

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.580
and a clear tube
of saline dripped

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.990
into a vein in the
crook of her elbow.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.660
The ebullient bustle of
post-competition commotion

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.280
outside told her that she'd
been unconscious for only

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.870
a few minutes, though she felt
like she'd witnessed eternity.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.680
Sitting up drew the
relieved attention

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.720
of a kind-faced young medic
on the other side of the tent.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.890
Her heart fluttered,
her head throbbed,

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.290
and he urged her
to lie back down.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.140
She'd almost died.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.170
It was time to rest.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.300
In a photo finish, Charlie's
vomit had stayed in her hands

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.300
and off the table
until after the buzzer.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.740
The rules were clear--
she'd officially

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.590
finished successfully.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.070
Charlie was awarded third
place, just five wings shy

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.700
of the grits guy.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.880
On the plastic stool
next to her cot,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.110
paper-clipped to a $500 check
and a handful of Hooters

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.050
coupons, was a business
card with the International

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.870
Federation of Competitive
Eaters logo on it.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.620
She grinned deliriously,
belched, and fell asleep."

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.790
Thank you.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.678
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:39.694 --> 00:28:42.110
IMOGEN BINNIE: It's always
awesome to watch the people who

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.970
kind of lose their
shit during that story.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.216
I've seen Red read
that a lot of times.

00:28:46.216 --> 00:28:47.879
It's nice.

00:28:47.879 --> 00:28:48.920
My name is Imogen Binnie.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.540
This is a novel
called "Nevada" that I

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.950
wrote that just lost at
the Lambda Literary Awards.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.326
It's a story--
it's in two parts.

00:28:56.326 --> 00:28:58.825
The first is about a trans woman
living in New York City who

00:28:58.825 --> 00:29:00.930
is a mess, who loses her
girlfriend and her job.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.420
In the second part, she sort
of half-borrows, half-steals

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.000
her now-ex-girlfriend's
car and points it west,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.356
where she winds up at a Wal-Mart
in a small town in Nevada,

00:29:11.356 --> 00:29:13.230
where she sees a kid--
she's in her late 20s.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.450
She sees this kid, and
she's like, ah, you're 19,

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:16.075
and I know you.

00:29:16.075 --> 00:29:18.630
You are trans and you
don't know it yet.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.420
I'm going to fix that for you.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.670
And he's like, I
don't know about that.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.527
It's a story of
non-consensual mentorship.

00:29:27.527 --> 00:29:28.985
And so what I'm
going to read-- I'm

00:29:28.985 --> 00:29:30.230
going to read a part
from the first half of it

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.646
and then a part from the second
half of it when they meet.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.950
Or am I?

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:37.450
I am.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.504
So the first part I'm
going to read-- she

00:29:42.504 --> 00:29:43.920
has broken up with
her girlfriend.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.380
Her girlfriend broke up
with her a little bit ago.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.300
And she just was
fired for her job

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.034
because she works at The Strand.

00:29:49.034 --> 00:29:50.700
Do you know The Strand
in New York City?

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.741
She works at a bookstore.

00:29:51.741 --> 00:29:54.330
She tends to kind of just
leave, walk around lower

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.770
Manhattan on the clock.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.640
So she's just been
fired for that.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.075
And that's that.

00:30:00.075 --> 00:30:02.200
"You could be melodramatic
and say, just like that,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.490
Maria Griffiths is homeless and
unemployed in New York City.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.930
The reality, though, is that
she has a bunch of places

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.180
to crash, so it would be
appropriative to call herself

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:10.792
homeless.

00:30:10.792 --> 00:30:12.250
OK, she says, great,
I'm just going

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.460
to grab my stuff from the back.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.200
And then I'll be on my way."

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.090
She is in the process
of being fired.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.230
"OK, she says,
great, I'm just going

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.521
to grab my stuff from the back.

00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:20.370
And I'll be on my
way, all cheerful.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.640
Someone will bring you
your things, McNealy says."

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.710
McNealy is an angry,
obviously, supervisor

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.890
who is in the process
of firing her.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:27.822
"McNealy says.

00:30:27.822 --> 00:30:29.530
You're really not
going to let me go back

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.300
to the closet to get my bag?

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.970
You don't work here anymore, he
says, looking off to one side,

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.360
already bored with
this conversation.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.839
Some new kid brings her bag up.

00:30:37.839 --> 00:30:40.130
They must have watched her
leave and prepared for this.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.310
Awkward, but whatever.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.340
Once again, her
response surprises her.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.460
She's kind of excited.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.152
She laughs in the old
fucker's face, takes her bag,

00:30:47.152 --> 00:30:48.360
and walks back into the rain.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.790
She practically knocks
over the terrifying owner

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.310
of the store, who has just
arrived in a cab or a car

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.276
service or whatever,
right on time for work."

00:30:56.276 --> 00:30:59.454
I'm not going to read
this section for YouTube.

00:30:59.454 --> 00:31:01.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.966 --> 00:31:08.382
Yeah, wow, that's
a lot of stuff I

00:31:08.382 --> 00:31:09.632
don't want to read on YouTube.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.240
"Maria starts
immediately to regret

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.880
that she didn't get a
jab in, but whatever.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.990
She's outside in the rain, and
she's got the whole afternoon

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.829
to herself-- the
whole week, actually.

00:31:18.829 --> 00:31:20.620
It hits her again that
she's pretty excited

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.600
not to have a job anymore,
even though that means no more

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.800
money until she can find
another one and no more health

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.300
insurance.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.170
Who cares?

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.670
She never has to
go back to that job

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.610
she was so indifferent about for
so long because she absolutely,

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.730
completely hates her
life in New York.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.510
Whoa.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.160
Sometimes, your internal
monologue surprises you.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.660
She thinks about going back to
the apartment she is probably

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.920
still sharing with Steph,
but seeing all Steph's things

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.670
would probably be kind
of rough right now.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.050
Then she thinks about going
to hang out with Piranha--"

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.430
her best friend
is named Piranha.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.810
"She thinks about going
to hang out with Piranha,

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.882
but she is probably going
to be asking Piranha

00:31:50.882 --> 00:31:53.340
if she can crash at her house
a lot pretty soon, so she had

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.977
better not just start taking
up space there immediately.

00:31:55.977 --> 00:31:58.060
She could go see a movie,
but suddenly being broke

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.143
is a lot more real than
it was a couple hours ago,

00:32:00.143 --> 00:32:02.090
and $10 for a
two-hour distraction

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.350
seems irresponsible,
like bad irresponsible.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.985
She decides to go to Alt.Coffee.

00:32:06.985 --> 00:32:09.254
It is this biggish coffee
shop on Avenue A where

00:32:09.254 --> 00:32:11.170
they have computers and
stuff but also couches

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.177
and expensive coffee
and atmosphere.

00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:15.260
It's cooler than the coffee
shop by the bookstore,

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.210
like in a gentrification sense.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:22.150
As a last act of epic,
brutal, punk-rock defiance,

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.490
she steps two feet back into
the door of the bookstore

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:26.700
and grabs an umbrella out
of the umbrella basket.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.512
Hah.

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:29.720
She leaves her bike chained
up outside the bookstore,

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.303
under the awning
where it'll stay dry,

00:32:31.303 --> 00:32:34.920
and walks the six long blocks
to Avenue A. It's so gray out.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.800
It rules.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.150
This has been her
favorite kind of weather

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.250
since she was a little kid.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.666
She loves going inside after
being in the rain when you're

00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:43.550
kind of wet and cold, but you
immediately start warming up.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.520
And you finally start
to feel just how wet you

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.212
are as soon as you
start to dry out.

00:32:47.212 --> 00:32:49.170
And then you can look
outside and see the rain,

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.419
watch it run down the windows.

00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:54.130
And nobody can realistically
ask you to go outside and play.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.620
New Yorkers walk
by and ignore her.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.600
Cabs splash puddle
water everywhere.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.100
Nobody waits for
the Don't Walk sign

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.380
to turn to Walk before
they cross the street.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.130
Rain looks like it's freezing to
the frail branches of the city

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.800
trees.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.640
Maybe the rain will start to
freeze, turn the sidewalks icy.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.960
It's fall, so it might happen.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.490
But it's very early
fall, so it might not.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.420
This umbrella is enormous, and
it's got a Nike logo on it.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.756
Punk rock indeed, Batman."

00:33:15.756 --> 00:33:17.130
She's been calling
herself Batman

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.595
in her internal monologue.

00:33:18.595 --> 00:33:20.870
It's pretty wise.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.890
"Punk rock indeed, Batman,
she says to herself

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.559
as she retracts the umbrella and
goes into the hip coffee shop.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:27.100
They have an umbrella
bucket, and she

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.308
worries for a second about
whether someone will steal

00:33:29.308 --> 00:33:30.860
her umbrella, then
laughs at herself.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.679
Who cares?

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:33.470
It'd probably do her
some good for somebody

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.160
to steal her stolen
umbrella so she

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.160
would have to walk back
to her bike in the rain.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.100
She thinks about how
good a hot shower feels

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:44.097
when you're soaked
in cold rain."

00:33:44.097 --> 00:33:44.930
So here's the thing.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.650
She's been thinking a lot
about knuckle tattoos,

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.620
and how if you
have eight letters,

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.400
you can make a knuckle tattoo.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.380
The next line is
"Umbrella, she thinks,"

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.440
but it is spelled out in
blocks of four letters

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.501
so as to appear in the
shape of knuckle tattoos.

00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:57.750
She's thinking about having
the word umbrella tattooed

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.699
on her knuckles.

00:33:59.699 --> 00:34:00.740
"She didn't bring a book.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.860
And she doesn't
really know what she's

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.485
going to do at the coffee shop--
spend money on internet access

00:34:04.485 --> 00:34:06.410
to look at help wanted
ads on Craigslist?

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.460
Her resume from years
ago is probably somewhere

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.409
in her email.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.980
She could update it to
include this most recent job,

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.920
act like she left
without being fired,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.849
lie and say a friend
is a manager who

00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:17.514
thinks she was a great employee.

00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:19.389
She can use her real
name, not her legal one,

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.437
and just not freak out
about it if anybody asks,

00:34:21.437 --> 00:34:23.270
just tell them she's
trans at the interview.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.064
If she gets an
interview-- that way,

00:34:25.064 --> 00:34:26.480
it'll be out in
the open, at least

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.230
with the management
at her new job, which

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.188
will be as somebody's
assistant at a publishing

00:34:30.188 --> 00:34:31.370
company or something.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.750
She gets a $3 drip coffee and
gives the barista her license.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.750
She doesn't look at it,
but she's got dyke hair,

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.250
so she probably
wouldn't care if she

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.820
saw the M. Maria is
assigned computer number 23,

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.340
but after 15 minutes of
looking at Craigslist, her eyes

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.832
glaze over, and she is
falling asleep sitting up.

00:34:45.832 --> 00:34:47.790
She doesn't have the
energy to email that girl.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.331
She does not feel
like job searching.

00:34:49.331 --> 00:34:52.130
She's like, do I even
want to stay in New York?

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.940
She doesn't actually have to.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.345
She goes back up to the
counter, tells the girl

00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:57.720
that she is done
on the computer,

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.870
and gets her license
back. $5 for 15 minutes.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.610
She takes her coffee
over to a couch,

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.290
sits down, and takes
out her notebook.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:06.875
October 15, part three.

00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:09.460
I hate New York, but I love
the New York rain in autumn,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.070
like the November rain.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.510
But it is October,
and I just got

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.050
fired from the stupid bookstore.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.486
I didn't even cuss out anybody.

00:35:15.486 --> 00:35:17.860
Now I have to figure out what
the fuck to do with myself.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.060
Do I get a new job in
Brooklyn near my apartment?

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.730
Except I'm going to have to
find another apartment, too.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:25.230
I am exhausted from thinking
about being trans all the time,

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.500
and I wish I could stop.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.762
If you work for the city of
San Francisco, dear diary,

00:35:29.762 --> 00:35:32.220
did you know that they will
pay for bottom surgery for you?

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.720
It might be an urban legend.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.250
Maybe I will look into it.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.800
It didn't even occur to
me to go out and get drunk

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.420
after I got fired,
which is interesting.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.920
It's almost like I
got drunk all the time

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.170
when I was dating Steph and
working a shitty job, not

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.060
because I am a total
addict, but because it

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.950
was a coping mechanism to
deal with being unhappy.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.150
Her hand hurts already.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.566
It sucks that being from the
computer generation means she

00:35:50.566 --> 00:35:53.230
cannot write longhand,
like, at all.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.290
She texts Piranha.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.730
Can I stay with
you again tonight?

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.430
Got fired a little.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:00.650
She puts the phone
back in her pocket,

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:01.820
but it rings immediately.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.550
It's Piranha.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.070
She stands up and goes
outside, because who

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.528
cares what everybody
else does, who

00:36:05.528 --> 00:36:07.960
cares that there are only three
other people in the coffee

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.640
shop at 2:00 PM on a Wednesday.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.210
It is rude to talk
on your phone when

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.100
other people are
trying to concentrate.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.850
Dude, Piranha says.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.009
Hi, Maria says, maybe more
cheerful than she actually is.

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.550
I'm working tonight,
but you can come

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.580
get the key from me at work and
stay at my house while I'm out

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.170
and, like, take a
shower or whatever.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:23.978
Thanks, Maria says.

00:36:23.978 --> 00:36:26.353
But listen, you can't just
stay at my house all the time,

00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:26.853
you know?

00:36:26.853 --> 00:36:28.450
Yeah, I was--

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:29.530
Piranha cuts her off.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.660
I know you know,
but it's like, dude,

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.290
Maria, besides the
occasional text,

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.440
I hear from you once every two
or three months because you're

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.560
so occupied with your
girlfriend all the time.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.287
And now suddenly, you want
to hang out all day every day

00:36:39.287 --> 00:36:41.370
because you don't have to
worry about her anymore?

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.820
It feels kind of fucked to me.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.550
Shit.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.430
Yeah.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:45.040
I--

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.229
No, listen, Piranha says.

00:36:46.229 --> 00:36:48.020
I'm not going to put
you out on the street,

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.580
especially if you just
got fired from work.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.289
And I want you to tell
me all about that.

00:36:51.289 --> 00:36:52.954
I'm not super pissed
at you or anything.

00:36:52.954 --> 00:36:54.480
I just need you to
understand that I

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.040
feel kind of resentful
about the fact

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.910
that you've ignored me
pretty bad for so long.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.840
And now that you've got a
reason besides that you're

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.680
excited to hang out
with me, suddenly we

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.370
are besties or whatever.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.040
OK, Maria says, probably
hurt the most deeply

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.970
that she's been in
these last couple days.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.672
I miss you, Piranha says, and
I'm excited to see you again.

00:37:10.672 --> 00:37:12.130
But I needed to
put that out there.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.090
I've got to go to work at 9:00.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.260
Come see me then, OK?

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.051
Yeah, Maria says.

00:37:15.051 --> 00:37:15.550
OK.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.839
They hang up.

00:37:16.839 --> 00:37:19.380
Now her mood has come back to
earth, and she feels like shit.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.175
Maybe she should get a beer.

00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:24.160
Turns out they have two-for-one
beers after 4:00 at HiFi

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.740
half a block away, but Maria
doesn't wait until 4:00.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.840
Then, when 4 o'clock hits, she
has her third and fourth beers

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.274
and falls asleep on the
bar for a couple hours.

00:37:32.274 --> 00:37:34.690
Who knows why the skinny,
pretty bartender lets her sleep.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.530
That's kind of off
limits at most bars.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.540
Maybe having a transsexual pass
out at your bar for a couple

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.470
hours is the kind of
gritty authenticity

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.880
that a bar on the
Lower East Side

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.340
needs now that everybody
has moved to Brooklyn."

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.080
That's the first part
I'm going to read.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.410
This next section is from
the perspective of James,

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:53.980
who is 19.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.850
He's smoking a lot
of weed so he doesn't

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.391
have to think about gender or
have any feelings about gender.

00:38:00.437 --> 00:38:02.020
"He smokes out before
he gets to work,

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.140
but by hour four of so
of a nine-hour shift,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.260
he is not really
feeling stoned anymore.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.380
Every day by this point,
he mostly feels tired

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.510
and pissed off.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.790
He's always wished he could
be the kind of cool badass

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.225
who smokes out at
work, but there

00:38:13.225 --> 00:38:15.780
is no way you could do
without somebody finding out.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.715
Plus, his mom rides
in his car sometimes,

00:38:17.715 --> 00:38:19.789
so you can't even
hotbox it ever.

00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:21.330
It's actually very
possible that this

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:22.700
is why he hates his job so much.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.480
He's like, I should
think about that.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.090
Every single day, I go through
an unstonedening and fucking

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.350
hate my life and my job and
my house and my girlfriend

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.760
and everyone and
everything that I can see.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.495
It seems like that probably
affects my job satisfaction.

00:38:35.495 --> 00:38:37.660
I end each shift
with a headache.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.450
I need a fix because
I am addicted

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.690
to the she-demon marijuana.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.440
It is getting toward
the end of his shift,

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.384
and James isn't stoned
anymore, and it sucks.

00:38:45.384 --> 00:38:47.300
This old guy who comes
in once or twice a week

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.012
was looking for some
stupid old movies

00:38:49.012 --> 00:38:50.970
that he couldn't find
because Wal-Mart does not

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:51.990
carry stupid old movies.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.020
But this guy doesn't
listen to James at all,

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.853
so they always wind up
spending half an hour

00:38:55.853 --> 00:38:58.400
pretending to look for these
DVDs that are not there.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.000
That's probably a metaphor for
life in Star City, actually.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:01.600
Whatever.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.890
Once or twice a week,
James thinks very seriously

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.098
about writing out a note to
have waiting for this guy

00:39:06.098 --> 00:39:08.640
the next time he comes in that
explains that these are very,

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.754
very old and hokey
movie starring actors

00:39:10.754 --> 00:39:13.420
that nobody cares about anymore,
and that he would be better off

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.003
going to the Family Dollar over
in [? Imlay ?] where they sell

00:39:16.003 --> 00:39:18.890
those mass-produced DVDs of
public domain stuff that feel

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.520
all light in your hands
like there's no DVD in them.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.962
Wal-Mart can't even order them.

00:39:23.962 --> 00:39:25.920
Those DVD companies have
their own distributors

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.610
that Wal-Mart doesn't
use, which is weird,

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.250
since it seems like
the distributors that

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.160
make those wholesome
DVDs would be Christian.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.629
And Wal-Mart doesn't shy
away from Christian anything.

00:39:33.629 --> 00:39:34.170
But whatever.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:34.660
Who cares?

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.410
James has a headache.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.200
He needs to smoke out
again, and this old guy

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.658
is starting to seem done with
playing out this scenario yet

00:39:39.658 --> 00:39:41.910
again, when Maria Griffiths
comes strutting up

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.220
the aisle of the Wal-Mart
looking out of place as hell,

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.400
like she is made out of long
red hair and layers of clothing.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.960
James does anybody
would do when they

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.530
see somebody they
would like to know.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.560
He ignores the shit out of her.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.935
Probably, he freaks
out a little.

00:39:54.935 --> 00:39:56.685
But she came right to
the Music and Movies

00:39:56.685 --> 00:39:58.110
section, so what
else could he do?

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.730
He says hi to her when she first
comes in because he can get

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:01.926
in trouble if he doesn't.

00:40:01.926 --> 00:40:03.550
According to Wal-Mart
corporate policy,

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.845
greetings turn
thieves into friends.

00:40:08.809 --> 00:40:10.350
But then he just
ignores her as hell.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.016
Maybe on some level,
he notices that she

00:40:12.016 --> 00:40:14.550
might have looked at him
for a second longer than was

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.050
appropriate.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.840
But if he half thinks anything,
it's like, suck it up, dude.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.469
That girl is definitely
not checking you out.

00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:22.260
She's wearing more
clothes than he has ever

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.820
seen anyone wear at once-- huge
black boots, a long black skirt

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.760
or maybe a dress, what
looks like a shorter

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.700
dark orange skirt on top
of it, a long maroonish

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.400
sweater under a ratty denim
jacket with a bunch of patches

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.330
and buttons on
it, a black scarf,

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:38.420
and wavy dried-out-looking
hair just past her shoulders.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.120
Her hair is almost exactly
the same color as her sweater,

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.440
but a little bit darker.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.220
They probably clash or whatever.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.401
Her clothes look like
she slept in them.

00:40:46.401 --> 00:40:47.900
There are
permanent-looking crinkles

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.710
in the elbows of her
jacket, and her hair

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.380
looks like it would
leave a mark if she

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.760
leaned her head against a wall.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.280
She looks like she is probably
a rock star or a murderer.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.980
One time, the band Creed
came to his Wal-Mart

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.700
on tour to buy
batteries or something.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.610
And everybody flipped out, even
though Creed is a stupid band.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.490
But James saw one of
the guys from the band,

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.586
and he walked with this
magnetism or swagger

00:41:09.586 --> 00:41:11.460
or something, like he
knew he was a big deal.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.590
And Maria carries herself
kind of the same way.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.980
She walks over to the
Pop/Rock CD display.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.640
And James thinks clearly,
who the fuck wears a scarf

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.130
in the daytime in Star City,
especially during a heat wave?

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.199
While he is ignoring her,
he stares at her back."

00:41:25.199 --> 00:41:25.740
This is good.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.120
I bet Google people
will get this, ready?

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.800
"Who the fuck wears a scarf
in the daytime in Star City,

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.050
especially during a heat wave?

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.049
While he is ignoring her,
he stares at her back.

00:41:34.049 --> 00:41:34.910
Steven Tyler?

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.630
The Fourth Doctor?"

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.044
Yeah, great.

00:41:39.044 --> 00:41:40.960
There's always one or
two people who are like,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.130
you didn't just-- cool.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.530
It's a "Doctor Who" allusion.

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.032
James watches a lot of TV.

00:41:49.032 --> 00:41:50.490
"He is seriously
just being a creep

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.865
and staring at
her because people

00:41:51.865 --> 00:41:53.490
who look like that
do not live here.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.270
They don't stop here while
they're driving through,

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.570
either.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.660
There are other Wal-Marts
closer to the highway,

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.840
like three exits away
in either direction.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.160
It was fucking dumb for
Wal-Mart to put a Wal-Mart here.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.890
Well, nobody comes
here except for Creed.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.990
Once.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.610
She flips through the
Pop/Rock CDs for a second.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.600
And James manages to
look away from the Poison

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.460
patch safety-pinned across her
back and the messy, wavy hair

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.630
sprawling its way down it.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.920
Like, Poison?

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.590
The glam rock band with the
singer who does reality TV

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.457
shows now?

00:42:21.457 --> 00:42:23.790
His headache fades, or else
James just forgets about it.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:26.010
Because when she turns
around, he's very intently

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.760
alphabetizing CDs that have just
come in and need to be shelved.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.190
Hey, she says, looking
him up and down again.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.140
James is like, Hi.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.150
Do you have the
Miranda Lambert album?

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.900
Um, he says, probably,
but it's probably

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.220
in the country section.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.970
She's like, Oh, there's
a country section?

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.960
And he's like, Well, yeah.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.157
Then, because he is
feeling totally weird,

00:42:46.157 --> 00:42:47.490
James doesn't even stop himself.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:48.906
He just blurts
out, You don't look

00:42:48.906 --> 00:42:50.927
like the folks who usually
shop there, though.

00:42:50.927 --> 00:42:53.010
Because if he is being
totally honest with himself

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.910
on some level, James
has already figured out

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:55.910
that this girl is trans.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.460
And while he hasn't processed
what that means yet,

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.260
he is having this desperate,
magnetic attraction to her,

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.960
like not even
sexual, just like, I

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.630
want to be your Facebook friend.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.552
I need to grab you, to have
you in my life, whatever.

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.760
You don't look like the
folks who usually shop here--

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.950
that is a pretty dumb thing to
say, but she doesn't disagree.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:16.540
She looks at his name
tag, smirks, and says,

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.920
That's probably true, James
H., but check this out.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.607
I left New York City
about a week ago.

00:43:20.607 --> 00:43:22.940
And my dog, my cat, and I
have been living out of my car

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.690
since then, driving
out to the West Coast

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.625
solely because we
have never seen it.

00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:28.750
In New York City, there
are Spanish music stations,

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.490
rap stations, dumb
rock stations,

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.980
and little stations run by
painfully self-aware college

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.387
students with no idea what to
do with all their privilege

00:43:35.387 --> 00:43:37.720
besides collect records in
gentrified neighborhoods that

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.777
have been fine for generations.

00:43:40.777 --> 00:43:43.110
But I don't think there's a
country station in New York.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.040
I guess there are a lot of
reggaeton stations, which

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.520
in a lot of ways,
people tend to not even

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.590
notice has a lot of
similarities to country music."

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.880
By the way, people
have asked me,

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.460
oh, yeah, how is reggaeton
similar to country?

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:51.960
It's not.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.320
This is Maria being an idiot.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.260
Anyway, "It turns out,
though, that once you

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.680
leave New York-- which
nobody should ever do, ha ha.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:04.030
JK, the only things
you can consistently

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:07.150
get on a 12-year-old car stereo
are NPR and country stations.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.750
And have you ever
listened to NPR?

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:09.967
It's soothing, for a while.

00:44:09.967 --> 00:44:11.800
But eventually, it makes
you want to call in

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.464
and cuss somebody
out until you cry.

00:44:14.464 --> 00:44:16.130
It wouldn't get onto
the radio because I

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:18.380
guess they have enough lag time
to dump out angry people who

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.520
call up and lose their shit.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.061
But it turned me
off NPR for a while,

00:44:21.061 --> 00:44:22.980
which means country
station after country

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.315
station for the last four days.

00:44:24.315 --> 00:44:26.125
And look, I am not
some New York jerk

00:44:26.125 --> 00:44:28.420
who thinks country music
is for yokels or something.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:28.920
I'm into it.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.700
I get it.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.360
I even think it's kind of
nice that country singers are

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.630
so fucking convinced of
their own sincerity that they

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.440
don't do any of the
tortured artist,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.130
'I don't care if you
like me, it's art,

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.375
man,' posturing that all
the indie rock kids do.

00:44:39.375 --> 00:44:41.000
And they don't spend
all day telling me

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.125
about how tough and rich
they are, like the rappers

00:44:43.125 --> 00:44:44.970
on the radio do,
except, James H.,

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.130
there is also a lot of
dumb shit on country radio.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:49.630
'I'm So Much Cooler Online'?

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.340
'She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy'?

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.394
I guess it's funny the
first time, but, but--

00:44:54.394 --> 00:44:56.810
Maria has followed James over
to the country music section

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.120
and is jabbing her pointer
finger toward his chest.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.320
I guess, she says,
Miranda Lambert

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.080
isn't the biggest star
in the country sky

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.500
because I have only heard the
radio play her a couple times.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.000
But I think all her
songs are about,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.620
like, burning down cheating
ex-boyfriend's houses

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.785
and, like, shooting your
abusive ex in the face.

00:45:12.785 --> 00:45:14.660
The first time I heard
that song, I was like,

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.400
finally, someone is just
coming out and threatening

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.237
to kill her asshole boyfriend
right there on the radio.

00:45:20.237 --> 00:45:22.820
Not that I think anybody should
kill anybody else or anything,

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.060
but after five days of country
radio, consider me brainwashed.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.000
Miranda Lambert, James H., is
the punkest shit on the radio,

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.750
and I am going to drive
my car off a cliff

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.208
if I hear the song about how
the guy hopes he gets a chance

00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:36.166
to live like he was
dying ever again.

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.790
Not because I don't
like it, because it

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:39.248
is so sad and true
that it makes me

00:45:39.248 --> 00:45:41.330
want to live like I
was dying and then die.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.220
So James H., Miranda Lambert
is a contingency plan

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.470
to save my life.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.860
She actually said the
internet abbreviation

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.104
for just kidding out loud.

00:45:53.104 --> 00:45:54.645
There's a pause,
and then she smirks.

00:45:54.645 --> 00:45:56.270
And she's like, Sorry,
I haven't really

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:57.700
talked to anybody in a while.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.880
James is like, It's cool.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.997
He picks up Miranda
Lambert's second album

00:46:00.997 --> 00:46:01.830
and hands it to her.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.871
This is the CD with that
song about the gunpowder

00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:05.020
and lead on it, he says.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.340
Thank you, James H., she says.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.729
You've been very helpful.

00:46:07.729 --> 00:46:10.020
Then she starts to leave the
Movies and CDs department.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.730
Wait, James says.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.430
You've got to buy it here, or
else security will kick my ass.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.370
This is kind of true.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.953
Mostly true-- you're supposed
to get people to buy their music

00:46:16.953 --> 00:46:18.636
and DVDs in the Music
and DVDs section.

00:46:18.636 --> 00:46:20.510
Even though there isn't
like a rule about it,

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:23.510
it's a firm suggestion in the
interest of loss prevention.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.510
But it is a stupid thing
to emphasize just then.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:26.482
It's not like he's
going to slip her

00:46:26.482 --> 00:46:28.290
his phone number on the receipt.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.370
Well, the receipt does
have the phone number

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:33.827
for Wal-Mart number 8304 on
it, if she wants to call him.

00:46:33.827 --> 00:46:35.660
I don't think they could
take you, she says.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.560
You look like a total bruiser.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.300
Yeah, he says, totally.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.670
I'm a regular old Brad Paisley."

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:43.086
We were just talking about
Brad Paisley in the car before.

00:46:43.086 --> 00:46:44.100
Brad Paisley is great.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.040
"I'm a regular old Brad Paisley.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.230
Which one is Brad Paisley?

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.980
You know, he says.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.540
I don't highlight my hair
and I've still got a pair.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.040
Maria's eyes light up, and she
quotes from this dumb country

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.539
song.

00:46:53.539 --> 00:46:56.080
My eyebrows ain't plucked,
and there's a gun in my truck.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.020
That's me, he says.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.350
Honey, I'm still a guy.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.260
It's $10.90.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.762
The weirdness of that exchange
is not lost on either of them.

00:47:04.762 --> 00:47:05.970
Maria pays with a debit card.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.770
James notices that
her PIN is 6664.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.812
Then she leaves, and
he thinks, well, fuck.

00:47:10.812 --> 00:47:13.020
Then his headache is back,
and he gets pretty bummed.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.020
So he starts thinking
about how, like, soon he's

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.017
going to go home and
get high as fuck.

00:47:17.017 --> 00:47:19.600
Smoking weed rules, and the fact
that this girl just showed up

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.971
in his life and now she is
gone forever totally sucks.

00:47:21.971 --> 00:47:24.220
He's thinking about this
weird girl who was just here,

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.011
whose name he doesn't
even know because she

00:47:26.011 --> 00:47:27.430
paid with a PIN
instead of credit.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.721
And then his thoughts naturally
and optimistically turn

00:47:29.721 --> 00:47:34.370
to his go-to non-sexual
fantasy, weed.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.310
He is envisioning,
like, laying down

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.010
in the sprawling
fields of the marijuana

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:42.830
farms of northern California,
but she keeps stomping in.

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:44.600
Even though it is
his go-to fantasy,

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.694
James is aware that
it is pretty boring.

00:47:46.694 --> 00:47:48.360
More interesting
things tend to intrude,

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.860
like fantasizing about laying
down in a field of weed crops.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.670
It's like licking the centerfold
of an issue of 'High Times.' He

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.260
just keep thinking,
like, New York City.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.790
Her and a dog and a cat
in a car for a week--

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:00.060
what the fuck is reggaeton?

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.349
Trans.

00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:06.390
It's weird that he could
tell that she was trans.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:08.450
You could tell, but not
in like an obvious way,

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.450
like if a drag queen came
parading up the aisle.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.450
You couldn't really tell
from the way she looked

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.880
or the way she
talked or anything.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.550
Probably.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:16.490
But then you have to ask
yourself, like, well,

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:17.730
how could I tell?

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.530
It was probably some
combination of things,

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.579
but could other people tell?

00:48:22.579 --> 00:48:24.620
Was he going to have to
have stupid conversations

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.680
for the next three
months with idiot

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.240
co-workers about
the freaky queer

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.090
that was in the
store that one time?

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.380
Gross.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.010
Weird."

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.723
Thank you.

00:48:34.723 --> 00:48:38.571
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:38.571 --> 00:48:40.530
CASEY PLETT: Hi, everyone.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:41.360
I'm Casey Plett.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.530
I'm the last one.

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.771
I'm going to read a
story out of this book

00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:46.770
that I just wrote, called
"A Safe Girl to Love,"

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:47.820
which is a collection
of short stories.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.800
They're all about
young trans women.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.350
I'm going to read part of
a story-- couple excerpts--

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:59.960
that I haven't read yet, which
is a story called "Winning."

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.650
And it is set in Eugene,
Oregon, out in the northwest.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.190
And it is about a
girl and her mom.

00:49:14.078 --> 00:49:17.750
I'm just going to start
at the beginning, so.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:20.950
"He's shivering, Zoe thought,
as she came in Robin's bedroom

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.520
and saw his tall,
muscle-and-pudge body vibrating

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.566
on the bed, blanket
on the floor.

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:26.940
She made to tuck
the blanket back

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.230
over him when she saw
his face was contorted

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.520
and his lips were
moving like waves.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.730
She said, 'Hey,' and
softly rocked his shoulder.

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:34.337
Robin gasped.

00:49:34.337 --> 00:49:35.920
Then his face turned
instantly blithe.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.690
'Hey, I'm sorry to wake you.'

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:38.517
'It's OK,' he said.

00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:40.600
He stretched, and his
boxers made a ruffling noise

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.690
in the sheets. 'You're
leaving?' he said.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.690
'Yeah,' she said. 'Thanks
for letting me crash.'

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:45.320
'Definitely.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.420
Boy,' he yawned.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:47.870
'I feel fucked up.'

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.970
Robin finished most of
a magnum last night.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.940
Zoe'd had two glasses
and switched to milk.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.020
She loved milk.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.589
She giggled and said, 'Aw,'
and mussed his wavy brown hair.

00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:57.880
It was silly, she realized,
walking outside and zipping

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.710
her hoodie up over
her dress, but she

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.545
had forgotten that boys
even had nightmares at all.

00:50:02.545 --> 00:50:04.670
It was mid November, when
in the Pacific Northwest,

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.836
the panorama of clouds
stopped flirting with the sky

00:50:06.836 --> 00:50:09.330
and moved in and set their
parking brakes until May.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.270
A soft mist patter of
rain was coming down

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:13.550
as Zoe walked down the
motel-like stairs of Robin's

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.360
complex, then over
to Eugene Station

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.680
to take the 66 bus north.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.440
She got on and texted her best
friend Julia back in New York.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:20.985
Hi, she said.

00:50:20.985 --> 00:50:23.110
You're beautiful, and I
miss you to fucking pieces.

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.160
When she got off the bus
and walked up to Ayres Road,

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.535
the rain had
stopped, but the sky

00:50:26.535 --> 00:50:28.290
was still an ocean
of pearl gray.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:29.382
Zoe hated this.

00:50:29.382 --> 00:50:30.840
Humans aren't
supposed to go months

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.700
with all their sunlight
broken, she thought.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.920
She had actually loved
the winters in New York.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.461
Everyone there
complained about gray,

00:50:36.461 --> 00:50:39.230
but to Zoe, New York had
been sunny and bright.

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:42.139
Back at her mom's, the boxes
in the kitchen hadn't moved.

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:43.930
There was a note on
the counter which said,

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:45.980
I've gone to the farmers
market one last time.

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.962
I need everything out
of your room tonight.

00:50:48.962 --> 00:50:50.170
Well, that was a new request.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:52.700
She still had a week to
stay here, but whatever.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.120
She went into her room and
resumed clearing out her shit.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.300
You can build up
so much stuff when

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.210
you have a room in a house
you don't actually live in,

00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:58.890
she thought.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.334
And Zoe'd always been a pack
rat, even as a teenager.

00:51:01.334 --> 00:51:02.750
She would save a
lot of the things

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:05.150
that she thought regular
families saved with their kids.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.750
But she'd done most of
that stuff now, though.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.874
And there were only a few
boxes left-- orderly seas

00:51:08.874 --> 00:51:11.960
of social studies papers, choir
programs, stuff like that.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.640
Sandy came home
as Zoe was mashing

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.274
a basketball-sized paper
wad into the recycling.

00:51:16.274 --> 00:51:18.190
'I bought some food for
you,' her mother said.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.547
'I'm not hungry,' said Zoe.

00:51:19.547 --> 00:51:20.380
'Don't give me that.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.046
Have you eaten?'

00:51:21.046 --> 00:51:23.190
'I don't want any food, thanks.'

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:24.920
Sandy washed a bag
of Bartlett pears

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.690
and plunked it,
dripping, on the counter.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:29.640
She put her elbows beside the
bag and massaged her eyes.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.460
'Better to tell me the
truth, don't you think?'

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.970
Ever since Zoe transitioned,
Sandy had become convinced that

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:36.500
her daughter would develop
an eating disorder,

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.870
though Zoe was eating as
little as ever. 'No, thanks,

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:40.609
Mom,' Zoe said.
'I'm not hungry.'

00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:42.900
'Zoe,' Sandy said, 'the last
thing I want to do is have

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:43.566
to make you eat.

00:51:43.566 --> 00:51:47.230
It's not like I like having this
conversation.' Sandy was trans,

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:48.850
too.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:50.910
Zoe had come out to her
exactly 18 months ago,

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:52.576
on the phone from her
Brooklyn apartment

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:55.560
after she'd already been
on hormones for a while.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.040
She'd meticulously taken
steps to avoid telling her.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.930
And when she had, her mother
had cried and cried and cried.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.222
Her phone pulsed, and Zoe
saw another text from Julia.

00:52:03.222 --> 00:52:03.930
You're beautiful.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:04.440
I miss you.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.010
And Zoe picked up
the biggest pear

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.630
and took a gargantuan bite.

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.627
'What do you need help
with next?' she asked.

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.710
Sandy had done a lot to
have Zoe with Sandy's wife

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.000
at the time, [? Tea ?].

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.380
This was back in the mid '80s.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.570
Sandy had sent the
forged death certificate

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:18.636
to the clinic where she'd
banked her sperm, who then sent

00:52:18.636 --> 00:52:20.344
the samples to a friend
of Tea's, a nurse

00:52:20.344 --> 00:52:22.450
practitioner, who then
helped with inseminating.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:25.000
This was on the plains, where
Sandy and Tea had grown up.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.550
They'd moved to
Oregon to have Zoe,

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.182
who was born downtown in an
apartment off Eighth Avenue.

00:52:29.182 --> 00:52:30.640
Zoe loved this
story, and she never

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.800
got tired of telling
her friends back east.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.730
She liked to say that
she had been born loved.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.630
Though Tea left both of
them when Zoe was eight,

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:39.005
and Sandy had not always been
the most stable of mothers,

00:52:39.005 --> 00:52:42.406
Zoe had always
felt acres of love.

00:52:42.406 --> 00:52:45.252
'Can you go through the closet
in the spare room?' Sandy said.

00:52:45.252 --> 00:52:46.210
'No problem,' said Zoe.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:47.835
'Hey, have another
pear if you want it.

00:52:47.835 --> 00:52:50.047
They're completely yours,'
Sandy called after her.

00:52:50.047 --> 00:52:52.380
Zoe didn't respond, so she
got out pita bread and hummus

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.910
and went to her desk in the
living room to do paperwork.

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.730
She passed well, her mother did.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:58.400
Zoe had always
admired her for that.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.150
And now that she herself
had transitioned,

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.440
she especially admired it now.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.380
In the old days, no one
had known about Sandy.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.671
And with her being 6' 1" and
broad-shouldered and poor,

00:53:05.671 --> 00:53:07.640
Zoe thought it really
couldn't have been easy.

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.520
'I always wore jeans,' Sandy
told Zoe once when Zoe was 17.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.939
It had been the
fifth anniversary

00:53:11.939 --> 00:53:14.480
of Sandy's bottom surgery, and
she'd been unusually talkative

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.502
about the subject.

00:53:15.502 --> 00:53:17.710
'I always wore jeans,' she
said, 'almost never skirts

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.440
or dresses.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.910
Because just in people's
heads, subconsciously,

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:23.920
the idea of trannies wearing
jeans doesn't mesh.' Zoe had

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.920
listened to this raptly.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.753
'They said I looked
mannish,' Sandy giggled,

00:53:26.753 --> 00:53:28.310
'but they never
thought I was a man.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.380
I tricked them.' And she
sounded like she was gloating.

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.680
She said, 'You know,
they just passed me off

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.920
as some big, earthy dyke.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.930
Well, you know, that's OK.'

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:36.670
From very early
in her childhood,

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:39.194
Zoe knew that Sandy had
once lived as a man.

00:53:39.194 --> 00:53:41.110
Neither of her mothers
had hidden it from her,

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:43.610
but it was also understood to
be a buried subject, something

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.719
gravely serious Zoe was never
supposed to talk or ask about.

00:53:46.719 --> 00:53:49.010
'I did have some really pretty
dresses,' Sandy had said

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.890
in that conversation, 'but I
had to be very careful about

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:52.460
wearing them.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.171
I just had to be careful.'

00:53:54.171 --> 00:53:55.920
They moved out of the
apartment off Eighth

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.341
when Zoe was in third grade.

00:53:57.341 --> 00:53:59.090
It had been right after
Tea left and right

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.040
when Sandy got her
job with the county.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.750
That's when they got one
of the few bungalows left

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.583
along [? Ayres ?], on
the north edge of town

00:54:04.583 --> 00:54:05.700
just shy of the city line.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.890
Sandy was from the country, and
she missed the stars, she said.

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:13.110
She missed the stars
and the quiet."

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.150
Skipping to another
section, more middle way

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:16.045
through the story.

00:54:19.234 --> 00:54:21.900
So now Zoe has just gotten a job
at a call center doing surveys.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.240
And this is her
first day at work.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.400
"On the third
call, she stuttered

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.900
a bit because the man on
the phone, a surly dairy

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.150
farmer outside Pacific
City, sounded exactly

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:33.880
like a man she'd known
back in New York,

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.600
a guy with layered blond hair
who ran a bar in Williamsburg

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.480
wallpapered with
covers of Gaddis books.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.660
They had gone out for
dinner, then out dancing.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.070
The man had been amazingly
charming, gentlemanly.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:44.820
She accepted all the
drinks he bought her.

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:46.850
And back at his place, he
began squeezing her nipples

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.016
and slipping his hand south.

00:54:48.016 --> 00:54:50.890
And her last memory was of
mushily shaking her head, wait,

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:54.240
hold on, I like you, I
want you, it's like-- wait.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.460
And when she woke up,
she was on his bed alone.

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.190
And he was at his
desk on his computer,

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.930
and both sides of her bottom
had a dull, vomit-spurring ache.

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:04.260
'How many milk-giving cows
did you say?' said Zoe now.

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.301
'I'm sorry, including
heifers that are not yet--'

00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:08.700
'52,' said the man. 'Now,
do you have it this time,

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.160
or do I need to repeat it again?

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.192
You tell me here.'

00:55:11.192 --> 00:55:13.150
And Zoe said, 'Yes, of
course, of course, sir."

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:15.950
And by 9 o'clock, Zoe had
covered the scratch paper

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:18.250
on her office desk with black
and white penciled swirls

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.250
and shapes, crisscrossing
paisleys and hexagrams

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.440
and triple helixes and
the outlines of faces.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.510
Some of the faces
resembled her mom.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:30.877
Her mom-- Zoe had always seen
her mother as dimly gorgeous.

00:55:30.877 --> 00:55:32.460
She had short, coiffed
ash-blonde hair

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.180
like Sharon Stone in
'Casino' without the rattail.

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.060
She wore blue or green
skinny jeans, tank

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:39.210
tops with shiny satin edges
that showed off lightly

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.360
muscled swimmer's arms
and long earrings that

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.030
skittered around her collarbone
wherever she moved her head.

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:46.107
In winter, she wore
cable-knit zippered hoodies.

00:55:46.107 --> 00:55:47.940
Zoe, on the other hand,
kept her hair black,

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.481
liked dresses with stripes or
polka dots, see-through blouses

00:55:50.481 --> 00:55:52.880
over camisoles, with patterned
sweater tights in winter.

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.000
She sped through tubes
of eyeliner and lipstick.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.640
Sandy maybe used a little
mascara once in a while.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.440
Even as Zoe took no
part of her own style

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.170
from her, if she
had to be honest,

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.910
she dressed a bit like
her other mother, Tea,

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:06.050
who now spoiled her
with clothes on visits.

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:08.700
Zoe did admire the
way Sandy looked.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.835
She admired a lot about
her mother, really.

00:56:10.835 --> 00:56:13.630
She admired the way she hadn't
hid from Zoe the pain of Tea

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:15.240
leaving her, but she
rarely badmouthed

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.874
or castigated Tea herself.

00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:19.290
And given that Tea had departed
with a load of their money

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.310
and a note including the words
'like anyone else would have

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:23.584
loved you,' she would
have had plenty of reason.

00:56:23.584 --> 00:56:25.500
She admired how Sandy
treated Zoe's boyfriends

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.124
in high school, the
ones she dragged up

00:56:27.124 --> 00:56:29.420
from south or the U of O--
because no gay boys were out

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.960
at her own school-- and how
Sandy welcomed them and cooked

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.220
for them even when sometimes
they were snotty to her.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.095
She admired the sex
talks Sandy had given her

00:56:36.095 --> 00:56:37.910
when she was really
young, before puberty.

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:39.660
Sandy had told her,
'Now, this is a thing

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.430
that teenagers and adults like
to do, and they get to do.

00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:43.060
Kids don't.

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.010
It's not a kid thing.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:46.010
You won't even want to
do it, and you shouldn't.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:48.650
But this is what'll
happen when you're older.

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:50.070
And it can be wonderful.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.410
But it is important you're safe.

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.650
There's a safe way to
do it and an unsafe way.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.000
And it's like driving
without a seat belt,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.620
where if something bad
happens, you can die.

00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.930
But if you're safe,
it gives you freedom.

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:00.290
You can't imagine the
happiness and the freedom.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.460
When you're older, I will help
you, and we can talk about it.

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.830
This is something I
want you to do right,

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:05.871
and it's something I want
you to look forward to.

00:57:05.871 --> 00:57:08.762
I want this to be a good and
healthy part of your life,' she

00:57:08.762 --> 00:57:09.675
had said.

00:57:09.675 --> 00:57:12.324
And Zoe really admired that,
especially when she found out

00:57:12.324 --> 00:57:13.740
about all of Sandy's
friends who'd

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.300
died during what she had
only referred to as a plague.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.050
Zoe had remembered a
few of them from when

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:21.960
she was a kid, but only
faintly, and only a few.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.480
'Thanks for your time, sir,'
Zoe said to her last call.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.770
'Yeah, yeah, good night,
ma'am,' the man grumbled.

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:28.910
Zoe folded the drawings she
made, thought of sticking them

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:30.743
in her bag, then dropped
them in the trash--

00:57:30.743 --> 00:57:33.760
not the recycling, the trash.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.270
'So New York, huh?' the
supervisor asked as they left

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:39.900
their building
together after work.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.150
'Why'd you come here?'

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:44.210
Zoe was really tired of
answering that question.

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:45.550
And lately, she'd
just been snapping,

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:47.140
'I'm helping my
mom' in a tone that

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.140
made everyone think her
mom had a deadly illness

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.480
and needed Zoe to tend to
her last days or something.

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.310
It usually got people
to leave her alone.

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.335
But when she said that
now, her super--" whew.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.145
Too much coffee.

00:58:00.145 --> 00:58:02.662
"But when she said that now,
her supervisor just said, 'Huh.

00:58:02.662 --> 00:58:03.995
But do you like it here, though?

00:58:03.995 --> 00:58:06.670
Like, do you think you want
to stay here in Eugene?'

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:10.170
Zoe considered how to
answer that to a stranger.

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:13.250
'Well, I grew up
here,' she said softly.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.750
Walking down dark and slick
Willamet Street with her hoodie

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:17.690
up in the sprinkle-mist
rain, it occurred to her

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:19.910
that she'd walked these streets
late often since coming back,

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.290
but hadn't been propositioned
or harassed once in Eugene,

00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:25.064
or made to feel unsafe
in any way, really.

00:58:25.064 --> 00:58:27.480
When Zoe was a kid, she thought
she lived in a great town.

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.730
She thought no place was
better than this little city,

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:32.114
a term Tea had liked to
use-- 'Oh, this little city.'

00:58:32.114 --> 00:58:34.280
Zoe didn't like the
neighborhood they'd ended up in,

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.470
a weird little bumpkin and
religious yuppie enclave,

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:38.440
but she loved downtown
and she love the U of O.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.080
And she even loved the
dumb political battles

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.705
that played out in
the city-- bike paths

00:58:41.705 --> 00:58:43.910
through the Catholic school,
the cross in Skinner's Butte,

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:46.201
where to build the new
hospital, all the little clashes

00:58:46.201 --> 00:58:49.320
between right and left,
hippies and Mormons, developers

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:49.820
and enviros.

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.380
It had felt like
that stupid idea

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.270
of what America
was supposed to be.

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:54.580
And no one was from there.

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:55.879
It was a place you moved to.

00:58:55.879 --> 00:58:57.420
Even from middle
school on, it seemed

00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.890
like being born in town
put her in the minority.

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.620
And when she was a
teenager, leaving just

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:02.460
didn't occur to her.

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.770
Like, why would you do that
if you were lucky enough

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:05.714
to be from here?

00:59:05.714 --> 00:59:07.630
She thought when she
left home that she'd just

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:08.990
get a room in a
house back downtown

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:11.323
by the [INAUDIBLE] Hall and
go be a stupid duck for four

00:59:11.323 --> 00:59:13.790
years, then get a job and
a little house of her own.

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:14.760
And there she be.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.090
There she be, as her mom
would say in one of her few

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:18.670
kept Midwesternism.

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:20.649
Zoe was rarely bitter
about being trans.

00:59:20.649 --> 00:59:23.190
If you needed to believe in the
possibility of unbitter trans

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:25.050
women, Zoe would be your girl.

00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:26.860
But she knew she
wouldn't have left

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.404
if it hadn't been for that.

00:59:28.404 --> 00:59:29.320
She would have stayed.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.540
She would have gone
to the country fair,

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.610
signed on with a coop,
checked in on her mom,

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:34.780
lived the beautiful
neoliberal American life.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.964
It had been so close.

00:59:35.964 --> 00:59:38.130
Hell, on the face of it,
the town in its current era

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:40.360
had been designed specifically
for someone like her.

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.590
Like, who else if not for
the fag kid of a woman

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:44.630
like Sandy, queer and
transplanted and a hippie

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:45.410
to boot?

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.560
Zoe had really always
thought it was a great town.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.130
She'd never hated it growing
up-- ever, ever, ever.

00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:52.325
But she knew that staying
meant a boy future,

00:59:52.325 --> 00:59:53.460
a pretend-to-be-cis future.

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.730
She didn't have the
strength to figure out

00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:56.730
the gender thing on
everyone she'd known.

00:59:56.730 --> 00:59:58.500
And she'd known that
in part from her mom.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.050
You couldn't transition
and keep everything else

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:01.020
in your life the same.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.110
It couldn't happen.

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:03.780
She tested it that
one summer by telling

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.738
a few friends about Sandy,
the ones she thought

01:00:05.738 --> 01:00:06.660
would react the best.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.500
And the looks on their
faces-- especially her

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.740
boyfriend's-- a
revulsion, a horror,

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.489
the things they said
about her mother.

01:00:13.489 --> 01:00:15.780
One just said simple dumb
stuff like, 'Oh, gross, she's

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.430
your dad.

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:17.500
That is fucked up.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.791
That is fucked up.'

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:20.166
And another said,
'Huh, well, she

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.270
was too pretty to
actually be real, anyway.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:24.760
Hey, maybe he'll be
a penguin next, huh?'

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.040
Though the worst was a
girl, a close friend, who

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.220
had looked ashen, then
said, 'You know, it sucks.

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.940
I knew she had
problems, but I still

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.890
looked up to her
as a strong woman.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.230
I thought I had this
strong woman in my life.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:37.240
I thought you had
this strong mother.'

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.430
Zoe clammed up about
telling anyone after that.

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:42.740
She didn't even mention
it to Frankie--"

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.239
an old best friend of hers.

01:00:44.239 --> 01:00:46.530
"And so when fall came and
she applied for and squeaked

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:48.113
into a fancy school
on the east coast,

01:00:48.113 --> 01:00:50.730
she saw for the first time in
her town a void, endless black.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.730
She would be forever
grateful she grew up there.

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:56.140
But the future she saw was
for some willowy gay kid--

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.800
lovely, but not her.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.300
I mean, everyone's
fucking attitudes

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.591
about trans stuff changed so
quickly after a few years.

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.190
Chaz, Thomas Beatie,
all those fucks--

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:04.710
had she been born
five years later,

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:06.210
she thought sometimes
she might have

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:07.830
felt like she could've stayed.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.260
So.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.882
Zoe was bitter about that.

01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:13.340
She looked away
from her supervisor

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.700
and adjusted her bag.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.280
'I don't mind it,'
she said quietly.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.240
'There's a lot of
worse places to be.'

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.830
'Oh, gee,' said the supervisor.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:20.580
'You have no idea.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.996
I love it here.' And he started
talking about his hometown

01:01:22.996 --> 01:01:25.625
in Arizona, and how there were
grocery stores and bars here

01:01:25.625 --> 01:01:26.430
in Eugene he just loved.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:27.810
And you'd never find
that where he was from,

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.280
and just even the people
were so nice, like they give

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.570
a shit about being
humans here, you know?

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.970
He had great eyes, and they
kind of sparked as he talked.

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:37.987
Zoe said, 'Uh-huh, totally,' and
decided to picture this guy Al

01:01:37.987 --> 01:01:40.070
lubed and naked until they
got to the bus station,

01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:42.236
where she returned some
texts and her supervisor got

01:01:42.236 --> 01:01:44.880
on the 24 going somewhere south.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.270
Thank you.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.020
[APPLAUSE]
