00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:12.087
Remember the time you fell off your bike
or bumped your head on a sharp corner?

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:15.417
Childhood injuries are things
we'd often like to forget,

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:20.118
but our bodies often carry the memories
in the form of scars.

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:24.798
So what are these unwanted souvenirs
and why do we keep them for so long

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:28.997
after that unintended vacation
to the emergency room?

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:32.122
The most common place we see scars
are on our skin,

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:35.968
a patch that looks slightly different
from the normal skin around it.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:39.093
Often, this is considered
an unfortunate disfigurement,

00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:42.225
while other times, deliberate
scarification has been used

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:46.881
in both traditional and modern cultures,
to mark a rite of passage

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.419
or simply for aesthetic decoration.

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:51.858
But the difference isn't only cosmetic.

00:00:51.858 --> 00:00:54.716
When we look at healthy skin tissue
under a microscope,

00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:57.454
we see the cells that perform
various functions

00:00:57.454 --> 00:01:02.575
connected by an extracellular
matrix, or ECM.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:06.056
This is composed of structural proteins,
like collagen,

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:09.635
secreted by specialized fibroblast cells.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:13.421
Well-arranged ECM allows for
transportation of nutrients,

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:17.245
cell-to-cell communication,
and cell adhesion.

00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:21.307
But when a deep wound occurs,
this arrangement is disrupted.

00:01:21.307 --> 00:01:26.378
During the process of wound healing,
collagen is redeposited at the wound site,

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:30.297
but instead of the basket-weave formation
found in healthy tissue,

00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:34.043
the new ECM is aligned
in a single direction,

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:39.710
impeding inter-cell processes,
and reducing durability and elasticity.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.766
To make matters worse,

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:45.370
the healed tissue contains
a higher proportion of ECM than before,

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:48.021
reducing its overall function.

00:01:48.022 --> 00:01:52.802
In the skin, the overabundance of collagen
interferes with its original functions,

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:54.119
like producing sweat,

00:01:54.144 --> 00:01:55.770
controlling body temperature

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:57.877
and even growing hair.

00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:03.269
The scar tissue is fragile, sensitive
to changes in temperature and sensation,

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.734
and should be kept in moist environments
to maximize healing.

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.443
This presence of excessive
fibrous connective tissue in an organ

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:15.038
is known as fibrosis,
and if that term sounds familiar,

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:19.320
it's because our skin is not the only
organ vulnerable to scarring.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.423
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder
that causes scarring of the pancreas,

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:28.011
while pulmonary fibrosis
is a scarring of the lungs,

00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:30.209
resulting in shortness of breath.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.087
Scarring of the heart and the buildup
of ECM following a heart attack

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:38.066
can inhibit its beating,
leading to further heart problems.

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:39.959
What's common to all these conditions

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.230
is that although it retains some
of the original functions,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.841
the scar tissue formed after a wound

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:49.525
is inferior to the native tissue
it replaces.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:51.030
However, there is hope.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.218
Medical researchers are now studying
what causes fibroblast cells

00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:58.224
to secrete excessive amounts of collagen

00:02:58.224 --> 00:03:00.816
and how we can recruit
the body's other cells

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:04.727
in regenerating and repopulating
the damaged tissue.

00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:08.712
By learning how to better control wound
healing and the formation of scar tissue,

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:11.085
we can utilize
the multi-billion-dollar budgets

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.844
currently used to address
the aftermath of wounding

00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:15.903
in a much more efficient manner,

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:19.312
and help millions of people live better
and healthier lives.

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:21.843
But until then, at least some of our scars

00:03:21.843 --> 00:03:26.009
can help us remember to avoid
the sorts of things that cause them.
