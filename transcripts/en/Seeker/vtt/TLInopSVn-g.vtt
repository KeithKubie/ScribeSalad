00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.629
On paper, chemistry looks like little Cs,
Hs, and Os,... flat… simple… but just

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.460
like a map versus a globe, that's just a representation:
not only are molecules three-dimensional,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.560
they're "handed"

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.349
Hey handymen and handywomen, Trace here on
DNews today.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.870
Scientists find incredible things in space
all the time.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.750
It's space, it's fantastic, but this find
is a doozy.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.970
Using sensitive radio telescopes, astronomers
found a complex organic molecule in interstellar

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.970
space.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.460
The molecule is propylene oxide and it was
found in a star-forming region near the centre

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.750
of our Milky Way galaxy.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.120
But it gets better, this discovery might show
that life on Earth is not as unique as we

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.480
may have thought.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.850
Propylene oxide is what’s known as a handed
molecule.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.430
Handed, in this case, doesn’t mean being
right or left handed like we’re used to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.699
it meaning, but hands are a good way to illustrate
what it does mean.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.250
Handed in this case means two molecules are
mirror images, they're similar, but flipped,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.500
they're asymmetrical!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.290
If you put your hands side by side, they mirror
each other, but put one on top of the other

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.970
and you’ll find they aren’t superimposable.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.040
And this is a super exciting find for scientists
because molecules on Earth are just like this

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040
too!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
Lemme explain.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.270
Handedness is a chemical property called chirality.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.230
And chirality matters because the building
blocks of life are chiral.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.800
For example: DNA only twists in a right-handed
screw… and only uses right-handed molecules

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.790
of the sugar ribose, but it also uses only
left-handed amino acids.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.920
Basically, different parts life evolved to
favour one “hand” over another, and scientists

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.300
have no idea why.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.530
Every living thing has somehow determined
it will use one, and only one of the chiral

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.800
molecules available in nature.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.530
And even though they exist, they're super
curious, because chiral molecules "have the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.780
same melting, boiling, and freezing points,"
and even produce the same spectra when they

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.780
emit light.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.220
But, even though they behave the same way,
they're not the same.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.590
Like a glove only fits on one hand, molecules
have to fit together in a very specific way,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.750
and, for some reason, life evolved so only
certain hands fit with each other.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.260
It's confusing, and crazy, but that's how
nature works!

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Why?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.260
We don't know!

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.450
A paper in Nature, posits asymmetrical molecules
may have evolved, because radioactive decay

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.350
destroys left-handed molecules more quickly,
leaving only right-handed ones.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.760
If this was also the case early in life's
evolution, it could explain why DNA is mostly

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.760
right-handed.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.330
Scientists also know that molecules large
enough with an electrical charge will find

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.000
their like type to bind with, meaning this
is among their chemical properties.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.610
But still, the scientists admit that "we may
never know" exactly why this happens.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.030
What we do know is this chirality is present
on Earth, and has been found in our solar

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.950
system as well, on both meteorites and in
comets.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.300
Of course, since we know life exists here…
we live here… it makes sense that we'd find

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.060
chiral molecules.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.190
Finding a chiral molecule in interstellar
space on the other hand (pun intended), means

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.220
chirality didn’t spring up on Earth.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.090
It makes it even more awesome.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.060
And that's exactly what the scientists found.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.260
So, if these chiral molecules existed in the
cloud of gas and dust that became our solar

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.020
system, they could have reached Earth via
a meteorite or comet.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.020
Which could help explain how life first formed
on Earth.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.170
And finding chiral molecules in interstellar
space has a similar implication: because these

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.320
molecules exist here, and now we know they
exist out there, that could mean, that organic

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.450
molecules as we know them could come together
on ANOTHER PLANET, or perhaps they already

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.450
have…

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.940
And as you might imagine: more research is
needed.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.480
Because they can't tell handedness from this
far away, scientists can’t tell yet which

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.220
handed version of propylene oxide they’ve
found…

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.960
Follow-up observations will use polarized
light to see if one version of the molecule

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.690
dominates space.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.230
Let's give them a hand, eh?

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.380
This isn't the only crazy thing found in space
lately, Atomic Oxygen was found on Mars!

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.310
And it sounds like some kind of Simpsonian
superhero, but it's not.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.900
Watch this video to find out what it is!

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.670
Up and At Dem!

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.570
Does stuff like this blow your mind?!

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.570
It totally blew mine.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.440
If you have any other crazy science you want
to know more about…
