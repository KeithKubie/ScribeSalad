00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.340
In this exercise, we'll be
looking at a problem, also

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.710
know as the coupons collector's
problem.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.500
We have a set of K coupons,
or grades in our case.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.230
And each time slot
we're revealed

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.210
with one random grade.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.230
And we'd like to know how long
it would take for us to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.900
collect all K grades.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.690
In our case, K is equal to 6.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.390
Now the key to solving
the problem

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.930
is essentially twofolds.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.980
First, we'll have to find a way
to intelligently define

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.050
sequence random variables that
captured, essentially,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.280
stopping time of this process.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.930
And then we'll employ the idea
of linearity of expectations

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.740
in breaking down this value
in simpler terms.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.260
So let's get started.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.440
We'll define Yi as the number
of papers till we see

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.910
the i-th new grade.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.420
 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.280
What does that mean?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.040
Well, let's take a look
at an example.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.069
Suppose, here we have a timeline
from no paper yet,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.740
first paper, second paper,
third paper,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.430
so on, and so forth.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.230
Now, if we got grade A on the
first slot, grade A minus on

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.020
second slot, A again on the
third slot, let's say there's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960
a fourth's slot, we got B.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.380
According to this process, we
see that Y1 is always 1,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.100
because whatever we got
on the first slot

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.810
will be a new grade.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.000
Now, Y2 is 2, because
the second paper is,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.190
again, a new grade.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.690
On the third paper we got a
grade, which is the same as

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.950
the first grade.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.150
So that would not
count as any Yi.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.940
And the third time we saw new
grade would now be paper four.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.490
According to this notation,
we're interested in knowing

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.600
what is the expected value of E
of Y6, which is the time it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.270
takes to receive
all six grades.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.180
So so far this notation isn't
really helping us in solving

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.290
the problem, but kind of just
staying a different way.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.290
It turns out, it's much easier
to look at the following

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.690
variable derived from the Yis.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.090
We'll define Xi as the
difference between Yi

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.700
plus 1 minus Yi.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.690
And in [? words, ?] it says, Xi
is a number of papers you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.950
need until you see the i plus
1-th new grade, after you have

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.840
received i new grade so far.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.450
So in this case, X1 will be if
we call 0, Y0, will be the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.030
difference between Y1 and
Y0, which is always 1--

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.270
that's X1.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.100
And the difference between
these two will be X2.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.100
And the difference between
Y3 and Y2--

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.685
Sorry.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:51.590
It should be Y X0,
1, 2, and so on.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.610
OK?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.040
Through this notation we see
that Y6 now can be written as

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.700
the summation of i equal
to 0, 2, 5, X, i.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.580
So all I did was to break down
i6 into a sequence of

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.220
summation of the differences,
like Y. 6 Minus Y5, Y5 minus

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.960
Y4, and so on.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.060
It turns out, this expression
will be very useful.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.420
OK.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.280
So now that we have the two
variables Y and X, let's see

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.200
if it will be easier to look
at the distribution of X in

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.170
studying this process.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.370
Let's say, we have seen
a new grade so far--

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.400
one.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.660
How many trials would it
take for us to see

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.710
the second new grade?

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.720
It turns out it's
not that hard.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.790
In this case, we know there is
a total of six grades, and we

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.890
have seen one of them.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.920
So that leaves us five
more grades that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.290
we'll potentially see.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.740
And therefore, on any random
trial after that, there is a

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.560
probability of 5 over 6 that
we'll see a new grade.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.970
And hence, we know that X1 has
a distribution geometric with

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.350
a success probability,
or a parameter, 5/6.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.580
Now, more generally, if we
extend this idea further, we

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.019
see that Xi will have a
geometric distribution of

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.840
parameter 6 minus i over 6.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.120
And this is due to the fact that
so far we have already

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.630
seen i new grades.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.350
And that will be the success
probability of seeing a

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.480
further new grade.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.670
So from this expression, we know
that the expected value

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.780
of Xi will simply be the inverse
of the parameter of

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.730
the geometric distribution,
which is 6 over 6 minus i or 6

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.350
times 1 over 6 minus i.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.930
 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.600
And now we're ready to compute
a final answer.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.550
So from this expression we know
expected value of Y6 is

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.280
equal to the expected value of
sum of i equal to 0 to 5 Xi.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.360
 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.600
And by the linearity of
expectation, we can pull out

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:28.140
the sum and write it as 2,
5 expected value of Xi.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.220
Now, since we know that
expective of Xi is the

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.670
following expression.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.990
We see that this term is equal
to 6 times expected value of i

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.260
equals 0, 5, 1 over 6 minus i.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Or written in the other way
this is equal to 6 times i

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.356
equal to 0, 2, 5.

00:05:51.356 --> 00:06:03.510
In fact, 1, 2, 5, 1 over i.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.970
And all I did here was to,
essentially, change the

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.190
variable, so that these two
summations contained exactly

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.030
the same terms.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:20.840
And this will give us the
answer, which is 14.7.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.420
Now, more generally, we can
see that there's nothing

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.400
special about number 6 here.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.640
We could have substituted 6 with
a number, let's say, K.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:37.840
And then we'll get E of YK,
let's say, there's more than

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.580
six labels.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.030
And this will give us K times
summation i equal to 1, so K

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.740
minus 1, 1 over i.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.000
Interestingly, it turns out
this quantity has an

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.480
[? asymptotic ?]

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.170
expression that, essentially,
is roughly equal to K times

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.100
the natural logarithm of K.
And this is known as the

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.190
scaling [? la ?]

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.680
for the coupon collector's
problem that says,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.810
essentially, takes about
K times [? la ?]

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.650
K many trials until we collect
all K coupons.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.800
And that'll be the end
of the problem.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.050
See you next time.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.850
