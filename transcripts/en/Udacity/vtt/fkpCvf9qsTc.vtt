00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.380
If the ABO mRNA is the length of this string that you see here,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.790
which is about the width of a single parking space in a parking lot. Then

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.260
ABO gene, the DNA sequence that the mRNA comes from, what actually have to be

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.569
about 17 times the distance away from me. All the way down there to Loren.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.050
&gt;&gt; It's a really long way, guys.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.770
&gt;&gt; Now, like most genes, just like the ABO mRNA

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.520
transcript, all other genes, almost all other

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.490
genes have some kind of intronic regions to

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.080
cut out. So the mRNA is much shorter than the DNA sequence that it comes from.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.150
&gt;&gt; Matt, that was a long way. Seems like a waste of material though.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.240
&gt;&gt; I know it sounds like a lot, but there's a

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.510
reason for this. That reason's pretty advanced though, there's a lot going

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.450
on with exons and introns, and it's kind of out of the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.820
scope of our course. All I want you to know is that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.900
if a gene has more than one exon, all those introns have to be

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.220
spliced out so that we can get the complete MRNA with just the exons.
