[MUSIC]

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:10.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.290
ROBBIE: Hey, dad.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.764
Can I ask you a question?

00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:13.680
TODD: Why sure Robbie.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.824
That's what I'm here for.

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:17.490
ROBBIE: Yeah, speaking of which,
aren't you supposed to be like,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.370
at a job or something?

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.820
TODD: Listen Robbie, I'm
in between opportunities

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.620
right now.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.540
And so I'm taking that time
to build up my personal brand

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.690
and my social media presence.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.510
ROBBIE: Hmm.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.470
So you mean you're like, on
Twitter all day and stuff, dad?

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.132
TODD: It's grown up stuff.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:34.170
You wouldn't understand.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.540
Anyway, what's your question?

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.780
ROBBIE: Well, you remember last
time I installed a CocoaPod,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.330
its version number
had a squiggly arrow

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.530
in front of it and stuff?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.630
TODD: I sure do.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.430
ROBBIE: Well, you never really
did tell me what that means,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.550
dad.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.570
TODD: Why I guess
I didn't, did I?

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.817
Well, follow me, Robbie,
to the wall of knowledge.

00:00:52.817 --> 00:00:55.066
ROBBIE: Oh, you mean that
projector screen over there?

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.757
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.757 --> 00:00:56.590
TODD: Just watch me.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.456
So to answer your
question a little better,

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:04.830
I probably need
to explain to you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.790
what semantic versioning is.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.201
In semantic
versioning, libraries

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.700
have version numbers
that are broken

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.990
into three parts that look a
little something like this.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.020
Now, let's explore these
numbers from right to left.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.150
The number on the right
is the patch number.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.910
As a general rule,
anytime an author

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.100
makes any kind of bug
fix to their library that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.200
doesn't break backwards
compatibility--

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.710
and let's face it,
you shouldn't be

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.520
breaking backwards
compatibility for a bug

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.930
fix-- they increment
this number.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.750
The number in the middle is
the minor release number.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.360
Library authors
will increment this

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.560
when they add a new feature.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.140
But again, generally,
if they do it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260
in a backwards compatible way.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.450
Now the number on the left
is the major release number.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.960
Library authors
will increment this

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.670
when they make changes
to their code that

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.780
breaks backwards compatibility.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.200
ROBBIE: I think I get it.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.440
So, if you fixed a crash
bug in your library--

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.450
TODD: I might change the
version number to 1.4.8,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.120
as long as the change
is backwards compatible.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.610
ROBBIE: And if you
added a new feature?

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.470
TODD: I would change the
version number to 1.5.0.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.970
ROBBIE: OK.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.550
But let's say you
made a fix that

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.870
changed the signature of
some of your method calls.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.370
TODD: Right.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.580
Well, that's not
backwards compatible.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.265
So I might change
my version to 2.0.0.

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:15.765
ROBBIE: Oh.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:17.640
I get it.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.510
But wait.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.420
You still haven't explained what
the squiggly line means, dad.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.360
TODD: Well, let's say you
have version 1.4.7 installed.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.380
Would you want CocoaPods
to automatically

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.650
update your library to 1.4.8
when you call pod update?

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.930
ROBBIE: Well, that sounds safe.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.020
Because it's not breaking
the change, right?

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.060
You're just fixing
the crash bug.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.240
TODD: That's right.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.650
Now, let's say you
have version 1.4.8.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.590
Would you want CocoaPods
to automatically

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.452
update your library to 1.5.0
when you call pod update?

00:02:46.452 --> 00:02:50.690
ROBBIE: Well, yeah, I guess so.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.930
I mean, the developers have
just added new features.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.320
Nothing should break, right?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.950
TODD: Yeah, that's
probably true.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.942
ROBBIE: Probably?

00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:00.150
TODD: We'll get back to that.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.270
So here's the $64,000 question.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.940
Let's say you have
version 1.5.0.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.170
Would you want CocoaPods
to automatically

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.500
update your library to 2.0.0
when you call pod update?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.630
ROBBIE: Well, probably not.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.540
You've changed the
major version, which

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.360
means there's changes in
there that will break my code

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.777
and my project won't compile.

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:23.360
TODD: Correct.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.160
You got it.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.410
ROBBIE: Hooray!

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.470
But what does any
of this have to do

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.100
with the squiggly arrow, dad?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.610
TODD: So the
squiggly arrow means

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.000
that you're OK letting
CocoaPods automatically

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.580
upgrade your library,
but only if it

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.723
increments the last version
number you specified.

00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:41.690
ROBBIE: Hmm?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.160
TODD: Let's say you have
squiggly arrow 1.4.7.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.860
That means you're totally fine
having CocoaPods upgrade you

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.440
to 1.4.8, 1.4.9, and
1.4.10, but not 1.5.0.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.960
Similarly, squiggly
arrow 1.4 means

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.830
you're fine having
CocoaPods upgrade you

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.050
to 1.4.8, 1.4.9, 1.5.0,
1.6.2, but not, say, 2.0.0.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.030
ROBBIE: Well, what if I
have squiggly arrow 1 1?

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.720
TODD: Well, that means you're OK
having CocoaPods automatically

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.657
update your library to
just about anything.

00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:14.240
At that point you might as well
not include any version number

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.970
at all.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.660
ROBBIE: Well that seems
pretty worthless, dad.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.329
TODD: It is.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.495
Just like my brother-in-law.

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:20.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.620
ROBBIE: And what if I don't want
to use a squiggly line at all,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.220
dad?

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.280
TODD: CocoaPod supports a number
of operations all of which

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.190
work pretty much
like you'd expect.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.920
ROBBIE: OK.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.510
So, hmm, why would I ever
want to upgrade just the patch

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.250
version?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.845
It seems like I should be able
to upgrade the patch version

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:41.050
and and the minor
version anytime I want.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.010
Right, dad?

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.900
TODD: Well, in theory yes.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.420
In practice
sometimes you'll find

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.230
the developers do add small
breaking changes here or there

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.640
when they upgrade
their minor version.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.682
Maybe developers
making bug fixes,

00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:54.140
and it turns out
one of their fixes

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.300
adds another argument
to one of their methods.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.120
Well, you know, technically
it's non-backwards compatible.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.290
The API surface has changed.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.140
But changing the major
version seems pretty drastic

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.530
here for what's essentially
a minor bug fix.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.660
And so perhaps they compromise
and change the minor version

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.600
instead.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.130
Usually these situations
are pretty easy to fix.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.530
But they do happen.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.783
ROBBIE: But doesn't that break
the whole semantic versioning

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:18.464
rule?

00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:19.130
TODD: Well, yes.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.546
But it's important to remember
that semantic versioning is

00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:22.630
just a convention.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.330
Nobody anywhere is going to
enforce it, or eject a CocoaPod

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.610
that doesn't follow it.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.690
And so, there is a small
risk that your code

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.650
might break even when only the
minor version number changes.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.210
So you'll find that some
CocoaPod users are only

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.800
comfortable updating
their libraries

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.620
when the patch number changes.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.890
Other developers are OK
with updating their library

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.392
when the minor number changes.

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:43.850
It probably depends
on how much you

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.060
feel like living on the
edge, and how comfortable

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.960
you feel with a pod developer
following semantic versioning.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.350
ROBBIE: So what about Google?

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.395
Have they promised to
follow semantic versioning

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:54.954
in their CocoaPods, dad?

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.120
TODD: I think it's safe to
say most groups at Google

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.000
try to follow
semantic versioning.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.170
But the groups that are part
of the new, automated CocoaPod

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.520
publishing process are
a little better at it.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.970
ROBBIE: Well, that'll help
me sleep better at night.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.200
Say, does this squiggly line
have an official name dad?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.840
TODD: Yes, it's called
a twiddle wakka.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.250
ROBBIE: You're joking, right?

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.000
TODD: I don't joke
about things like this.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.260
So there you go son.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.130
All your questions about
the squiggly arrow answered.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.850
ROBBIE: Don't you mean the
twiddle wakka wakkas, dad?

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.212
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.212 --> 00:06:29.712
TODD: Oh.

00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:31.670
But seriously, correct me again
and I will cut your [BLEEP]

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.625
[BLEEP] off.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:35.346
[AUDIENCE GROAN]

00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:37.304
ROBBIE: Don't you mean
the twiddly wakkas, dad?

00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:41.400
TODD: But seriously,
correct me again,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.200
I'm going to ship you
off to military school.
