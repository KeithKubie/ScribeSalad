00:00:00.393 --> 00:00:04.708
What I wanna do in this video
is explore the types of 2D shapes

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:09.300
we can construct,
by taking planar slices of cubes.

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:11.158
So what am I talking about?

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:13.648
Let's say we wanna deconstruct a square:

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:19.581
How can we slice a cube with a plane
to get the intersection of this cube,

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:21.978
and that plane to be a square?

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.300
We'll imagine that that plane
we are to cut, just like this,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.277
the square is maybe the most obvious one,

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:31.632
so it cuts the top right over there,

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:35.950
it cuts the side, right over here,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.747
it cuts the side, I guess on the back
of the glass cube, where you will see it,

00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:41.405
right over there, dotted line,

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:46.915
and then it cuts this, right over here. 
So you can imagine a plane that did this,

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:50.369
and if I wanna draw the broader plane,
I can draw it like this.

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:53.568
Let me see if I can do a decent, 
an adequate job

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:57.736
at drawing the actual, 
as you see you'd say a part of the plane,

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:03.433
that is cutting this cube.
It will look - it could look something...

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:06.585
it could look something like this. 
And I can even color in

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:16.028
the part of the plane that you could 
actually see it the cube were opaque,

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:20.086
if you couldn't see through it. 
But if you could see through it

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:23.317
you would see this dotted line,
and the plane would look like that.

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:27.010
So a square is 
a pretty straightforward thing to get,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.594
if you're doing a planar slice of a cube.

00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:32.952
But what about a rectangle? 
How can you get that?

00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:34.601
And at any point, I encourage you:

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.120
Pause the video and try to think about it
on your own:

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.595
How can you get these shapes
that I'm talking about?

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:43.447
Well for a rectangle
you can actually cut like this:

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.593
So, if you cut this side like this,

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:49.703
and then cut that side like that,

00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:54.072
and then you cut this side like that
- I think you'd see where this is going,

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.758
this side like that,

00:01:56.758 --> 00:02:00.045
and then you cut the bottom,
right over there,

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:03.648
then the intersection of the plane
that you are cutting with;

00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:05.687
so, the intersection, let's see:

00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:08.761
This could be the plane 
that I'm actually cutting with,

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.840
so the intersection of the plane
that I'm cutting with,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.773
and my cube is going to be
a rectangle.

00:02:17.773 --> 00:02:22.621
So it might look like this, and once again
let me shade in the stuff,

00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:27.638
if you kind of view this, 
if you imagine the plane

00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:32.249
just like one of those huge blades
that magicians use to saw people in half,

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.211
or pretend like they are - they give us

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:36.023
the illusion of sawing people in half,

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:37.706
it might look something like this.

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:40.415
Ok! So you'll go like: 
"Ok, that's not so hard to digest,

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:45.765
that if I intersect a plane with a cube,
I can get a square, I can get a rectangle.

00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:48.017
But what about triangles?"

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.507
Well, once again pause the video
if you think you can figure it out,

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:56.541
triangles are not so bad. 
You can cut this side over here,

00:02:56.541 --> 00:03:00.938
this side right over here,

00:03:00.938 --> 00:03:04.223
and this side right over here,

00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:07.200
and then, this is it - of course 
I can keep drawing the plane,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.673
but I think you get the idea -

00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:09.914
this would be a triangle.

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:12.735
There's different types of triangles
that you can construct.

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:15.741
You could construct
an equilateral triangle,

00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:22.340
so as long as this cut is the same length
as this cut right over here,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.661
is the same length as that upper length,

00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:27.556
or the length that intersects 
on this space of the cube,

00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:29.467
that's gonna be an equilateral triangle.

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:34.779
If you pushed this point up more,
actually I'd do that in a different color,

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:40.064
you were going to have 
an isosceles triangle.

00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:44.234
If you were to bring this point
really, really close, like here,

00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:50.004
you would approach having a right angle, 
but it wouldn't be quite a right angle:

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:53.767
you'd still have these angles
who'd still be less than 90º,

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:56.681
you can approach 90º.
So you can't quite have

00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:00.461
an exactly a right angle, 
and so since you can't get to 90º,

00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:04.031
sure enough you can't get near to 91º,
so actually you're not gonna be able to do

00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:05.637
an obtuse triangle either.

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:08.630
But you can do an equilateral, 
you can do an isosceles,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.016
you can do scalene triangles.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:13.406
I guess you could say you could do
the different types of acute triangles.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.230
But now let's do 
some really interesting things:

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:21.816
Can you get a pentagon
by slicing a cube with a plane?

00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:24.870
And I really want you to pause the video
and think about it here,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.166
because that's such a fun thing. 
Think about it:

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:31.421
How can you get a pentagon
by slicing a cube with a plane?

00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:33.659
All right, so here I go,

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.911
this is how you can get a pentagon
by slicing a cube with a plane:

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.600
Imagine slicing the top
- we'll do it a little bit different -

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:49.733
so imagine slicing the top, 
right over there, like this,

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:54.751
Imagine slicing this backside, 
like that,

00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:58.166
this back side that you can see,
quite like that,

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:05.688
now you slice this side,
right over here, like this,

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:09.633
and then you slice this side
right over here, like this.

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:13.437
This could be,
and alike I'm gonna draw the plane

00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:16.403
- yet maybe it won't be so obvious
if I try to draw the plane -

00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:20.777
but you get the actual idea:
if I slice this, the right angle

00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:24.108
(not any right angle - 90º - 
but 'the right angle' - the proper angle.

00:05:24.108 --> 00:05:27.452
Actually I shouldn't use 'right angle',
that would confuse everything.)

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.703
If I slice it in the proper angle,

00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:32.415
that I'm doing 
with the intersection of my plane

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:37.796
then my cube is going to be
this pentagon, right over here.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.779
Now let's up the stakes something,
let's up the stakes even more!

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.794
What about a hexagon?

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:48.363
Can I slice a cube in a way,
with a 2D plane,

00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:52.406
to get the intersection of the plane
on the cube being a hexagon?

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.981
As you could imagine, 
I wouldn't have asked you that question

00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:59.173
unless I could. 
So let's see if we can do it.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:06.749
So if we slice this, right over there,
if we slice this bottom piece,

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:12.423
right over there,
and then you slice this back side,

00:06:12.423 --> 00:06:21.436
like that, and then you slice
the side that we can see right over there,

00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:23.844
(This side, I could have made it
much straighter)

00:06:23.844 --> 00:06:26.069
So hopefully you get the idea!

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.367
I can slice this cube
so that I can actually get a hexagon.

00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:34.282
So, hopefully, this gives you 
a better appreciation

00:06:34.282 --> 00:06:37.116
for what you could actually do 
with a cube,

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:41.613
especially if you're busy slicing it
with large planar planes

00:06:41.613 --> 00:06:45.753
- or large planar blades, in some way -

00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:49.412
There's actually more to a cube
that you might have imagined in the past.

00:06:49.412 --> 00:06:53.061
When we think about it,
there's six sides to a cube,

00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.042
and so it's six surfaces to a cube,

00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:58.160
so you can cut 
as many as six of the surfaces

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.848
when you intersect it with a plane,

00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:02.227
and every time you cut 
into one of those surfaces

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:04.842
it forms a side. 
So here we're cutting into four sides,

00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:07.371
here we're cutting into four surfaces
of four sides,

00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:10.129
here we're cutting into three,
here we're cutting into five

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.705
- we're not cutting into the bottom
of the cube, here -

00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:17.651
and here we're cutting into all six
of the sides, all six of the surfaces,

00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:20.700
of the faces of this cube.
