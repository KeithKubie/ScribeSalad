00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
go into an interview try and they do
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.350
go into an interview try and they do
this when they write essays to is try to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
this when they write essays to is try to
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.390
this when they write essays to is try to
tell the interviewers what you think

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
tell the interviewers what you think
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.770

they want to hear but you can bloody

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
they want to hear but you can bloody
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240
they want to hear but you can bloody
well be sure that virtually everybody

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
well be sure that virtually everybody
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.100
well be sure that virtually everybody
who's being interviewed is gonna do that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
who's being interviewed is gonna do that
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.910
who's being interviewed is gonna do that
and I don't think that's very advisable

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
and I don't think that's very advisable
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310
and I don't think that's very advisable
because if you don't manifest yourself

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
because if you don't manifest yourself
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.399
because if you don't manifest yourself
the way you are then there's no way that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
the way you are then there's no way that
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.560
the way you are then there's no way that
the path that's proper for you can

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
the path that's proper for you can
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749
the path that's proper for you can
reveal itself I know that sounds sort of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
reveal itself I know that sounds sort of
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.190
reveal itself I know that sounds sort of
mystical but I don't know how to put it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
mystical but I don't know how to put it
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.310
mystical but I don't know how to put it
any better the best way to stand out in

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
any better the best way to stand out in
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.340
any better the best way to stand out in
an interview always assuming you're

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
an interview always assuming you're
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.539
an interview always assuming you're
competent and that you've done the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
competent and that you've done the
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.859
competent and that you've done the
preparation you know and that you're not

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
preparation you know and that you're not
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.950
preparation you know and that you're not
living a lie is to actually say what you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
living a lie is to actually say what you
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.160
living a lie is to actually say what you
think and hopefully what will happen is

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
think and hopefully what will happen is
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.770
think and hopefully what will happen is
that there will be other people on the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
that there will be other people on the
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569
that there will be other people on the
panel that's this that are looking at

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
panel that's this that are looking at
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.410
panel that's this that are looking at
you who are of the same type and that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
you who are of the same type and that
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179
you who are of the same type and that
would characterize a good position for

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
would characterize a good position for
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.499
would characterize a good position for
you a good place to be if there are

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
you a good place to be if there are
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.569
you a good place to be if there are
people like that and they'll know what

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
people like that and they'll know what
 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.789
people like that and they'll know what
you're doing and that will that would

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
you're doing and that will that would
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.620
you're doing and that will that would
then they'll think you know that person

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
then they'll think you know that person
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840
then they'll think you know that person
you know they're there they'd be good

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
you know they're there they'd be good
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609
you know they're there they'd be good
they're straightforward they're honest

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
they're straightforward they're honest
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.219
they're straightforward they're honest
they're they're tough they're they can

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
they're they're tough they're they can
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.380
they're they're tough they're they can
say what they think and if there aren't

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
say what they think and if there aren't
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850
say what they think and if there aren't
people like that on the panel then I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
people like that on the panel then I
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.080
people like that on the panel then I
would say you probably don't want to go

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
would say you probably don't want to go
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.260
would say you probably don't want to go
there anyways

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270
there anyways
 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.540
there anyways
so that's what I would that's what I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550
so that's what I would that's what I

so that's what I would that's what I
would do be true to yourself you know

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460
would do be true to yourself you know
 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.790
would do be true to yourself you know
but that also assumes that you've done

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800
but that also assumes that you've done
 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.710

your homework and that you're prepared
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.240

the odd cynic in there who's trying to
 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.490
the odd cynic in there who's trying to
figure out a reason to give you an X and

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500
figure out a reason to give you an X and
 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.610
figure out a reason to give you an X and
check you off the list but most of the

check you off the list but most of the
 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.050
check you off the list but most of the
people sitting there if they have a clue

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
people sitting there if they have a clue
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.940

candidates and they're gonna assume that
you're you've hit threshold and so it's

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630
you're you've hit threshold and so it's
 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.960
you're you've hit threshold and so it's
