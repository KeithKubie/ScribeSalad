you're in a state of way and this is why

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
you're in a state of way and this is why
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319
you're in a state of way and this is why
these early thinkers want way because

success so if you're a Confucian getting

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
success so if you're a Confucian getting

and this allows you to attract followers

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
and this allows you to attract followers
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.450
and this allows you to attract followers
without having to force them or try to

without having to force them or try to
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.770
without having to force them or try to
get them to follow you people just

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
get them to follow you people just
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.450
get them to follow you people just
spontaneously want to follow you if

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
spontaneously want to follow you if
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.450
spontaneously want to follow you if
you're a Taoist it's what relaxes people

without harm so everybody wants this
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.880
without harm so everybody wants this
because it's a very it's the key to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
because it's a very it's the key to
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.880
because it's a very it's the key to
success but they're all involved in this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
success but they're all involved in this

success but they're all involved in this
tension then of how do you try to be

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
tension then of how do you try to be
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399
tension then of how do you try to be
effortless how do you try not to try so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
effortless how do you try not to try so
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.780
effortless how do you try not to try so
the first strategy is the early

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
the first strategy is the early
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639
the first strategy is the early
Confucian strategy which I refer to as

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
Confucian strategy which I refer to as
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010
Confucian strategy which I refer to as
carving and polishing strategy which is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
carving and polishing strategy which is
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230
carving and polishing strategy which is
essentially you're gonna try really hard

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
essentially you're gonna try really hard
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.690
essentially you're gonna try really hard
for a long time and if you do that

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
for a long time and if you do that
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.389
for a long time and if you do that
eventually the trying will fall away and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
eventually the trying will fall away and
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.580
eventually the trying will fall away and
you'll be spontaneous in the right way

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
you'll be spontaneous in the right way
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.490
you'll be spontaneous in the right way
so you practice ritual you engage in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
so you practice ritual you engage in
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.170
so you practice ritual you engage in
learning with fellow students and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
learning with fellow students and
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240
learning with fellow students and
eventually somehow at some point you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
eventually somehow at some point you
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.490
eventually somehow at some point you
make the transition from trying to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
make the transition from trying to
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320
make the transition from trying to
having internalized these things you're

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
having internalized these things you're
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.860
having internalized these things you're
learning and being able to embody them

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
learning and being able to embody them
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.370
learning and being able to embody them
and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
and
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.060
and
for this way the second strategy the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070
for this way the second strategy the
 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.680
for this way the second strategy the
uncarved block or going back to nature

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
uncarved block or going back to nature
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.220
uncarved block or going back to nature
strategy is the daodejing or the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
strategy is the daodejing or the
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.070
strategy is the daodejing or the
primitive s Taoist and they essentially

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080
primitive s Taoist and they essentially
 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.470
primitive s Taoist and they essentially
think the Confucian strategy is doomed

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
think the Confucian strategy is doomed
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.680
think the Confucian strategy is doomed
if you are trying to be virtuous if

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
if you are trying to be virtuous if
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.940
if you are trying to be virtuous if
you're trying to be a Confucian

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
you're trying to be a Confucian
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.920
you're trying to be a Confucian
gentleman you're never gonna be a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
gentleman you're never gonna be a
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.930
gentleman you're never gonna be a
Confucian gentleman anyone trying to be

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
Confucian gentleman anyone trying to be
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.550
Confucian gentleman anyone trying to be
benevolent is never gonna actually be

benevolent is never gonna actually be
 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.780
benevolent is never gonna actually be
benevolent they're just going to be this

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
benevolent they're just going to be this
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.530
benevolent they're just going to be this
hypocrite and so their strategy is undo

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540
hypocrite and so their strategy is undo
 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.990
hypocrite and so their strategy is undo
all this learning that you've been

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
all this learning that you've been
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240

taught so get rid of culture get rid of
learning actually physically drop out of

there's good points to this strategy -

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
there's good points to this strategy -
 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.530
there's good points to this strategy -
one of the main insights I think of the
