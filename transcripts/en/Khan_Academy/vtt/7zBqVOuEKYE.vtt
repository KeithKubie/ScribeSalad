00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:01.802
Male: We finished the last video with

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:04.279
the scenario where company A wants

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.670
to buy company B,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.537
but they're not going to do it with cash,

00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:09.869
they're going to do it with their shares.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.693
They issue a press release saying

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:14.474
that company A intends
to acquire company B

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:18.281
for $60 million in A's shares.

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:21.003
They want to give a price that's a premium

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.403
to company B's current market cap

00:00:23.403 --> 00:00:24.610
so that it's compelling,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.277
so that the shareholders of
company B want to do this.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.408
They're like, wow, that's a 20% premium

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:32.615
to our current market cap,
so we're willing to do it.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.950
Since this is a share transaction,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.611
company B shareholders won't
exactly get $60 million.

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.608
What's going to happen
is company A's going

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.737
to issue 2 million in new shares.

00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:45.073
Those 2 million new shares, in theory,

00:00:45.073 --> 00:00:46.803
could be worth $30 a share.

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:48.535
Maybe they could sell
them in the open market

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:51.723
at $30 a share so that they
would be worth $60 million.

00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:53.335
Instead of trying to raise the cash

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.337
and then giving the cash to company B,

00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:57.435
they're just going to
take those shares directly

00:00:57.435 --> 00:01:00.707
and exchange them for all
of the shares of company B,

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:03.673
essentially acquiring the
company with all of those shares.

00:01:03.673 --> 00:01:06.857
Every shareholder of company
B, for every share they have,

00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:09.123
they'll get 2 shares of company A.

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:12.788
If at the time of closing, company A's

00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:15.988
stock price goes from $30 to $35 a share,

00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:17.853
then the transaction price would,

00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:20.191
if you think about the
market value of those shares

00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:22.191
that company B's shareholders
are going to get,

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:24.603
the market price would
actually be $70 million.

00:01:24.603 --> 00:01:27.830
If the market price of company A goes down

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.073
to $25 a share, then
they're only going to get

00:01:31.073 --> 00:01:34.738
$50 million worth of shares.

00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:36.557
What I want to think
about in this situation

00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:40.062
is what should happen to company B's stock

00:01:40.062 --> 00:01:44.399
before the transaction
closes, if we assume

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.006
that everyone thinks the
transaction is going to happen?

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.776
Let me draw a stock chart here.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:54.743
This is price.

00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:58.718
This is time right over here.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.326
Let me draw company B's stock price first.

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:05.989
Let's say right now it is
trading at $50 a share.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:07.051
That is company B.

00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:13.858
Right now company A's
trading at $30 a share.

00:02:13.858 --> 00:02:15.662
Notice even though that their share price

00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:17.585
is lower than company B's share price,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.533
they have a much larger market cap

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.124
because they have many, many more shares.

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:22.512
They actually are a larger company

00:02:22.512 --> 00:02:26.195
so it doesn't sound crazy for
them to acquire company B.

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:30.251
Now, this is the day that
everything was announced.

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:33.852
Let's just assume that everyone thinks

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.336
the transaction will happen.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:39.253
For every share of B a B shareholder has,

00:02:39.253 --> 00:02:41.620
they will get 2 shares of company A.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.522
If company A does this, what should happen

00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:49.338
to company B's stock price if everyone

00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:53.417
is 100% sure the
transaction's going to happen?

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:58.580
Every share of B is going to be converted

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.662
into 2 shares of A.

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:02.839
After this point in time, if you're sure

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.522
the transaction's going to happen,

00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:07.673
each of these B shares
should be worth 2 A shares,

00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:09.787
so they should trade exactly at twice

00:03:09.787 --> 00:03:11.584
the value of the A shares.

00:03:11.584 --> 00:03:13.716
Right when the transaction was announced,

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:15.518
if everyone assumes it's going to occur,

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:21.452
B shares should immediately
jump up to $60 a share,

00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:27.852
and then they should always
trade at double of A's shares.

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:32.112
If they trade at less
than double of A's shares,

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.421
then, instead of buying A shares, people

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.671
would rather buy B
shares, or they could buy

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:38.670
half of B shares.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.948
Or let's say there was
someone who was going

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:42.129
to buy 2 of A shares, instead they'll say,

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.796
"Hey, look, B shares are
trading for less than

00:03:43.796 --> 00:03:46.185
"2 of A shares, but
they're going to be worth

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:48.656
"2 of A shares in the future
because of this merger,

00:03:48.656 --> 00:03:51.458
"so I'm just going to
buy B shares instead."

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:54.185
There's no reason, if everyone assumes

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:56.188
the transaction's happening, that before

00:03:56.188 --> 00:03:58.527
the transaction closes that B shouldn't

00:03:58.527 --> 00:04:02.527
trade at exactly twice
the stock price of A.
