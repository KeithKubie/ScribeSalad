00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.010
Joelle is working on a school
report in a word processor.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.880
She wants to place a figure
which is 13.09 centimeters wide

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.550
so that it appears
centered on the page.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.200
The width of the page
is 21.59 centimeters.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.540
How much margin should
she leave on the left

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.130
so that the figure is centered?

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.020
So let's visualize
what's going on.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.060
We have a page that's
21.59 centimeters wide.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.160
So this distance right over
here is 21.59 centimeters.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.720
So this right over
here, that is our page.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.530
Let me draw the actual page.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.270
Let me draw that in white,
since paper tends to be white.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.510
So this is her page.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.385
It's 21.59 centimeters wide.

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:50.380
It's just like that.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.970
It's a little unusual
dimension for a piece of paper.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.062
But we'll go with it.

00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:55.770
And then she wants to
place a figure that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.930
is 13.09 centimeters wide
in the center of the page.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.515
So the figure-- I'll
do it in magenta.

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:05.580
That's not magenta.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.690
The figure is 13.09 centimeters.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.670
So let's say that this is
the figure right over here.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.620
So this is the
figure that she wants

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.690
to place in the
middle of the page.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.880
So this is 13.09 centimeters.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.180
So the question is, how
much margin should she

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.230
leave on the left so that
the figure is centered?

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.560
So they're really asking,
what should this distance

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.370
be here so that the
figure is centered?

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.720
And the key thing is, if
the figure is centered,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.990
this distance is going to be
the same as this distance,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.060
so that the figure is
right in the middle.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.700
Whatever this is, it's going
to be the same as this.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.360
So one way we could
think about it--

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.150
we could say, OK, let's take
13.09 centimeters from 21.59

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.720
centimeters.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.650
And if we do that,
then we'll know

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.190
how much leftover space
this plus this combined is.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.540
And then we just want to
split that space in half.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.430
We want half of it to
go on the right side,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.070
and we want half of it
to go on the left side.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.440
So let's see how much this left
margin and the right margin

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.920
combined need to be.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.330
And that's just 21.59.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.410
That's just going to be
21.59 centimeters minus 13.09

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.120
centimeters.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.920
And this, we get to-- let's see.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:38.262
This is 8.50 centimeters,
which is the combined margins.

00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:39.970
Not just the left or
not just the right--

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.910
this is the left plus the right
margin, is 8.50 centimeters.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.880
This is this distance
plus this distance.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.630
Now, if we want to figure out
what the left margin should be,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.630
if we want to center it.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.470
Well, we just want
to split this evenly

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.370
between the left and
the right margin.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.780
So we just want to
divide this by 2.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.870
So if you divide 18.50 by 2--
or multiply it by 1/2, I guess.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.460
That might be a little bit
more obvious-- either way.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.260
So if we multiply this by 1/2,
you are left with 1/2 of 8.50,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.810
is 4.25 centimeters.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.790
So if we want it
centered, this is

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.420
going to be 4.25 centimeters.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.360
And of course, this is going to
be 4.25 centimeters, as well.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.200
And you see, when
you add 4.25 to 4.25,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.990
you get 8.5 centimeters.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.410
And then you add that to 13.09.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.730
You get the entire width
of the piece of paper.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.290
So how much margin should
she leave on the left?

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.602
4.25 centimeters.
