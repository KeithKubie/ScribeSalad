00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How do we compute such statistical correlations?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The Pearson correlation coefficient is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
perhaps the best known indicator of correlation,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but this is suitable only for linear dependents.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That is if you have 2 ranges of values.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What we want instead is a correlation

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
between 2 binary values.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
On 1 side we have the outcome of the run,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
either fail or pass.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then for each line we know that it's either covered or uncovered.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we want to come up with a correlation

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
between coverage on one side,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and outcome of the run on the other side.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So the Pearson correlation coefficient is not appropriate for this.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But there is another measure for such correlation,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and it was also invented by Pearson.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's called the Phi coefficient.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The Phi coefficient starts with a table.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In this table you count how frequently

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
a line was covered in failing runs

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
as well as in passing runs.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And of course you also count how frequently

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it was not covered in failing runs

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
as well as in passing runs.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
These 4 values take the names N11, N10, N01, and N00, respectively.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Where the first digit stands for covered versus uncovered,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and the second digit stands for fail versus pass.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You also compute sums over all rows

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
as well as sums over all columns

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
as well as the total sum of events.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This then is the Phi coefficient.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It consists of multiplying the values in the first diagonal

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and subtracting the product of the second diagonal.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This is then normalized according to the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
square root of the sums of the columns and rows.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The Phi coefficient is high if 1 diagonal has a high value

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and the other diagonal has a low value.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If it is this diagonal, which has a high value that's down here,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
then it becomes positive.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If it's this diagonal, which has a higher value,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
then it becomes negative.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So the higher the value in 1 diagonal

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and the lower the value in the other diagonal,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the stronger the correlation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Our plan now is we compute the Phi correlation for each line,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then we rank the lines from high correlation to low correlation.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And we start, of course, with the strongest correlation.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Let me illustrate how the Phi coefficient

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is computed on a simple example.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's assume that we have a line in our program and a number of runs.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In the first run, line 10 is executed, and the run fails.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So what we enter in the table for this line is that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we now have seen 1 instance where it covered and failed.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Next thing that happens with this line is that it's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
not covered and the run passes.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So we add a 1 in this part of the table.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Next thing we see, it's covered and it fails.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So the value on that table becomes 2.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And then again, we see uncovered and it passes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So now we have seen 2 instances

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
of the line being uncovered and passing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Let's assume these are just the 4 runs that we observe.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Then we have seen no instance of the line being covered and passing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and no instance of the line being uncovered and failing.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Let's quickly sum up the remaining rows and columns.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We have seen 2 instances where the line was covered

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and 2 where it was uncovered.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We have seen 2 instances where it failed

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and 2 instances where it passed.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The total number of events is 4.
