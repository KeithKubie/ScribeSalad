00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:50.590
is to find the plants that have the
 

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.380
is to find the plants that have the
activities that people are interested in

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:52.390
activities that people are interested in
 

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.140
activities that people are interested in
that's the first stage fingerprint them

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.150
that's the first stage fingerprint them
 

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.580
that's the first stage fingerprint them
so we have an idea of the chemistry

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:56.590
so we have an idea of the chemistry
 

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.730
so we have an idea of the chemistry
that's associated with the bio activity

00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740
that's associated with the bio activity
 

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.850
that's associated with the bio activity
and that is a really key element of the

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:02.860
and that is a really key element of the
 

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.670
and that is a really key element of the
the projects that we're doing Monique

the projects that we're doing Monique
 

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.500
the projects that we're doing Monique
and her team have modeled unique
