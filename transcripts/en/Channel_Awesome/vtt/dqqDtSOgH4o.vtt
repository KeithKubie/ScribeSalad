00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.880
*raspy moans*

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.280
Workshed.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.720
*clings and clanks*

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.420
That's right, you guys guessed it:

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.540
this Halloween build is gonna be

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.740
Ash's chainsaw hand

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.040
from the Evil Dead films.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.420
Now as I said, you guys had a lot of great suggestions,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.300
and I will get to most of them.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.400
But we had several people request this,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.520
and to be honest, it's one of my favourite film franchises,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.360
and I've never built one before.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.920
So, rather than build one completely from scratch,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.460
which there are a lot of great tutorials out there

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.660
on how to build it using things like

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.800
an old gas can and some plywood,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.000
or even like a Tide bottle or some kind of detergent bottle or something

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.680
and converting that into one,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.820
I want mine to kind of work and because it's Halloween.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.020
There are tons of Halloween stores and party stores that have these fake chainsaws,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.240
And there's all kinds of coupons and stuff like that out there so you can get them pretty cheap.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.520
So this one, actually with a coupon, I got at a party store

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.380
for about 26 bucks.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.900
And what's cool about it,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.880
*chainsaw rev noise*

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.000
Is it's got a working chain.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.120
*chainsaw noise continues*

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.380
So what I'm gonna have to do is take it apart,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.960
and see how I can get a fist in there without moving too many components around

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.740
so that it still works, I wanna still have the sound effect,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.320
but I gotta be able to take this handle off and move the switch to the inside

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160
so that I can operate it within.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.340
Definitely gonna have to do some modifications to make it look a little bit more like Ash's.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.300
His kinda swoops down...

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.800
Yeah.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.880
Gonna have to cut some of this out.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.360
Add a piece of sheet metal.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.720
We're gonna have to build a metal handle and cut this one down, take this one off,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.760
and...

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.080
remove this bogus pull cord, knob thing here.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.120
Yeah. The other side....

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.860
the other side's pretty good.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.180
I mean obviously we're gonna have to paint it up, dirty it up.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.540
But for the most part, we've got a decent amount of work to do to it.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.980
All right, so some of the other items we're gonna be using:

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.640
there's a scrap piece of sheet metal,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.200
this wooden dowel,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.240
some aluminium flat bar,

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.020
this 3-inch pipe coupling,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.400
some various corner brackets,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.620
this little toggle switch,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.900
some various nuts and bolt and screws,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.840
and, so far, that's about it.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.900
This is what I'm going with, I hope you guys dig it.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.560
Kinda dive right in and see what this sucker looks like inside.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.960
All right so we just open that sucker up,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.900
then you can see there's quite a bit of room inside there,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.620
so it'd be easy to fit a hand.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.460
and removing the switch out of the handle was a piece of cake; it'll pop right off.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.000
The switch was still intact.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.100
So I took my pipe coupling and put it to the back,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.000
and traced it out with my Sharpie so that I knew where to make my cuts.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.180
I also did the same thing on the top where I was gonna cut it down

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.300
to kind of give it that reduced look that matches a little bit more to Ash's chainsaw.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.100
So using my plastic cutting bit on my rotary tool. I cut it out.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.920
Pulled that thing off.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.320
Then I went back over it after I finished cutting these out

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.440
with my sanding bit to kinda get rid of some of those rough edges.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.620
But, hand fits. Good enough.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.220
While I'm at it, I'm just gonna cut off that pull chain knob,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.920
because we're gonna replace that with our own.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.720
Yeah, get that thing out of there.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.520
So I cut the bar down because Ash's only has his like, on the side.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.800
His is cut down because we're gonna put the handle on the top.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.380
So once I cut out the top piece, and it's got that kind of reduced look,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.500
I'm gonna cut a piece of dowel; that's gonna be the inside of my handle.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.380
Then I made some lines down the center of another piece of dowel

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.920
and I'm gonna cut it down the middle.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.620
That's gonna be the top and bottom grip on the top handle

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.180
that we're going to cut and bend out of our flat bar.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.540
And that's gonna go across the top of the chainsaw.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.220
So I made some holes...

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.480
And the handles...

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.620
And then my flat bar, I just put in a vice

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.940
and bent it into the shape that I wanted.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.240
And that looks pretty good.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.300
I'm deciding how much I want it to come down,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.560
I'm gonna cut a piece off.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.900
I'm gonna need some of that flat bar to attach the inside handle,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.440
so we have something to grip inside of the chainsaw.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.100
So now I'm just cutting off my flat bar.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.200
Lookin' pretty good.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.140
I got my sheet metal. And it was thin enough sheet metal to where actually

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.720
I could cut it with a pair of hobby shears,

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.860
which made it a little bit easier to cut.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:26.080
Now I've got my little brackets and I am measuring where to make my holes

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.240
on the chainsaw and the coupling.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.540
The brackets themselves, I had to bend quite a bit

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.960
to kinda fit the contours of the chainsaw.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.260
I also used some aluminium strap...

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.380
'cause it's a little easier to work with and easier to bend.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.260
Once I made my measurements for my holes and drilled them out with my drill for my coupling,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:10.420
then I attached my brackets with just a screw, a nut, and a little lock washer in there so it didn't back out.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.600
Screw everything in snug.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.220
And then make sure that everything is lining up still before I attach everything.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.620
I'm putting another piece of dowel; it's gonna be my pull chain.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.660
Sanding it down, drilled a hole through the middle.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.800
I'm using a piece of rope that I had lying around the shop

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.100
to feed it through the hole for the pull chain.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.140
The other piece of dowel, I screwed to that piece of aluminium flat bar we had scrapped,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.040
And that's gonna attach to the inside of my chainsaw so I have something to grab on to.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.740
I'm gonna attach the switch to the inside of that.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.460
Once I have the handle secured,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.040
seems to fit pretty good,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:13.460
I'm gonna shoot a screw through the bottom into the dowel to hold it in place along with the bracket.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.400
Any excess wiring that I didn't need, I removed.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.440
There was actually a switch already in there that wasn't attached to anything,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.180
so I just removed that.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.340
All the other wiring, I taped using electrical tape

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.940
to get it out of the way.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.440
and the switch, I used electrical tape to attach the switch to the handle.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.820
Now the piece of plastic that I cut off the top, I sanded the edges down

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.180
so it still had that reduced look.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.220
And then I reglued the top part to the chainsaw with some hot glue.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.560
I drilled a hole through my piece of sheet metal where I can put my toggle switch.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.760
And then I put the sheet metal in place using some screws.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.660
Just on the sides.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.820
I used various hardware to kinda give it a look like it was build out of scrap pieces.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.280
Once everything is secured, I attached my pipe coupling.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.460
I had to feed these screws from the inside so that the screws weren't digging into my wrist.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.740
Also, that's the look the original one has, so...

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.420
Once I got everything into place and tightened everything down,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.180
make sure it's secure,

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.540
I taped everything off that I didn't want painted.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.320
I painted using krylon: I used a red gloss first

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.740
for the whole body of it.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:18.720
And then went back over it with a flat, darker red to kinda give it that worn look.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.460
Needed an oil and gas cap, so a couple of water bottle caps sufficed.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.240
Using some black latex paint I had laying around the shop.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.240
Watered it down,

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.520
and painted over all the crevices and cracks.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:09.340
With it painted in those cracks, I went right over it with a paper towel to remove any excess.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.580
This leave a really good dingy, grungy kinda look to it,

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.020
like it's covered in oil and dirt and stains.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.200
Gives it a nice weathered look.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.920
It's usually the paint job that sells any product.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.360
I sprayed the chainsaw blade with a nickel finish...

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.920
and did the same thing with the wash.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.580
Put black paint in all the cracks and crevices then immediately wiped it off,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.240
to give it that dingy, gritty look.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.680
*snaps and clicks*

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.820
*starts chainsaw*

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.000
Groovy.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.320
All right, well there it is- Ash's chainsaw hand from the Evil Dead movies.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.720
Overall I have to say I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.720
It was a little more involved than I actually originally  thought it was gonna be but, ah,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.840
*chuckle*

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.800
Few things that maybe you guys didn't notice when I was building:

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.660
I needed a gas and oil cap for the top, kinda forgot about it.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.940
But fortunately I drank a couple bottles of water while I was working

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.800
so I just painted the bottle caps and glued them to the top there.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.060
The pull cord is kinda loose, I think it looks kinda neat when it's kinda dangling.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.880
You could just glue it right to the actual chainsaw, but I like the way it kinda hangs a little bit

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.600
with the rope just kinda attached inside there.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.740
I hope you guys enjoyed watching this build as much as I enjoyed building it.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.640
It was a lot of fun and it gave me a great excuse to build one.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.620
It's something I've always kinda wanted to do and never gotten around to,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.740
so this gave me a great excuse.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.720
So thanks guys for the suggestions,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.180
and...

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.740
yeah.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.620
Until next time, keep watchin', keep buildin', enjoy your Halloween.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.000
Don't forget to look me up on Facebook at James "Jim" Jarosz,

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.080
And,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.800
uh...

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.300
Yeah.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.600
Thanks again for watching guys. You guys are awesome.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.980
See you next time.
