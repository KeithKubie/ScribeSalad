00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.800
Everybody’s got a secret, including some
of the biggest filmmakers in Hollywood.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.430
Even as millions of moviegoers enjoy their
projects in the theater, there are some things

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.420
the movie doesn’t reveal on the surface.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.900
Most will never stop to think about or realize
some shocking behind-the-scenes revelations…

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.900
until now.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.870
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 amazing secrets
about popular films.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.970
Kingsman: The Secret Service

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.760
A criticism about modern action movies is
that they’re sensory overload, flooding

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.960
the screen with CGI and too many special effects
to keep track of.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.190
Some aren’t sure what they’re supposed
to pay attention to.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.630
That isn’t a problem with Kingsman.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.320
When constructing the action sequences, director
Matthew Vaughn framed it so that all of the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.769
action is framed centrally, meaning that the
viewer’s eyes never have to leave the middle

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:47.769
of the frame.

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.190
That’s a nice touch that makes Kingsman
easier to watch, even if our brains didn’t

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.920
realize why everything was pleasant to follow.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.699
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.769
Whenever a franchise reboots and recasts a
legendary role like Mad Max, there’s sure

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.140
to be some audience skepticism – even when
the filmmakers land a talent like Tom Hardy.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
But before he took the part, Hardy had his
doubts as well, and even had lunch with Mel

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.820
Gibson, the original Max, to discuss the possibility.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.170
During their time, Gibson told Hardy he was
fine with Hardy taking up the role and gave

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.170
him his blessing.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.500
That was enough to convince Hardy it was the
right move, and he proved to be a strong choice

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.150
to headline the series for years to come.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.150
Furious 7

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.020
The Fast &amp; Furious series is known for featuring
cars… lots and lots of cars.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.720
Dominic Toretto and his crew are always shifting
gears and driving fast to where they need

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.880
to go, often complete death-defying stunts
so they can accomplish their mission.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.539
They’re also rather destructive.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.600
For Furious 7, more than 230 cars were destroyed
during production, creating headaches and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840
nightmares for various insurance agencies.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.360
We’re all for emphasizing practical effects,
but this is an instance where some CGI may

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.360
have been better.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.469
That seems like a lot of vehicular carnage
for a single film, regardless of how popular

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.189
it is.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.270
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.119
Fans enjoy watching the enormous green rage
monster known as the Hulk smash everything

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.119
on screen.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.310
But did you know he was supposed to be a different
color?

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.470
Originally, Marvel had intended Hulk to be
gray in the comics, but the company’s printers

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.440
couldn’t get the color right, and the character
came off as green on certain pages.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.250
Marvel eventually switched Hulk’s primary
color to green as if nothing else ever happened,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.500
and when their printing capabilities improved,
they established Gray Hulk as another persona

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.360
Bruce Banner could transform into.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.030
Joss Whedon thought of using Gray Hulk in
Age of Ultron, so perhaps he’ll be in the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.010
MCU one day.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.080
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.080
Daisy Ridley’s Rey is now one of the most
popular faces in the franchise and a hero

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.830
fans can’t wait to see again.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.440
They have Ridley’s director to thank for
how things turned out.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.480
On her first day on the set, J.J. Abrams told
Ridley that her performance was wooden and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.910
nearly caused the actress to have a panic
attack.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.590
Whatever coaching Abrams provided seemed to
work, since the newcomer Ridley was praised

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.110
by many critics and quickly became a household
name.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.430
If Abrams didn’t step in, perhaps the entire
sequel trilogy gets derailed before it even

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.440
kicks off.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.150
Jurassic World

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.120
Usually when a Hollywood blockbuster features
tons of product placement, it’s at the order

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.580
of the studio looking for a little help in
covering costs.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.100
But things were handled a little differently
for Jurassic World.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.660
Director Colin Trevorrow was the mastermind
behind the decision, seeing it as an amusing

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.650
way to satirize the corporatization of popular
culture.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.230
Just about everything has a sponsor these
days, grounding the dinosaur adventure in

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.400
a world that the audience is very familiar
with – and it provided a fair share of laughs.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.380
We doubt Verizon Wireless wants any part of
the Indominus rex now.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.520
Spectre

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.060
When a new James Bond film is coming through
the pipeline, one thing viewers want to know

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.090
is the musical artist providing the opening
credits song.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.760
Spectre went with Sam Smith’s “Writing
on the Wall,” but they could have gone in

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
a different direction.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.440
Grammy winning band Radiohead recorded a title
song called “Spectre,” which was released

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.720
after the film came out.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.690
Both tunes have their fans, but it’s hard
to argue with the filmmakers’ judgment.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.840
Smith got nominated for an Oscar for his work,
adding his name to the long list of accolades

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.730
for original Bond songs.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.730
Creed

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.590
One of the most famous sequences in the Rocky
spinoff is Adonis Johnson’s first professional

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.920
fight, which appears to be shot in one continuous
take.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.240
Directors are known for using some digital
trickery to hide edited cuts to create the

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.380
illusion of a single take, but Creed’s cinematographer
says this is the real deal with no post-production

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.669
stitching involved.

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.900
During production, Ryan Coogler shot 13 takes
of the scene, eventually using the 11th in

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900
the final film.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.420
The fights in Creed were very much acclaimed,
and with hard work like this, it’s easy

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.259
to see why.

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.259
The Martian

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.830
A big part of this film’s story is astronaut
Mark Watney coping with isolation while stranded

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.100
on Mars, and director Ridley Scott went the
extra mile to hammer that aspect home.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.010
Scott stated that Matt Damon’s solo scenes
were shot for five weeks straight, and then

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.460
the actor was relieved from the production
schedule.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.569
As a result of this tactic, Damon did not
meet most of his co-stars until the cast reunited

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.050
to promote the film.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.930
That may seem odd, but it fit the nature of
the narrative and The Martian garnered widespread

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.250
critical acclaim, so it’s hard to argue
with Scott’s handling of his stars.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.120
Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.139
It was well documented before this film’s
release that Tom Cruise performed Ethan Hunt’s

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.780
daring plane stunt at the beginning for real,
taking off with an actual airplane.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.569
But Cruise’s daredevil nature didn’t stop
there.

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.400
Always one up for the extreme, Cruise did
all of his own stunt driving as well, most

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.139
prominently in Rogue Nation’s Morocco car
chase sequence.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.620
Cruise’s efforts even influenced his co-star
Simon Pegg, who also did his own stunts.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.580
Pegg said being around Cruise made him feel
“obliged” to do things for real, and moviegoers

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.780
were very pleased with the results.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.160
Who knows what they’ll deliver next?
