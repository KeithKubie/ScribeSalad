00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.950
Welcome. We are here today with Katia Bertoldi.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.900
Great to have you here.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.605
Thanks.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.190
And we are here in your lab,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.070
which is new, which is quite exciting.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.650
Brand new.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.380
Why don't you tell us a little bit about what type of research you're doing here?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.875
Yes. So, I'm  mainly interested in structures,

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:21.939
but what I'm looking at is how we can exploit geometry of structures

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.640
to achieve new properties and to design systems

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.670
whose property can be tuned and controlled on the fly.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.465
Interesting. So what applications would that have in real life?

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.335
When we think about different structures,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.485
we can also think about reconfigurability.

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:39.400
Think of this, for example, for medical applications.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.205
So, surgical devices, you would like to be able to go into the body,

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:47.520
and then to expand to perform certain tasks.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.540
Or think about the ability to,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.115
for example, guided propagation of sound.

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:54.970
You would like to be able to basically guide

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.645
the propagation of sound in certain direction at a given time,

00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:59.900
and then at a given time you would like to create a barrier for

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.535
sound to protect a certain environment.

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:05.430
Right. So basically you want a structure to do

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.475
one thing sometimes and do something else at other times?

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:09.250
Exactly, exactly.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.310
There are different ways to achieve reconfigurability.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.431
One is to program the material itself,

00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:15.529
so to work basically with the chemistry.

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:19.910
Basically, introduce smart molecules into the material,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.370
and then to control them with different stimuli.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.550
But another approach that we are basically

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.885
exploring is the possibility to play with very simple materials,

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.660
but play with geometry to achieve similar effect.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.120
And now we are trying to see how much we can push this.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.120
Okay, cool. And you brought some of those today.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.670
So, can you show us how these reconform and transform?

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.720
Yeah, so for example,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870
these are structures we designed with Chuck Hoberman

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.550
who is also a researcher at the Wyss Institute.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.220
As you can see, it's made with a very,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.050
very simple material, cardboard, and adhesive tape.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.860
By carefully arranging these two building blocks,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.900
we can design the structure that can go from completely flat to fully expanded.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.825
And now I'm doing this with my hands,

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:02.335
but what you can do you can embed actuators and we've done that so basically,

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.645
you can control the motion from outside.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.985
That's really cool. And I can definitely see how that'd be helpful for shipping.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:11.660
You want something to lie flat on a truck and then pop it up.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.260
Exactly. So you can acheive all sort of transformation by playing with geometry.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.320
Clearly, what we did,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.215
we developed algorithm towards being able to predict this geometry.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:25.945
So, what is it about the Wyss Institute that allows you to do

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.420
all this interdisciplinary work in collaboration that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.185
you might not be able to do in other places?

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:35.315
I  think for me the Wyss is a very exciting and fascinating place,

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:37.945
give me the opportunity to collaborate with

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:40.560
a range of people with very different background.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.310
People that are very good at designing new materials, smart materials.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.765
People that are excellent at designing new robots.

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:49.920
People who are focusing on architecture.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.380
So, it is quite unique to have all these people under the same umbrella.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.765
And now sort of support to basically pursue all these different research directions.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:04.294
I'm excited about the collaboration I'm having with Joanna and Jennifer,

00:03:04.294 --> 00:03:08.560
where we try to combine smart material and complex geometries.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.705
We have also been working with Connor Walsh,

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:12.121
Rob Wood, and George Whitesides.

00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:15.125
We are mostly helping them with models,

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.200
to predict basically the behavior of these robots.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.320
So, instead of using an empirical approach to design them,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.520
we are trying to develop methodologies to design robots with a predictable response.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.720
So speaking of robots,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.785
do you want to show us the snake robot?

00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:33.815
Inside, there is a tube made of rubber, it's an elastomer tube.

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:34.985
So when we pump in air,

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:36.725
it elongates in one direction.

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:39.680
So now, in order to make it to move, what we did,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.960
we basically cover this actuator with the skin,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.710
and then we laser cut this pattern of cuts.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.360
And now what happens is,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.770
when it stretch, you see the cuts pop up.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.155
Opens up a little bit.

00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:54.950
Open up. So they create an asymmetry, and so,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.395
this basically makes this very simple machine to move.

00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:01.800
Basically, one actuator is enough to achieve a certain movement.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.385
So, it's significantly simplify what is needed to achieve as basically locomotion.

00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:08.250
I know you just had a baby, so I'm sure that that takes a lot of your time.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.310
Yeah, we have two babies.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.860
Are there any things that you wish that you could

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.130
reconfigure to make it easier to deal with your two kids?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.635
A stroller for my kids.

00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:19.260
Yeah, so if you can reconfigure a stroller what would you turn it into?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.935
I would like something very small that I can pack with me and bring it somewhere.

00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:26.030
Something much lighter than what it is,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.845
because right now I mean it's quite heavy.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:30.710
So maybe that's a new project?

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.210
That's a new project for the future for sure.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.800
Bio-configurable strollers.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.090
Well, thank you so much for sharing your work with us today, Katia.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.395
It was really interesting.

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:41.000
You're welcome.
