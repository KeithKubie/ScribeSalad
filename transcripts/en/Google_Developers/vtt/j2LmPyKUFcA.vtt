FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hello,
I'm Florina Muntenescu

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.260
for The Developer Show.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.610
This is your weekly update on
the Developer News from Google.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.270
Application sand boxing is a
core part of Android design.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.520
Isolating apps from each other.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.550
In Android Q taking the
same fundamental principle

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
from applications sand boxing
we introduced scoped storage.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.360
Take a look at this post for
best practices and updates.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.550
Cloud TPUs were designed
from the ground up

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.150
to accelerate cutting edge
machine learning applications

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.660
from image recognition,
to language modeling,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.440
to reinforcement learning.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.240
And now we've made
it even easier

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.140
for you to use Cloud TPUs
for image segmentation.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.560
With high performance TPU
implementations of two state

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.810
of the art segmentation models.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.950
Mask R-CNN and DeepLab v3+.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.440
The post has performance
and cost metrics

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
for both models along with
links to the GitHub repos.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.190
Chrome 74 is now available.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.709
And we've added support
for cleaner creation

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.050
of private class
fields in JavaScript

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.730
detecting when the
user has requested

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.570
a reduced motion experienced,
CSS transition events, and much

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.480
more.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.880
Take a look at the post for the
change log and example code.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.330
Data Saver is expanding
to provide more benefits

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.400
in addition to data savings.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.170
Pages will now load faster, in
some cases considerably faster

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.180
and use less memory.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.200
It will now be called Lite mode.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.440
And you can read
more on the post.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.360
Google I/O is next week.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.310
We'll be taking a
break from the TLDR

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.320
because the whole Dev Show crew
will be on site hanging out

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.740
at the sessions and sandboxes.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.095
Please remember to like,
subscribe, and share.

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:48.900
I'm Florina Muntenescu
for the Developer Show.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.850
Thanks for watching and
we'll see you at Google I/O.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.870
We can do better, come on.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.150
SPEAKER 1: Dev Show
DS155 take four.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.600
