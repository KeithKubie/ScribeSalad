00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.055
When faced with a big challenge

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:11.336
where potential failure seems
to lurk at every corner,

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:14.228
maybe you've heard this advice before:

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:16.419
"Be more confident."

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.530
And most likely, this is what you think
when you hear it:

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.261
"If only it were that simple."

00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.322
But what is confidence?

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:28.086
Take the belief that you are valuable,
worthwhile, and capable,

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.136
also known as self-esteem,

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:34.769
add in the optimism that comes
when you are certain of your abilities,

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.820
and then empowered by these,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.869
act courageously 
to face a challenge head-on.

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:42.857
This is confidence.

00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:46.684
It turns thoughts into action.

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:49.480
So where does confidence even come from?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.632
There are several factors 
that impact confidence.

00:00:52.632 --> 00:00:55.492
One: what you're born with,
such as your genes,

00:00:55.492 --> 00:01:00.466
which will impact things like the balance
of neurochemicals in your brain.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.037
Two: how you're treated.

00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:06.354
This includes the social pressures
of your environment.

00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:09.563
And three: the part you have control over,

00:01:09.563 --> 00:01:11.038
the choices you make,

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.516
the risks you take,

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:16.653
and how you think about 
and respond to challenges and setbacks.

00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:20.385
It isn't possible to completely untangle
these three factors,

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:23.955
but the personal choices we make
certainly play a major role

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:26.039
in confidence development.

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.573
So, by keeping in mind 
a few practical tips,

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:35.419
we do actually have the power to cultivate
our own confidence.

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:38.023
Tip 1: a quick fix.

00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:41.307
There are a few tricks that can give you
an immediate confidence boost

00:01:41.307 --> 00:01:43.008
in the short term.

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:46.767
Picture your success 
when you're beginning a difficult task,

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.723
something as simple as listening to music
with deep bass;

00:01:49.723 --> 00:01:53.546
it can promote feelings of power.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:58.554
You can even strike a powerful pose
or give yourself a pep talk.

00:01:58.554 --> 00:02:03.824
Tip two: 
believe in your ability to improve.

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:06.013
If you're looking for a long-term change,

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:09.895
consider the way you think 
about your abilities and talents.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.243
Do you think they are fixed at birth,

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:15.100
or that they can be developed,
like a muscle?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.193
These beliefs matter because
they can influence how you act

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:20.594
when you're faced with setbacks.

00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:22.263
If you have a fixed mindset,

00:02:22.263 --> 00:02:24.881
meaning that you think your talents
are locked in place,

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:26.520
you might give up,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.216
assuming you've discovered 
something you're not very good at.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:34.652
But if you have a growth mindset
and think your abilities can improve,

00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:38.343
a challenge is an opportunity
to learn and grow.

00:02:38.343 --> 00:02:40.821
Neuroscience supports the growth mindset.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:46.028
The connections in your brain do get
stronger and grow with study and practice.

00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:48.209
It also turns out, on average,

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.322
people who have a growth mindset
are more successful,

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:53.054
getting better grades,

00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:56.529
and doing better 
in the face of challenges.

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.751
Tip three: practice failure.

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:02.406
Face it, you're going to fail sometimes.

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:04.562
Everyone does.

00:03:04.562 --> 00:03:07.421
J.K. Rowling was rejected by
twelve different publishers

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.798
before one picked up "Harry Potter."

00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:13.236
The Wright Brothers built on history's
failed attempts at flight,

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:14.903
including some of their own,

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.635
before designing a successful airplane.

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:22.303
Studies show that those who fail regularly
and keep trying anyway

00:03:22.303 --> 00:03:25.413
are better equipped to respond 
to challenges and setbacks

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.176
in a constructive way.

00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:30.515
They learn how to try 
different strategies,

00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:32.226
ask others for advice,

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:34.223
and perservere.

00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:37.017
So, think of a challenge 
you want to take on,

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:39.749
realize it's not going to be easy,

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.929
accept that you'll make mistakes,

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.341
and be kind to yourself when you do.

00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:49.511
Give yourself a pep talk, 
stand up, and go for it.

00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:52.887
The excitement you'll feel knowing that
whatever the result,

00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:56.223
you'll have gained greater knowledge
and understanding.

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:58.247
This is confidence.
