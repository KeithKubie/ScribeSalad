00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.360
For the next few questions, I'm just
going to give you a few true statements,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.970
and you're going to have to
create the conversion factor,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.560
select the appropriate one,
and answer the question.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.880
So, here are some conversion factors.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.440
They relate to distances, miles to feet,
volumes, like gallons and quarts.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.340
And weights like grams and
milligrams, or pounds and ounces.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.560
So for the first question,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.630
let's say that your friend
lives 3 miles from your house.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.150
How far is that in feet?

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.600
Enter your answer here, and you may
want to use a calculator for this one.
