5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.471
I've been real good.

6
00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:21.680
Been drinking the throat coat tea and having the lodge [inaudible]

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.690
um,
I had a great week.
I did the uh,
the,

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.250
I thought it was a two year anniversary sit three year anniversary of the

9
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:35.810
goddamn comedy jam.
And a I sang for the first time,

10
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:40.811
came out dressed as a Johnny paycheck and I saying that take this job and shove

11
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:46.850
it my working here no more.
Um,

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.890
and then I sat in a play drums afterwards,
played sweet child of mine for the uh,

13
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:54.980
the finale.
And uh,
you know what's funny about that song?

14
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:58.940
I never really listened to the drums once slash started playing the guitar Solo.

15
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:02.240
That's one of those guitars,
solo songs.
I always have to fucking real.

16
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:05.870
I can't listen to it one time through.
I always have to rewind it back.
You know,

17
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.030
we really starts slash really starts getting going.

18
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:12.500
I fucking loved that Solo and I was so listening to what he was doing.

19
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:16.370
I never really listened to all the cool drums underneath it.
Um,

20
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:21.170
the Great Steven Adler,
so I had a great time doing all of that shit last night.

21
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:26.090
I did a fucking benefit for the troops there and,
uh,

22
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.400
I just had a,
it was a fucking amazing night.
Just,
uh,
went out there.

23
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:33.380
One of those nights you walk on stage like,
you know what?

24
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:34.700
I don't feel like doing my act.

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.470
And you just start fucking talking and it works rather than you're bombing,

26
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.610
you know,

27
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.370
the nights when you don't feel like doing your act and you don't do your act and

28
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:48.140
you start bombing,
then you reluctantly go into your act.
It becomes a,
you know,

29
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.740
they get all grumpy.
The crowd sitting there like,

30
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:55.940
what the fuck is this guy's problem came down here to laugh at.
He's a,
he's,

31
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.250
he's coming out,
he's being all fresh.
Um,
oh,
it's just one of those,

32
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.870
just one of those great nights.
And other than that,

33
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.250
I've just been stuck in a writer's room,

34
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:08.750
so I have no idea what the fuck is going on in the world.
This is what this is.

35
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:10.820
This is what happens when they go into the writer's room.

36
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:15.821
I have no fucking idea what goes on in the world where I'm working on episodes

37
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:21.610
one and two.
We have our first table read tomorrow so well,
uh,

38
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.920
I get a fucking,
I get a look at my lines,

39
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:29.150
make sure if I sell the joke so they get laughs so we don't have to fucking

40
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:33.980
write new jokes.
That's how it works.
Uh,
the madness has begun again.

41
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.070
So,
um,
I can't remember what the fuck I talked about cause I already started this

42
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.920
podcast that I mentioned that my wife came into work today with my lovely

43
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:47.450
daughter and everybody got to see her and it was the highlight of my day and try

44
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.480
to make sure she does that more often.
You know,

45
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.640
they're only little one time I came home early and I come home a little early

46
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.550
now.
Right.
I got the whole excuse talk cause I gotta go home and see my baby,

47
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:01.840
right.
So I come home and she's got this little chair,
you know,

48
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:06.280
that just like fucking clamps onto the table and uh,

49
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.410
she sits at that thing and she just sat there talking to me like,
how,
you know,

50
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.860
trying to talk to me is,
I had dinner in my,

51
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.060
a lovely wife was downstairs sleeping.

52
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.360
We just basically had our first dinner date with,
so it was so cool.
It wasn't me.

53
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.740
It amazes me.
Is she like cracks herself up.

54
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.150
She can't speak a word of any language.

55
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.880
And so,

56
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.100
but she sits there and she thinks about stuff and she just kinda chuckled,

57
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.190
sit there going,
I'm just,
she just be by herself and I'm just,

58
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.980
it kills me.
I'm like,
what is she thinking about?

59
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.260
Like to make yourself laugh,

60
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.050
do you got to think about something that's fucked up?

61
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.110
Which means you got to have a knowledge of something that's like,

62
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.970
you know how things should be like that when somebody comes walking in the room,

63
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.260
they're just supposed to walk into the room.

64
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.110
They're not supposed to bump ahead of fall on their ass.
Like,

65
00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:04.850
you know what's normal?
I kind of share like what's our idea?
Normal.
I Dunno.

66
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.680
I Dunno.
This is like one of these things that,
you know,

67
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:11.180
when you watch like the uh,

68
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.890
one of those animal programs and they start telling you what the fucking ant,

69
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.140
what the animal's thinking.
You just,
you just want to be like,

70
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.560
how about God's name?
Would you know that?
You know,
when the shark does this,

71
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:26.940
it's actually a,
it's actually afraid because it's blah,
blah,
blah.
They,

72
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.080
they do this when they,

73
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.070
when they fucking make this noise with their mouth and it's actually a,

74
00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:34.830
this is like a mating call and say,
how did you figure that out?

75
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.960
How did you figure that out?

76
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.330
Like you followed this thing around the fucking woods.

77
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.310
It made that noise and then another bird showed up and they started fucking,

78
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.680
these are like birds.
Like,
how did you figure that out?

79
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.190
How do you keep,
do you ever try to keep up with a bird?
I've never tried that.

80
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.210
That's gotta be hard as hell.

81
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.520
How many fucking people are in the woods.

82
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.640
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.730
<v 0>Fucking bird gets like performance anxiety.</v>

84
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.770
You know,
you think you can keep fucking,

85
00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:10.790
if you looked out the window and there was like 10 birds with cameras looking at

86
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:14.880
you.
Okay,
right and shit down and everything.
You'd be like,

87
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.360
what the fuck's with these birds?
Then you kind of forget what you were doing.

88
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.930
I've never understood how they do that.

89
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.600
Like how big the jungle is,
all of that shit.

90
00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:31.601
You had the cameras set up and you were able to capture this fucking thing

91
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:33.160
killing this other animal.

92
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.870
Well like they're following like a fucking unbelievably deadly snake.

93
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.300
They're following it through the forest

94
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.150
and then they'll fucking be on the other side of the log and it's,

95
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:50.630
it's coming over the top.
It's like is that,
is that fucking snake in the union?

96
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.940
It looked like it went back to one.
When you reset and action.

97
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.450
It's like it comes like comes over the bucket thing.

98
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.570
I swear to God,
I watched one one time,
I'm telling you,

99
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.780
they set this fucking mouse up the one day they had footage of the mouse.

100
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.560
It's in the fucking woods,
or I guess if it's a poisonous snake,

101
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.560
it's gotta be the jungle right at that point,
I don't know the forest,

102
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.833
all right.

103
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.070
In this fucking mouse is like freaking out in this snake.

104
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.330
A rattlesnake is on like it's,
you know,
it's on its path.
It's chasing this thing.

105
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:30.110
So the fucking thing goes down this hole,
this mouse.

106
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.130
Okay.
And then they showed the snake,
you know,

107
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:39.110
coming over the log and then it goes down the same fucking hole and then all of

108
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.660
a sudden I'm in the hall with the mouse.

109
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.820
Like there was a camera down that whole like,
how the fuck,
how to fuck did,

110
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.510
did you know to put the camera down there?
Right.

111
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.410
And then the mouse is down.
Then you'd see the thing freaking out.
Like,
you know,

112
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.420
like some fucking set up man,
right in the fucking snakes coming down.

113
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.460
It's like Joe Pesci when he thinks he's getting made,
he walks it.
Ah,
no,
Bam.

114
00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:08.520
That was it.
The snake came in and fucking killed the mouse.

115
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.720
And I remember just feeling,
I just was sitting there watching it going like,

116
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.990
did I just watch your fucking murder?
Did that thing that was like a hit.

117
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.960
That wasn't just some random shit that they kind of caught like,
you know,

118
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.450
when they see like Cheetahs chasing down some fucking thing.

119
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.390
I Dunno.
I think they ought to investigate that one.

120
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.870
That was clearly a,
uh,

121
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.590
it was something about it that's definitely worthy of,
of an investigation.

122
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:40.850
A suspicious,
you know,
you know when somebody dies and they just say he'd say,

123
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.060
yeah,
seem like natural causes.
What's that other word they use?

124
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:48.320
I don't fucking know.
I uh,
I always root for Anil whatever,

125
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.860
animals dying and there's a lot of animals that I don't like cause they're

126
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:56.300
fucking scary.
You know,
when you watch like,
uh,

127
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.330
one of those big cats,
which I love those fucking things.
When you watch them,

128
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.450
you know,
when you watch them taken down one of those bulls,

129
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.030
it's like I'm all for the fucking bull.
Like rooting the thing on.

130
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.070
Then all of a sudden it kicks one of the lines in the face or it stabs him with

131
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:14.940
the horn and then the lion limps off.
Then I feel bad for the line.

132
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.560
Like I fuck man,
I had the lines going to die.
Now you know,

133
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.450
I don't like how Eunice and I fucking hate monkeys.

134
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.180
I like gorillas.
I don't like monkeys.

135
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.890
I definitely don't like chimpanzees and I'm definitely going to go see planet of

136
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:37.390
the apes and I'm rooting for the humans,
sponges.
I know that,
you know,
if we win,

137
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:40.960
we're going to continue to cause global warming and throw TV sets into the
ocean.

138
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.330
I just a,
I don't like those fucking ticks.
Like that first planet of the apes,

139
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.590
this latest reboot of it.

140
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.490
When the things walking down the street and had like pants on and the guys like

141
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.410
Holden,
it's fucking hand.
Yeah,
like the,

142
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.900
and I always go to the planet of the apes movies and we just exchange looks the

143
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.630
entire fucking time just looking at each other like,
this is just fucking,

144
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.140
this is so fucking weird.
They're so fucking weird.

145
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.100
They're so close to what we are,
you know,

146
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:13.950
but they can like rip your face off and they just don't give a shit.

147
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.570
I'm actually wondering to them [inaudible] I dunno,
I don't like fucking monkeys.

148
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.410
I respect him and uh,
but I could never live in,
in a,

149
00:09:24.411 --> 00:09:27.500
in a country where they're just out in the wild

150
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.620
like that,
like party at DNC,

151
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.410
like those things like in India or some shit and some guy will be walking down

152
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:39.270
the street and this fucking random monkey will just run up behind him and give

153
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:39.811
him like a,

154
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:43.350
the monkey version of a fucking flying drop kick and the guy does like a face

155
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:46.940
plant and the monkey takes off like laughing at him.
Like,
um,

156
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.060
I,
I wouldn't be able to handle that.
I'd be like,

157
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:54.690
I'm gonna fucking kill that thing.
Not Kill it,
kill it.
Because then I feel bad,

158
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.030
but I'm going to throw a fucking rock at it

159
00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.483
<v 2>right</v>

160
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.380
<v 0>from walking down some fucking godforsaken road in a monkey knocks me over and</v>

161
00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:08.650
then the happy goes up the fucking train.
It's jumping up and down,

162
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:13.430
all proud of itself.
I would,
I would love to think that,

163
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.970
you know,

164
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.740
for all the Peta people listening that I would be mature enough to not do

165
00:10:18.741 --> 00:10:21.290
something,
but uh,
I would have to do something

166
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.580
if I lived in a country that had fucking just monkeys running around.

167
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.910
I would have,
like,
I would,
you know what I would do,

168
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.920
I would design like a portable firehose,

169
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.293
<v 2>right?</v>

170
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.530
<v 0>You know,</v>

171
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.820
at that level of fucking velocity and after they fucking did whatever they did,

172
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:42.860
throw their poo at me or whatever the fuck they did,

173
00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:44.630
I would just blast them right out of the trees.

174
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.070
You know,
those little ones

175
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.800
there was fucking chimpanzees.
You can't have him.
Can't have it.

176
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.570
It's amazing how we just found out now that chimpanzees can like rip your face

177
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:05.630
off.
You know,

178
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.600
like when they go to kill another chimpanzee,

179
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.000
they like to rip their balls right off,

180
00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:13.280
twist their foot off and fucking rip their faith.

181
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:18.260
They do all this fucking crazy shit.
Then they get all amped up afterwards.

182
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:20.390
All the other apes after they fucking killed that one,

183
00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:24.050
that jumping around all talking shit about what the fuck they just did.

184
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.100
Um,
there's no fucking way,

185
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.850
there's no fucking way I can live in a country that had that type of shit.

186
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:35.890
I went,
I would be fucking pack in the entire time.
You know,

187
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.450
like if my neighbor ever just like for the years,
like in Hollywood,

188
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.840
like the chimpanzee was,
was so fucking castable.

189
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.060
And now that I've actually gotten to a writer's room and I talked to these guys

190
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.670
about different shoots,
everybody has a monkey story.

191
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.240
Everybody has a fucking monkey where it's like,
ah,
man,
you know,

192
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.990
can't do it,
man.
Can't do it.
I won't work with them.
I won't work with them.

193
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.070
And I'm like,
really?
And they got why?
What happens is the guy,
you know what?

194
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:06.010
This is what the fuck happens.
Okay,
you took,
you know,

195
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.750
you've got a finite amount of time.

196
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.150
The monkey's going to do kind of what you want it to do.

197
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.570
And then it's going to get to a fucking point where the monkeys just going to go

198
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:16.360
fucking ape shit,
no pun intended.
And it's just going to do what?

199
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:20.250
It's going to start flying around the fucking set and it's something somebody is

200
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:21.084
going to get jumped.

201
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

202
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.790
<v 0>You know,
I worked with a guy,
he got fucking attacked by a monkey on a set.</v>

203
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.400
There's no fucking way.
There is no fucking way.

204
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.990
I'm of a long time ago we did the uh,
when I did the opie and Anthony Show,

205
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.290
right.
Which I'm hoping,

206
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.990
you know now that opie schedules all freed up now.
I'm hoping that may be,

207
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.760
you know,
guns and roses can get back together.
Huh.
Who knows,

208
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.720
stranger things have happened.
Um,

209
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:55.960
<v 2>yeah,</v>

210
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.710
<v 0>I was on the opiate Anthony show and somebody brought in,
it was,
uh,</v>

211
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.070
I think it was a,

212
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:06.070
a baby tiger and the thing was fucking adorable,

213
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.460
but I'll tell you right now,
it was like the size,

214
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.180
it was between a house cat in a bobcat.

215
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.050
As far as the size it was no,
I mean it was kind of like the size of a house cat.

216
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.870
But it was fucking jacked.
You know,

217
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.740
it's was,
we'd like a baby bear because it's going to turn into this three,
four,

218
00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:32.180
five,
600 pound fucking thing.
When it's a baby,
it's still like,
dude,

219
00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:37.180
that thing could fuck me up there.
Freddy Kruger pause that,
those bears APP.

220
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:42.130
So they got this fucking,
uh,
they bring in this baby tiger.

221
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:44.630
It's the white one,
right?
The,

222
00:13:44.631 --> 00:13:47.850
the bill burr version of the tiger and they bring it in.

223
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.330
I remember Anthony was going out and then he goes,
baby animals.
They're adorable.

224
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:57.250
Like he fucking loves him in the fucking thing was the goddamn tiger was not in

225
00:13:57.251 --> 00:14:01.590
a good mood and it was at going,
wow.
Wow,
wow.

226
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.440
I'm doing like this baby.
Little fucking roaring.

227
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.750
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

228
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.650
<v 0>So they'd go,
do you want to hold that thing?
And I was like,
no.
I mean,
yeah.</v>

229
00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:14.520
If you de and you fucking duct tape,
it's fucking cute little mouth shut.
Yeah.

230
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.640
I'd maybe done.
Yeah,
maybe then I would fuck with it.
You know?

231
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.660
Could you put some boxing gloves on and all four of its paws?
I,
yeah.

232
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.020
Then I would do it,
then I would do it.
But I,
I just,
you know,

233
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.050
I've gotten scratched by a house cat.
It fucking kills.

234
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.050
They'd hurts that thing with its baby lion paw.

235
00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:35.390
The fucking thing was the size of like four house cats.

236
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.420
Like if you took all four house cats paws and you put it together,

237
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.320
that was the size of this fucking thing.

238
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:41.900
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.080
<v 0>So Anthony fucking starts,
you know,
playing with the thing.</v>

240
00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:48.620
And I remember he ended up getting scratched to get scratched on his neck and

241
00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.300
then they told me how to go get a fucking shot.

242
00:14:50.301 --> 00:14:54.800
I don't know if he ever it and um,
yeah,

243
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.320
it's weird cause there's a white guy.

244
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.330
I should be the kind of guy that goes around fucking with animals.
But uh,

245
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.520
I don't,
I do,
but I don't,
I go to the zoo,
I kind of fuck with them,

246
00:15:05.521 --> 00:15:07.380
but I don't know why.
I just want to see,
you know what it is.

247
00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:09.600
I want to see them do what they do.
I don't want to see him chilling.

248
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.040
That's fucking boring to me.
I want to see him kind of flipping out.
You know,

249
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.400
like I hate when you finally go see a poisonous snake and it's just laying there

250
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.430
all wound up like some climbing rope,
you know,
I want it to be like on it,

251
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.610
you know,
like I'll fucking murder you.
I want to see it do some snake shit.

252
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.370
That's the thing that you go to the zoo.
It's like everybody,
it's like,

253
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.250
it's like everybody's a in a spa or some shit,
you know,
just chilling out.
Oh God.

254
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.170
How much a pdf people are going to hate me on this one.

255
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:42.710
Talking about shooting monkeys and comparing the zoo to his spot though,

256
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:44.690
just to let you know all the conditions.
I know,

257
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:49.190
I'm just saying that chill or depressed.
I don't know what they are,

258
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:53.820
but then they're not doing anything.
You just like,
yeah,

259
00:15:53.821 --> 00:15:57.460
I get it.
I can't get out of here.
So,
you know what I mean?

260
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.431
It'd be like,
you know,

261
00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:02.980
going to look at like human beings and they're all in jail.
Like,

262
00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:06.400
why would you want to do that?
Some guy just fucking sitting there on a cot like,

263
00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:10.180
yeah,
I'm here for the rest of my life.
Say All right,

264
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.510
nice talking to you.
Can you just move onto the next guy?

265
00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:15.490
You don't want to see that,
right?
You want to go down a little food court.

266
00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:19.590
You want to watch people,
people free like food court is like the Serengeti,

267
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.480
you know,
watering hole for human beings and you just go down.

268
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.430
Then you look at all the different species down there,
all interacting,

269
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.840
you know,
everybody seems to be getting along.

270
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.050
Then all of a sudden somebody comes when those little kids comes by with the

271
00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:38.710
wheels on his sneakers and freaks everybody out,
the herd starts to stampede.

272
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.620
Sound like that.
At least that.
Maybe that's on black Friday.

273
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.920
I don't know what happens.
Um,
anyways,
I,

274
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:49.900
I got a bunch of reads I have to do because there was no reads during the 4th of

275
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.520
July weekend.
One,
two tree,
four,
five,
five reads,

276
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.270
but they're fund rates.
I always make it fun.
You know what I mean?

277
00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:01.450
I'm the kind of guy that can make advertise and fun.
I like to think,
can we go,

278
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.500
oh,
look who's back.
It's all zip

279
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.550
<v 1>brought up.
Are you hiring?
Why</v>

280
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.910

I gotta tell you I was so impressed with the,
the,

422
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.460
the track in Austria at the Austrian Grand Prix.

423
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.040
I think I'm going to go to that race next year and I'm going to do a show and

424
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:48.750
fucking Austria.
What do you think about that?

425
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.310
And then the next fucking week is to British Grand Prix.
So God dammit,

426
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.640
what the fuck?
I might as well go to England,
right?
I'll knock out two.

427
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:59.940
I'm gonna knock out a couple of two,
three races a year,
you know,

428
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.090
until it starts getting shady and I got to start going to those fucking

429
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:04.650

432
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.490
Yeah.
What did you guys do to these people?
And uh,

433
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.570

as he was telling me,

434
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.890
as her,

I don't know.

435
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:29.040
I see that a in that z and I just start thinking like,

436
00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:31.980
I don't know about that.
I j.
A.

437
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:35.850
N I just feel like that [inaudible] that just sounds like they're sitting on oil

438
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:39.150
and if they are,
I know we're over there fucking with them.
You know,

439
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:42.120
decided who their leader was or whatever the fuck we do.
You know what I mean?

440
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:47.190
You got to do that.
You got to pay attention.
You know,
Singapore is the shit.

441
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.570
I've been there and never been to Malaysia,
Japan.
I got to go there,
right?

442
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.350
I got to do that all.
I gotta do all of that Shit.
That's what I would do.

443
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.600
I'm going to fucking build my whole year and never been to Wimbledon.

444
00:27:57.601 --> 00:28:01.680
I've got to do that.
Oh,
and I got to go to that fucking tt race next year.

445
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.160
Those are the three I'm going to knock off,
right?
F One race,

446
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.910
fucking Wimbledon.
And I'll go to that fucking tt race,
right?

447
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:12.030
And watch somebody fucking slammed into the side of a seven 11 at about 200

448
00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:16.920
miles an hour or 320 kilometers.
One of the fuck it is.

449
00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:20.640
I don't know.
I don't pretend to know.
Um,
all right,

450
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.850
so I'm off to go to fucking,
um,

451
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:30.210
grand rapids,
Michigan,
and uh,
I can't wait to do this as such.

452
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.770
Can Be such a fucking fun Gig.

453
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:37.440
And I completely fell off the fucking wagon.
You know,
I went over this,

454
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:40.080
I went to this fucking pool party and I had some,
some beers.

455
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.240
And then I've drank every single night.
Not a lot,
but I just been dreaming of.

456
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.890
It's not even getting hammered,
it's just the calories.

457
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:50.460
But I dialed the drink in way back.
Um,

458
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.510
I tell you,
this is what happens.
We want to go into the fucking writers room.

459
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.510
I've been great in the writer's room,
except today I had a cheeseburger,

460
00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:58.344
but other than that,

461
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.590
I've been in the writer's room for fucking two and a half weeks and I have eaten

462
00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:05.120
salads the entire time.
I have drank waters.

463
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.300
I'm eating fucking fruit.
I'm fucking killing it.

464
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.660
But today my wife came by.
When that guy,
let's go to fucking,

465
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.700
we'll go to shake shack.
Fuck right.
Those burgers are so,
God damn,

466
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:20.280
this is free advertising.
These burgers are so fucking delicious,

467
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:25.060
but they didn't fucking need to do like for a five year old,
you know,

468
00:29:25.061 --> 00:29:29.570
every time I see it as I could eat 10 of these things,
you know,

469
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.140
they taste so fucking good and you just,
I like three bites.
That thing's gone.

470
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.940
How many steak and shake fucking at steak and shake,

471
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.770
shake shack burgers you think you could eat.

472
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.060
I've eaten so bad in my life.
Like I don't have the tolerance I used to,

473
00:29:45.061 --> 00:29:47.580
but like in my prime,

474
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.360
I bet I could eat five of those.
That's not bad.

475
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.940
Just under five foot 10.
Right.

476
00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.940
A fat fuck still.
I got to get on the phone.

477
00:29:58.941 --> 00:30:01.700
I gotta get back on the fucking elliptical.
You know what?
My dog was in town.

478
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.370
My dog was in town.
I got to see her,
uh,
yesterday and today she's fucking happy.

479
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:11.990
She looks great.
She looks so fucking great.
You know,

480
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.970
she came over right.
I brought her over to the house.
She met my,
uh,

481
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.050
you know,
I'm a say and my,
you know,
she saw Nia again,

482
00:30:21.051 --> 00:30:22.340
was freaking out and all that stuff.

483
00:30:22.341 --> 00:30:26.750
Saw Lola wags her tail and then later looked over at Lola,
you know,

484
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.860
and she was way,
way,
way away by the way.
I made sure she was way the fuck away.

485
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.650
And I had her on a leash the whole time and she looked over and she just went

486
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.140
like fucking growled at her.
I was like,
all right,
there you go.

487
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:45.340
That's why we don't have you anymore because you are fucking insane fucking

488
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.650
lunatic dog.
I love you to death.

489
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.540
Like I would have to have dog whisperer fucking skills and um,

490
00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:59.540
uh,
you know,
I don't know that,
that it actually gave me closure.

491
00:30:59.541 --> 00:31:02.960
Like I know I made the right fucking decision.
I knew that,

492
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.130
that it was going to be a fucking issue.
Um,

493
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:12.670
I more thought that she was going to go after she gets so overly protective that

494
00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.050
once she bonded with the baby that it was going to be like she couldn't be

495
00:31:18.051 --> 00:31:19.670
lunging at people down the street.

496
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.470
Cause according to my trainer that it would cause her even more fucking anxiety,

497
00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.300
um,
that they,
they have like a bay,
you know?
Yeah,
I hear that.
Hey Shit like that.

498
00:31:29.301 --> 00:31:32.510
I have heard stories of like people that like they have a dog,
right?

499
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:36.800
And then they have like a baby and then the dog like lays underneath the crib.

500
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:40.370
And the parents are walking to the baby and the dog starts growling.

501
00:31:40.371 --> 00:31:43.250
So then they gotta like get food,
you know,

502
00:31:43.251 --> 00:31:44.900
and throw it to the dog will go get it.

503
00:31:44.901 --> 00:31:48.110
Not realizing that you're rewarding the dog for the behaviors that you don't

504
00:31:48.111 --> 00:31:51.680
want it to do.
It's just too fucking much.
And um,

505
00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.770
um,
I yeah,

506
00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:01.830
I am 100% at peace with the decision that we made and I am also so fucking happy

507
00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:09.130
that she has a great home.
She looked fucking amazing and um,

508
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.850
you know,
I got to walk over the last couple of days,
you know,

509
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.610
playing what they're and all that type of stuff.
It was really fucking great,

510
00:32:15.611 --> 00:32:19.330
but definitely obviously made the right decision.
You know what I mean?

511
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:23.800
And I'm not trashing the breed or anything like that.
We just got a dog that was,

512
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:26.110
I dunno,
this dog got,

513
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.160
it's amazing that this dog has not been put down like fucking nine times.

514
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.990
You know,
this dog is just,
it's like,
it's real.
It's fucking,

515
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.810
they should do a 30 for 30 on this dog.

516
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:41.030
Like all the fucking shit this dog has been through.

517
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.560
And how it always met people that,
you know,

518
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.860
we're in its corner.
We did it.

519
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:52.490
We did what we did fucking 2009 to last year.

520
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:56.900
We did seven years with it at,
uh,

521
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.710
you know,
and now it's,
that's,
you know,
I got a deal,

522
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:05.711
worked out with my trainer that he's going to keep the dog until she passes and

523
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:08.000
I'll still be able to visit her and all that.

524
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:10.070
But that's the last time I'm bringing her buy the house.

525
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.780
It is.
But anytime he comes to town,
I always fun.
Can I go on hikes with her?

526
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:19.460
And I fucking,
I love the dog to death,

527
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.090
but we definitely made the right decision and uh,
you know,

528
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.050
and I'm still fucking pain cause I still have to pay them.
It's weird.

529
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.420
It's like it's his dog,
but it's still my dog.

530
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:31.280
So I'm still paying to board the fucking thing.

531
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.640
This fucking dog is gonna is gonna cost me a fortune.

532
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:39.010
But I absolutely loved that fucking dog to death.
Uh,
I do.

533
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:44.120
I do.
But you know,
uh,
you know,
I knew,

534
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.030
I knew it was going to be a fucking problem.
So,
uh,

535
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:48.200
and I know all your dog people yet.

536
00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.790
They're now he's your energy and is it the Veggie bread?
Fine.
Pin It on me.

537
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:55.400
Pin It on me.
I did not have the skills.
I did not have the skills.

538
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.860
And you know what?
My dog's still alive.

539
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.620
My baby's still alive and I'm not on the news.

540
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.620
It's trying to explain what the fuck just happened.
You know what I mean?

541
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.210
Cause I knew something was going to happen.

542
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:08.450
Someone's going to get bit and then my dog was going to get put down and I was

543
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:13.060
gonna have to deal with some fucking horrific guilt or something.
So,

544
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:18.690
uh,
uh,
that's it.
That's it.
So anyways,
that is the,
uh,

545
00:34:18.691 --> 00:34:22.260
that is the podcast for a this Thursday.

546
00:34:22.261 --> 00:34:25.950
You guys have yourselves a wonderful weekend.
You can stay there and uh,

547
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.360
thank you to everybody that came out of me.

548
00:34:27.361 --> 00:34:30.690
I was hoping to do one show out there in grand rapids.
We got,

549
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.800
we got fucking two sold out and we've got this other one.
And um,

550
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.660
I am in such a silly,
stupid fucking mood.
Um,

551
00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:44.460
the shit that's coming out of my mouth,
I can't fucking wait to just continue on.

552
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:50.230
Um,
figuring out what this next hour is going to be.
All right.
That is it.

553
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.570
Um,
oh,
congratulations to fucking Aaron Judge Jesus Christ.

554
00:34:55.571 --> 00:34:57.280
Did you see that fucking display?

555
00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.500
I love that they said no one could hit one out of the

556
00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:06.070
baseball stadium and he fucking did it.
It's literally like watching Paul Bunyan.

557
00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.450
I'm going to figure out when the fucking Yankees had coming to town.

558
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.980
Hopefully they have an inner league game with the Dodgers so I don't have to

559
00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:15.580
drive all the way down to fucking Anaheim,
which is like a three day trip.

560
00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:18.470
Now you might have people out here.
MMM.

561
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.400
I got to see that guy his rookie season.

562
00:35:21.401 --> 00:35:24.250
I always try to see like when somebody like breaks out like that,

563
00:35:24.251 --> 00:35:25.810
you try to seem that rookie season.

564
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.170
I've been doing that all the way since back like a Allen Iverson.

565
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.720
I saw him his rookie season.
I always tell this story.

566
00:35:31.721 --> 00:35:34.030
I saw him his rookie season before he had the corn rows.

567
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.010
I saw him at the La sports arena.

568
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.440
Biggie smalls was the crowd on that trip when he got murdered.

569
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:42.120
Uh,

570
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.120
like a few days later and I fucking walked up to him after and he was standing

571
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:48.420
there.
I remember he had like his,

572
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.430
his security guys were standing there and he looked cooler.
Shitty.

573
00:35:53.431 --> 00:35:55.800
I'd like this purple like long fucking coding.

574
00:35:55.801 --> 00:36:00.480
I like the color of royalty and stuff,
you know,
any,
I'd like these sunglasses on.

575
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:04.790
And a,
I remember some guy walked by and just went,

576
00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.590
baby ba Ba yelled at him.
I mean he just went,
what's up boo?

577
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.990
So just like that and like,
I swear to God,
like what you look up on the schedule,

578
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:17.180
70 sixers versus the fucking La Clippers.

579
00:36:17.181 --> 00:36:21.920
That was 1997 and it was either like the end of February,

580
00:36:21.921 --> 00:36:25.070
early March.
And that was the trip.
Man.
I keep,

581
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.130
he wasn't alive for like another fucking week.
It was so creepy.

582
00:36:28.131 --> 00:36:31.490
He was only 20 fucking for crazy.
And by the way,

583
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.870
there was just the 10 year anniversary of that or that genius getting fucking

584
00:36:35.871 --> 00:36:38.270
killed.
And they still haven't been able to figure out who the fuck did it.

585
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.270
Unbelievable.
I said,
I can't find who killed Kennedy.
Right?

586
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.850
If you believe in that Shit,
you know what I mean?

587
00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.610
How hard they gonna look at for fucking rapper gets shot.
You know what I mean?

588
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.100
They're going to look the other way with a president.

589
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:55.270
Do you think that was all him?
That single bolt action.
Fucking rifle.

590
00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.730
Jesus Christ.
I don't know.
They was a marine.
Who knows?

591
00:37:00.731 --> 00:37:02.890
All right.
I don't know what I'm talking in circles here.
All right,

592
00:37:02.891 --> 00:37:05.950
go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.

594
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.240

What the Hell's the next one?
Oh,

595
00:37:13.241 --> 00:37:14.740
it's in Britain.
What am I talking about?
Oh,

596
00:37:14.741 --> 00:37:18.370
what's his faces are Lewis Hamilton's a Hong Kong.
Alright,

I'll see you all.
Listen to the music,

I can't end this podcast.

598
00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:25.980
Listen to the music and enjoy a greatest hits Thursday podcast.

599
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.310
Mothers' Day going by in a year that no longer exists.
All right.

600
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.383
<v 3>No</v>

601
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.533
[inaudible] [inaudible]

602
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.143
[inaudible] [inaudible]

603
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.970
<v 0>you guys see that?
I just saw a commercial,
uh,
uh,</v>

604
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.800
for Kentucky Fried Chicken with the parents are all excited because two bratty

605
00:38:31.801 --> 00:38:36.100
kids won't sit still at the dinner table,
but the got I'm this fucking

606
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.390
<v 7>chicken and they're feeding it to them.</v>

607
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.670
They basically very subtly saying that there's drugs in this chicken that will

608
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:47.020
make your spastic children chill the fuck out and spastic.
I mean like,
you know,

609
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.840
not,
not the way they mean.
And over there in Great Britain,

610
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.240
you can't say that on the comedies or you can say it in a comedy club over in

611
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:56.480
Scotland,
but you'll have a rough,

612
00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:00.040
you'll have a rough go of it if you say the kid was spastic over there,

613
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:04.060
that means like severely a mentally challenged over here.

614
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:06.280
It just means you're not going to get laid to you at 26

615
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.100
when you were in Grad school looking over a fucking cadaver,
right.

616
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:17.380
With some other fucking nerve narrowed.
Right.

617
00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:18.610
And you're just sitting there going,

618
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:21.760
you know the ankle bones connected to the knee bone.
Right.

619
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.160
Has any of this made any sense?
It shouldn't.

620
00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:28.030
It's fucking Sunday night and I am spent and I got a whole bunch of Shit I have

621
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:31.870
to do tomorrow,
so I got to do it tonight.
All right,
I'm off my game.

622
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.790
All right,
you,
you cleanse your liver and like 42 43 days or something like that.

623
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:41.770
Every drunk I know has told me that every drunk I know that does not have a

624
00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:46.180
medical degree has told me that if you go 42 43 days,

625
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:50.170
you will cleanse your liver at least to the booze.
You know?

626
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.910
Now if you fucking,
you start doing blow or a,

627
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:55.241
you know,

628
00:39:55.241 --> 00:39:58.840
eating a bunch of trans fat fucking food or feeding your kids Kentucky Fried

629
00:39:58.841 --> 00:40:02.430
fucking chicken,
Jesus Christ.

630
00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.580
What happened to parents that you got drug your kids to keep them under control.

631
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:13.530
You know,
you know what it is.
Kids don't respect their parents,
they respect them,

632
00:40:13.531 --> 00:40:18.300
but they don't respect like,
oh my God,
this,
this person could wring my neck,

633
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.180
could pick me up by my hair.
Right.

634
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.480
Could grab a paddle and fucking,
you know,

635
00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.580
mostly hit my ass,

636
00:40:26.581 --> 00:40:30.480
but also kinda hit my lower back because I'm squirming right.

637
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.980
That doesn't exist anymore.
So now these kids is so fucking out of control.

638
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:39.710
These people have to go down and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Okay.

639
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:40.600
And I,
I,

640
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.600
I use the term chicken very loosely to go down and whatever that is,

641
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.560
that's in that bucket.
Okay.
If it doesn't have a beak,

642
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.310
it doesn't have feet.
If it's fucking,
you know,

643
00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:00.710
chest,
his breasts is sticking out like the cast on fucking,
uh,
what was,

644
00:41:00.711 --> 00:41:04.850
what was that show with the Italians there on New Jersey Shore Jersey shore.

645
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.700
Right.
My world.
That's not a fucking chicken.

646
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.110
You know,

647
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:15.580
you want the chicken that looked like Mark McGuire in his rookie season.

648
00:41:15.581 --> 00:41:19.540
You don't want to eat the chicken that looks like mark McGwire when he fucking

649
00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:22.300
played for the cardinals.
You know,

650
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.360
do you eat a regular fucking chicken?
First of all,

651
00:41:27.361 --> 00:41:30.420
it's going to look like a pigeon to you because you so used to see in those

652
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:35.890
roided up ones that they have row that you got down there at you fucking Shaws,

653
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.830
right?
Your Vons,
you,
JC Penney's,

654
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:42.980
wherever the fuck you buy your goddamn chicken,
you go down,

655
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.490
you go down to any one of the main stream fucking supermarkets.

656
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:52.160
Okay.
And I swear to God when you get to the chicken section,
okay,
if you've,

657
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:56.900
if you've slept for the last 30 years,
like that Van Gundy guy under the bridge,

658
00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:01.580
whatever his fucking name is,
Van Morrison,
the hell's his name,
Rip Van Winkle.

659
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.050
Right.
That was one of those people,
one of the vans.
Um,

660
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:07.640
<v 2>yeah.</v>

661
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.400
<v 7>If you slept for the last 30 years and you went down,
okay.</v>

662
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.640
And they showed you what a chicken was,
you'd be like,
ah.
You'd be like,

663
00:42:13.641 --> 00:42:18.370
that ain't no chicken.
Okay?
It's a God damn Turkey.
I know.
Fucking die.

664
00:42:18.371 --> 00:42:21.510
No fucking Turkey when I see one.
Alright.

665
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.680
I no such thing as a mad time.

666
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:29.320
Fucking chicken can't be done.
No Sir.
No Sir.

667
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:34.110
Get off my property.
Okay.

Um,

671
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.710
you would think it was a fucking Turkey.
And the thing is,
is now it's a chicken.

672
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.710
And I remember I watched one of those food banks when I was fucking liberal.

673
00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:55.731
Goddamn thinks,
you know,

674
00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:59.000
talking about flying carpets and electric roads and all that bullshit.

675
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.160
Somewhere in there they were talking about,
you know,

676
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:03.080
the food supply and our poison.

677
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:07.850
It is poisonous poison in his is.
Um,

678
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:13.630
so I fucking went down to a farmer's fucking market and um,

679
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.630
I said I wanna,
I wanna,
I wanna all I want,
I want,

680
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.120
I want an all natural fucking chicken.
I can't even talk.
I'm so tired.

681
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.380
One and all natural chicken.
The guy goes,

682
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:31.850
these are all natural.
And I said,
all natural.
And he goes,
well,

683
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.160
I'm Mike.
Come on,
where is it?

684
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.840
And he had to walk around the corner sitting over there,
lonely.

685
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.880
I swear to God,

686
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.450
looking like a dove look like in somebody killed the fucking dump because right

687
00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:48.470
there,
that one right there is 100% all natural.
Nothing's wrong with it.

688
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:52.000
And I was like,
okay.
I was like,
what at?
What?

689
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.510
That's what a chicken is supposed to look like.

690
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.600
And he raised his eyebrows and he,

691
00:43:58.601 --> 00:44:02.140
he kind of put his lips together so they were straight line and then he nodded,

692
00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.060
you know,
that look that people do like,
like yeah,
I'm in the Matrix.

693
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.370
I realize I'm in the Matrix,
but you know,

694
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:15.020
I knocked the bitch up so I got to be selling these roided up chickens.
No.

695
00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:20.020
Um,
anyways,
anyway,
what the fuck I'm talking about?

696
00:44:20.021 --> 00:44:23.350
So basically that's what these people are eating over there.
Okay.
They,
uh,

697
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:27.600
they are drugging up
the kids,

698
00:44:27.601 --> 00:44:32.601
but I can't get mad at him because I actually did that to Murphy and,

699
00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.360
uh,
Don l Rawlings.
I've told this story before,
Hey,

700
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:38.280
I'll tell it against my fucking podcast.

701
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.150
I actually drug I the exact thing that they're doing in that Kentucky Fried

702
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:43.900
Chicken commercial with it,

703
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:48.300
trying to get their kids to sit still by just feeding them so full of these

704
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:53.160
fucking trans fats from these roided up beatless fucking chickens with their

705
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:56.070
Dolly Parton breasts.
Disses right.

706
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.320
I did that to fucking Don Allan,
Charlie.

707
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.920
I was hung over and we were taking a car service from Chicago xannies up to one

708
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:11.910
of those whenever the fuck it was
Saint Charles,

709
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.980
it was a three city run and one of them was Saint Charles.

710
00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.880
So we're getting in the fucking Limo,
Don L's in rare form.

711
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.870
Charlie's in rare form their fucking Gavin and trash and people in me and

712
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:27.780
everybody and I just don't want to hear it.
I'm like,

713
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:31.890
I don't want to listen to these fucking guys running that Goddamn yaps in the

714
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:35.370
back of this car the whole fucking way up.
I want a nice quiet ride.

715
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.250
This is going to suck.
And I walked outside,

716
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:42.030
hung over and I walked into the Chicago where you know,

717
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.750
almost got hit by three fat people.
And,
um,

718
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:51.780
I looked up the street and I saw it,
I saw Popeye's and I was like,

719
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.650
oh,
thank God.

720
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.000
And I fucking walked in there and I got all this fucking Popeye's chicken with

721
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.110
biscuits and all of this shit food.

722
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.640
And I brought it back to the car.
And as the car pulled up,

723
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:10.410
they came out and I say,
guys,
I got sell some.
I got some food.
And they went,
ah,

724
00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.690
that's fucking great.
You know,
they were hungry or whatever.

725
00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:17.610
And they started chowing that fucking Popeye's food.
And I sat back,

726
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:19.080
nibbling on drum stick,

727
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.210
and I swear to God,
10 minutes later they were asleep.

728
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.720
I'm not lying to you.
They will fucking asleep,

729
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:34.980
snoring the whole way up.
And I was just sitting there loving life,

730
00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:38.220
the whole fucking write up.
And I,
you know what,
I admitted to them later.

731
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:42.660
They thought it was funny,
but that's basic what it is.
They call it the Itis,

732
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:44.791
that's what they call it.

733
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:47.310
When you eat that shit food and then you have to go to sleep,

734
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:51.270
they call it the Itis,
I guess.
And by they,
I mean African Americans.

735
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.800
Um,
they call it the fucking ideas and that's what the gut,

736
00:46:56.090 --> 00:47:01.090
and I learned that from Don l because I don't know how that man stayed in shape,

737
00:47:02.311 --> 00:47:03.840
but he had the worst diet.

738
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:07.740
He's one of those guys who like you stopped for gas and he comes out of the gas

739
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:10.800
station with like one of those gas station hotdogs

740
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:18.970
and he would eat it and then he would immediately fall asleep.
And I,

741
00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.540
and I would say to Charlie,
look at this guy,
he's sleeping.
And Chad be like,

742
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.070
yeah man,
he got the itis.
And he explained that to me in what,

743
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:29.070
that little bit of information it went,

744
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:34.290
my evil white brain and I drug my two African American friends way back in the

745
00:47:36.611 --> 00:47:40.300
year 2005.
Um,
and that's a little chicken story for you.

746
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:41.560
What time did you like dad?
Everybody.

747
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.800
So that's what the fuck they're saying right there.

748
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:48.040
That's what Kentucky Fried Chicken is allegedly saying.

749
00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:52.480
I guess I have to say a legit,
so they have lawyers on retainer.

750
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.190
Don't attack my fucking plot podcast as far as I can tell.

751
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.480
I'm asking you right now.
Um,

752
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:04.210
Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding behind your fucking letters,
KFC.

753
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:06.070
Is that what the fuck you do?
Is that what you're saying?

754
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:08.340
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

755
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:13.340
<v 7>If you've got kids who are not stimulated enough that they can't even sit down,</v>

756
00:48:13.741 --> 00:48:18.300
if you haven't read yet to run him around,
you've got to tie your kids out.

757
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.660
Open the door.
You send them out in the fucking yard,
Gad God's side.

758
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.420
Get outside and play.
That's what you do.

759
00:48:24.421 --> 00:48:28.820
Like a Goddamn one of those fucking Irish dogs there was bred to have to,

760
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:31.590
to herd sheep.
You've got to let that fucking thing run around.

761
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.050
Run around in circles.
Guy,
get out there,
take a ball.

762
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.670
You just fucking throw it out in traffic and let the dog run around.

763
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.090
Dodgy cars that comes in,
it's going to lay down.
Okay?

764
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:43.440
It's not going to jump all over.

765
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.200
Company sticking its cold nose right in their fucking who has.

766
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.880
That's what you gotta do with your kids.
You've got to send him outside,
right?

767
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.870
But to catch a Predator and all these other fucking shows,
you know,

768
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:58.710
all these shows on TV where people forget they're kids are in a car with the

769
00:48:58.711 --> 00:48:59.730
windows rolled up.

770
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.630
Their kids are too fucking dumb to roll them down or they're too weak because

771
00:49:03.631 --> 00:49:06.960
they haven't gone outside and climbed a fucking tree and they stay in there and

772
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:11.010
the,
their,
their brains get cooked like a boxer,
you know,

773
00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.130
do you know that dog boxes?
They don't,
they don't do well on this sun.
We'll,

774
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:18.740
we'll need to do fat kids.
You leave the windows rolled up,
you know,

775
00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.350
when they got those weak arms that all he doesn't like.

776
00:49:21.351 --> 00:49:26.090
The most tedious things they ever did was take a wrapper off of a fucking,
uh,

777
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.860
an ice cream sandwich.
Right?
You can't leave them in the car.

778
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.170
My mother left us in the car all the fucking time.
She would go to school,

779
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.400
she was going to school during the day trying to further her education and she

780
00:49:40.401 --> 00:49:44.960
left five fucking kids in the car with the windows rolled up and money for

781
00:49:44.961 --> 00:49:47.840
Burger King.
And she would say to us,
just go into the Burger.

782
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.680
That's the only time you were to leave this car over the left,

783
00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:54.860
over the next three fucking hours when I'm in class.

784
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.150
And she would disappear around the corner after we said,
absolutely mom.

785
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.970
And she walked away.
And uh,

786
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
we immediately would get out of the car and start walking up and down the

787
00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:09.170
streets in Boston.
We go into fucking burger king and we,

788
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.750
we'd have something to eat.
Do you know what happened nowadays,

789
00:50:11.751 --> 00:50:14.810
if they just saw five fucking dirty face kids walking up and down,

790
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:18.650
calm AV Boylston street going into a burger king,

791
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.110
we're going to cast a fucking nanny.

792
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.850
Someone would've filmed it and my mother would have been in,

793
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:28.790
they would have taken us away,
you know,
but,

794
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:32.660
but they didn't because there was no cameras back then or videotape ones.
I mean,

795
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.613
there was,

796
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:38.860
but only the people add them on like the news and a young Steven Spielberg.

797
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:43.880
So we went in there and we fucking got some food Kleinberg and cars and fucking

798
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:48.850
yelled at people and Shit,
you know,
hanging on Platt,

799
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.090
parking meters and all that.

800
00:50:50.091 --> 00:50:54.110
Hence we had the fucking forearm strength to roll down the windows and none of

801
00:50:54.111 --> 00:50:57.200
us ever had an issue in the car.
And you know what?

802
00:50:57.201 --> 00:51:00.350
I think that's one to grow on today.
You go people,

803
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.610
I'm not saying KFC is food,
I'm not,
I'm just kidding.

804
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.470
I'm not saying it's bad food.
Every once in a while who's kitten home?

805
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:08.870
Every once in a,
we don't go anywhere.
He great.

806
00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:11.780
If he could just fucking do heroin the way you can eat Mcdonald's,

807
00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:16.340
just like every once in awhile he just be like,
you know what?
Yeah,

808
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.680
let's just fucking tie off.

809
00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:23.930
Not off for the rest of the fucking day in like the people that work understood

810
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:27.510
it,
you know?
Hey,
where were you yesterday on any,

811
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.660
I got this black tar heroin came in.
You know,

812
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:34.250
I hadn't done it like three months away.
Figured fuck it.
Oh,

813
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:37.040
is that what you did?
How was it?
I wasn't,
you know,
like,
like you went to Aruba,

814
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:41.180
you said,
oh dude,
it was awesome.
Fucking,
I don't remember shit.

815
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.290
Can you know you get addicted?

816
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:46.423
<v 3>Two</v>

817
00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:17.043
[inaudible] [inaudible]

818
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.623
[inaudible] [inaudible]

819
00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:27.663
<v 7>yeah.</v>

820
00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:31.760
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

821
00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:36.200
This is built bar and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

822
00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:40.090
July 13th,
2009.
This is my third attempt,

823
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:44.930
possibly the fourth attempt to,
uh,
try to do this podcast.

824
00:52:44.931 --> 00:52:48.560
But,
uh,
as always,
I got 9,000 things on my mind.

825
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:52.580
I have to go to the airport and like two fucking hours to fly up to do my shows

826
00:52:52.581 --> 00:52:53.660
in San Francisco,

827
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:59.360
<v 0>um,
this evening.
And uh,
I already walked my frigging dog,</v>

828
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.970
so I got that out of the way.
And uh,

829
00:53:02.971 --> 00:53:06.080
I'm actually psyched to be at my apartment this the first time I've been here in

830
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:10.850
about five weeks and it's nice to be sitting here on my couch with my feet on my

831
00:53:10.851 --> 00:53:13.820
coffee table.
Um,

832
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.800
<v 8>do I own anything else?
No,
I rent.
So the landlord owns the fucking floor,</v>

833
00:53:19.801 --> 00:53:20.940
but I don't have my feet on it.

834
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.090
<v 0>All right.
So fuck him</v>

835
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:31.050
<v 8>to tell you guys about my place I fucking had,
I came home.
Right.
And you know,</v>

836
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:33.900
I don't know if you guys have ever left your life for five weeks,

837
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.720
but when you come back,
it's a nightmare.

838
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:41.700
First of all is like three pounds of mail
and a,
I don't know about you guys,

839
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:45.660
but every once in awhile I give to one of these,
uh,
you know,

840
00:53:45.661 --> 00:53:49.080
save the wolves or a,
you know,

841
00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:53.850
saved this park or save these lepers or whatever the fuck the,
uh,

842
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.580
the causes.
And I swear to God,

843
00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.990
don't ever give money through the mail.
Okay.

844
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:03.090
Give it directly to a homeless guy.
You know,

845
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.750
throw a hamburger to a fucking wolf from your car window,

846
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:09.300
but for the love of God,
do not get on.

847
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:13.230
Don't fucking give money through the mail because when you do,

848
00:54:13.231 --> 00:54:17.760
they literally clear out an acre of trees from the rainforest trying to send you

849
00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:19.980
shit to get more money from you.
It's actually annoying.

850
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.600
It's like if you feel like a SAP,

851
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:25.980
like you just feel like everyone out there who's looking for money,
like your,

852
00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:30.690
your address just lit up like,
oh,
we got a SAP,
we've got a live one here.

853
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:34.800
He actually gave money.
Holy.
Oh my God,
this guy gives a shit about wolves.

854
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:36.953
You know,

855
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.250
where the fuck were the wolf's by the way before then,

856
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:45.390
before they reintroduce them into the parks and they started killing elk and

857
00:54:45.391 --> 00:54:48.660
competing with the bears and more importantly the hunters so the hunters don't

858
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:51.750
want them there.
Is that,
is that what's going on?
Is that the wolf issue?

859
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.920
You know what exactly is going on?

860
00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.780
You're Wolfe's where the fuck are wolves anyways?

861
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:02.490
Is there any place out there and you know is not a fucking mall at this point?

862
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.060
I don't know.
Huh?
Was that intriguing for your Monday?

863
00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.540
Might have a citizen fucking that'll get the conversation going,
Huh?
All right.

864
00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:14.541
This podcast is sucked so far and so I know a podcast sucked if fucking three

865
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:18.000
minutes into it.
I'm already looking for questions that people have sent me.

866
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.850
All right.
I'm a little out of it.
People.
I went and I went,

867
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.880
I went a little hardcore the other night as always,

868
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:26.780
which is why I'm shutting it down.
And I'm,
I'm,

869
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.990
I'm just drinking cranberry juice with Lyme now after my shows for awhile.
Okay.

870
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.830
And all you fucking douchebags who've watched the departed will all come up to

871
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.540
me.
They were you on your period?

872
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:40.920
Did you fucking see that movie that 9 million other fucking people saw,
hey,

873
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:44.790
when people quote fucking lines from movies,
you know,
like,

874
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:49.200
like the country didn't see it already.
You know what I mean?

875
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:53.640
It's like you're already telling an old fucking joke.
Nobody cares.
All right.

876
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.900
Did I say I was in a good mood this week?
I don't sound like it.
Do I?
Um,

877
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.840
girlfriends laughing at me.
All right.
Um,
all right,
let's get to the,
uh,

878
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.610
oh,
wait a minute.
You know,
I,

879
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:06.450
I didn't finish telling the story now I want a little hard.
The other night,

880
00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:07.530
I actually a,

881
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.030
I ordered that UFC fight and I had a couple of friends come over who will all

882
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:15.990
remain nameless because I'm a guy's guy and I won't name names.
Huh?

883
00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:20.320
You like that?
Like how I just dubbed myself a guy's guy,
you know,

884
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.710
if Michael Jackson can give himself a fucking nickname,

885
00:56:22.711 --> 00:56:27.490
why can't I give myself one bill?
Burn the guy's guy,
the king of guys guys.

886
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.150
And uh,
you know,
I got a lot of,
I got an email.
This guy was,

887
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.130
I got a couple of emails of people giving me Shit,
uh,

888
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:40.140
saying I completely dropped the ball when it came to Michael Jackson's death and

889
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:45.850
I just talked about what a big star he was and I didn't chastise them for,

890
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:51.200
uh,
stuff that he got acquitted of.
And uh,
and you know,

891
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:53.740
I disagree with you.
I 100%.

892
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:58.450
I think the hacky way to go on that one was to talk about how the guy,
you know,

893
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.950
you know,
is,
is to be that moron who walks around saying that,
you know,

894
00:57:02.951 --> 00:57:07.470
he's guilty of that shit even though he was never convicted.
Okay.
Now,

895
00:57:07.471 --> 00:57:11.290
I know the guy got a tie.
He's got a ton of fucking money and all of that stuff.

896
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:14.950
But you know,
I'm not saying he did.
I'm not saying he didn't,
but you know,

897
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:19.300
that's so,
I don't know.
I just thought that that was a hacky way to go to be,

898
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:19.840
you know,

899
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.840
considering some fucking congressmen out on Long Island did some rant,

900
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.550
you know,
and put it up on youtube and got like a zillion hits.
I mean,

901
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:34.300
right there,
you know that that's a hacky route to go is a comedian.

902
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:38.950
If fucking some guy who,
you know,
where's like penny loafers without socks.

903
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:43.060
You know,
if that guy can come up with a fucking video of the shit,

904
00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:44.100
you know what I mean?
Why don't,

905
00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.780
why don't you go watch that guy's video for his insightful,

906
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:51.430
just goes and fucking kid folker UNOS.
This goes,
you're fucking freak.

907
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:55.330
You know those people who just go that complete need your,
I mean,
how,

908
00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:59.830
how in an interesting is it to go that fucking route,
you know,

909
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:05.710
hey,
you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to state the obvious,
you know,

910
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:09.490
this guy's weird.
He had 9,000 plastic surgeries.

911
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:12.280
What the fuck is with this guy and go the exact same route.

912
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.640
People went with that chick with the eight fucking babies.

913
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:21.460
Did that make any sense whatsoever?
I'm just saying,
you know Jesus Christ.

914
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:25.600
Well then when I,
when I'm talking about Elvis was fat while I'm at it,
you know.

915
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:30.100
All right.
Anyways,
I was watching that UFC you guys want shut the other night,

916
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:36.060
Brock Lesnar probably had the best post fight interview I've ever seen in my

917
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:39.760
life.
He basically pounded this guy,

918
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.950
was it frank Mir and I don't even know the fucking names.

919
00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:45.670
I'm out of the loop when it comes to that shit.
This guy basically to just,

920
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:46.960
if you're not into the UFC,

921
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:51.961
this is how big the guy basically has a tattoo of a sword on his chest and he's

922
00:58:52.271 --> 00:58:56.650
so big.
I think it's like fucking actual size.
You know what I mean?

923
00:58:56.651 --> 00:59:00.130
Like if I got that tattoo would look like a little paring knife on my chest

924
00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:04.960
where his literally he's got the fuck.
It's like a Samurai sword.

925
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.390
It star.
I don't even think it starts.

926
00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:11.950
It starts like above his navel and it goes all the way up to his neck.

927
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:15.910
And of course he has the pointed the sword at his fucking throat.

928
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:21.650
Guys,
just a maniac.
You know what I love too was when he lost,

929
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.513
when he won,

930
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:26.390
the crowd starts booing him and immediately gives everybody the finger.

931
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.620
And when he comes up to the microphone,
everyone's born and when he's gone,

932
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:33.860
I love it.
I love it.
And you could clearly see that he didn't love it.

933
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:38.870
You know Haiti,
Brock,
you didn't love it.
You want to be loved.

934
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:41.740
Okay.
But it was great.
He wrote,
they,

935
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:45.380
I think they finally have a good heel and the UFC,
you know what I mean?

936
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:48.320
You Watch these guys,
these guys are the toughest motherfuckers on the planet.

937
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:50.420
And for the most part,
when they end the fights,

938
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:54.710
they always just compliment the other guy.
Say,
I respect the guy,
or whatever.

939
00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:56.930
But this night was,
it was fucking great.

940
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:59.840
This one guy knocked out this other dude.

941
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.570
The guys just lay in there on the ground.

942
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:06.980
And then this the fucking dude who knocks him out.
Then for some reason,

943
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:11.270
leaps up into the air and just lands on them and punches him in the face again.

944
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:16.000
It was like attempted murder and then he like admits to it at the end of the

945
01:00:16.001 --> 01:00:20.050
fight.
Like,
yeah,
I did that.
I did the second one because,
uh,
you know,

946
01:00:20.051 --> 01:00:24.700
we talked a lot of shit.
It was great.

947
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:27.370
He was total thunder.
Dolman uh,

948
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:30.640
unlike a lot of paper views that you'd throw your fucking money down and

949
01:00:30.641 --> 01:00:32.170
afterwards you feel like you got raped.

950
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:37.000
I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.
So,
uh,
um,
uh,
there you go.

951
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.740
If you,
if you want to pick a pay for pay per view,
go with the UFC.
Um,

952
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.680
what the fuck did Brock say?
He said something like,
uh,
he's like,
God,

953
01:00:46.681 --> 01:00:48.570
that guy,
you know,
the guy fighting,
he goes yellow,

954
01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:52.510
horseshoe up his ass last fight.
I pulled it out and I,

955
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.200
you it over his head.
Woo.

956
01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.780
And he had like to psycho fucking date rape vibe.

957
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:01.510
I'm literally waking up my entire fucking complex,

958
01:01:01.511 --> 01:01:04.220
doing a bad impression of fucking Brock Lesnar.
All I all,

959
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:07.030
whatever was a great thing.
Let's go to the gas bill.
All right,

960
01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:09.370
let me get out of this fucking thing because you know,
half,

961
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.190
you know as I'm doing this podcast,
half of my brain's going,
dude,

962
01:01:12.191 --> 01:01:16.960
you haven't packed yet and um,
I'm not going to pack shit anyway.

963
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:20.890
So this is one of these overnight gigs.
What I do is I basically wear the shoes.

964
01:01:20.891 --> 01:01:24.820
So I have them,
I wear the shoes that I'm going to wear on stage,
right.

965
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.640
And then I just,
whatever I wear in the planes,

966
01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.210
whenever I went on the plane and I just fucking pack my,
my,

967
01:01:31.211 --> 01:01:34.180
my pants and the shirt that I'm going to wear that night.

968
01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:37.450
And then like a fucking toothbrush,
toothpaste,
shave and shit,

969
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:41.050
I put it into a lunch back little plastic thing and I throw it in and that's

970
01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:45.610
fucking it.
That's it.
And I zip right through the airport,
you know,

971
01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.780
security guards looking at me,
what's with this guy?
He doesn't have any luggage.

972
01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:52.870
He doesn't have any luggage.
The fucks with this guy.

973
01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:55.030
I'll tell you what the fuck's with this guy.
He's going to San Francisco.

974
01:01:55.031 --> 01:01:58.180
He's coming right back and he doesn't have any drugs in his ass.
All right.

975
01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:02.740
I'm telling jokes.
Stop fucking looking at me.
All right,
let's go to ask bill.
Um,

976
01:02:02.741 --> 01:02:04.300
here's an interesting question.
Uh,
Bill,

977
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.870
I've been dating the same girl for about two and a half years now.

978
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:10.570
We've talked about having a threesome,

979
01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:15.220
but I've never met the right girl to do it with.
Oh,
okay.
Here we go.

980
01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:20.730
This is called the beginning of the end of a relationship.
Um,

981
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.350
we're tired of fucking each other and we've admitted it to one another and now

982
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:27.150
we're going to go outside the relationship,

983
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:29.400
but we're too codependent to break up with one another.

984
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.010
I'm just fucking with you.
All right.
Here we go.
Uh,
he says,

985
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:36.480
I'm 28 and my girlfriend is 26.
About two months ago,

986
01:02:36.481 --> 01:02:37.370
I added some,

987
01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:42.150
I added some random cougar to my Facebook who is 42.

988
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:45.670
Uh,
right now it's getting interesting.
Uh,

989
01:02:45.671 --> 01:02:49.110
my girlfriend got all pissed about it and we had a minor fight.

990
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:54.860
Fast forward to this past Thursday and my girlfriend runs into the cougar at a

991
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:59.220
bar while she's out getting hammered.
Okay,
timeout.

992
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.600
You added some random cougar on Facebook.

993
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.370
There's what?

994
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:10.370
4 billion people on Facebook and somehow your girlfriend runs into the random

995
01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:14.280
cougar.
Dude,
you added an old fucking broad.

996
01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:19.170
You met in a bar down the street.
Are you on Facebook?
Yeah,
I'm on Facebook.

997
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.000
You know,
add me.
She's probably already rubbed one out.
Huh?

998
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:25.650
Were there old wrinkled up hand?

999
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.690
She probably already gave you a hand job,
but the local Hooters didn't.

1000
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:36.540
You didn't,
she write and then you fucking load.

1001
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:38.250
Then you feel guilty and you're like,
all right,

1002
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:40.950
well if I include her with my girlfriend,
maybe I can get some of that.

1003
01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:45.810
I just sorta cheated stench off of me.
All right,
I'm judging.
I'm sorry.

1004
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.350
Let's plow ahead here.
So we goes,
uh,

1005
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:53.430
I'm at home and I get a call from my girl at one in the morning who says,

1006
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:57.030
I met the chick you added on Facebook and we should have a threesome with her.

1007
01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:01.800
Good for her.
Jesus Christ.
All right.
At first I was kind of excited,

1008
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.790
but then my girlfriend says she wanted to take her back to the apartment to

1009
01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:09.890
experiment with just the two of them.
Uh,

1010
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.710
this cougars good.
She's good.
She's sweet,
talked to you,
right,

1011
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.540
sweet talk to you and now she's sweet talking your girlfriend.
Um,

1012
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:20.160
she's in.
The guy says,
ah.

1013
01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:24.930
I freaked out and told her that it would hurt my feelings if she messed around

1014
01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:27.780
without me.
Basically.
My question is,

1015
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:32.640
is it cheating for my girlfriend to hook up with another chick if I'm not there?

1016
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.270
All right,
dude.
You know what?
You're asking the wrong question.

1017
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.910
If I could be so bold here,

1018
01:04:38.911 --> 01:04:43.170
the question you should really be asking yourself right now is when you look at

1019
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:44.550
your girlfriend,
you got to say,

1020
01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:48.330
is this the future mother of my children?

1021
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:52.960
If it is,
don't have a threesome with her.

1022
01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:57.910
Okay.
Because I don't care how much you love her.

1023
01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.230
The sight of her going down on that old clam is just something that,

1024
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.063
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1025
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:09.040
<v 8>it's just something that I just psychologically,</v>

1026
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.300
I don't know how you're going to be,

1027
01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:15.420
that's going to be holding your child something that hopefully 50% looks like

1028
01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:19.570
you one day.
You know what I'm saying?
That's just a,
uh,

1029
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.590
you know,
seriously do it.
If this is this,

1030
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.720
if this is the woman you want to marry and man,
come on man,

1031
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.880
some dusty old broad down the street.

1032
01:05:27.881 --> 01:05:32.320
You guys are going to fucking do an indecent proposal with that.

1033
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.370
You know,
I could see if you a,

1034
01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:40.780
there's something about going to another country or a far away place and doing

1035
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:43.120
something like that because you know,
you get to play that,
oh,

1036
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:44.500
we're just different people now.

1037
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.900
And then you come back and you act like it never happened.

1038
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:50.950
You just compartmentalize it and you know,
it comes up in an argument,
you know,

1039
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:52.210
fucking 12 years later,

1040
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.760
but by then who gives a shit because you're both old and out of shape.

1041
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:59.920
But to go right down this street,
you're basically shitting way you're eating.
Um,

1042
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.430
I dunno,
Dude.
I like,
if you're not going to marry this girl,

1043
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:07.560
then you know why not?
I would do it for the story,
but,
uh,

1044
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.120
if you really think that this is the girl you're going to marry,
I would,

1045
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:14.950
I would tap out of this one.
I'd wait for a,
I'd wait for some fresher fish.

1046
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:20.320
Jesus Christ.
Bill.
Sorry.
I've been really crude lately on this thing.

1047
01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.170
Um,
but anyways,
I will ask your question is,

1048
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.710
is it cheating for my girlfriend to hook up with another chick if I'm not there?

1049
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.440
Um,
uh,
Jesus Christ,

1050
01:06:32.441 --> 01:06:36.490
this is just another one where women get away with it.
Right?
I don't know.

1051
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:38.860
Would it be cheating if you went out and blew your best friend?

1052
01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.430
I think it's just kind of fucking weird.

1053
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.230
There's just something about if you have the same sexual parts,

1054
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:52.120
it's like,
it's less cheating.
It's more weird.

1055
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:53.591
Yeah.

1056
01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:57.220
It is weird if she's fucking there and then she's just having a full on lesbian

1057
01:06:57.221 --> 01:06:59.350
thing where if you're there too,

1058
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.740
then it's just sorta like you're adding to like the candy dish.

1059
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.770
You know what I mean?
It's another little spice in there.
Hey,

1060
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.300
I already got one vagina.
Oh look,
there's another one.
You know what I mean?

1061
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:12.370
And you know,
you get to stack them up.

1062
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.270
What you want to do is have the three on one and you just stack them all up.

1063
01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:18.430
What I,
I call that the traffic light,
right?

1064
01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.460
Ah,
Shit.
I think I just coined a phrase there.

1065
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.580
I love how I'm acting like I've actually done any of this.

1066
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:31.870
I haven't done any of that.
You know,

1067
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:36.610
actually care about my girlfriend and is as much as I'd want to have a fucking

1068
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:40.660
two on one.
I just,
I couldn't,
I couldn't,

1069
01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:43.220
I actually mean that she's sitting over there putting lotion on herself.
Like,

1070
01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.930
are you getting all adorable?
Why?

1071
01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:48.490
Why are you looking all nice now that I'm leaving town?
Huh?
What do you got?

1072
01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:52.570
Some office boyfriend.
I'm sick of that lavender robe.

1073
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.940
My girl has this fucking robe.
This is way too personal,
but I really need to,

1074
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.340
but yeah,
he really need to get a new one over the,

1075
01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.700
dress it up a little differently.
Is that the dog?

1076
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:10.210
Okay.
Fucking codependent.
Pitbull.
Can you believe that shit.

1077
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:13.150
So anyways,
dude,
you know what?
I would be honest,
like this is the deal,
man.

1078
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:15.890
If you're not going to,
if you're not going to stay with this girl,

1079
01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:19.190
by all means fucking do it.
By all means do it.

1080
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:23.380
But if you actually love this girl and you're going to marry this girl,
Dee,

1081
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:24.620
do you really want,
I mean,

1082
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.130
the next time you guys get tested for whatever fucking reason,

1083
01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:33.260
you know you get a worry because you,
you,
you put your Dick in and be Davis.

1084
01:08:34.350 --> 01:08:36.110
What are the fucking name was the name of that chick who played?

1085
01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.810
Alison said Alice,

1086
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.590
what the fuck was the name of that?
And Hey,

1087
01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:45.730
what's the name of the housekeeper on the Brady Bunch was Alice,
right?

1088
01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:49.010
It was Alice.
Some reason it came out of my mouth.
It didn't sound right.

1089
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:53.690
All right.
Um,
oh,
and this is the best part of the email.
The guy goes,
ps,

1090
01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:57.440
I tried to use small words in this email because I know how you suck at reading

1091
01:08:57.441 --> 01:09:01.700
things off your computer.
Ah,
Shit.
That really made me laugh.

1092
01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.010
All right.
Even though I didn't live right there.

1093
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:06.710
It did make me laugh because it was the excitement that it was new.

1094
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:09.770
Then I just read it again and it wasn't new to me,

1095
01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:12.800
so I gave it a lifeless read,

1096
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.230
which goes back to what I was talking about earlier.

1097
01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:19.280
When people quote shit from movies that you've already seen and when you meet,

1098
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:21.760
somebody comes up to you and they're like a,
hey,

1099
01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:24.350
have you seen the depart and what?
Have you seen the department yet?
Yeah,
yeah,

1100
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:28.400
I saw it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that one part and they were in the bar.
I saw it,

1101
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:33.170
and they just keep plowing through and no matter what you say,

1102
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:36.470
no matter what you do,
they're going to do the whole fucking scene.

1103
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:38.180
Why can't you just say,
Hey,
listen,

1104
01:09:38.181 --> 01:09:41.270
you know that movie you've already seen and you don't want to hear me do,

1105
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:43.040
I'm going to do it anyways.

1106
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:46.460
So it'd be in your best interest if you don't want to be involved in this,

1107
01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:50.270
to fucking walk away right now,
because I am unstoppable once,

1108
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.200
once I fucking get in this mindset,
you know?
All right.

1109
01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:56.900
Let's go onto the next question.
Hey Bill,
first off,

1110
01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:00.790
a huge fan of the Monday morning podcast.
Thank you.
Uh,

1111
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.440
you've always given some great advice to comedians starting out,

1112
01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:07.580
but I was wondering what advice you have for someone with a few years of comedy

1113
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:08.414
under their belt.

1114
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:11.690
I'm a young comic and I have been doing standup for a few years and I've been

1115
01:10:11.691 --> 01:10:16.520
doing regular work,
coasting,
featuring,
etc.
But I live in a smaller market.

1116
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.500
Uh,
that's a good thing actually when you start now I'm,

1117
01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:24.590
I'm moving to La in a month and I'm very excited to dive into the big comedy

1118
01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:26.840
scene and looking forward to the challenge.
I was wondering,
Bill,

1119
01:10:26.841 --> 01:10:30.640
your thoughts on the various comedy stages in town.
You see beavers,

1120
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.470
the comedy store versus the laugh,
laugh factory and so on.

1121
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.750
What is the vibe from place to place,

1122
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:40.880
which is your favorite since you moved to town?
All right.
This is my whole vibe,

1123
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:45.050
uh,
as far as,
okay,
you're in a small market,
you started in a small market,

1124
01:10:45.051 --> 01:10:46.970
that's a great,
that's where,

1125
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:51.920
I mean I'm basically going with my experience because I started in a smaller

1126
01:10:51.921 --> 01:10:56.690
market in Boston and uh,
before I moved to New York and then coming here to la.

1127
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.160
Um,
so I think starting in a smaller markets better,

1128
01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:03.380
it's just easier to get on stage,
less competition.

1129
01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.300
There's nobody watching you and that type of shit.

1130
01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.670
And then basically what happens two to three years in,

1131
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:08.960
you start looking around going,
all right,

1132
01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:11.630
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here if I'm ever going to get to the next level.

1133
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:15.540
And then you have to make a,
of whether you're going to move to New York or la.

1134
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.190
And um,
I dunno,
I was way more of a New York guy,

1135
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.730
but you basically,

1136
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:25.710
you should check out both places in whichever one you just feel is drawing you

1137
01:11:25.711 --> 01:11:30.120
towards it.
I would go that way.
And as far as what,

1138
01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.170
um,
the comedy store laugh factory,
you see B?
Um,

1139
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.720
I like all of those places and I can tell you this,

1140
01:11:36.721 --> 01:11:40.710
if you moving out to la to get into TV and movies and that type of thing,

1141
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:42.810
I would take an Improv class.

1142
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.240
It's something that I wish I did and it's something I plan on doing soon.
And,
uh,

1143
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:51.690
it's weird.
It's kind of looked down upon by comedians.
Like when they,

1144
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:56.100
when they look at Improv shows,
they,
you know,
somebody throw out an emotion,

1145
01:11:56.101 --> 01:11:59.250
we always consider it like fucking hacky,
whatever.
But,
um,

1146
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.371
I dunno,
I,

1147
01:12:01.371 --> 01:12:06.270
I think there's a reason why when you watch the office and you watch Saturday

1148
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:11.130
night live and you watch all these shows and so many people are coming from,
uh,

1149
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.990
you know,
second city and UCB.
I mean,
I actually went to the Groundlings show,

1150
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.550
this guy's buddy of mine now,

1151
01:12:17.551 --> 01:12:20.490
she was doing a show down there and I went and I saw it and it was fucking
great.

1152
01:12:20.491 --> 01:12:21.840
And when I noticed when I was watching,

1153
01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:24.240
it was literally everything that they were doing.

1154
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:26.850
If you tried to do it in stand up,
you would,

1155
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:30.180
you just get raked over the coals by the comedians.
They had props,

1156
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.600
they were singing songs.
Uh,
what else?

1157
01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:36.180
What else can you not do as a comedian,
um,

1158
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:39.900
without getting beaten with a fucking mic stand?
Um,
you know,

1159
01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:43.440
they were up there with other people,
you know,

1160
01:12:43.441 --> 01:12:45.930
they would dress it up just fucking all this type of shit.

1161
01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:48.570
But it was fucking hilarious.
And I remember when I went down that night,

1162
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:51.060
I was watching the show at the Groundlings and it was hilarious.

1163
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.000
And then I went to the comedy store,
but it was,
and it was also hilarious,

1164
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:59.040
but I kind of understood why like when you watch an Improv show,

1165
01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.420
especially if they're doing like sketches,
it's like watching a live TV show.

1166
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:07.670
So you don't really have to think,
there's no thought like,
oh,

1167
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.760
can I see this person on TV?
You feel in a way like you're watching a TV show.

1168
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.330
Whereas if you watch a comedian,
you know,

1169
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:18.600
what's your more hearing is like a immunologist in Sony,

1170
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:21.510
like spewing out their thoughts,
which is also fucking hilarious.

1171
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:26.510
But I can see why they always approach comedians now to host reality shows or to

1172
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:32.490
uh,
I dunno,
whatever,
all the other shit that they fucking have us go out for.

1173
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:36.000
And I think that we can act because they can't really see us doing it.

1174
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:40.380
So anyways,
um,
you know,

1175
01:13:40.381 --> 01:13:43.110
I guess what I'm trying to say is come out here and do standup but don't be,

1176
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.150
I would definitely take acting classes,

1177
01:13:45.151 --> 01:13:49.320
take those improv classes because it's only going to help you in the long run in

1178
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:53.910
uh,
you know those improv classes.
I think it's kind of like open mics.

1179
01:13:53.911 --> 01:13:56.910
You need to go to an open mic cause you need a safe place where you can just

1180
01:13:56.911 --> 01:14:01.080
bomb and soc and learn to get good.
Um,

1181
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.070
and I feel that you should do the same thing with acting.

1182
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:09.690
You should go to acting class and just fucking bomb and just do a bunch of shit

1183
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.740
that you never do if he just went on,
you know,

1184
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:17.020
if you're booked a guest star on a show or if you booked a part in a movie

1185
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:20.110
because you'd be like,
Oh fuck,
I don't know if this is going to fly.

1186
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:25.410
And that's not really the place to see if something's going to bomb is when you,

1187
01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:25.731
you,

1188
01:14:25.731 --> 01:14:30.731
you book a big Gig and people still don't know who the fuck you are and you make

1189
01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:35.980
some big fucking choice.
So,
um,
I dunno,

1190
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.810
I like all the clubs out here as far as the standup clubs,
but um,

1191
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.100
I would definitely,
if I was you,

1192
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:45.040
that that would be the biggest thing I can tell you is definitely do shit like

1193
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:48.250
that.
So,
uh,
it'll help you with your auditions.

1194
01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:52.210
It's something I wish I did back in the day.
And uh,

1195
01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:55.960
I don't believe in that everything happens for a fucking reason.
I believe.
No,

1196
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:59.830
I made a mistake and that is one of the mistakes I made in my career is I did

1197
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:04.000
not focus on that shit.
All right.
That was a little sad.
Okay,

1198
01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:07.840
let's move on here.
Um,
oh,
here's one that's for your little self checkouts story.

1199
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.420
Um,
if you're new to my podcast,

1200
01:15:10.421 --> 01:15:15.220
I am 100% against those self checkouts in a grocery stores.

1201
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:20.170
I am not 100% against automation.
I have no automated machines.

1202
01:15:20.171 --> 01:15:25.171
I have no problem with the ones that the bank where I have 24 hour access to my

1203
01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:30.910
money and just for the simple fact is it takes me two seconds to get my money.

1204
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.480
I stick a card in,
I punch in my password,
I say withdrawal.

1205
01:15:34.481 --> 01:15:38.560
They say how much I say this much and I have my money as opposed to self

1206
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:42.880
checkout where I have to become a fucking cashier in a bag boy and I have to

1207
01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:45.250
scan a week's worth of fucking groceries.

1208
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.430
And if something doesn't have the right bar code,
I have to do what?

1209
01:15:48.431 --> 01:15:50.710
Get a price check.
I don't know.
Fucking won.

1210
01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.550
And that's after I stand behind a plumber who's doing the same fucking thing.

1211
01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:59.950
And considering it isn't any quicker,
where an ATM at a bank is quicker,

1212
01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.820
it makes an or automated things at the,

1213
01:16:02.821 --> 01:16:06.040
at the airport has made checking in for a flight quicker.

1214
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:09.700
So I want you fucking nerds out there who keep thinking that I'm just against

1215
01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:13.050
tech advancements in technology.
I'm not,
I am.

1216
01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.690
I am against the ones that is not,
they're not an advancement.

1217
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:21.850
It's only an advancement for the fucking big goddamn store.

1218
01:16:21.851 --> 01:16:23.050
All they've done is just,
you know,

1219
01:16:23.051 --> 01:16:26.230
enabled me to do somebody else's job for fucking free.

1220
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:30.130
And it takes the exact same amount of time,
if not fucking more.
Okay.

1221
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:33.610
If you could come up away for me to scan my fucking groceries in,

1222
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:37.330
it actually was quicker and they magically were bagged.

1223
01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.090
I wouldn't be doing this shit.
So anyways,
here we go.
This guy says,

1224
01:16:40.091 --> 01:16:43.900
so it's 11:00 PM and my fiance is dying for some ice cream.

1225
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.710
Everything's closed out there by the time.
Uh,

1226
01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.600
we get outside the bars and a couple of major,
um,

1227
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:52.600
only a couple of major supermarket chains were open.

1228
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.140
So we hit our local Kroger supermarket,
which is open 24 hours.

1229
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:59.170
We grab a pint of ice cream and walked to the register thinking there should be

1230
01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:03.310
quick boy,
oh boy were we wrong?
We couldn't believe what we were seeing.

1231
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:06.430
This store had maybe 15 lanes and not one was open.

1232
01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:11.610
All we had were four of the do it lanes open and one person overseeing those.

1233
01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:12.741
Um,

1234
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:16.370
this would be fine if the four people who are using these registers didn't all

1235
01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:19.040
have $150 worth of groceries in their cart.

1236
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.790
Plus they were four or five people waiting in front of us as well.

1237
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:25.550
I don't know if you've noticed,
but this is what p uh,

1238
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.250
but I don't know if you've noticed this,
notice this,

1239
01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:30.020
but when people scan their own item,

1240
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.790
it takes approximately twice as long than if an employee is doing it.

1241
01:17:34.791 --> 01:17:36.800
Thank you.
That's what the fuck I was saying.

1242
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:40.970
Plus one of the poor people's scanning their groceries was an elderly,

1243
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:44.450
elderly man and one of those drivable carts.

1244
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:48.110
This man could barely move yet he was forced to scan his own shit.

1245
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.120
And then when he,
uh,
had to pay,

1246
01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:54.620
he couldn't really reach the slot where you put your cash in or slide your

1247
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:58.310
credit card and you could tell he had a very hard time reading the screen from

1248
01:17:58.311 --> 01:18:01.610
that far away.
So we finally make our way out of self checkout.

1249
01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:06.230
We scan our one item and of course the computer doesn't register that we placed

1250
01:18:06.231 --> 01:18:10.130
the ice cream on the bagging area and keeps telling us to remove the last item

1251
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.840
and rescan it.
And after that comes up a few times,
I tell,
uh,

1252
01:18:14.841 --> 01:18:18.860
it tells us that the employee has been notified and to please wait.

1253
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:23.090
So we look at that one employee sitting there whose only job is to watch a bunch

1254
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:26.690
of suckers do her job and for her,
uh,

1255
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:31.040
and what is she doing playing with their fucking iPhone.
We get our,

1256
01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.360
we get our attention,
pay and get the fuck out of there.
And to top it all off,

1257
01:18:35.361 --> 01:18:38.840
since it's July,
by the time my fiance opened up or Ben and Jerry's was,

1258
01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:43.310
she had to wait a half hour for it was all watery,
you know,

1259
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:46.280
just how she likes it.
Uh,
anyways.
Um,

1260
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.880
yeah,
see,
I mean,
I dunno,
I've talked about this shit till I'm blue in my face.

1261
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:56.660
I don't understand people who think that big time corporations come up with new

1262
01:18:56.661 --> 01:19:01.280
technologies to try and help the customer save money.
Um,

1263
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:05.390
if you want to know how our corporations mentality works,
I can recommend a good,

1264
01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:06.680
um,

1265
01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.240
documentary I saw literally called the corporation and it's a great one because

1266
01:19:11.241 --> 01:19:15.830
it isn't like this Michael Moore totally slamming,
you know,

1267
01:19:15.831 --> 01:19:17.630
everybody in corporations are evil.

1268
01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:20.810
It actually just showed how people incorporations are kind of regular people,

1269
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.610
but just the,
uh,

1270
01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:28.400
business model in the momentum and the direction that it goes in and how they

1271
01:19:28.401 --> 01:19:32.330
always have to show a fucking profit no matter what leads to them doing

1272
01:19:32.331 --> 01:19:37.040
literally psychotic shit.
Um,
anyways,
um,

1273
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:40.780
oh,
here's another thing he says.
Get.
Um,
also,

1274
01:19:40.781 --> 01:19:44.500
did you see the alleged swimming pool racism thing going on in Philly?

1275
01:19:44.501 --> 01:19:48.130
Looks like the wrong person watched your last HBO special.
Yeah,

1276
01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:51.330
I got a lot of emails about that.
Um,

1277
01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:56.290
I guess that happened the whole get out of the pool thing.
You know,

1278
01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.230
I think what I was trying to say in that bit was kind of lost.

1279
01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:03.700
What I was saying was that white people are evil,

1280
01:20:03.701 --> 01:20:06.170
has been documented.
You know,

1281
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:11.100
they started with major subjects like slavery and uh,

1282
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:13.560
they just kept making the movie over and over again.

1283
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:17.400
They had to come up with new subjects to the point it got all the way down to

1284
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:21.060
swimming,
which to me was kind of fucking nitpicking.

1285
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.980
But I actually saw somebody sent me a clip of that,
that story on,

1286
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:27.570
uh,
on the Internet.

1287
01:20:27.571 --> 01:20:32.070
And it was a classic news story where they just show one side of the new story.

1288
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.060
All they showed where the people complaining they didn't show the other side.

1289
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:39.120
And then everyone just has those other people convicted.
Now,

1290
01:20:39.121 --> 01:20:43.080
I'm not saying that they,
they fucking didn't do something wrong,

1291
01:20:43.081 --> 01:20:46.530
but you got to hear the other side first.
You know,

1292
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:49.170
you got to see what the deal was.

1293
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:53.370
Were they decent kids and they went there and they really got judged or was it a

1294
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:54.990
group of fucking asshole kids?

1295
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.380
And then they got booted out and then they just played the race card.

1296
01:20:58.381 --> 01:21:02.460
You don't know until you've seen it,
but I can,
I can tell you this.

1297
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:07.461
I don't think it's a smart thing in general to,

1298
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:12.360
uh,
you know,
city kids versus suburban kids.
It's it,
that's never a good thing.

1299
01:21:12.361 --> 01:21:16.710
When you grow up in the city,
no matter what color you are,
you age in dog years,

1300
01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:18.203
you know,

1301
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:22.290
when I was out in the suburbs playing with the fucking stick in a mud puddle,

1302
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:26.410
the white version of me on the inner city was learning how to fucking,
I dunno,

1303
01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:30.240
take ecstasy.
You know,
I mean,
this straight across the board,

1304
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:33.330
Paris Hilton probably went to her first orgy when she was like 11.

1305
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:38.570
You know what I mean?
I dunno,
Ain't no,
and I don't get mushy.

1306
01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:42.480
And she's like the king of all whores and I don't give a shit how you take her

1307
01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:46.800
out of the city and sticker in a nice fucking park.
She still a psycho whore.

1308
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.150
Right.
So just being devil's advocate here,
you know,

1309
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:51.961
that being said,

1310
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:54.270
you really shouldn't have a problem with anybody getting in a fucking pool

1311
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.290
unless they're trying to drown your child.
Um,

1312
01:21:58.291 --> 01:22:02.010
I hope that made sense.
I hope that didn't come off like an in a Fox News Way.

1313
01:22:02.011 --> 01:22:05.280
I didn't mean it that way.
Okay.
But I do fucking exist.

1314
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.590
I Dunno.

1315
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:11.700
In my own fucking reality sometimes in my shit doesn't come across the right
way.

1316
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:16.650
So whatever.
Anyways,
you guys can ask me questions.
What I meant by that.
Um,

1317
01:22:16.651 --> 01:22:21.000
anyways,
uh,
dating services,
uh,
Bill,
what is your opinion on dating sites?

1318
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:26.460
I personally think it's a bunch of shit.
They advertised about how much,
uh,

1319
01:22:26.461 --> 01:22:30.810
they match people perfectly and show these happy couples who supposedly have

1320
01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:35.070
everything in common.
Um,
what if you don't want to be in this?

1321
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:38.250
What if you don't want to be the same?

1322
01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:41.010
What if you want to be happy with someone who is dramatically different.

1323
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:45.160
Those things are for people who have given up all those dating services or

1324
01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:49.140
people who have completely given up in life to the point that they have no human

1325
01:22:49.141 --> 01:22:49.771
contact.

1326
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:54.540
So they have to sit in front of their computer by themselves to try and get
some,

1327
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:59.670
wow,
that's a little harsh.
Um,
what do I think about them?
Um,

1328
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:02.730
it depends on when I see him.

1329
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:07.030
Sometimes I see the commercial and I think they're funny when I'm going through

1330
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:08.650
a rough period in my relationship,

1331
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:12.280
I'm jealous of the people I see on TV because they seem so happy and they're

1332
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:15.760
playing that little zippy piano tune in the background,
you know,

1333
01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:17.670
that e harmony and that girl goes,
yeah,

1334
01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:21.920
<v 9>wow,
this good day.</v>

1335
01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:22.610
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1336
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:27.020
Now the last did love and there's like two people in argyle sweaters crawling

1337
01:23:27.021 --> 01:23:31.670
all over each other.
Yeah.
Like it gets fucking annoying.
I'm so,
you know,

1338
01:23:31.671 --> 01:23:35.460
I actually did,
I went to a a,
I went to a dating site and I,

1339
01:23:35.461 --> 01:23:38.650
I'm actually going to check this fucking thing out here and um,
it,

1340
01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:41.060
it goes from creepy.

1341
01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:43.821
I Dunno.

1342
01:23:43.821 --> 01:23:47.750
The window here seems creepy and nerdy and then there's just one guy on here.

1343
01:23:47.751 --> 01:23:51.290
You can tell he's just trying to pull some ass off for this.
All right,
here.

1344
01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.650
One guy starts with my darling.
I wish to be near you.

1345
01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:56.853
All right.

1346
01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.890
This guy's a psycho and he's got the classic sitting there with his fucking hand

1347
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:02.570
underneath his chin.

1348
01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:07.460
I simply wish to be happy together with favorite.dot dot.

1349
01:24:07.461 --> 01:24:12.461
I hope that I meet you here and we can be happy and to be one family.

1350
01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:18.290
I wait for your letter and then we can learn more each other.
Okay.

1351
01:24:18.291 --> 01:24:21.980
This is definitely a second language.
This fucking Pussy Hound.

1352
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.530
He's banged everything in his country and now he's coming over here with his

1353
01:24:24.531 --> 01:24:28.520
broken English going into a dating site.
I respect that guy.
All right.

1354
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:33.110
Here's another one.
Seeing if Mr right exists.
All right.
First of all,

1355
01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:36.410
this girls smile.
Is she smiling like Erik Estrada?
You know,

1356
01:24:36.411 --> 01:24:38.960
when you know exactly how many teeth or person has in their mouth,

1357
01:24:39.650 --> 01:24:42.380
he shouldn't see somebody molars when they smile.
Anybody else?

1358
01:24:42.381 --> 01:24:47.000
Anybody else with that?
You should see basically teeth six to 11,
right?

1359
01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:50.210
Six seven eight nine 10 11.
Yeah.
That's canine to canine.

1360
01:24:50.211 --> 01:24:54.740
For those of you who've never been to a dental office.
Um,
anyways,

1361
01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:59.120
this lady says,
uh,
I'm a fun,
outgoing girl who likes to try new things.

1362
01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.770
I'm loyal,
trustworthy,
friendly and caring.
I like to go out and meet new people.

1363
01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.610
I like to hang out at the beach and travel to places that I've never been to

1364
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:10.400
really,
really?

1365
01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:15.560
Yeah mean these,
these,
these descriptions is,
are ridiculous.

1366
01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.670
I like all of those things,
but I'm also prone to fucking road rage.

1367
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.480
I accidentally punched my dog in the face the other day.
Did I tell you that?

1368
01:25:23.481 --> 01:25:24.440
This is actually true.

1369
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:28.580
I was rolling around with Cleo right up fucking wrestling with her,
right?

1370
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:32.710
Having a great time.
And she's,
she has a tongue,
like a fucking paintbrush.

1371
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:35.690
She licks you twice and you have to take a shower,
you know,

1372
01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.170
so she gets all excited and she wants to start licking my face.

1373
01:25:39.171 --> 01:25:40.180
So I kind of stuck my,

1374
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:45.210
my neck out to keep my head away from her and she brought her fucking rock hard

1375
01:25:45.231 --> 01:25:48.850
head up and hit me right in the throat.
I mean,
almost killed.

1376
01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:53.210
One was crushed my voicebox right.
I was,
and I was like,
Jesus,
crisis dog.

1377
01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:57.410
I'll say,
my God,
this do you believe are hardest fucking dogs head is.
She goes,

1378
01:25:57.411 --> 01:25:58.950
oh yeah.
She goes like,
nothing affects.

1379
01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:01.190
So you could literally punched her right in the face and it wouldn't even bug

1380
01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.570
her.
And I was like,
Oh yeah.

1381
01:26:02.571 --> 01:26:06.290
And I was trying be funny and I just sort of threw a jab and I tried to pull the

1382
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:09.020
punch,
but she moved her face right into it.

1383
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.800
I punched her right in the face just like this,
this hard.

1384
01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:18.350
You hear that just like that.
And she didn't even flinch,

1385
01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.180
cheat,
even shake it off.

1386
01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:24.290
She just continued licking my fist and I felt horrible.

1387
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:28.970
Yeah.
I'm telling my story and I punched the dog in the face.
That was brutal,

1388
01:26:28.971 --> 01:26:33.590
right?
It was an accident.
I said it was horrible.

1389
01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:34.873
All right,

1390
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.110
let's read a couple more of these geeky Filipino girl looking for a sweet guy

1391
01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.990
who spend time with Si there.
There's,
that's,

1392
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:44.600
if I was going to go on one of these sites,

1393
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:47.630
I would more gravitate towards someone who actually kind of had a sense of humor

1394
01:26:47.631 --> 01:26:52.631
about themselves as opposed to someone who writes on this journey called life.

1395
01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:57.410
I swear to God,
somebody wrote that.
I enjoy traveling and exploring new places,

1396
01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:02.330
so why not look online for someone to be able to share journeys together with,

1397
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:08.770
whether it's to a local museum or to exotic locales in distant countries?

1398
01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:13.250
Question Mark.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1399
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:17.840
He had every,
he had every hacky thing in there.
You know,

1400
01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:20.360
life being a journey,
going to a museum.

1401
01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:23.150
He had everything but talking about watching sunsets.
You know what?

1402
01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:28.010
Fuck that guy.
Um,
oh,

1403
01:27:28.011 --> 01:27:30.710
here's one guy,
the guy with little five o'clock shadow.
It's nice out.

1404
01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:34.910
We should do something.
Hi,
I'm Daniel.
I like being outdoors,
traveling,

1405
01:27:34.911 --> 01:27:36.800
photography and learning new things.

1406
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:40.160
A mellow and can be somewhat shy when meeting new people,

1407
01:27:40.161 --> 01:27:44.150
but I open up pretty quickly with the right person.
In other words,

1408
01:27:44.151 --> 01:27:47.220
he's going to be a sweetheart until you get them alone in your fucking
apartment.

1409
01:27:47.221 --> 01:27:51.710
He's going to tear your clothes off.
Who is this person?

1410
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:57.440
Um,
all right.
And search of for a hand to hold me psycho.

1411
01:27:58.310 --> 01:28:01.850
Everything happens for a reason.
Good and bad.
Okay.
That guy's depressed.

1412
01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.490
I love and enjoy my life in La.

1413
01:28:04.491 --> 01:28:09.410
I am looking for a partner who can be my best friend and share things together.

1414
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.310
She looks creepy.
Uh Oh.

1415
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:17.420
Here's one girl looking for a guy who's going to show her a good time and

1416
01:28:17.421 --> 01:28:20.630
appreciate her.
All right,
her dad didn't stick around.

1417
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:23.270
She'll blow you easily within the first three hours.

1418
01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:27.970
I'm looking for a genuine guy.
The best way to describe myself is,

1419
01:28:27.971 --> 01:28:32.180
is easy going individual on genuine,
down to earth.

1420
01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:34.520
You know these fucking people,
they're all full of themselves.

1421
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:38.990
Here's a guy just looking for fucking ass right here.
We stand here in a Tuxedo.

1422
01:28:38.991 --> 01:28:40.280
Work hard,
play hard.

1423
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:45.260
I am new to the South Bay and I have only lived in California for nine months.

1424
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:48.410
I know when you're looking for some ass to tag.
Here's the last one.

1425
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.980
Beauty isn't only physical,
but in

1426
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:58.310
Inter beauty plays a major factor.
All right.
That means she's a fat chick.

1427
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:03.390
That's me.
But it's fucking true.
She is fat.
Um,
all right,
let's plow ahead.

1428
01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.040
Um,
what,
what is,
what's my feeling on those?
I Dunno.
I Dunno what I'm feeling is,

1429
01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:11.760
uh,
I would feel like a loser if I went on one of those.
Um,

1430
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:13.110
but I think the older you get,

1431
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:17.490
the less you would feel like a loser unless you're just doing it just to get

1432
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:21.450
more pussy than I kind of respect it,
you know?
All right.
There you go.

1433
01:29:21.451 --> 01:29:22.620
Was that ignorant enough for you?

1434
01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.610
Is that the usual level of ignorance that you expect on this podcast?
All right.

1435
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:27.780
Sports Bill,

1436
01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:32.580
you talk a lot about sports and your podcasts and I enjoy your passion.
Um,

1437
01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:36.120
but for life,
I'm,
I'm from Australia,
but for the life of me,
I,
for the life of me,

1438
01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:40.110
I can't understand the appeal of American football.
When I was living in Seattle,

1439
01:29:40.111 --> 01:29:44.600
I went to a few Seahawks game and I found the game tedious as it stops starting

1440
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:46.020
nature totally put me off.

1441
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:50.190
Do you think you need to grow up with the sport to enjoy it?
Um,

1442
01:29:50.191 --> 01:29:53.340
I mean I enjoy watching hockey and the occasional baseball game by just can't

1443
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:54.570
get into American football.

1444
01:29:54.571 --> 01:29:57.090
I usually watch Australian rules football during the winter.

1445
01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:02.490
The best way to describe it as a contact version of soccer and basketball.
Um,

1446
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.700
yeah,
I think you need to grow up with it.
I gotta be honest with you.

1447
01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:09.690
I went through a good five year period where I found NFL football mind numbingly

1448
01:30:09.691 --> 01:30:14.400
boring for the same reasons you're saying.
I just,
it just stop,
start,
stop,

1449
01:30:14.401 --> 01:30:19.140
start.
Um,
I don't know.
I think,
I dunno.
I have add,
man.
I like hockey.

1450
01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:21.330
It just keeps going.
It just,
it doesn't stop.

1451
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:26.960
There's not 58 fucking timeouts like basketball where the last four minutes

1452
01:30:27.901 --> 01:30:32.400
takes two hours to play.
Um,
yeah,
I can see that.

1453
01:30:32.401 --> 01:30:37.080
I can see,
um,
cause like I,
I wasn't really into soccer.
I watched American soccer,

1454
01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:41.700
which is horrible because the crowd doesn't really give a shit or are the way

1455
01:30:41.701 --> 01:30:45.150
they broadcast it is just,
it's just not presented well.

1456
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.510
But when I watched like the premier league or something like that,
you know,

1457
01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:53.150
overseas stuff and everybody's singing songs and got their scarves on and going

1458
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:57.510
fucking bananas,
I actually can get into it,
you know?

1459
01:30:57.511 --> 01:31:01.770
And I liked that when there's 90 minutes it takes about 90 minutes other than

1460
01:31:01.771 --> 01:31:03.870
the,
the extra time for whatever penalties.

1461
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:08.490
But the one thing I don't like about soccer is anytime anybody gets barely

1462
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:12.480
nicked in the Shin,
they fucking collapsed down to the ground.

1463
01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:15.090
Like they got hit by a truck.
It's like,

1464
01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:18.570
it's like the whole field is a bunch of pile Gus salts.

1465
01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.510
That's what I can't stand about soccer.
And it's like,
dude,

1466
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:22.920
you have on Shin Guards.

1467
01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.180
So I want to know for you a anybody from around the world when you play soccer,

1468
01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.070
does it really hurt that much?

1469
01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:32.790
I'm not talking if somebody has got spikes on and they step on your ankle,

1470
01:31:32.791 --> 01:31:33.960
I understand that that's going to hurt.

1471
01:31:33.961 --> 01:31:37.320
But when they kick you in the Shin and you're wearing shin guards,

1472
01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:41.480
do you really have to roll around on the floor like that?
Huh?

1473
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:46.110
Like the fucking pussy that you are?
Um,
oh,
somebody sent me a funny email going,

1474
01:31:46.111 --> 01:31:47.090
hey bill,
great.
Uh,

1475
01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:52.190
point about nobody good looking being in England ever coming from England and

1476
01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:56.310
they said signed,
uh,
whatever that soccer player's name is.

1477
01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:59.890
Who came over here that no one gives a shit about.
And uh,

1478
01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:03.380
oh,
one who,
who's,
who's,

1479
01:32:03.381 --> 01:32:05.970
who's that Horry looking girl that went out with that guy?

1480
01:32:05.971 --> 01:32:09.410
I got the fucking prostitute.
Hugh grant.
What the hell was that name?

1481
01:32:10.130 --> 01:32:14.750
Was that Linda Lavin?
I never can remember the names.
Lisa Lohan.

1482
01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.410
Lisa Kudrow loose.
Lisa Hurley.
Kelly Hurley.

1483
01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:26.630
Liz Hurley.
There we go.
Thank you.
From the other room.
Look,
India,

1484
01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:29.480
she's actually helped me out this week.
Is this from a dating site.

1485
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.540
<v 1>Oh,

1486
01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:44.070
<v 8>All right,
this,
this basically this guy looks like a 58 year old pediatrician,</v>

1487
01:32:48.090 --> 01:32:52.380
um,
you know,
bald,
white dude with a coffee stain teeth,

1488
01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:56.820
a big psychotic fucking grin.
And he's looking for a smart,

1489
01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:58.680
sexy spiritual goddess,

1490
01:32:58.681 --> 01:33:03.400
desired for awesome relationship with extraordinary man.
Uh,

1491
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:05.940
how insecure as this guy isn't.

1492
01:33:05.941 --> 01:33:09.210
One of these guys would probably fucking has to sail boat around the world to

1493
01:33:09.211 --> 01:33:13.560
prove something to himself.
You know,
I did,
man,

1494
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:18.300
I found out about myself when I was out there jerking off in the middle of the

1495
01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.540
Indian Ocean.
Um,
anyways,
so uh,
one gentleman,

1496
01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.020
his quest to find his goddess.
Are you capital letters?

1497
01:33:25.021 --> 01:33:29.820
A woman who has most of the extensive goddess qualifications,

1498
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:33.630
at least he's being realistic.
As long as you got most,

This is,

1526
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:29.720
this marks my triumphant return to the stand up stage after,

So I did a quick set the other night at the comedy store and I got to tell you,

1530
01:35:45.111 --> 01:35:49.340
I,
I immediately,
the second I went in there,
I felt like I was at home.
You know,

1531
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:53.840
I can't explain it.
I hope you guys have that when you walk into your job.

1532
01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:55.950
Cause it's a great fucking feeling,
you know,
rather than,

1533
01:35:55.951 --> 01:35:59.600
than go in there and just being like,
oh my God,
when is this going to be over?

1534
01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:04.430
Not saying that never happens,
but,
um,
yeah,
I'm psyched to,
to,

1535
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.760
to,
uh,
to be back out there.
And I'm,
like I said,
I'm going to be doing,
uh,

1536
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:11.840
a standup special at the end of this year.
So I'm going to try to,

1537
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:16.280
I'm going to try to do some clean living here.
Plenty of water,
eight hours sleep.

1538
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:20.030
No.
Who was no booze,
no nothing.

1539
01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:24.260
Watching telly,
nothing.
Um,

1540
01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:27.650
so see I just did a quote from a movie anyways.
Um,

1541
01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:30.230
let's do a couple of overrated,
underrated and then that's going to be,

1542
01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:31.010
that's going to be it.

1543
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:33.950
I'm also going to be at the comedy works in Denver this week.
Uh,

1544
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:36.320
I mean this month,
July 23rd,

1545
01:36:36.321 --> 01:36:39.290
24th and 25th and young Jo de Rosa.

1546
01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.030
We'll be doing a number of my fall dates as I get geared up from my,

1547
01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:49.730
uh,
my,
my next special,
which I hope I will make special.
You know,

1548
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.500
I hope it's not just going to be yet another special yet another guy with his

1549
01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:59.300
wacky take on life.
You know,
here's some for you guys.

1550
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:04.160
Like I really can't stand like the weird level of respect and disrespect that

1551
01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.433
standup comedy gets.

1552
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.870
Like when you meet people and you tell them you're a comedian,
they always say,

1553
01:37:08.871 --> 01:37:12.440
oh my God,
I have so much admiration.

1554
01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:17.270
I would never have the nerve to do that.
Right.
They always say that shit.
Okay.

1555
01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:21.440
But then whenever they write about stand up or whenever they do what they,

1556
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:24.170
they're doing a caricature of a standup.

1557
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:29.510
It's always the most horrific,
obnoxious like tables.

1558
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:33.920
What's up with that?
You know,
they still like,

1559
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:38.630
I think stand up comedy is still suffering from the and the tail end of the

1560
01:37:38.631 --> 01:37:42.740
eighties.
Boom.
As far as people's idea of what it is.

1561
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.810
Because for the life of me,

1562
01:37:44.811 --> 01:37:48.170
every time I read a fucking article about standup comedy,

1563
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:52.760
they always say this like recently I saw this article on Glenn Beck.

1564
01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:57.020
He's one of these,
uh,
well I don't know what you would call them.

1565
01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:01.190
They are like a celebrity journalists,

1566
01:38:02.150 --> 01:38:06.900
I don't know.
Personality.
They like celebrity personalities.
They're kind of like,

1567
01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:09.630
who's that girl?
Waba Waba Waba go by.

1568
01:38:09.631 --> 01:38:14.631
And God blessed though that if like downtown Judy Brown did the fucking news

1569
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:18.870
that that's what these guys are like,
that they're sort sorta,
I don't know.

1570
01:38:18.871 --> 01:38:20.610
I can't explain what the fuck they are.
You know,

1571
01:38:20.611 --> 01:38:23.550
they should be opening Hooters around the country.
Right.
So this guy,

1572
01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:26.430
basically Glenn Beck is going out and he's doing stand up.

1573
01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.630
So somebody asks him going,
Oh,
you're going to go out and go do stand up?

1574
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:33.540
And he goes,
well he,
I mean,
I'm not going to be on stage going,

1575
01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:37.110
what's the deal with airline food at a local Yuk?

1576
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:41.910
Yuks I'm actually going to be going out telling stories that at the end we'll

1577
01:38:41.911 --> 01:38:45.270
have a funny punchline,
you know,
something unique.

1578
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:49.590
Something do something different.
Just like everything I did I do or whatever.

1579
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.780
It's like,
Oh yeah,
I wish bill Cosby,
you know,

1580
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.450
at some point in his career decided to tell a fucking story.

1581
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:58.750
That was funny in the end,
you know,
uh,

1582
01:38:58.770 --> 01:39:03.060
she's fucking drives me nuts and what that fucking my whole career,

1583
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:05.640
nobody has done jokes.
I've been doing it 17 years.

1584
01:39:05.641 --> 01:39:09.510
Nobody has done jokes about airline food.
Nobody yet,

1585
01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:14.610
it is still defined by all those fucking guys dressed in their Miami vice sport

1586
01:39:15.151 --> 01:39:19.950
coats with the fucking sleeves pulled up that did jokes after joke after joke

1587
01:39:19.951 --> 01:39:23.940
about going to the dentist and about airline fucking food and safety.

1588
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:28.890
I mean,
you're going on 20 years ago.
I mean,
if you want to make fun of stand up,

1589
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.950
I understand because there's nothing worse than a bad comedian,

1590
01:39:31.951 --> 01:39:36.060
but at least updated,
you know,
say some shit like,
you know,

1591
01:39:36.061 --> 01:39:37.200
I'm not going to be up there,
you know,

1592
01:39:37.201 --> 01:39:42.201
doing tired material about Monica Lewinsky or even George Bushes and his fucking

1593
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:46.280
old at this point,
you know.
But Geez,
enough with the fucking airline from,

1594
01:39:46.281 --> 01:39:47.114
nobody's doing,

1595
01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:50.550
I saw one time they were doing a story on some alternative comics and I don't

1596
01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:51.331
know if you've noticed this,

1597
01:39:51.331 --> 01:39:53.490
but whenever they do a story about alternative comedy,

1598
01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.050
they somehow have to trash mainstream comics.
I don't know why,
but they do.

1599
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:00.540
And they're like,
yeah,
this is alternative comedy.

1600
01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:05.430
This isn't some guy in a mainstream club working out five minutes of material

1601
01:40:05.431 --> 01:40:08.100
about airline,
about,
you know,

1602
01:40:08.101 --> 01:40:10.710
flying on an airline for his next Letterman audition.

1603
01:40:10.711 --> 01:40:14.490
Someone actually wrote that.
All right.

1604
01:40:14.491 --> 01:40:16.620
People don't talk about airline.
Okay,
we don't,
okay.

1605
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:18.840
We still compare men to women,
but you know,

1606
01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:21.330
I'm just saying if you're going to fucking trash us,

1607
01:40:22.670 --> 01:40:26.720
you just have the decency to,
to,
to do a little bit of research,
you know.
Ah,

1608
01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:30.510
I would love to go see Glen Beck and just start fucking heckling him,
you know.

1609
01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.350
Anyways.
Alright.
Uh,
overrated,
underrated.
Hey,
a bill.
Um,

1610
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:37.830
here's my overrated for this week.
Rachel Ray,

1611
01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:41.070
she started out with their show on the food network called 30 minute meals,

1612
01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:41.791
which was fine.

1613
01:40:41.791 --> 01:40:45.780
She made tasty family meals that were easy and fast and she sort of put forth a

1614
01:40:45.781 --> 01:40:48.720
homey vibe.
Then she got another show and then another.

1615
01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:51.090
Now she has four shows on the food network,

1616
01:40:51.091 --> 01:40:55.510
half of which are just her eating food and different countries saying Jamo and

1617
01:40:55.511 --> 01:40:57.580
why the fuck does she have her own talk show?

1618
01:40:57.790 --> 01:41:00.730
She is far from Oprah or even Tyra.

1619
01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.840
I'm sick of her acting like she's normal that she can relate to everyone.

1620
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:06.220
Fuck you Rachel.

1621
01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:13.060
I don't think I have to add to that.
You really can't stand her.
Um,

1622
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:20.060
I dunno if I was you,
I'd stop watching the fucking food network.
A watch.

1623
01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:24.040
Ah,
Mario Batali,
you know,
if you can get over his orange clogs.

1624
01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:28.750
He really cooks a lot of great food.
I'm overrated.
The fucking Jonas brothers.

1625
01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:33.580
How the hell are these no talent?
Douchebags famous while they're adorable,

1626
01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:39.070
they can play their own instruments and they are squeaky clean with their

1627
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:42.160
virginal genitalia.
Anyways,
he goes,

1628
01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:47.020
I help all three of these faggots get car bombed.
Jesus Christ,
Dude.

1629
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:52.900
Um,
next,
uh,
overrated.
Those men are evil movies on lifetime.

1630
01:41:52.901 --> 01:41:56.110
I don't have to name them.
And other words,
you've never watched them,

1631
01:41:56.650 --> 01:41:58.090
but you know,
they suck.
I'm agreeing with you.

1632
01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.860
Hear those shitty movies make me want to fire bomb the set of the view like it's

1633
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:07.480
Dresden.
What does that have to do with anything?

1634
01:42:07.481 --> 01:42:09.710
It says the peanut gallery where I'll tell you what it has to do a,

1635
01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:13.600
the view was a bunch of broads running the yaps who don't know what the fuck

1636
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.730
they're talking about.
That's what he's trying to say there.

1637
01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.900
Because what does that have to do with lifetime?

1638
01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:21.730
Because see what I did right there.

1639
01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:26.020
That is an old stand up a skill that a lot of times the crowd can hear what the

1640
01:42:26.021 --> 01:42:28.630
person heckling you said.
So what you do as you repeat what they say,

1641
01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:30.580
what does that have to do with lifetime?

1642
01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.640
Cause they always have those fucking movies about guys throwing women into

1643
01:42:33.641 --> 01:42:34.570
fireplaces

1644
01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:41.050
cause the views a bunch of women sitting around a spewing out there.

1645
01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.630
Their thoughts.
Yeah,
their opinions.

1646
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.770
Yeah,
because it's a bunch of women.
It's really,
there's,

1647
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:54.250
there's not a lot of layers to this.
Nia is basically,
he doesn't like lifetime.

1648
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.300
Huh?
Don't use your real name.

1649
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:03.400
Well I told you I didn't want to put you in my top fucking 10

1650
01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:10.540
all right,
well I can always edit this out.
No,
I can't.
I don't know how to use,

1651
01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:13.000
I don't know how to use garageband.
Look,

1652
01:43:13.001 --> 01:43:15.250
if you don't want to be part of the podcast,
don't fucking chime in.

1653
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:19.600
Don't chime in.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
See you later.

1654
01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.400
All right.
Underrated.
Underrated.
Ak 47 [inaudible]

1655
01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:31.150
to most people.
I'm going to wrap it up.
My second AK 47 is to most people,

1656
01:43:31.151 --> 01:43:34.870
these are shitty guns,
the terrorist carry around and movies,
but they are,

1657
01:43:34.871 --> 01:43:36.370
this guy's a fucking maniac.

1658
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:40.420
He wants to kill the Jonas brothers and he's into AK 47.
[inaudible].
All right,

1659
01:43:40.421 --> 01:43:44.230
we're going to end on that.
All right.
Um,
hope you guys enjoy the podcast.

1660
01:43:44.231 --> 01:43:46.690
Please come out and support my shows and a,

1661
01:43:46.691 --> 01:43:49.540

1662
01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:50.470
please come out and see me.

1663
01:43:50.471 --> 01:43:53.750
I added some dates and I'm going to be adding some more dates,

1664
01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:58.310
especially come September,
October,
November when I really,
uh,

1665
01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:02.120
start buckling down so I don't suck.
All right.
You guys all have a good,
