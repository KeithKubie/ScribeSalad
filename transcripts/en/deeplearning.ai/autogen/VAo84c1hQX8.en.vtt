00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.880
 
one of the problems of object detection

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890
one of the problems of object detection
 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.919
one of the problems of object detection
as you've learned about it so far is

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929
as you've learned about it so far is
 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.889
as you've learned about it so far is
that your algorithm may find multiple

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
that your algorithm may find multiple
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.259
that your algorithm may find multiple
detections of the same object so rather

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
detections of the same object so rather
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.330
detections of the same object so rather
than detecting an object just once

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
than detecting an object just once
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.390
than detecting an object just once
it might detect it multiple times

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400
it might detect it multiple times
 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.310
it might detect it multiple times
non-mac suppression is a way for you to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
non-mac suppression is a way for you to
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.900
non-mac suppression is a way for you to
make sure that your algorithm detects

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
make sure that your algorithm detects
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.510
make sure that your algorithm detects
each object only once let's go through

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
each object only once let's go through
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670
each object only once let's go through
an example let's say you want to detect

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
an example let's say you want to detect
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.189
an example let's say you want to detect
pedestrians cars and motorcycles in this

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
pedestrians cars and motorcycles in this
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.550
pedestrians cars and motorcycles in this
image you might place a grid over this

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
image you might place a grid over this
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.950
image you might place a grid over this
and this is a 19 by 19 grid now while

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
and this is a 19 by 19 grid now while
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.840
and this is a 19 by 19 grid now while
technically this car has just one

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
technically this car has just one
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940
technically this car has just one
midpoint so it should be assigned just a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
midpoint so it should be assigned just a
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.880
midpoint so it should be assigned just a
one grid cell and the car on the Left

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
one grid cell and the car on the Left
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.280
one grid cell and the car on the Left
also has just one midpoint so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
also has just one midpoint so
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.279
also has just one midpoint so
technically only one of those fit cells

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
technically only one of those fit cells
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.619
technically only one of those fit cells
should predict that there is a car in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
should predict that there is a car in
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.200
should predict that there is a car in
practice you're running an object

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
practice you're running an object
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.420

disparate cell might think that the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
disparate cell might think that the
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760
disparate cell might think that the
center of a car is in it and so might

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
center of a car is in it and so might
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.219
center of a car is in it and so might
this and so like this and for the car on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
this and so like this and for the car on
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070

not only that boss might decide that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
not only that boss might decide that
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960
not only that boss might decide that
things has found the car maybe this box

things has found the car maybe this box
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.850
things has found the car maybe this box
and this box and maybe others as well

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
and this box and maybe others as well
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920
and this box and maybe others as well
will also think that they've found the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
will also think that they've found the
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.830
will also think that they've found the
car so let's step through an example of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
car so let's step through an example of
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.039

how non-mac suppression will work so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
how non-mac suppression will work so
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.920
how non-mac suppression will work so
because you're running the image

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
because you're running the image
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.859
because you're running the image

raise their hand and say my PC my chance
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800
raise their hand and say my PC my chance
of thinking I've been objects in it is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
of thinking I've been objects in it is
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.710
of thinking I've been objects in it is
large rather than just having two of the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
large rather than just having two of the
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.160
large rather than just having two of the
grid cells out of the 19 squared or 361

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
grid cells out of the 19 squared or 361
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980
grid cells out of the 19 squared or 361
think they've detected an object so when

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
think they've detected an object so when
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719
think they've detected an object so when
you run your algorithm you might end up

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
you run your algorithm you might end up
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.219
you run your algorithm you might end up
with multiple detections of each object

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229
with multiple detections of each object
 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.230
with multiple detections of each object
so what non max suppression does is it

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
so what non max suppression does is it
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.530
so what non max suppression does is it
cleans up these detection so that you

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
cleans up these detection so that you
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.499
cleans up these detection so that you
end up with just one detection per car

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
end up with just one detection per car
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.809
end up with just one detection per car
rather than multiple detections for a

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
rather than multiple detections for a
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.730
rather than multiple detections for a
car

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740

looks like the probability is associated

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610
looks like the probability is associated
 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.020
looks like the probability is associated
with each of these detections Canada pcs

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
with each of these detections Canada pcs
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.460
with each of these detections Canada pcs
although there are some details you

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
although there are some details you
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.900
although there are some details you
learn about in this week's prone

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910

exercise is actually PC times are c1 or

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
exercise is actually PC times are c1 or
 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.150
exercise is actually PC times are c1 or
c2 or c3 but for now let's just say is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
c2 or c3 but for now let's just say is
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.630
c2 or c3 but for now let's just say is
PC with the probability of detection and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
PC with the probability of detection and
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.570

this case is 0.9 and says that's my most
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.540
this case is 0.9 and says that's my most
confident detection so let's highlight

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
confident detection so let's highlight
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.320
confident detection so let's highlight
that I'm just say I found a car there

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330
that I'm just say I found a car there
 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
that I'm just say I found a car there
having done that the non-mac suppression

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
having done that the non-mac suppression
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.040
having done that the non-mac suppression
part then looks at all of the remaining

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050
part then looks at all of the remaining
 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.770
part then looks at all of the remaining
rectangles and all the ones with a high

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
rectangles and all the ones with a high
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.770

overlap with a high I owe you with this

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
overlap with a high I owe you with this
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.900
overlap with a high I owe you with this
one that you've just output will get

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
one that you've just output will get
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.000
one that you've just output will get
suppressed so those two rectangles with

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
suppressed so those two rectangles with
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.880
suppressed so those two rectangles with
the 0.6 and the 0.7 both of those

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
the 0.6 and the 0.7 both of those
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.039
the 0.6 and the 0.7 both of those
overlap but Lots with the light blue

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
overlap but Lots with the light blue
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.900
overlap but Lots with the light blue
rectangle so those you're going to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
rectangle so those you're going to
 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.210
rectangle so those you're going to
suppress and darken them to show that

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
suppress and darken them to show that
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.340
suppress and darken them to show that
they're being suppressed

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350
they're being suppressed
 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.600
they're being suppressed
NIC's you then go through the remaining

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
NIC's you then go through the remaining
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.610
NIC's you then go through the remaining
rectangles and find the one with the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
rectangles and find the one with the
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.770
rectangles and find the one with the
highest probability the highest PC which

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
highest probability the highest PC which
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.349
highest probability the highest PC which
in this case is this one with 0.8 so

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359
in this case is this one with 0.8 so
 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.970
in this case is this one with 0.8 so
let's commit to that and just say oh

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
let's commit to that and just say oh
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.310
let's commit to that and just say oh
I've detector car there and then an on

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320
I've detector car there and then an on

Mac suppression pod is to then get rid

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
Mac suppression pod is to then get rid
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.970
Mac suppression pod is to then get rid
of any other ones with a higher you so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980
of any other ones with a higher you so
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.180
of any other ones with a higher you so
now every rectangle has been either

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190
now every rectangle has been either
 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.069
now every rectangle has been either
highlighted or darkens and if you just

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079
highlighted or darkens and if you just
 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.050
highlighted or darkens and if you just
get rid of the darkened rectangles

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
get rid of the darkened rectangles
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.940
get rid of the darkened rectangles
you're left with just the highlighter

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950
you're left with just the highlighter
 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.910
you're left with just the highlighter
ones and these are your two final

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920
ones and these are your two final
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.580
ones and these are your two final
predictions so this is non Mac

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590
predictions so this is non Mac
 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.009
predictions so this is non Mac
suppression and non max means that

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019
suppression and non max means that
 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.650
suppression and non max means that
you're going to output your maximal

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660
you're going to output your maximal
 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.530
you're going to output your maximal
probabilities classifications but

suppress the closeby ones that are non
 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.840
suppress the closeby ones that are non
maximal so that's as a name non max

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850
maximal so that's as a name non max
 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.660
maximal so that's as a name non max
suppression so let's go through the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670
suppression so let's go through the
 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.210

to internment non max depression the
 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.170
to internment non max depression the
first thing you can do is discard all

first thing you can do is discard all
 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.570
first thing you can do is discard all
the boxes let's call all the predictions

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580
the boxes let's call all the predictions
 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.480
the boxes let's call all the predictions
all the bounding boxes were PC less than

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490
all the bounding boxes were PC less than
 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.719
all the bounding boxes were PC less than
equal to some threshold let's say 0.6 so

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729
equal to some threshold let's say 0.6 so
 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.430
equal to some threshold let's say 0.6 so
we're gonna say that unless you think

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440
we're gonna say that unless you think
 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.620
we're gonna say that unless you think
there's at least a 0.6 chance it is an

there's at least a 0.6 chance it is an
 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.890
there's at least a 0.6 chance it is an
object there let's just get rid of it so

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900
object there let's just get rid of it so
 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.689
object there let's just get rid of it so
this is cause all the low probability

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699
this is cause all the low probability
 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.560
this is cause all the low probability
output boxes so the way to think about

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570
output boxes so the way to think about
 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.300
output boxes so the way to think about
this is for each of the 361 positions

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310
this is for each of the 361 positions
 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.800
this is for each of the 361 positions
you output a bounding box together with

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810
you output a bounding box together with
 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.159
you output a bounding box together with
a probability of that bounding box being

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169
a probability of that bounding box being
 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.779
a probability of that bounding box being
a good one so we're just going to

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789
a good one so we're just going to
 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.270
a good one so we're just going to
discard all the bounding boxes that were

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280
discard all the bounding boxes that were
 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.469
discard all the bounding boxes that were
assigned a low probability NIC's while

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479
assigned a low probability NIC's while
 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.990
assigned a low probability NIC's while
there any remaining bounding boxes that

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000
there any remaining bounding boxes that
 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.689
there any remaining bounding boxes that
you've not yet discarded or process

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699
you've not yet discarded or process
 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.870
you've not yet discarded or process
you're going to repeatedly pick the box

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880
you're going to repeatedly pick the box
 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.270
you're going to repeatedly pick the box
to the highest probability with the

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280
to the highest probability with the
 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.270
to the highest probability with the
highest PC and then output that as a

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280
highest PC and then output that as a
 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.850
highest PC and then output that as a
prediction so this is a process on the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
prediction so this is a process on the
 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.740
prediction so this is a process on the
previous slide of taking one of the

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750
previous slide of taking one of the
 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.350
previous slide of taking one of the
bounding boxes and making it lighter in

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360
bounding boxes and making it lighter in
 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.480
bounding boxes and making it lighter in
color so you commit to outputting that

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490
color so you commit to outputting that
 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.450
color so you commit to outputting that
as a prediction for that there's a car

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460
as a prediction for that there's a car
 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.600
as a prediction for that there's a car
there next you then discard any

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610
there next you then discard any
 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.149
there next you then discard any
remaining box so any box that you have

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159
remaining box so any box that you have
 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.310
remaining box so any box that you have
not output as a prediction and there was

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320
not output as a prediction and there was
 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.680
not output as a prediction and there was
not previous as is called it so discard

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690
not previous as is called it so discard
 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.260
not previous as is called it so discard
any remaining box with a high overlap

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270
any remaining box with a high overlap
 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.050
any remaining box with a high overlap
with a high iou with the box that you

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060
with a high iou with the box that you
 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.189
with a high iou with the box that you
just output in the previous step so this

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199
just output in the previous step so this
 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.649
just output in the previous step so this
second step in the while loop was when

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659
second step in the while loop was when
 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.110
second step in the while loop was when
on the previous slide you were darkened

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120
on the previous slide you were darkened
 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.689
on the previous slide you were darkened
any remaining bounding box that has a

any remaining bounding box that has a
 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.969
any remaining bounding box that has a
high overlap with the bounding box that

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979
high overlap with the bounding box that
 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.769
high overlap with the bounding box that
we just made lighter than we just

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779
we just made lighter than we just
 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.050
we just made lighter than we just
highlighted

and so you keep doing this while there's

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880
and so you keep doing this while there's
 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.790
and so you keep doing this while there's
still any remaining boxes that you've

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800
still any remaining boxes that you've
 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.940

of the boxes and either output it as a
 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.790
of the boxes and either output it as a
prediction or discarded it as having too

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800
prediction or discarded it as having too
 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.909

on this slide if you actually try to
detect three objects say pedestrians

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810
detect three objects say pedestrians
 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.800
detect three objects say pedestrians
cause and motorcycles then the output

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810
cause and motorcycles then the output
 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.270

vector will have three additional

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280
vector will have three additional
 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.460
vector will have three additional
components and it turns out the right

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470
components and it turns out the right
 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.219

thing to do is to independently carry

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:20.229
thing to do is to independently carry
 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:23.100
thing to do is to independently carry
out non-mac suppression three times one

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110

on each of the outputs classes but the
 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.670

implement non-mac suppression yourself
 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.659
implement non-mac suppression yourself
on multiple object classes so that's it

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:39.669
on multiple object classes so that's it
 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:41.790
on multiple object classes so that's it
for non max suppression and if you

there's just one last idea I want to

00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039
there's just one last idea I want to
 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.560
there's just one last idea I want to
share with you which makes the algorithm

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:55.570
share with you which makes the algorithm
 

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.200
share with you which makes the algorithm
work much better which is the idea of

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.210
work much better which is the idea of
 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.170
work much better which is the idea of
using entire boxes let's go on to the

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180
using entire boxes let's go on to the
 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.690
using entire boxes let's go on to the
