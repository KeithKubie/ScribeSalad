00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.380
Given how setTimeout works when passed a function reference,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.460
what would you expect to happen when you pass in a method that

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.120
was first looked up as a property of an object?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.300
Notice that we're using dot notation to find the method at the moment we go

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.840
looking for it, to pass it into setTimeout.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.320
Again, let's start by considering how we expect the positional

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.770
parameters to work.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.590
As before, they're bound to undefined since no values were passed in

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.820
in-between the parentheses on the line where we call the callback.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.016
Furthermore, the setTimeout function wasn't passed any of

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:35.219
the color values that might have been passed to the callback.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.992
And so the body of setTimeout wouldn't have any way of

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:40.500
knowing what values you wanted passed in.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.530
The next question is what will get bound to the parameter this.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.690
Hint, remember where we have to look to determine the binding for

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.100
the parameter this.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.770
It isn't in the function definition nor

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.600
is it where the function is looked up on the object.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.250
The important moment is where the function is actually invoked.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.030
Generally, people find it tempting to imagine that since we did

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.940
a property lookup on the red object, perhaps that lookup event would have

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.230
some bearing on the keyword this inside the function.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.960
But this moment is irrelevant since only the moment of call time influences how

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.800
the parameter this will get bound.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.500
Just as in the previous example where we passed in fn instead of r.method,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.620
the last line of setTimeout is still a free function invocation and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.050
not a method invocation with a dot.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.440
Therefore, this would still be bound to its default value, the global object.
