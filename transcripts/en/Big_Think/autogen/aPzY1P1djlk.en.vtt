00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.230
There are forces at work against women, but
I also think that women can counteract those

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.990
forces with just a little bit of changes to
their behavior.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.969
&nbsp;And myself included, could I go back ten
years ago I would have done things a little

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.999
bit differently, maybe being more forceful,
asking for more things, not expecting that

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.199
they would come to me if I deserved them,
and just putting my neck on the line a little

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.199
bit more.&nbsp;

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.730
That’s maybe me, that’s maybe my personality.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.679
&nbsp;Things have worked out for me so far, but
there’s a fine line -- what is a personality

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.590
thing and what is what you’ve kind of been
taught by society as what is the polite, right

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.430
way to do and behave.&nbsp;

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.850
My advice for young women today and things
I wish I would have known or done differently

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.530
. . . there’s a lot.&nbsp;

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.090
But I would start with:
Just be aggressive.&nbsp;

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.690
Even if you think you’re being aggressive,
you’re probably not.&nbsp;

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.680
And whether that’s, you know, emailing someone
again who hasn’t emailed you back, picking

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.120
up the phone and calling them again if they
haven’t called you back, who cares?&nbsp;

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120
Just do it.&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.159
If you don’t kind of push, nobody will hear
you.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.159
&nbsp;
Ask for things.&nbsp;

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.710
Ask for things from your boss.&nbsp;

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.100
Ask for things from your people around you.&nbsp;

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.960
Ask for raises, ask for promotions, ask for
more responsibility.&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.369
Nobody’s necessarily looking out for you
and going to kind of take you and lift you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.369
up.&nbsp;

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.369
You have to do it yourself.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.420
Jump on opportunities.&nbsp;

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.990
Don’t worry so much about getting everything
on your list done.&nbsp;

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.960
I read a fabulous book called Nice Girls Don’t
Get the Corner Office, and it’s sort of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.140
101 things that you can do to change your
behavior, and it’s really—it came out

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.140
a long, long time ago.&nbsp;

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.240
It was a huge bestseller.&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.189
One of the things it said, you know, was that
women are achievers and men are careerists.&nbsp;

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.040
So a woman is more likely to sit there all
day, sit at her desk, even if it means having

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.280
lunch at her desk, and just make sure she
checks off everything on her to-do list, whereas

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.900
a guy is more likely to, like, get up, go
around the office, go see somebody, go have

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.219
lunch, come back, and just kind of, you know,
focus more on the bigger picture.&nbsp;

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.740
I think there’s a lot of truth to that.
