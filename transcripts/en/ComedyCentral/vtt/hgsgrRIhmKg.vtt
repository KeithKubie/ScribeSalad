00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:06.740
- It's an election year,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.309
which means we're all about
to go through a breakup.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.246
And an eight year relationship
is always hard to get over.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:13.413
Oh, well not always.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.249
(audience laughs)

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.083
Go away.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.417
I'm talking about Obama.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.152
We're not ready to say goodbye
yet,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.321
but all we can do is cope.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.524
So here are my tips for
dealing with a breakup.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.026
Okay, first get rid of
everything

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.394
that reminds you of Obama,

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.562
including those dad jeans,

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.063
that Portuguese water dog
poster,

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.198
and Joe Biden.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.366
(audience laughs)

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.034
I'm sorry, Joe, bye.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:39.206
And seriously, don't stalk
his social media accounts.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.075
I assure you, he's not up.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.913
And don't drive by his house,
he's moving, all right?

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.181
Now I know there's always
gonna be those songs

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.584
that remind you of him like this
one.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.185
("Hail to the Chief" by James
Sanderson)

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.587
That's our song you guys, turn
it off,

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:57.090
turn if off, (sobs) I can't take
it.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.460
He's perfect, it's like he
didn't do anything wrong.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.096
All I can think about is
that sweet perfect jump shot,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.532
you hunky angel of a man, oh!

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.969
- [Barack] I'm not gonna be
humiliated.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.737
- Oh Jesus, goddamn it.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.206
He's the most fuckable
president we'll ever have.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.074
(audience laughs)

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.108
Think about it.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.210
Like tell me you wouldn't fuck
this guy.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.546
Ah, pull yourself together, pull
it,

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.915
let's, come on, it's time to
move on.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.917
You know, maybe this is the
right time

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.586
to like experiment with
something new,

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:29.423
like a woman or a rotting
bag of baby carrots.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:31.258
I don't know.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.493
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.328
Please.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.465
I refuse to show Donald Trump's
face if I don't have to.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.168
I'm not Wolf Blitzer, yet.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.235
You'll need to tune in next time
for that,

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.271
but this week on Not Safe

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:45.605
I head down to a Trump rally

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.808
and ask his supporters if
he's the right candidate

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:49.943
to make America horny again.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.846
Tune in Tuesday at 10:30pm to
find out.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:56.783
(audience cheers and applauds)
