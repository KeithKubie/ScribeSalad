00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
&gt;&gt; So, Thomas, we're here to discuss whether
India can become a

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
superpower.
What do you think?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.179
&gt;&gt; I think it depends what you consider a
superpower is.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.620
I mean is a superpower a country that has
military strength?

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.460
Economic strength?
Is it a country that has intellectual strength?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.581
And if you look at all these various measures,
I think that India

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.950
already is a superpower in quite a few of
these respects.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.160
What do you think is the most valid measure
of a superpower, when you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.160
hear this question?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.100
&gt;&gt; I guess in many ways the very idea of the
superpower is a very

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.289
Western notion.
It's something that we received almost as

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.879
part of the history of the
20th century, one that was dominated by two

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.550
Western powers, USSR and
USA, being juxtaposed against one another.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.289
And I guess the question for me is not so
much whether India will be a

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.955
superpower, whether it can define a different
type of paradigm within

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:57.149
which it sees itself as a key part of the
world's structure, key part

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.359
of the world's leading countries, whatever
way that new paradigm is

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.359
defined.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.089
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that in some ways it is already
is a superpower,

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.030
again, another aspect of this is the -- something
that has come home at

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.680
this meeting is the power of the Indian [INAUDIBLE].
Indians throughout the world, I keep meeting

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.619
Indians who come back to
Indian from very vibrant communities overseas,

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.390
and they really have
this superpower that already exists.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.979
It's not really a case of India itself getting
things together, is that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.979
what it is?

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.560
&gt;&gt; Or maybe a recognition, maybe part of what
needs to be, maybe a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.299
different kind of label, so you don't use
the term superpower.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.380
What kind of ways there are of describing
India?

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399
Maybe something that comes out of this [INAUDIBLE],
something along

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.410
those lines or India's heritage.
Describe what India brings to the table.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.969
In the same way that India did not participate
in the dynamic between

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.341
the USA and the USSR looking at the non-alignment.
Are there ways that India could define itself

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.930
differently?
But using the criteria that you talked about

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.039
earlier, which are metrics
of a country gathering on the world stage,

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.850
you know, economy, military,
social engagement, increasing social inclusion,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.760
India definitely does
[INAUDIBLE] on world stage significant.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.820
So I think what we're seeing is, that's sort
of a given.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.900
It what's does that mean in terms of its way
of engagement what kind of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.780
model does it put forward for itself?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.060
&gt;&gt; All right.
So in other words, India's definitely a superpower.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.540
We question the notion of what a superpower
is.
