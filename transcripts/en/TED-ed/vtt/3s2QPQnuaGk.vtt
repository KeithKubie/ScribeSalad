00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:09.386
In mythological ancient Greece,

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:13.569
soaring above Crete on wings made
from wax and feathers,

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:19.346
Icarus, the son of Daedalus,
defied the laws of both man and nature.

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:23.137
Ignoring the warnings of his father,
he rose higher and higher.

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:26.368
To witnesses on the ground,
he looked like a god,

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:30.677
and as he peered down from above,
he felt like one, too.

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:32.887
But, in mythological ancient Greece,

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:36.637
the line that separated god from man
was absolute

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:41.167
and the punishment for mortals
who attempted to cross it was severe.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.459
Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus.

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:46.697
Years before Icarus was born,

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:50.818
his father Daedalus was highly regarded
as a genius inventor,

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:51.569
craftsman,

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.439
and sculptor in his homeland of Athens.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:59.808
He invented carpentry
and all the tools used for it.

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:01.730
He designed the first bathhouse

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.648
and the first dance floor.

00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:09.818
He made sculptures so lifelike
that Hercules mistook them for actual men.

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:15.377
Though skilled and celebrated,
Daedalus was egotistical and jealous.

00:01:15.377 --> 00:01:18.589
Worried that his nephew
was a more skillful craftsman,

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:20.854
Daedalus murdered him.

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:26.378
As punishment, Daedalus was banished
from Athens and made his way to Crete.

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:28.616
Preceded by his storied reputation,

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.979
Daedalus was welcomed 
with open arms by Crete's King Minos.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.558
There, acting as the palace 
technical advisor,

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:38.819
Daedalus continued to push the boundaries.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.129
For the king's children,

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:44.559
he made mechanically animated toys
that seemed alive.

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:50.118
He invented the ship's sail and mast,
which gave humans control over the wind.

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:53.228
With every creation, Daedalus challenged
human limitations

00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:56.968
that had so far kept mortals
separate from gods,

00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:00.840
until finally, he broke right through.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.600
King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë,
had been cursed by the god Poseidon

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.870
to fall in love
with the king's prized bull.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.329
Under this spell, she asked Daedalus
to help her seduce it.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.929
With characteristic audacity, he agreed.

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.802
Daedalus constructed a hollow
wooden cow

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:23.091
so realistic that it fooled the bull.

00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:26.441
With Pasiphaë hiding inside
Daedalus's creation,

00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:32.165
she conceived and gave birth
to the half-human half-bull minotaur.

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:34.661
This, of course, enraged the king

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:40.955
who blamed Daedalus for enabling
such a horrible perversion of natural law.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:45.691
As punishment, Daedalus was forced
to construct an inescapable labyrinth

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:49.894
beneath the palace for the minotaur.

00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:52.962
When it was finished, Minos then
imprisoned Daedalus

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:54.951
and his only son Icarus

00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:58.710
within the top of the tallest tower
on the island

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.085
where they were to remain 
for the rest of their lives.

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:04.710
But Daedalus was still a genius inventor.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.311
While observing the birds
that circled his prison,

00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:10.281
the means for escape became clear.

00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:13.071
He and Icarus would fly away
from their prison

00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:16.732
as only birds or gods could do.

00:03:16.732 --> 00:03:19.711
Using feathers from the flocks
that perched on the tower,

00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:21.951
and the wax from candles,

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:26.342
Daedalus constructed two pairs
of giant wings.

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:29.081
As he strapped the wings
to his son Icarus,

00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:30.923
he gave a warning:

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:34.842
flying too near the ocean 
would dampen the wings

00:03:34.842 --> 00:03:37.201
and make them too heavy to use.

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:39.122
Flying too near the sun,

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:43.802
the heat would melt the wax
and the wings would disintegrate.

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:47.192
In either case, they surely would die.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:52.578
Therefore, the key to their escape
would be in keeping to the middle.

00:03:52.578 --> 00:03:56.553
With the instructions clear,
both men leapt from the tower.

00:03:56.553 --> 00:04:00.113
They were the first mortals ever to fly.

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:03.323
While Daedalus stayed carefully
to the midway course,

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:07.813
Icarus was overwhelmed
with the ecstasy of flight

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:13.264
and overcome with the feeling of
divine power that came with it.

00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:19.224
Daedalus could only watch in horror
as Icarus ascended higher and higher,

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:23.423
powerless to change his son's dire fate.

00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:27.173
When the heat from the sun melted
the wax on his wings,

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:29.803
Icarus fell from the sky.

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.194
Just as Daedalus had many times ignored

00:04:32.194 --> 00:04:36.413
the consequences of defying 
the natural laws of mortal men

00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:38.533
in the service of his ego,

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:43.744
Icarus was also carried away
by his own hubris.

00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:44.742
In the end,

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:49.533
both men paid for their departure 
from the path of moderation dearly,

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:51.134
Icarus with his life

00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:53.843
and Daedalus with his regret.
