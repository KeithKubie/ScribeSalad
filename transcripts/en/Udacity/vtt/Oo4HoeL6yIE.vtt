00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.820
Let me introduce to you my favorite
screen reader, called voice over.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.090
Voice over is a speech
software that allows

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.520
people who are blind to vision impaired
to read information on the screen.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.290
Voiceover is built into Mac OS ten, so
it's available on every Mac computer.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.900
We will start by turning voice over on.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.300
The great thing is that because
it's a built-in software,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.500
there is a global shortcut key which is
available to users to use at any point.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.270
To turn a voice over on,
we press Cmd+F5.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.760
And we will use the same
shortcut to turn it off.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.840
So let's start by turning voice over on.

00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:45.120
&gt;&gt; Voice over on Chrome, Google, window,
Google, HTML content has keyboard focus.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.160
&gt;&gt; You can refer to instructor notes for
a full list of available shortcut keys.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.610
The next thing I would like to do is
to setup voice over for my needs.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.070
I would like to open
voice over control panel.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920
&gt;&gt; Spotlight spotlight system dialogue.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.610
They are voice over utility from Chrome,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.580
Google voice over utility
voice over utility window.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
&gt;&gt; I want to show you how to
adjust speech rate for voice over.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.710
First I'll show the speed that I
normally use in my daily computing

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.270
tasks and then we'll switch
back to the normal speech rate.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.760
&gt;&gt; Verbosity speech leaving table and
your speech.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.260
And Alex default for
five content selected.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.342
Default rate at a tax default rate 50%,
60%, 65%, 70%, 75%.

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:36.210
&gt;&gt; So this is my speech rate,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.730
however most people when they hear
it they say it's too difficult for

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.370
them to understand because
the voices speaking just too fast.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.950
So to make things a little
bit easier on you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.195
I'm going to switch back
to the default speech rate.

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:53.701
&gt;&gt; 55, 50%, 45%.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.490
&gt;&gt; The next setting I want to change
is the setting that's responsible for

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.990
providing the summary of
a web page when it loads.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.765
In order to do that,
I will switch to the Web category.

00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:08.160
Notice one thing,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.030
that as I navigate through the list of
categories, I use keyboard exclusively.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.980
So in this instance I'm
just going to shift tab.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.510
&gt;&gt; Four, five.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.420
Alex the mute speech unchecked checkbox
voices, utility categories, table.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.790
&gt;&gt; Once original list, I'm going
to arrow down to the web category.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.660
&gt;&gt; Navigation web.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.240
&gt;&gt; And then tab again to
the set in there I want.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.010
&gt;&gt; Leading cell navigation page
loading tab selected page loading

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.110
speed web page summary when
loading a new web page.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.340
&gt;&gt; So this is the setting that I want.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.890
So I'm going to check it.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.210
&gt;&gt; Checked speed web page summary
when loading a new web page.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.410
Checkbox.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.420
&gt;&gt; And now I'm ready to go back
to Chrome and begin web browsing.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.210
&gt;&gt; Chrome Google window.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.330
Google HTML content.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.480
&gt;&gt; So now we're going to go and
actually browse the web.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.200
I would like to go to Wikipedia website.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.300
So in order to do that
I'll press command l.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.840
&gt;&gt; Open location https//
&gt;&gt; Which takes me to the address bar.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.400
&gt;&gt; Selection n period en, i, k, i, p,
a, period, g, google, HTML content,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.070
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
page has 351 links, 15 headings.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.555
4 form controls, 6 tables, 14 landmarks.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.351
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; You notice how voice over spoke

00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:24.670
the page summary?

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.820
It told me how many headings, links, and
form fields and tables are on that page.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.360
And that's the setting we turned on
just a minute ago, if you remember.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.500
Every time I start
browsing a new web page or

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.180
even the pages that I already
know about I start looking for

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.280
headings to make it easier for
me to navigate through the page.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.520
Voice Over has a tool called
web router which allows me to

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.700
see how many headings
browse through them,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.640
and choose the ones that I actually
would like to navigate to.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.660
To start web router,
I press control option U

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.960
headings menu as you can see there are
quite a number of headings on this page.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.260
So when the arrow up and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.460
down I would hear things like having
level two from today's featured article

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.745
heading level did you know
Heading level two in the news.

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.855
Heading level two on this day.

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:23.955
&gt;&gt; One thing to notice here is that
the order in which I see headings with

00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:26.965
voiceover is different from the order
you see them on the web page.

00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:31.010
In other words,
my order is more logical.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.340
And the order you see on the page
is more visually arranged.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.750
This is the decision that
Wikipedia authors have made.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.490
Another thing to notice here is that
voiceover speaks the heading level

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.730
number every time I arrow
to a particular heading.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.390
&gt;&gt; Heading.
Heading.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.250
Hea. Hea. Heading-
&gt;&gt; Selecting

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.950
heading level 2--
&gt;&gt; Level 2.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.560
Wikipedia languages.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.110
Heading level 2.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.960
Heading.
Hea.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.015
Heading level 3 print/export.

00:04:55.015 --> 00:04:57.780
&gt;&gt; 3
&gt;&gt; And there could be more.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.970
Level of the heading indicates how
prominent it is on the web page.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.770
So for example these sections here.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.520
&gt;&gt; Padding level two
today's featured pictured.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.270
&gt;&gt; They have higher importance than the.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.490
&gt;&gt; Heading level three.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.610
&gt;&gt; Think of it as sections and
subsections of a web page.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.880
So if we find a heading of level three
Underneath the heading of level 2,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.640
it indicates that this is a subsection
of a section of a web page.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.240
So I would like to search for a heading
that says something about Featured.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.010
So what I'm going to do is I'll
just type a few letters and

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.000
let voiceover find that heading for me.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.470
&gt;&gt; Four items, three item, three items.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.520
Three item heading level two
from today's featured article.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;From today's feature article.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.730
That's exactly what I wanted.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.745
So I'm going to press Enter key and

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:53.015
jump-move the screen reader
focus straight to the Heading.

00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:56.625
Heading level 2,
&gt;From today's featured article.

00:05:56.625 --> 00:06:00.015
&gt;&gt; You hear a voice over repeated the
heading again which means my focus is

00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:01.075
right there.

00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:05.578
&gt;From here on I can begin exploring
the page right underneath the heading by

00:06:05.578 --> 00:06:09.140
pressing Ctrl+Option+Right Arrow.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.520
&gt;&gt; Row 2 of 4 link image.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.250
Jonathan Agnew in 2006, column 1 of 1.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.720
Link, Jonathan Agnew born 4 April 1960
is an English link, cricket, cricket.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.390
&gt;&gt; By the way, I can move by
headings on the page by pressing

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.820
shortcut keys Ctrl+Option+Cmd+H
to move forward by a heading.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.552
Or control option command shift
age to move backward by heading.

00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:36.020
&gt;&gt; Heading level two, did you know,
heading level two in the news.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.440
Heading level two, did you know,
heading level two,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.170
from today, first heading, heading level
two, from today's featured article.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.080
&gt;&gt; This is a quick way to
navigate through a web page.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.420
If I would like to move
with built in shortcut keys

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.220
directly through the content as opposed
to going through the web router options.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.180
So this is how I navigate
the web page using headings.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.260
There are other few tricks I use,
however I'll talk about them later.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.080
It's important to remember, that once
you made the functionality of your

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.690
web page accessible and usable for
users of assistive technology.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.350
Headings is probably one of the most
important features that you can

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.650
build into your web pages,
to make them more usable, for

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.310
screen beauty user specifically.
