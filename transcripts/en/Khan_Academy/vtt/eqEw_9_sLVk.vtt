00:00:00.311 --> 00:00:01.144
- [Instructor] In this video

00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:03.498
we're gonna focus on enumerated powers

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:07.058
versus implied powers for
the federal government.

00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:10.452
Enumerated just means powers
that have been made explicit,

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:12.042
that are clear, that have been enumerated,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:13.698
that have been listed some place

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:17.202
while implied powers are ones
that maybe aren't as clear,

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:19.611
maybe they haven't been explicitly listed

00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:22.333
but they are assumed
because of certain wording

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.083
or just in order to do
the enumerated powers

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:28.297
and this is a really important concept

00:00:28.297 --> 00:00:30.242
because in any federal system

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:32.984
where you have multiple layers,

00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:34.821
you have the federal government,

00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.479
you have the state governments

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.531
and of course you also
have the local governments

00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:42.622
but this idea of what powers
go to the federal government

00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:44.098
versus the state government

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:46.067
is a super important one

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.273
and it's a matter of significant debate

00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:50.925
and it has changed over time,

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.581
so to just get our base
line understanding,

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.327
let's sample some of the enumerated powers

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:57.564
to the federal government

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:01.193
inside of the United States Constitution.

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:03.850
So, this right over here is
Article One, Section Eight

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.339
of the United States Constitution.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.141
I'm not going to read it in its entirety,

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:09.205
we'll focus on some of
these powers in more detail

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:11.537
in other videos but I will sample it

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.462
and focus on some of the clauses

00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:16.652
that have been especially cited

00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:19.365
and have been especially
relevant to the world

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:20.630
that we live in.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.731
So, just to sample,

00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.103
so the Congress shall have
the power to lay and collect

00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:27.811
taxes, duties, imposts and excises,

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.339
so these are very clear enumerated powers.

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:32.807
It's listing what the
Congress has the power to do.

00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:35.508
The Congress can borrow
money on the credit

00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:36.564
of the United States.

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:40.064
Once again, a very clear enumerated power.

00:01:40.998 --> 00:01:43.295
To regulate commerce with foreign nations

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:45.239
and among the several states

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.549
and with the Indian tribes.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.939
Now, this clause right over here

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.924
and this is now referred
to as the Commerce Clause

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:55.049
might not really stand out to you,

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.508
it might not stand out to you relative

00:01:56.508 --> 00:02:00.218
to the right to conduct foreign affairs

00:02:00.218 --> 00:02:03.062
or something that seems very
big and dramatic like that

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:05.149
but it turns out that the Commerce Clause

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.539
is viewed as one of
the significant clauses

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.563
that gives the federal
government significant rights

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.707
and it's considered to have
really three enumerated rights

00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:16.820
embedded in it.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.184
You have the regulation of
commerce with foreign nations,

00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:23.293
the regulation of commerce
among the several states

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:25.145
and with the Indian tribes.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.344
And it's the middle one that is viewed

00:02:27.344 --> 00:02:30.538
as giving the federal
government a lot of power

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:33.070
because even though it
might seem okay, well,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.423
we're just talking about
commerce between states,

00:02:35.423 --> 00:02:39.724
it's been used to justify
things like federal drug laws

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.828
that even if a state argues hey,

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.719
we are just going to
say legalize marihuana

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.835
within our states, the federal government

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.758
has cited that your
legalization of marihuana

00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:53.244
is going to affect commerce between states

00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:56.020
and we'll go into more depth
in that in future videos

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.310
but the Commerce Clause
is a key enumerated right

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.826
that's given in the constitution

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:03.497
that is viewed as giving
the federal government

00:03:03.497 --> 00:03:05.677
fairly broad authority.

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:07.097
But, let's continue.

00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:09.672
To establish a uniform
rule of naturalization.

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:10.815
Who becomes an American?

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.787
Uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy.

00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:16.354
Keep going, I always
encourage you to look at this

00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:20.098
in context in the actual constitution.

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:21.443
That is always interesting.

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:22.900
The reason why I listed all of these out

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.620
even though I'm not going to read them

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.398
is that it's just interesting to see

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:29.100
how many of these
enumerated rights there are

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.157
but I'm going to focus on the last clause

00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:35.979
because this one is in a lot of ways

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.430
a lot bigger than all of the other ones.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.014
It says to makes all laws

00:03:41.014 --> 00:03:44.683
which shall be necessary and proper

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:49.143
for carrying into execution
the foregoing powers

00:03:49.143 --> 00:03:51.947
and all other powers
vested by this constitution

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:54.400
in the government of the United States

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.000
or in any department or officer thereof.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.981
Pause this video.

00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:03.148
Think about why this is a
very, very, very big deal.

00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:08.100
Well, the previous 17
clauses were very explicit.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.669
They were enumerated powers

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.758
about what the federal
government has the power to do

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:15.847
but his one here is making
a much broader statement.

00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:18.095
It's saying to make all laws

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:21.801
which shall be necessary and proper

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:24.893
for carrying into execution
the foregoing powers,

00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:29.230
the enumerated powers that
were in the last 17 clauses

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.927
and so, this is known as the
Necessary and Proper Clause

00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:33.902
which you will hear a lot about,

00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:35.569
Necessary and Proper

00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:40.277
and it provides for a
lot of implied powers

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:43.167
because it's essentially saying look,

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:45.646
there's things that we haven't listed

00:04:45.646 --> 00:04:47.692
in the enumerated powers

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:49.780
in the previous 17 clauses

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.632
but the federal government

00:04:50.632 --> 00:04:52.890
has the right to make all
laws which shall be necessary

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.221
and proper for carrying into execution

00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:56.888
the foregoing powers

00:04:57.726 --> 00:05:00.783
and so, even when I was talking
about say federal drugs laws

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:03.327
it's really the combination
of the Commerce Clause

00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:06.154
and the Necessary and Proper Clause

00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:07.604
that allows the federal government

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:10.472
to make some of these broader arguments

00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:12.546
that says okay, we regulate commerce

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:14.362
and in order to regulate commerce

00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:16.358
we need to regulate drugs

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.772
because it is necessary and proper

00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:21.849
for regulating interstate commerce,

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.637
so we're gonna talk
more and more about this

00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:26.821
especially when we look at
specific constitutional cases

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:28.583
that will cite these clauses

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.429
but it's really important to appreciate

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:33.289
what enumerated powers are

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.228
and what implied powers are

00:05:35.228 --> 00:05:36.442
which the Necessary and Proper Clause

00:05:36.442 --> 00:05:38.920
gives a lot of and the anti-federalists

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.779
really did not like this 18th clause.

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.245
Understanding the ideas of
enumerated and implied powers

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.734
is going to be really helpful

00:05:46.734 --> 00:05:48.970
as we study the various disputes

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.423
over state versus federal powers

00:05:51.423 --> 00:05:53.154
throughout American history

00:05:53.154 --> 00:05:56.871
and how it is decided on
by say the Supreme Court

00:05:56.871 --> 00:05:58.870
when they cite the constitution

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.842
and in particular cite some of the clauses

00:06:00.842 --> 00:06:02.460
that we have just looked at.
