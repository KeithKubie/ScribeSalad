00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:15.240
NARRATOR: It's San Francisco
in the 1970's, and it's the era

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.760
of peace, love, and low-riders.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.270
Our story starts
here, in the Mission

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.850
of corner of 24th and Folsom.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.300
This is Phil.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.017
He will go on to become
the king of coffee.

00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:28.975
PHIL JABER: Who's next?

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:30.480
NARRATOR: But more
on that later.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.470
For now, he sells the
country's cheapest milk, beer,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.930
and cigarettes.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.580
PHIL JABER: I have
a mini-supermarket.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.890
There's nothing I don't sell.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.530
NARRATOR: This is Jacob,
Phil's number one employee.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.440
JACOB JABER: Let me
know when you're ready.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.390
Now?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.050
OK.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.690
NARRATOR: Not wanting to leave
a legacy of a liquor store

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.900
behind, Phil set his
sights on something bigger.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.000
PHIL JABER: My friend's
coffee came to my dream,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.780
and I'm taking it to the moon.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.445
God bless.

00:00:57.445 --> 00:00:58.820
NARRATOR: He set
out on a mission

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.610
to create the best
product possible.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.510
Phil visited thousands of stores
and consumed gallons of coffee.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.260
PHIL JABER: When I was
working with beans,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870
it's like a pharmacy.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.579
We used to count them, one,
two, three, four, five.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:12.620
We'd do this [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.418
Then I add another
culture of coffee to it.

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:16.880
No, add another.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.240
No.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.978
I spent days and hours.

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:26.650
NARRATOR: Meet Tesora,
Phil's first blend.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.850
She took seven years to perfect.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.870
PHIL JABER: Seven years.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.342
[INAUDIBLE] that corner.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:36.390
[INAUDIBLE] Seven
years, one blend.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.350
Because I want to do it right.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.150
NARRATOR: Tesora
was so good, Phil

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.830
experimented with more flavors.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.310
There was something
for everybody.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.280
And cup by cup, Philz
Coffee was born.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.250
SPEAKER 1: My favorite flavor?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.100
Um--

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.090
SPEAKER 2: That's
tough, I don't know.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.070
My favorite drink--

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.660
SPEAKER 1: So Jacob's
Wonderbar was the first coffee

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.744
I ever had at Philz.

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:54.910
SPEAKER 3: The Philharmonic.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.960
SPEAKER 4: Organic Peru Light.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.800
SPEAKER 5: The Dancing Water.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.883
SPEAKER 6: Philtered Soul.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:00.060
SPEAKER 7: What's the flavor
profile of an ambrosia?

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.486
SPEAKER 8: Aromatic Arabic.

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:03.990
SPEAKER 9: Mint Mojito with an
extra shot of deliciousness.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.656
SPEAKER 10: Pan
Galactic Gargle Blaster.

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:08.900
SPEAKER 11: Uh, hot chocolate?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.560
PHIL JABER: And when I used to
sit in the coffee shop and sit,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.843
people stiffs.

00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:13.710
Don't talk.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.990
They sitting in their
table like a plant.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.060
I said that's not what I want.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.900
I want to put a big community
table, put'em together.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.450
I'm going to go say hi George,
how are you, this is Nancy.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.260
Nancy, this is George.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.902
And that's what I did.

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:30.910
SPEAKER 12: Coffee
is something that's

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.340
supposed to brighten your day.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.890
And wake you up in the morning.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.386
Inspire a conversation.

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:36.886
PHIL JABER: And
like I tell you, all

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:39.100
my coffee shop says you
go visit your grandma,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.622
it's the best
thing you ever had.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.380
SPEAKER 13: I wrote
a book at Philz.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.836
And it's about Philz.

00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:49.625
(IN UNISON) We got
engaged at Philz.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:51.500
SPEAKER 14: We started
our business at Philz.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.758
SPEAKER 15: I like Philz
so much, I got a tattoo.

00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:58.760
SPEAKER 16: (SINGING)
Philz Coffee, ooh, coffee.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.170
JACOB JABER: We believe to
deliver the best experience,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.130
you have to be able
to be yourself.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.580
SPEAKER 17: I get
to serve someone

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.220
a great cup of coffee
every day, and I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.740
get to better someone's day.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.970
SPEAKER 18: Why coffee?

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.410
Why not coffee?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.110
Coffee is great.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.050
SPEAKER 19: What we
do is so special.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.320
And what we want to do is
share the special experience

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.330
with more people
around the world.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.800
Our vision is to reinvent
the coffee experience.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.220
We want to change the
way people drink coffee.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.370
PHIL JABER: Which one
are we going to do now?

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.230
We're going to make
it with real love.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.820
PHIL JABER: I believe I
was born to make coffee.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.810
Just like people
born to be a doctor.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.000
Frank Sinatra, born to sing.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.120
I was born to make coffee.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.720
JACOB JABER: My dad and I
started Philz Coffee in 2003

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.710
in San Francisco.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.570
And now we have 11 locations.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.460
And we're voted one of the
best coffee shops in the US.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.870
PHIL JABER: I do this
just to see the color.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.452
Not for any other reason.

00:04:00.452 --> 00:04:02.160
JACOB JABER: He believed
in making coffee

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.570
without using machinery.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.780
Everything is handcrafted,
one cup at a time.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.610
PHIL JABER: I know
so much about beans.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.610
I didn't know nothing.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.360
JACOB JABER: There's
so many little things

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.910
that need to be perfect that add
up to something really great.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.870
Google Apps plays a
role in that by making

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.320
our lives easier for email,
for chat, for documents.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.450
It took us about 25 to 35
minutes from start to finish,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.060
literally, to set everybody up.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.400
We created a new
store check list.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.100
We share a spreadsheet with
all of the people involved.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.221
And it's helping us opening
stores more efficiently.

00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:37.720
I know that it's
going to support us

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.400
not with just 10
stories, or 11 stores,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.280
but a couple of thousand
stores down the road.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.490
My dad never uses technology,
but he actually enjoys it

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.110
and says it's
really easy to use.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.930
He said look, I
got an email today.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.810
Our mission is to
better people's day.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.540
We want them to walk out
of our store happier,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.440
with a damn good cup of
coffee, and a feeling of wow,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.040
they really cared about
me and my experience.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.480
PHIL JABER: People, when
they like something,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.037
they take you to the moon.

00:05:06.037 --> 00:05:07.870
One day, I'm going to
do coffee in the moon.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.615
PRESENTER 1: Phil
of Philz Coffee

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:23.860
immigrated to Alameda with his
family at a very young age.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.570
He became passionate
about coffee as a child.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.830
And soon, saw the business
potential grow over the years.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.390
When he opened a grocery and
liquor store in the Mission,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.560
he loved coffee so much that
he worked on coffee research

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.000
in his spare time.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.840
With a passion for
people and coffee,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.320
he spent 25 years perfecting
a variety of coffee blends.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.730
In pursuing his dreams, Phil
converted his Mission store

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.430
to the first Philz
Coffee location in 2003.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.170
Now at 30 locations in
California and Washington DC,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.880
Phil attributes his success
to having a unique approach

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.160
to business, respect, and
faith in loving what you do.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.040
Round of applause for Bill.

accounts, and relocated
to San Francisco

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.826
to open and lead the first

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:41.700
She was the general

they help define

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.600
While this would have fulfilled
her aspirations to be Leslie

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.872
Knope, her career actually--

00:07:50.872 --> 00:07:52.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.250

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.820

here.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.700
Seems like Philz Coffee and
Google and high-tech companies,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.530
we compliment each other.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.230
As I look around, I see smart
people, intelligent men,

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.579
women with a smile.

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:37.120
Look at that.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.220
How can I go wrong
not being here?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.320
So I want to tell you
something about here.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.920
We came, as you see in
the video, we came young.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.630
My family been
here since 1920's.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.389
When I was a little kid,
I always loved coffee.

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:53.180
In the old days, my
grandma, the neighbors,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.880
they used to get
together and sit for two,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.170
three hours, socialize.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.680
And the only thing they
had was coffee or tea.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.480
They didn't have
tequila or iPhone.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.970
So I used to see them
talk for two, three hours.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.110
Grandma or mom or
somebody go make coffee,

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.850
they never left the oven.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.850
They work on the coffee.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.930
It's not put it in the machine,
and push and a shot of espresso

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.280
come out.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.560
And from there they make latte,
cappuccino, these fancy names.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.880
So coffee is hand-crafted.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.900
That I learned when I was a kid.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.860
So I always like it
because in the old days,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.810
people used to get
together, seal a deal,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.750
talk, communicate
over a cup of coffee.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.810
So I always like coffee.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.120
So when I came to
the United States,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.800
my family had a supermarket.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.290
Then I went to
Alameda High School.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.280
As I graduate, we
have summer vacation.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.870
Then the second--
two, three months,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.730
we went to college to register.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.750
Second day, I get up, I said
I don't want to go to college.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.840
Open store for me.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.240
So I open the shop
on 24th Street.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:20.000
I used to sell every item that
a household use in their homes.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.040
And sell it at a
reasonable price.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.930
I wasn't looking-- I
want to make 30%, 40%.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.920
I want to make 3% to 5%.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.640
But I want to rotate products.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.250
Let's say, for example, I
buy $10,000 worth of milk.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.560
I want to rotate that at
least four times a month.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.570
So I'm spending $40,000 at 5%.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.830
Well a month later,
I'm making 60%.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.970
So that's how I
used to do business.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.240
Milk, cigarette, liquor,
beer, coffee, deli.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.220
There's nothing I don't sell.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.220
In the meantime, I used to work
on my coffee, the handcrafted.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.390
Because I want to be different
than any coffee shops.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.240
They're all good.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.270
God bless them all.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.180
There's business for everybody.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:15.520
But I want to capture the
quality of our new society.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.790
You guys, the new society.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.920
You guys smart, intelligent.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.720
You guys have class,
you have taste.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.080
You don't like BS.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.880
You love quality.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.010
You walk to it, you drive
to it, you even fly to it.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.830
And you guys have money.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.540
So I figure I'm going
to open a coffee shop.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.300
And I visit over 1,100
coffee shops in 2002

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.670
to see why people go there,
what they're looking for,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.670
what their expectation.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.120
Is their employees happy?

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.340
Does the owner come there?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.220
So some shops, I repeat, repeat.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.820
Then I stopped.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.330
So I wrote my own notes.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.799
Because each one of them have
something good about them.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.840
So I took one word from
here, one word from here.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.060
But I wrote my own
concept, how I'm

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.630
going to run my coffee shops.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.430
First and foremost
is hospitality.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.790
That I see that
need that attention

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:11.980
and be sincere action.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.630
Be loyal, be straight,
reasonable price,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.390
quality products, which
is-- I conquer it.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.450
25 years, I worked at it.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.660
So I'm not worry about
the coffee concept.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.280
Now I need to capture
the quality clientele

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.880
that no other
businesses can capture.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.194
By hospitality, sincere
action, treat them

00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:32.360
like you want to be treated.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.870
You greet them from the first
18 seconds as they walk in.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.670
And that's what happened to us.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.950
We did a good job.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.920
We used to have one
shop, me and my son.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.080
Now we have over 37 shops.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.830
We have a lot of
markets, quality

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:53.020
that we serve, like Whole Foods,
Mollie Stone, Williams-Sonoma,

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.790
[INAUDIBLE], Virgin America
airlines, the Facebook

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.560
headquarters, and all the
other high tech companies.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.190
Google was my first one, to
sell coffee from Middlefield.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:12.670
So these quality companies
and quality people, they

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.740
give me a name, a reputation.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.270
Because our sincere action, I
have people who work for me,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.020
they are team members, family.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.584
One guy asked me, sir, for
how many employees you have?

00:13:24.584 --> 00:13:26.500
I said I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.458
I don't have employees.

00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:28.770
[PHONE RINGING]

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.448
I have--

00:13:31.448 --> 00:13:37.600
[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry,
I should [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.270
PRESENTER 1: He has employees
and fans calling night and day.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.470
It's his wife.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.654
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:47.070
PHIL JABER: I don't
call her wife,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.710
I call her my
bride for 36 years.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.820
So I told him I didn't have
employees, I have families.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.690
I have almost 800-1,000
families working for me.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.370
And the guy was a business
major from Harvard.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.030
He goes Jesus, I'd
never heard that before.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.740
I visit a lot of high tech
companies, a lot of companies.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.110
And they say I have
40,000 employees.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.180
You're the only one who said
you have almost 1,000 families.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.280
You impress me,
that's really great.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.450
I said that's what we have, we
have families working for us.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.906
And the quality of my clientele.

00:14:27.906 --> 00:14:29.905
The first day they are
customers, the second day

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.930
they become clientele.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.800
You guys-- my team
and my clientele

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.240
give us a name, a reputation.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.200
That only happens
once in a lifetime.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.160
We don't have money to buy it.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.600
We earn it.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.900
From you guys, by the people.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.436
And you all put me
in the cloud now.

00:14:50.436 --> 00:14:53.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.768
I remember the
clouds used to rain.

00:14:56.768 --> 00:14:58.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:03.100
So when I wrote my concept,
before we start opening,

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.510
we have no money to open.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.150
We have a journey,
agenda, we have a dream

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.770
that I'm going to conquer.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.030
And it's not about talking.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.130
The more people you
have who you talk to,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.210
they take you away
from your concept.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.070
So I used to discuss
things with my son.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.230
Which is-- he's my
oxygen, my best friend.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.770
We have lots of respect.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.590
And we used to talk about
things, write things down.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.660
And we used to action
the second day.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.250
With so little money
I had, I let it be.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.560
Because that's how I learned
it was going to work or not.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.790
By-- see, I want to
tell you something.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.240
In the business world, without
money, you can't do nothing.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.052
So if you keep it in the
back or under the mattress,

00:15:45.052 --> 00:15:46.260
it ain't going to do nothing.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.790
It's dead meat.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.630
So I used my money work for me.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.400
So we grew.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.390
And I just can't tell
you how good it is.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.030
I could talk for 10 years.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.460
What happened to us only
happened once in a lifetime.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.420
It's how you conduct,
how you present yourself.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.070
The hospital and the
quality of the products.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:15.380
And like I said, you all
have class and taste.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.110
So you guys taking
me to the moon.

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:21.870
There's a lot to say.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.280
But you must have something
before you start company.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.250
Don't open company, have
money, and from there, you

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.610
start to learn and
getting better, better.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.120
We were better from the
first day we opened.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.140
Because we know
what we need to do.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.410
And we action people.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.410
And we have never been shy.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.072
I loved people when I was a kid.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.920
I feel I'm the
most wealthiest man

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.090
in this planet by how many
people like me, respect me,

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.180
trust me.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.726
Because three things we never
did, [? attack ?] my parents,

00:16:55.726 --> 00:16:56.600
cheat, steal, or lie.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.430
We never do that.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:03.170
We not tried to say sorry or
I'm sorry, I don't have it.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.952
But we have the morals,
the basics, the value.

00:17:05.952 --> 00:17:07.410
Money is the last
thing in my life.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.619
I'm into health before wealth.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:13.079
My father wrote me a note, 1976.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:18.089
Says let the life I
live speaks for me.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:23.700
So I realize that after he
passed away in '87, when

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.290
we were going to the cemetery
and so many cars behind,

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.870
he has so much respect
from his community,

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.100
his family, his friends.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.090
That's when I learned let
the lives speaks for you.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.720
That means a lot.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.015
So that's my mission in
life, business, families,

00:17:43.015 --> 00:17:46.365
work, talking to you guys.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.740
I want to learn from you all,
you all have something good

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.840
about yourself.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.932
You should all adore yourselves.

00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:54.860
Never underestimate yourself.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:01.010
Because we all go-- and the key
in life is-- God bless America.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.380
America has every culture
you think of in this planet.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.460
So I have a blend.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.720
If you look in my
charts, my menu

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.475
says [INAUDIBLE], Jacob
Wonderbar, Ambrosia.

00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:21.350
It doesn't say espresso,
double shot, latte, cappuccino.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.780
You go everywhere,
latte, espresso, shot.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.270
We don't have that.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.110
We have names.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.140
Each one has a
story and it's real.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.500
My coffee has the
least possible acid.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.050
My coffee is stronger
than espresso.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.440
But like I said, there's
business for everybody.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.400
God bless them all.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.250
And I run my business in
10-- like in that Bible,

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.900
there's 10 commandments.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.626
I have 10 steps that I follow.

00:18:51.626 --> 00:18:56.840
And all my team in my
company, in our company--

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.820
or our fraternity, I call
it-- they have that symptoms.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.860
And they follow.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.850
The first one we must have
faith, love, and truth.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.550
And if you have a
business, you run it

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.760
in faith, love, and
truth, you have customers.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.250
Customers become your clientele.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.500
Number four, you must respect
them and treasure them.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.470
And that's [INAUDIBLE]
telling me wow, this is great.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:28.460
Because of my team members and
the quality of my clientele,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.160
number six is telling
me go and grow.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.150
Go open here.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.070
Go open in my district,
open in my city.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.600
And that's what happened.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.800
So number six is I took action.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.330
I act.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.420
Number seven, I organize.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.400
Number eight, I said
we need managers.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.800
It doesn't mean I get
recommended by someone

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.430
and he said, oh, Phil, that's
a good manager in Whole Foods,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.190
why didn't you give him a job.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.700
No.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:04.450
Managers is to me is when I
hire people from the basement

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.930
and they're working with me.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.990
And I see them as
doing great job.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.200
They conduct, they have
love, they are filled.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.230
They're not shy.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.320
They're relaxed.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.470
They're focused.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.460
they get up with good
thoughts, good mind.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.140
Do good that day,
you can't go wrong.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.685
If I see that, that guy deserves
to be the supervisor, shift

00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:26.250
leaders, or a manager.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.620
And of course I'm
going to pay him more.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.820
Because manager is big name
and he wants more money.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.160
So I have that already
planned for him.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.590
So I have my team
members growing with me.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.160
And we have excellent
people working for us.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.460
And the key is I trust them.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.620
I go to sleep like a baby.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.420
And don't even think twice.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.752
And if once in a while we have a
complaint-- because my business

00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:54.460
is like marriage.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.720
It's not perfect.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:02.970
But I want to tell
you something.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.290
My house marriage
is in the high 90s.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:10.070
And my business, in the
real high, high 90s.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.410
Because we not shy
from each other.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.510
We communicate.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.960
We talk.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.300
None of them, I walk
in, or the CEO walk in,

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.970
or Carolyn walk in,
or Faith walk in,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.560
or Greg walk in--
oh my god, they

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.500
here, what they have
under their sleeve.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.910
What they have up
their shoulder,

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.951
you know what I'm saying.

00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:31.000
We have none of that.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.630
We walk in, hi Phil, hi Carolyn.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.920
You know?

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.090
It's a great feeling.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.990
And I love what I do.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.550
I don't forget
where I came from.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.830
I put 200-300 miles
in my car every day,

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:47.450
I visit four-five
shops to see how can we

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.170
become better
tomorrow and do what

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.010
we do best, become excellent.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.470
Because people change,
companies change.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.820
But I want to guarantee
you, take this to the bank,

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.950
Philz Coffee tomorrow become
better at what we do best.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.180
And maybe we in it for life.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.790
We have love and passion for it.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.770
And we here to grow.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.810
Let's all grow together.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:17.210
And there is nothing I can't
do for my city, my counties.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.840
Every shop I go to,
that community, I

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.800
fit that community.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.740
I hire people from
that community.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.550
And we raise revenue, there's
taxes, put people to work,

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.130
less employment.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.360
We give them health,
we give them dental,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.570
we give them vision.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.690
I give them 401(k), I
give him opportunity

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.800
to invest in Philz Coffee.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.070
And it's delicious.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.850
I can't explain to
you how good it is.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.544
So I could talk for a year.

00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:50.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.421
I want to hand it to
Carolyn, thank you so much.

00:22:53.421 --> 00:22:59.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.610
CAROLYN FREY: Thank you, Phil.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.193
I think it'd be great to get a
show of hands of how many Philz

00:23:03.193 --> 00:23:05.894
fans we have in the room.

00:23:05.894 --> 00:23:06.662
Wow.

00:23:06.662 --> 00:23:09.120
So you'll probably give us some
good feedback across today.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.620
We want to save a lot of time
for questions and answers.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.940
And you all were great
about submitting questions

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.460
in advance.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.200
So what we want to do, one
of our biggest challenges

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.380
growing Philz coffee
in such a pure mission

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.520
is to bring on the right people
and to train them effectively.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.150
So we got a lot of questions
specific to our barista

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.410
training, barista, we
like to call them artists.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.154
We actually have some
of our team members

00:23:33.154 --> 00:23:34.070
here in the front row.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.580
They may be called
on to ask questions.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.996
But what we thought
is Faith could

00:23:36.996 --> 00:23:40.290
talk a little bit about
how we structure training.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:41.880
What does that
look like at Philz?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.585
And then we'll open
it up for questions.

00:23:43.585 --> 00:23:45.210
And hopefully, we'll
address everything

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.940
that was submitted in advance.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.270
FAITH SONGCO: So
thankful to be here.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.690
And excited to hear
your questions.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.332
I started at Philz
in April of 2015,

00:23:56.332 --> 00:23:58.640
so a little over a year ago.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.480
And it was six months
of finding out,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.070
aren't you a small
mom and pop shop?

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.280
And you want to
open a university?

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.520
And what does that mean?

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.920
And are you really
committed to investing

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.600
in your people in the way that
Jacob, when I'd spoken with him

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.910
had communicated with me.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.200
And so after talking with
him, and meeting the team,

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.375
and going to several shops--
Ferry Street, Middlefield

00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:31.880
in Palo Alto, which
is my favorite store,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.510
Cupertino, because obviously I
used to work for a tech company

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:40.800
near there-- visited all
the stores and I said, wow,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.570
is this for real?

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.410
Every single store,
whether in San Francisco

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:50.450
or in Sausalito or in
Cupertino felt the same

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.270
even though they were
drastically different in look.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.240
And so I was really
intrigued about well,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.630
is it in the hiring?

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.990
Or is it in the training?

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:02.270
Or what is it?

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:08.450
Like why are Philz people
so special and so kind?

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.710
And a lot of it has to do with
the people be hire, for sure.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.640
Hands down.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.760
There's definitely
a set of things

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.530
we look for which makes
training a lot easier.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.560
And it's really, really unique.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.130
And the types of
questions I think

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.730
we've been asking folks and
experiences for them to share

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.490
with us, I think one of my
favorite things that Phil says

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.920
is interviews are
a chance for you

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.830
to look at people in the eye and
really understand who they are.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.490
And so when we bring
these people on,

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:48.740
they go through a 15-day
training, or on boarding,

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.350
or orientation, however
you want to say it.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.860
But a lot of the
training is not formal.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.760
A lot of it really has
to do with being immersed

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.370
and-- I'm seeing nodding
heads here from our baristas.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.030
And so they can vouch for me.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.970
And a lot of it is just being
behind bar with your team.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.320
And in my job, we
have to figure out

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.840
what are the parts that
we engineer and design.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.400
And what are the
parts that you don't

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.020
want to engineer and
design away, right?

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.690
And I remember thinking, gosh,
like, there's so much happening

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.180
behind the bar and
there's so much

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.880
happening with this customer.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.870
But so much of it has to do
more with that person and how

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.010
they connect, and less about the
structure of how we do things.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.910
However, there's a very specific
way we do things at Philz.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.740
Every cup of coffee you have
is personalized to your taste.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.617
Which means you have to
really know and understand

00:26:45.617 --> 00:26:46.450
what a person wants.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.230
And you need to be able to
deliver it physically, right,

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.670
behind bar.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.040
So it's a great two
week experience.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.130
A lot of it has to do
with the relationship

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.170
you build behind bar.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.340
I would say another really
unique thing about training

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.760
is it levels the playing field.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.450
I am Leslie Knope, I
am a perfectionist.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.320
And when I got behind
bar I said this is hard.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.220
This is really, really
hard work in the sense of,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.300
like, you really care about
crafting something back there.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.970
But at the same time, you
remember that in the end,

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.090
people are here because
they want to see you.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.840
And they want to have
something delicious.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.730
And they want to treat
themselves, right?

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.130
So its a really
interesting mix between I

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.610
guess your left brain
and your right brain,

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.640
between your heart
and your science.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.290
And then ultimately,
the help behind the bar

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.490
is that's trading.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.754
Being vulnerable and
level setting of I

00:27:46.754 --> 00:27:48.170
don't know how to
do this, I don't

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.370
know how to make this
h-- how can you help me?

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.850
I think the team that
I trained with really

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.670
helped me out that week.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.750
And so now as people go
through Philz University,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.980
I stop by, I say hi.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.320
I say what day are you on?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.570
Because I can tell by where
they are in their training.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.850
And I tell them, if it wasn't
for the team standing next

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.100
to me, I wouldn't
know as much as I did.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.260
So a lot of really
interesting things

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.610
that actually began
with the training

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.280
even before I got there.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.820
I just have the luxury of really
understanding what that is

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:27.020
and making sure that we hold
to it no matter how big we get.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:30.602 --> 00:28:32.310
CAROLYN FREY: So maybe
we'll turn it over

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.960
to the audience for questions?

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.050
PHIL JABER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.091
CAROLYN FREY: Sure, yeah.

00:28:39.762 --> 00:28:41.970
PHIL JABER: She said everything
that I needed to say.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.606
But the training came in--
when we started doing it,

00:28:46.606 --> 00:28:47.860
Jacob was going to college.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.960
And the first day he
came to me, he said dad,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.960
I'm not going to go to college.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.616
I said uh-oh, getting
in trouble now.

00:28:54.616 --> 00:28:55.960
Your mom.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.620
You have two sisters, they
were educated, one is a doctor,

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.710
one double business major.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.940
Jacob, go talk to your
mother, don't talk to me.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:08.810
It took three months for the
family to agree with him.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.660
He came to me.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.380
But Jacob was well-trained when
he was four or five years old.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.020
I used to take him with me.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.500
I used to put a
milk box for him.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.240
And he was working in the cash.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.480
And he was approaching
the customer

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.580
like he's 20, 25 years old.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.420
Hi ma'am, how are you?

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.100
Anything else?

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.102
Even take them back to the car.

00:29:29.102 --> 00:29:31.060
And he used to look
straight in the eye to them

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.210
and say thank you.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.450
So he was well-trained.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.400
So when we decide to
open more and he agreed,

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.030
our family, to work
with me, I said Jacob,

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.960
we're going to open shops.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.540
He goes to me.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.840
Then I asked him, I said what
do you want out of Philz.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.750
You want to work, sweep
and mop, $6 an hour?

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.291
He goes no, dad.

00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:51.290
I said what do you want?

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.920
He said I want to grow.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.810
See, grow.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.000
What does that mean?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.770
He said like you trained me.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.330
You could go pick up
shops, open them up.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.370
I will train the people
the way you train them.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.830
And we open one, the
second, and third.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.950
As we opened shops, I
already have team for you

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.750
already trained to go to work
tomorrow in case you open.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.920
And that's what happened.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.550
So we had the training
well-trained before.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.118
So to work for me, I look
for three things in a person.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.620
The basics, the value, morals.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.500
He loves to work for
Philz, he loves coffee.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.390
He wants to work, he want
a job, go somewhere else.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.800
So when I meet
them for training,

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.150
I used to tell them my name
is Phil, what's your name?

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:44.060
Mr X, I want you to be calm,
settled, relaxed, focused,

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.810
be flexible.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.800
Don't be shy for me because you
have something I want from you.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.180
And I'm willing to train you.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.400
So when I ask you a
question, be honest with me.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.730
Because if I find out two, three
months later, the door is open.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.962
You leave by yourself.

00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:02.210
So we hire, you fire yourself.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.220
So we have a concept.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.550
So from day one, as we grow on.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:11.240
And as we grow, we
hire these fine ladies.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.400
And they know what we need.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.480
And Jacob knows what I want.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.040
Sometimes I don't bother,
I don't interfere.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.715
I go sit in meetings
sometimes, just sit and watch.

00:31:21.715 --> 00:31:26.600
So our job is
well-trained from day one.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.150
And like I said, tomorrow,
next week, next month,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.450
we become better at what we do.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.280
We simplify things.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.150
And you have to be
humble about it.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.060
You have to be
humble in business.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.430
And the key to success
is greed is disaster.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.840
Satisfy is success.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.950
That's what we aim
to and we're going

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.380
to become better than
[INAUDIBLE] than best to come.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.770
That's all I know.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.335
Thank you.

00:31:54.335 --> 00:31:59.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:59.295 --> 00:31:59.920
AUDIENCE 1: Hi.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.000
Thank you for coming.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.762
We really-- this is,
like, the most people

00:32:02.762 --> 00:32:04.220
I've ever seen in
comic-con before.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.261
So it's quite impressive.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.070
Sort of a silly
question, are there

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:14.020
any plans to sell the infamous
orange cup in Philz locations.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.800
I have a million people who
would purchase about a thousand

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.190
of them.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.605
The infamous orange cup.

00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:21.230
CAROLYN FREY: So I
can answer that one.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.470
No plans as of now.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.370
We're always open to
ideas and feedback.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.190
So don't be shy about
sending them along.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.190
So we'll take that back.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.390
I think one of the key
principles of how we operate

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.910
is never lose sight of the core.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.040
So merchandise is important.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.780
We want folks wearing
Philz t-shirts.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.600
But really, we've got
a lot on our plates.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.950
And it is very easy
to get distracted.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.020
So I think my answer
would be maybe.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.860
But right now, we
have so much work

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.550
to do to deliver our
mission, which is looking you

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.300
in the eye every day, and
delivering you exactly what you

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.370
want, and making you feel great
so you can go off and solve

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.410
the world's problems.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.150
Thank you.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.360
AUDIENCE 2: I am a huge fan.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.930
You've actually
ruined coffee for me

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.930
because now I can't
go anywhere else.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:08.030
My question to you is you said
every coffee made has a story.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.850
My favorite coffee
is Philtered Soul.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.000
Which is the story
behind Philtered Soul.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.760
PHIL JABER: I got a
big soul for coffee.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.736
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:23.084
Philtered Soul because this is
Phil, and I used that filtered.

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:24.000
And everything comes--

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:29.620
Philtered Soul, I made it like
a dessert, afternoon dessert.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.114
Like after dinner, you want a
piece of cake or cheesecake.

00:33:33.114 --> 00:33:37.600
So I made for like
a dessert drink.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.270
But it's a good drink.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.930
Especially if you mix
it with honey and cream.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.610
It's a very satisfied drink.

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.240
So Philtered Soul is like
you when you have life,

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.910
you have soul.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.630
AUDIENCE 3: I first
started drinking

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.990
Philz Coffee in Berkeley.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.060
My favorite blend is Tesora.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.380
I had a question, you mentioned
that greed is disaster.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.320
Over the past decade, many small
business owners in the Mission,

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.080
in San Francisco as a whole,
have struggled monetarily.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.040
Many have been forced
to sell their shops

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.730
and leave their homes.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.960
How do you start a
successful business yourself

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.000
in the mission?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.940
What is your advice to
small business owners

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.269
in light of these changes?

00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:23.393
How can they be successful?

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.840
See in business, you
can't be relaxed.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.770
You can't sit behind the
console, talk on the phone,

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.909
watching TV.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:40.739
You have to stand
erected to God.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.800
Have a smile, greet
the clientele,

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.520
have the right
products for them.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.300
Display, feature it
right, reasonable price.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.550
They all need help these days.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.130
Because a lot of people
are losing businesses.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:02.470
Because first and foremost,
their leases is out.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.430
Landlords wants more money.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.788
And they can't
afford the new rent.

00:35:08.788 --> 00:35:11.600
So they leave.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:17.620
Or they have businesses and
they teach people one or two--

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.490
not the right way, they go
outside, they give names.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.780
One become 10, 10 become
20, they stop going there.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.060
You have to be alert.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.310
Courtesy.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.460
And treat people right.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.960
And there's a lot of
big issues these days

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.710
with landlords and leases.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.689
They're not satisfied,
they're greedy.

00:35:42.689 --> 00:35:43.730
I just cannot understand.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.100
In the 80's, 70's,
80's, families

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.730
used to come and rent homes.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:57.400
And after a while, young
generation, single,

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.260
they come to rent.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.640
Share.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.330
Then all of a sudden, people
rent four bedroom house

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.500
or three bedroom house and
they share with their friends

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.320
so they could afford
to pay the rent.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.950
I just wonder how
they could afford

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:16.570
the one-bedroom apartment in
the Mission for $4,200 a month.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.410
And the kitchen is like 1960.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:25.110
So that's what we
have in these days.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.760
Either too much wealth up
there from young generation.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.060
Either they earn it from
grandparents or parents,

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.590
pass away, left it for
them and they have so much.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.440
They have no conscience.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.740
I don't know who they're
trying to impress.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.140
But we have issue
in that department.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.890
And I don't know.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.750
This is me personally I went
through four-five cycles of up

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.390
and down.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.730
I see the next cycle is
going to be the worst we ever

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.030
had in our life history.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.820
Because our young
generation don't know

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.700
how to struggle to sacrifice.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.690
And I see that coming.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.880
Society change.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.350
Cycle change, business change.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:14.910
Numbers change.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:17.530
You know, long time ago,
$40,000 was lot of money.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.360
Now it's like $0.05.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.900
All businesses must pay
attention to their customers.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.620
I see a lot of big
companies like Macy's, GAP,

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.720
all these closing.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.280
I don't know why.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.580
But something's happening.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.140
Because maybe Amazon
has taken over.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.230
Go ahead.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.980
CAROLYN FREY: I think
just to add to that.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.370
I mean, we don't take a single
relationship for granted.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.350
And our relationship with our
customers and team members

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.270
is our focus.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.720
But Phil really leads
the way in carrying that

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.440
through how we do business.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.440
And yes, you could argue we're
growing to a bigger company.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.686
And we're not the small
corner store in the Mission.

00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:53.060
But one of the things I think
that's so unique that still

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.080
happens is Phil and his son
Jacob meet every landlord

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.860
that we do business with.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.230
And that goes through to
every single partner we

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.800
have at Philz to our
outside investments,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.940
to a vendor that provides,
helps us with napkins.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.960
That we look them in
the eye and we really

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.750
understand who
they are as people.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.810
And do they align
with our values.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.430
And I think that's one of
the unique things I would say

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.820
and the advice I'd give
to other businesses,

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.890
is focus on what's important.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.690
And make sure you have
those relationships.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:26.520
You understand.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.770
Because when times
get tough, those

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.905
are the things that are
going to carry you through.

00:38:30.905 --> 00:38:32.030
PHIL JABER: One more thing.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:40.510
Like you saying, lot of
people closing, landlord,

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.220
leases stuff like that.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.610
Businesses take
care of business.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.810
What happened to us is
every shop that I get either

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.750
through a broker or
developer or real estate,

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.310
I must meet the owner.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.645
If I don't meet
the owner, no deal.

00:38:57.645 --> 00:39:00.480
So I meet the owners,
if we come eye

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.550
to eye-- that's why I told you,
business the old fashioned way

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:08.520
is the best-- if
we meet eye to eye,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.960
we understand each other,
whatever we do for each other,

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.160
we can't go wrong.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.890
And a handshake, sometimes
I twist my mustache

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.310
like my grandpa.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:20.910
This is my contract.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.480
But I make sure my
daughter, tomorrow-- she

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.510
is the master agent for me.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:31.210
Besise we have real estate,
[? VIB, ?] she'll send him LOI.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.500
The American way, we do
business the American way.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.060
And let's say my option is off.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.750
Which is I have many
shops, options, expired.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.890
Phone call is done.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.640
We didn't have to
go see lawyers.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.810
Spend more money.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.420
So the key is we
must meet owners.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.020
Because it's like marriage.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.900
I want to be with you for life.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.030
We write leases, options.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.530
But in the meantime,
he knows me and him,

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.930
we're going to be
cemented for life.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:08.810
Because when I go to a
special place, open a shop,

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.169
God bless what he had.

00:40:12.169 --> 00:40:13.960
There's many people
like him own buildings,

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.830
have money, developers.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.660
But I tell him, there's
only one Philz Coffee.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.330
And you can't buy that twice.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:23.510
So when I come to your
building, I'll put in the map,

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.720
I desire people to come
to shop for my corner,

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.220
I enhance all of the
businesses around me.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.279
Because I don't sell
salads, sandwiches, food.

00:40:31.279 --> 00:40:32.695
People-- coffee--
they want salad,

00:40:32.695 --> 00:40:34.140
they go across the street.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.900
Slice of pizza, whatever.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.930
So I enhance all the businesses.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.860
Plus I raise his property value.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.940
And I have over 37--
no, maybe 33 landlords,

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.910
some of them I have a couple
buildings with, they call me

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.700
brother Phil, which
building you like,

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.540
I go buy for you to open shop.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.250
I'm serious.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.040
That's what happened to us.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.460
I went to Austin, Texas.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.240
I just came back last week.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.950
We saw 10 locations.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.950
One location I like where
Google companies go in them.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.050
High rise building.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.570
I told them, I want
the bottom shop.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.060
I want to be in Google building.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.140
You see.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.910
I met the owner and
we like each other.

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:19.560
So that's how things work.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.740
Do the right thing.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.376
Be straight and honest.

00:41:23.376 --> 00:41:26.510
All my landlords love us.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.260
So I don't know about
other businesses,

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.660
how they treat their landlords.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.790
I never call them,
I have problems.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:33.820
Landlords like that.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.090
So we are flower clientele.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.290
No weeds.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.896
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:41.020
AUDIENCE 4: Phil, how do
you think about expansion?

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.790
Your son said
aspirations may lead

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.247
to several thousand stores.

00:41:45.247 --> 00:41:47.080
Do you expect it to
happen in the next year?

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.590
In the next 20 years?

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.200
And what challenge do you
foresee to get you there?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.730
Is it high rent prices?

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.724
Or other factors?

00:41:54.724 --> 00:41:56.640
CAROLYN FREY: I'll take
the first stab at that

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.639
and we'll see-- we'll
compare answers with Phil.

00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:00.940
I mean, I think, again, think
about our mission, which

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.490
is authenticity, quality.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.070
And it's pretty
easy for companies

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.069
to go out there and
open 1,000 stores.

00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:08.860
There are a lot of
companies in our history

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.160
that have done that.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.180
What's most important
to us is to do it right.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.730
And to be welcomed by the
community that we're in.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.780
We're creating community.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.020
Our mission is warmth
and connection.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.100
So we don't want to ever impose
ourselves on a community.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.320
And we want to do it--
so it comes down to one--

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.400
a real estate.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.680
We want the right real
estate, the right location,

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.070
the right community that
we're going to be successful.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.570
We feel like for a reasonable
degree of likelihood,

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.250
we can hire amazing
team members.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.000
And that we can do
it the right way.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.910
And so for us today, that's
been one store at a time.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.730
One customer at a time.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.420
One market at a time.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.390
And I think as we get
better at that, we

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.770
will start to accelerate.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.420
And our vision is 1,000 stores.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.240
I don't think we'll get
there in the next five years.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.960
But we could.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.450
It all is kind of
contingent on do

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.900
we find the right people
in the right places.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.030
And are we welcome
by that community?

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.860
Because we never
want to-- we never

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.250
want to overstep and
start to feel like,

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:14.230
oh, we're that corporate company
imposing Philz on communities.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:18.240
PHIL JABER: You see,
ask me-- our shop,

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.050
one shop is like 1,000 shops.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.492
That's how we treat our shops.

00:43:23.492 --> 00:43:24.580
I would open everywhere.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.085
Because one time
a guy said Phil,

00:43:27.085 --> 00:43:28.560
why you going to Washington DC?

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.480
Different market, different
animals, different people.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.090
I said I don't know until I
go take a visit, my friend.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.440
He said why you like Washington?

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.650
I said because it's
small like San Francisco.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.230
Six miles by six miles.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.960
OK?

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.210
Let me go find out and compare.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.520
So we flew.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.901
We look at locations.

00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:49.150
Second day, I sign two leases.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.140
And I get up in the
morning, 4:00, 5:00 o'clock.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.500
I walk two blocks.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.415
There's any shops open, I
walk and see how they talk,

00:44:01.415 --> 00:44:04.030
how they conduct.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.350
See, anywhere I go, I'm relaxed.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.250
I fear no one.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.960
I no go, look around,
oh, this is not my city.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.430
I feel like it's my
city anywhere I go.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.760
So I walk around like a
zigzag, see the merchant.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.915
8:00, 9:00 o'clock, I go
back to that location.

00:44:17.915 --> 00:44:21.271
And I look up, I see
God looking over me.

00:44:21.271 --> 00:44:23.020
I said this is the
place I'm going to get.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.890
So let's move down.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:27.050
So I got two places.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:28.314
So I came back.

00:44:28.314 --> 00:44:29.980
Two weeks later, my
friend called me up,

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.090
he said oh, what
happened to Washington?

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.104
I said I signed two
leases, ready to open.

00:44:36.104 --> 00:44:37.520
He said I told you
it's different.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.350
I said there's no
different, my friend.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.840
People sleep, eat,
work, go out, enjoy.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.290
Same thing as here, my friend.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.300
Even, you know what?

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.390
The smartest people in the
world work in Washington.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:51.220
They're running the world.

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.384
So I opened two shops.

00:44:53.384 --> 00:44:57.300
I find out Philz Coffee could
go anywhere in the planet.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.920
Open even in the
mountain, camping.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.630
Build a tent.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:04.580
People will come
camping for the weekend.

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:10.370
So the only reason I find out
is I could go anywhere, it's

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.200
all about destination.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.400
And everything is
[? shifted ?] in this country.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.580
There's no different.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.290
So we're going to open shops.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:22.350
Next year, maybe
a few, six more?

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.570
Next year, maybe 15 to 20?

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.580
We're not hurried.

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.630
We're still young,
we're still babies.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.390
We're not going nowhere.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:32.900
Like I told you, music is
for life, coffee is for life.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.620
So like Carolyn said, we
hire the finest people

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.720
who have basics,
values, morals, respect.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.670
They love to work.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.160
I like their knowledge, but
they have to follow our concept.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.550
Because I'm completely different
than anybody in this planet.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.550
I'll make it easier for you.

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.740
I spent 25 years.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.660
People spend 10 years,
12 years, colleges.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.240
I spent 25 years.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.200
We have it all written down
for hundred years from now.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.000
I have vision, I
have the plan here.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.910
I drew it in my head,
how it's going to be.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.270
And it's working.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.700
It's working because I have
a good, excellent team.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.330
People, culture.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:14.695
And like I said,
doesn't get hard.

00:46:14.695 --> 00:46:15.900
It gets easy for us.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.220
Hard for somebody else.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.340
We are simplifying things.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.860
And things, if it
work, we don't change.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.540
But we are humble.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.230
We like to listen
to people opinion.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:31.640
And we go back to our
mind, we make decision.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.740
And good people.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:39.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.280
AUDIENCE 5: Thank you
guys for coming today.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.610
I had two supply
chain questions.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:49.360
So the first is Philz used to
be a big favorite here at Google

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.300
in our local micro kitchens.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.760
And I guess we no
longer stock Philz

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.080
because we don't have a ton of
insight into the supply chain.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.800
So I was wondering
between Google and Philz,

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.880
is there a way that we
could bridge that gap?

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.910
PHIL JABER: Oh, you could do
that yesterday, my friend.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:07.150
No problem.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.983
AUDIENCE 5: I can't.

00:47:07.983 --> 00:47:08.550
I can't.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.430
PHIL JABER: But
you see, maybe they

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.370
changed the marketing
guy, or the food guy,

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.420
or the guy who buys
things, maybe he

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.380
has [? friends ?] other places.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.470
We don't deal like this.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.770
We deal quality, service.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.130
I want to be cemented
with you for life.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.250
I'm not after money.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.624
I want to give you quality.

00:47:23.624 --> 00:47:25.040
When you drink
that cup of coffee,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.830
put a smile in your face.

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:29.850
You might take another one
to your office for later on.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.910
So if you could
make it happen, I'd

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.589
like to have a coffee
shop right here.

00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:37.630
AUDIENCE 5: Sounds great.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.561
PHIL JABER: I don't need much.

00:47:39.561 --> 00:47:41.060
CAROLYN FREY: Yeah,
Greg [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.726
who runs our wholesale
business is here.

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:45.614
He just had his first child, so
he's a little sleep deprived.

00:47:45.614 --> 00:47:46.530
But wanted to be here.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.149
And partly-- I mean-- I don't
know the reasons behind it,

00:47:49.149 --> 00:47:51.440
but that's one of the things
we're actively working on.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.200
Because we're a company
of transparency.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.880
And so our relationship
all the way back

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.630
to the farmer and that
coffee bean is so important.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.660
So I feel pretty confident
without knowing the details

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.560
that we've probably come a long
way since that conversation.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.000
And I think if
anyone in this room

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.007
can help us bridge that
gap, we are all ears.

00:48:08.007 --> 00:48:10.340
AUDIENCE 5: You know is there
anybody here from the food

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.510
team that could talk to Greg?

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.060
CAROLYN FREY: Greg.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.536
Greg!

00:48:16.536 --> 00:48:18.660
GREG AHLBACH: Yeah, we
always kind of view business

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.870
as a conversation.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.570
And would love to open
up that conversation.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.010
The thing about our blends
is they're a family secret.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:27.316
The people that are
roasting the coffee

00:48:27.316 --> 00:48:28.440
know what they're sourcing.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.856
But the people
blending the coffee

00:48:29.856 --> 00:48:33.520
don't The only two people
that know are Phil and Jacob.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.267
But with that being that we
want to have a conversation,

00:48:37.267 --> 00:48:38.350
we can discuss some stuff.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.970
And find out kind
of a happy medium.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:42.400
But we would love to
work with you again.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.530
I mean it was a pleasure working
with you for three plus years,

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:46.920
I think it was.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.200
And it was very sad
for us to see you go.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.120
And we highly value our
relationship with you.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.762
So let's talk.

00:48:54.762 --> 00:48:55.470
AUDIENCE 5: Yeah.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.300
And my second question
was how many people

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.646
know the secret sauce.

00:48:59.646 --> 00:49:00.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.540
CAROLYN FREY: Yeah, I think
just to drill into that.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.510
I mean, our blend's our secret.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.897
And so we have an entire
supply chain operation,

00:49:05.897 --> 00:49:07.230
our roasting plant's in Oakland.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.510
And we have half a team
that knows half the recipe.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.190
And we know another half of the
team that knows the other half.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:16.190
And this guy here and his son,
Jacob are the only two people--

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.930
and there's a lot of ways that
food engineers and scientists

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.290
could probably reverse engineer.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.090
But part of it is it's
culture, it's trust.

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:27.110
That's the mystique and
the beauty of Philz.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:31.287
So it's just-- and we call that
working in the curtain method.

00:49:31.287 --> 00:49:32.870
And it adds quite a
bit of complexity,

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:36.029
but our team values it.

00:49:36.029 --> 00:49:38.320
AUDIENCE 6: When you first
started the coffee shop back

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.120
in '03, what kind of challenges
were you facing when you

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.529
started this up in the Mission?

00:49:42.529 --> 00:49:43.570
PHIL JABER: No challenge.

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.690
Because I've been there for
35 years, I build the name.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.900
You see, I chose San Francisco
when I was 13 years old.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.060
Because seven miles
by seven miles.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:55.480
If you do business the
right way in the community,

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.970
you become a community guy.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:01.040
You help out with so little
we have-- I have a good name,

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.240
reputation.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.550
And during that time, I
was working on coffee.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:06.620
So when I conquered
my reputation,

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.630
I said now I'm going
to do my coffee.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.140
See, it's not--
to own a business,

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.450
you have to be a good man,
a family man, honest man.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.950
We're recommended under
good term, good report

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.914
from the community, the people.

00:50:19.914 --> 00:50:20.830
And the city is small.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:22.500
So my name was all over.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.240
Like perfume, Joe Malone.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:29.000
I have no challenges.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.920
I am my own-- I am
my own competition.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.630
I have no competition.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.800
I no pay attention to
other coffee businesses,

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.270
people they have coffee shops.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:39.520
But I tell you, all
these business people,

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.675
they wish to capture clientele
like us, like you guys.

00:50:43.675 --> 00:50:46.600
They having a hard time.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.190
So mine comes from you guys.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.960
Because you guys give us name.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.460
You guys, you all
have class and taste,

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.410
you know where the quality is.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:58.340
And not I'm telling you
this just to say it.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.740
It's for sure.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.010
We have quality.

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:02.820
And my beans, I
used to count them

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.830
like a pharmacy, one at a time.

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:08.410
I spent lot of years on that.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:12.290
So we different, how
we run our business,

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:14.650
by culture, the people.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:17.060
Make your day a better day,
put a smile in your face

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:21.160
as you walking out from
my shop or go sit in my--

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.804
I was the first guy to
put community table.

00:51:23.804 --> 00:51:25.220
Because this young
generation when

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.242
they move to the city
they share rooms,

00:51:27.242 --> 00:51:28.450
they have no community table.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:30.340
They share bathrooms, showers.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.150
So Philz Coffee become
your community tables.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.620
I have so many people met and
they get married in my shops.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.500
That the first time in
the history of the US

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.870
ever happened.

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:43.550
That's something to be proud of.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.430
That's mean you
have something good.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:46.800
And we in it for life.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.850
Best to come.

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.900
So I'm talking about Google.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.070
You guys were my first customers
when I open in Middlefield.

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.010
I used to deliver
the [? brothers ?]

00:51:56.010 --> 00:52:00.560
to the warehouse-- what's the
other building, a little bit

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.450
closer north?

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:05.842
Mountain View.

00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:07.300
I used to deliver
to the warehouse,

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.560
they used to have eight
different companies.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.160
All of a sudden only three.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.140
And what happened between us
and you, it's not from our side.

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.710
It's from your leadership.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.800
Or all you need to
do now, all of you,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.950
send an email to the
master, and tel them

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:27.230
what you have done to us.

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.978
Bring Philz Coffee back.

00:52:28.978 --> 00:52:30.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:30.034 --> 00:52:31.700
PRESENTER 1: Thank
you, thank you again.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.680
Let's give another
round of applause.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.230
[APPLAUSE]
