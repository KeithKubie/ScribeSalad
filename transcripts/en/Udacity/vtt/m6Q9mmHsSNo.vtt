00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.060
In this lesson,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.210
we learned about constructing your UI
out of tangible material surfaces.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.700
We learned how surface arrangement and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.785
layering can make UIs
easier to understand.

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:13.900
&gt;&gt; We discussed how to determine which
actions should be highlighted in a FAB

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.590
and how to have surfaces
react to touch and scrolling.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.370
&gt;&gt; In the sample app, we put these
concepts into practice with code.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.380
In lesson three we'll start thinking
about the content of those surfaces.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.080
The ink on our digital sheets of paper.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.680
Stay tuned.
