00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.794
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to momentarily make these problems at the bottom small and just

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.621
show you the answers to the first three. Then we'll move onto the last two

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.750
later. So here's the work and the answers for the first three problems. We have

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.530
x is less than negative 3, x is greater than or equal to negative 2, and x is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.361
greater than three. Of course with this last one, we started out with x on the

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:23.015
right side of the equation, and some people prefer to put the variable on the

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:26.732
left side in the answer. So if you want to follow that convention, then to get x

00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:30.437
onto the left side, you also need to flip the inequality so that it's facing the

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:34.681
opposite direction. Saying that 3 is less than x is also the same as saying, x

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:39.552
is greater than 3. And now moving on to our last two problems. And after several

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:45.143
steps we end up with x is greater than or equal to 4 and x is greater than 4.
