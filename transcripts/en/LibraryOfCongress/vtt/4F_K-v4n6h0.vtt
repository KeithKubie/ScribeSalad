00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.690
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello: So
good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.990
I'm Dan Turello.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.650
I'm a staff of the Kluge Center.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.550
And before we begin,
I want to remind you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.460
that we are filming
today's event for placement

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.980
on the library's iTunes
and YouTube channel.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.620
And please silence your
cellphones and any other device

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.170
that might interfere
with the lecture.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.530
This has been a week of
David Bordwell events

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.520
which started last Wednesday with
a visit to the cool Packard Campus,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.910
which houses the library's National
Audio Visual Conservation Center.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.230
And there were lots of amazing
things about this visit.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.530
It was a really superb day.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.400 position:56%
But one of the things that stuck
with me was witnessing the dialogue.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.440
Everyone on the technical
staff was very familiar

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.450
and had engaged with David's work.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.740
And it was inspiring to see this
dialogue between film history

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.910
and active film conservation.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.410
And then last Monday,
David hosted James Schamus,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.210
who was down from New York City.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.000
He screened his film
"Indignation," which was adopted

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.840
from a Philip Roth novel and
it was a fantastic discussion

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.370
following that.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.800
And that brings us to today.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.400
And it's a bit of a better
sweet occasion because it's--

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.770
it marks David's conclusion of
his time here at the Kluge Center

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.000
as the Kluge Chair
in Modern Culture.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.960
The Chair in modern culture is one
of the five original Kluge Chairs.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.740
The Chair holder typically focuses
on modern arts and the media

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.280
and their impact on
societal development.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.470
And David has simply been a
superb chair in every way.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.820
I'll give you a brief run down
on his distinguished work.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.900
But before that, I think I could
tell you everything I needed

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.890
to tell you by remembering that
he arrived at the Kluge Center

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.500
on the first day and was
wearing a sed [phonetic] jacket

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.220
from the Quentin Tarantino
Inglourious Basterds.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.600
So on a scale, if there is a
cool scale from zero to 10,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.180
David is consistently a 12.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.840
And it's been a real pleasure
and honor to have him here.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.070 position:56%
In terms of a more formal
introduction, rendition of his work,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.660
he is the Jacques Ledoux
Professor of Film Studies,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.190
Emeritus at the University
of Wisconsin, Madison.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.000
He has written on all manner of
subject matter related to film.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.810
Some of his titles include The
Classical Hollywood Cinema:

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.070
Film Style &amp; Mode of Production,
Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.940
The Cinema of Eisenstein, On
The History of Film Style,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.990
Planet Hong Kong: Popular Cinema
and the Art of Entertainment.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.170
So you see his range is broad.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.860
Perhaps the book that he's most
well-known for is Film Art:

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.080
An Introduction, which has
been reprinted numerous times

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.460
and has made its way into
most syllabi of film schools

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.000
around the country
and around the world.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.820
Here at the Kluge Center, he has
been drawing on the resources

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.080
of The Motion Picture Broadcasting
and Recorded Sound Division.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.080
And today's talk comes from
this research and it is titled,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.450
"Studying early Hollywood: The
Search for a Storytelling Style."

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.510
Please join me in welcoming David.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.230
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.350
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: Thank you.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.120 position:56%
Thanks to so many of the people
I've seen, my colleagues and friends

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.600
at the Kluge Center and at The
Motion Picture Broadcasting

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.180
and Recorded Sound
Division for showing up.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.550
I'm very pleased to
see you all here.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.850
It is based on my research here.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.320
And I have many people to
thank but that's for later.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.120 position:56%
For now, I just want to sketch out
a little bit of what I've been doing

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.840
over the last two and a half
months in hopes of persuading you

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.460
that it's interesting or
even might be important.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.480 position:56%
The larger project is indeed the one
called The Art of Cinema, 1908-1920

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.720
and I hope to convince you that
that's a good focus because I think

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.780 position:56%
in a way, the modern cinema and the
classic cinema begin in that period.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.270
My focus was also on stylistics,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.220
the way movies are using the
medium to tell their stories.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.860
And I've focused particularly
on the period

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.160
because I couldn't do everything.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.850
I decided to simply deep-dive into
the period, 1914 to about 1918,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.970
which coincided with
the war, of course,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.400
but I was not really concerned
to relate it directly to the war.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.200
We can talk about that if
you want because I know many

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.590
of you are interested in that
period and its relationship--

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.770
the relationship of the
war to culture at the time.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.070
So let me start.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.370
Let's take a case.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.670
Let's take a case.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.060
How are you going to show on
film face-to-face encounters,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.980
two people having a
conversation was one another?

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.280
Well, here's an example.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.370
From Hidden Figures, a recent
film you might have seen,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.860
where the computer, as she's
called, faces off against the boss

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.480
of the NASA agency
she's working for.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.960
And instead of playing out
that scene in the entirety

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.220
of that long two-shot, we
get a cut to her speaking--

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.730
explaining why she takes
so long-- such long breaks.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.260
And then, we have another cut
to him looking at her answering

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.370
and speaking to her, asking
her further questions,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.480
and then we have a
shot of her again.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.930
And I'd point out to
you that the shot

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.500
of her isn't the same
one we had before.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.760
It's a different framing
or much closer to her.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.410
Now, this may seem no news.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.710
This seems very natural.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.370
In fact, you might ask, how else
would you film a face-to-face

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.200
encounter except by setting it up
and then singling out each person

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040
in turn as they take
turns in the conversation?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.340
Well, it goes back.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.690
We go back to hundred years from
2016 to 1916, Reginald Barker,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.570
the man you saw at the
beginning in my first slide,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.140
handled it much the same way.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.080
We have our master shot, not
in the wide screen like we have

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.870
with Hidden Figures, but that's
a more recent development.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.520
Master shot of the two people
engaged in conversation,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.950 position:56%
more than a conversation, a cut to
her reacting, a cut to him reacting.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.710
And then another shot of
her, closer, just as we had

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.010
in Hidden Figures,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.550
sort of intensifying our
attention on her reaction.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.080
So, you think again.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.890
So what, how else would
you film a conversation?

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.920
Well, it turns out that if
you assume cinema is invented

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.950
around 1895, it takes
about 20 years for people

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.460
to figure out how to do this.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.040 position:56%
It would seem to be the most natural
spontaneous thing in the world.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.410
And yet, it takes a
long time for filmmakers

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.590
to adopt this particular manner

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.270
of representing these
face-to-face encounters.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.050
Before that, things were shot
very differently, long shots,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.410
distant shots, long-held
shots as in The Passion

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.490
of the Christ, the
early Lumiere film.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.950
And then 10 years later,
Accidents Will Happen.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:13.070
You see it's very flat,
very distant and no cutting.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.010
Filmmakers start in the [inaudible]
to mount more complicated scenes

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.070
than the examples I'd just given
you, but they don't use editing.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.030
Now, one of the points of
using that example of the--

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.390
of Hidden Figures and
Vain Desires is

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.710
that it guides your
attention, doesn't it?

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.690
Those shots, those cuts point you
to what's important in the scene.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.240
But a scene like Ready Money or
the scene of The Sign of the Cross,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.590
it just seems to be
dumping everything in.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.690
It seems to be a kind of mess.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.070
So the question is, what would
make anyone think that this,

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.350
for 20 years, is preferable
to this cleaner,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.110
neater more efficiently
way of lining things up.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.410
So, my tasks today are these.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.290
I want to sketch the filmmaking
context of that period,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.190
to suggest the circumstances
that would lead to people,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.420
intelligent people like ourselves,
to make that kind of choice.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.330
I'd like to consider how the
trend toward editing got going.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.930
And then I'll try to
consider an alternative style

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.310
which actually was the
loser in that battle.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.250
And then I'll sketch some
causes very briefly at the end,

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.680
some causes for the
developments that we see.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.520
So let me start with
the period, the context.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.760
This is an important period,
as I said at the outset,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.350
because it's really the emergence
of many dimensions of filmmaking.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.010
First, the business of
film, film industries.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.860
You start to get the consolidation
of the international film business

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.230
around World War I, the
creation or revamping or decline

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.190 position:56%
of major European firms like Nordisk
in Denmark, Film d' art in France,

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.900
Svensk Filmindustri of Sweden.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.460
And especially important
for our purposes is the fact

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.010
that at this point, we
start to see the birth

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.600
of Hollywood in that period.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.300 position:56%
The major studios which are still
with us today, Loew's or Metro, Fox,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.680
Paramount, Universal,
Goldwyn, United Artists,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.010
and the very tailend
around 1920, Columbia.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.640
All these studios are really
started in one form or another,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.650
sometimes pretty crude as business
enterprises in this period.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.340
So the market film industry
is about 100 years old.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.690 position:56%
We also had many important artists--

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.390
film artists working in
those industries, Urban Gad,

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.460
Gallone in Italy, Feuillade,
Gance, Griffith,

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.500 position:56%
of course everybody knows that name.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.000
Mack Sennett, Cecil B.
DeMille, Thomas Ince,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.200
Charlie Chaplin, again,
very familiar.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.570
These are the people whose
careers start in that window.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.780
At the same time, the
industry is starting

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.620
to show us what movies
can be like in exhibition.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.380
We had the emergence of what we
might call our movie theatres.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.780
Early on, legitimate theatres were
converted for film screenings.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.990 position:56%
This is after the period before 1908
where films are shown in carnivals,

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.540
in small storefronts, so-called
Nickelodeons and so on.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.480
But around this period of
1908, we have purpose-built--

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.120
or purpose-rebuilt film theatres.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.010
And especially with the
rise of the feature film.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.570
The feature film was
a film initially

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.870
that simply could be featured.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.780
You could advertise it that
people would come by name rather

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.640
than simply treating
it like YouTube.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.940
You just turn it on and what--

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.980
you walk in or whatever
is playing is playing.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.280
A feature film is originally
just one

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.180
that could be advertised by title.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.710
But later, this so-called feature
film was as we know it today,

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.740
is a long movie, is a separate
long movie as opposed to a short.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.040
The length might vary.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.890
It might be a two-reeler, a
three-reeler, or a four-reeler

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.040
and gets standardized around the
mid themes at about five reels

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.980
or about an hour and
10 minutes or so.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.470
Seven minute though, but that
could be a little bit less.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.580
So the feature comes in, and
that reinforces the growth

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.570
of these movie theaters, these
purpose-built movie houses.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.070
So let's go to Wisconsin
for a while.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.770
I don't recommend it all the
time, but let's do it now.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.950
Let's go with the Baraboo,
Wisconsin, 1916.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.380
If you went to see a movie
in Baraboo, Wisconsin,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.700
you go to the Gem Theatre
and it's a movie house.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.990 position:56%
It's not that different from a movie
house in the town you grew up in.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.810
It's rather different from a
multiplex as they are today,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.320
but a single screen
theatre, you go in,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.780
you pay your money,
you watch a few movies.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.080
More elaborately, still
in Wisconsin,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.230
and this is why I really do
wish for a time machine, 1916,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.280
the Butterfly Theatre in Milwaukee.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.600
This is one gorgeous look
in movie theatre, isn't it?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.560
This is not even yet
a picture palace.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.900
There isn't that huge inside, but
it's magnificent on the outside.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.550
I'd go there today if I
could, no more, of course.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.960
But this gives you a sense of the
scale of the American film industry

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.140
at this period, with--
exhibitors can actually invest

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.490
in a venue like this.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.540
OK, not just in Wisconsin, the
American Cosmograph Theatre

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.460
in Cairo is a very
impressive theatre.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.020
And, of course, the Palads
Teatret, which is about the size

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.900
of a train station in
Copenhagen in 1912.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.130
Movies are now big business.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.990
Thousands and thousands of people
want to see them around the world.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.840
Reflecting the same
thing is the emergence

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.540
of a culture around movies.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.510
In fact, all the things now, we
think of as part of, you know,

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.400
movie buzz, the movie world being
a standard file, start that.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.230
You have the rise of film
culture as the film press.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.080
In France, for instance,
the Cine-journal,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.910
and several other journals and you
have major critics and theorists

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.220
of cinema emerging in
France at this period.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.670
Same as through in other countries.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.100
In the USA, you'd start
to have trade papers,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.910
newspapers devoted just to the film
business, Moving Picture World,

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.660
Photoplay, and you'll have
critics and theorists here too,

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.790
most famously I suppose,
Hugo Munsterberg.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.500
And just a look at Photoplay from
the period, with Pearl White,

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.700
a charmer that she is,
it's not that different.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.370
It's not that different.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.870
Same kind of culture, same kind
of buzz in this whole churn

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.910
of entertainment, infotainment
is there in the beginning.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.700
I want to focus on something else.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.880
The way that movies behave, the
look, I can't say sound of movies

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.930
at the time, and I believe
the true foundations

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.500
for the way movies behave
now were laid down then.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.600
Artistically, you've got the
emergence of certain kinds

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.280
of appeals and forms,
for instance, stars.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.560
This is the beginning of the
star system in this period.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.970
This does in years, 13 years,
Asta Nielsen, Charlie Chaplin,

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.220
William S. Hart, Mary Pickford,
and so on and so forth.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.500
The genres that we still have today
are formulated at this period.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.540
Detective films, societies,
melodramas, horror.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.840
They're all there.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.000
So even science fiction is there.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.240
The formats, as I've mentioned,
the multiple-reel film,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.760
the idea that a reel movie is at
least an hour and 10 minutes long.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.340
And the dramaturgy, the
structuring of stories.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.830
The thing is when you have a
longer film like a feature,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.280
how do you complicate it?

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.410
How do you tell a story
that lasts 50 or 60 minutes?

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.950
Kind of between a novel and a short
story, how do you fill that out

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.680
with an interesting plot that
will keep people interested?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.600
Well, my argument is this.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.600
Because of this immense growth
in audiences and film culture,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.980
and the development of the long
film, there's a pressure to develop

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.930
to use the medium in ways, to use
film, staging, shooting, cutting,

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.680 position:56%
performance, in ways that are suited

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.750
to telling these more
lengthy and complex stories.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.220
So, a couple of trends develop.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.180
I'm being schematic here for
the purposes of exposition,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.740
but I think this is
pretty much true.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.470
On the one hand, filmmakers decide
the thing we've seen already.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.130
The option that we mentioned, we
cut the scene up as John Ford does

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.770
for instance, in straight shooting.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.070
You're going to have a western.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.500
You're going to have a
showdown with western.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.230 position:56%
Big close ups of the two guys facing
each other down on the city street,

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.090
just like [inaudible] would, just
the way what Clint Eastwood would,

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.100
the same, the editing option.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.330
The other option is to do
things a little differently.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.730
You do it through staging.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.900
Instead of cutting the scene
up, you move your actors

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.470
around the frame in
various patterns.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.770
That's the loser.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:11.850
There are many options, or many
tasks that you need to fulfill

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.030
if you're going to use
film to tell stories.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.730
You have to engage the
audience emotionally.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.200
You have to find ways to align
them with characters and so on.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.500
There are many different things.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.800
I'm just going to focus on one,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.950
which is kind of a
precondition for all the others.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:29.800 position:56%
And that is directing the audience's
attention to follow a story on stage

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.210
in a novel, wherever, in a ballet,

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.650
whatever narrative form
you're talking about.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.970
The attention of the
audience has to be focused

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.240
on particular items
of, in the array.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.470
So the question is given film,
how do you focus attention?

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.700
Well, editing offers the choice.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.000
Editing says, here's how you do it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.610
You cut the scenes up.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.120
You either cut them by
showing two events or more,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.690
taking place at roughly the same
time, and you switch from one

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.510
to the other, so-called
crosscutting.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:03.010
As The Birth of a Nation is in
Birth of a Nation with Griffith,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.150
while Lillian Gish is
besieged in this parlor,

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.260
the Ku Klux Clan is
riding to her rescue,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.560
back and forth, back and forth.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.740
And then so, the eyes
are like pointed up,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.210
novels did this all the time.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.680
This is not-- This is
simply a straightforward,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.030
but kind of intensifying and
focusing of what novels have done

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.910
in terms of intercut chapters

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.980
or even intercut sections
within a chapter.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.820
While X is strolling in the
park, Y is murdering his wife,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.540
back and forth, back and forth.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.860
So that's adapted to film

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.170
and editing is necessary
to make it work.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.930
The other option is so-called
scene analysis or scene dissection

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:41.090
where you'd take a master
shot or this and break it

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.140
up into its component parts.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.090
So while the little colonel is
recovering from this battle wounds

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.770
in the bivouac hospital, he's lying
there and we got a shot of him.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.420
And he hears Lillian Gish
playing her mandolin,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.250
I guess that is her banjo.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.140
While we understand the emotional
interaction that's starting

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.070
to emerge between them.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.790
And it's the focusing
of the attention

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.700
with the separate close-up shots of
them that drives our understanding

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.840
and response to the drama.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.840
So editing does that focus
of attention for you.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.150
And that's what happens essentially
in the course of the themes.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.280
The dominant style
for handling those one

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.610
on one encounters is a standardized
pattern of continuity editing.

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:21.910
This and other things,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.450
I'll be mentioning some
that you've seen before.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.780
At a 1917 film based on
Wilkie Collins' novel,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.980
"The Woman in White",
you'd get a master shot,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.690
and then you'd get a closer view

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.100
as Count Fosco opens the
door and Marian is there.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.580
And then you'd get a
reverse angle on the husband

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.640
who has been standing off the one
side, looking suspiciously at her.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.010
And then another view of the
three, but a different framing.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.640
And by this point, they're thinking
OK, we don't need to see that,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.280
all of that painting and all
that candle around the left.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.160
We just go tighter
in on the characters.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.430
This is very modern and it's
very much what has developed

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.390
on those period based on editing.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.790
So for moment to moment,
your attention is focused

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.530
on what each character
is doing or saying to,

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.680
in relation to the others.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.490
And what develops at
this point among critics

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.370
and historians is a kind of
chauvinistic claim about editing.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.150
It's so powerful.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.090 position:56%
It transcends time and space because
it cuts around all over the place.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.580
It focuses our attention, rivets
us to particular things going on.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.880
It has to be.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.370
It's not only a great tool.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.420
It has to be the uniquely
cinematic technique.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.900
No other medium has an exact
equivalent for editing.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.390
So the theorists and critics say.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:41.070
And in a way, cinema was destined
to reveal its essence as editing.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.940
More and more, if you read, people
in the 20s and 30s are saying,

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.510
we had to get rid of all
that other stuff in order

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.880
to find the real true
essence of cinema.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.850
Its fate was to be an
editing-based medium.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.620
Why? Well, it directs and
maintains attention as we've seen.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.080
And it permits what we
might call camera ubiquity.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.510
That camera can be
anywhere in time and space.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:05.660
And then, the cut becomes a kind
of beat or kick, a little bump.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.960
You may perceive it.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.260
You may not perceive it.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.190
Ideally, you don't
perceive it most of the time

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.120
because the filmmaker's technique
is aiming to make it invisible.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.950
But sometimes, as in this
later segment I'd show you

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.520
from Hidden Figures, actually
it functions as a beat.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.340
As the couple kiss, we cut
to an extreme long shot

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.670
that we had not seen before.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.510
But it gives a kind of
code into the scene.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.020
It concludes the scene.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.640
OK, we're backing discreetly
away from them.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.940
This is so powerful.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.240
How can you not fake?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.930
This is the engine
that drives cinema.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.980
You'd get so many--
It buys you so much.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.540
It gets you so many advantages.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.560
Take this which I found
here in the archive.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.860
But I never heard of it before,

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.510
it's a very interesting film
called, "The Running Fight".

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.850 position:56%
Earlier in the scene, the curtain is
revealed to have someone behind it.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.340
There, you can see the
couple in foreground,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.690
the father and the daughter.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.820
And someone is peering in at them.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.910
Later, a different setup,
camera setup of that sort

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.940
of office laboratory, shows the
men gather around the retorts

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.100
and stuff and the curtain.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.210
And then thanks to good old camera
ubiquity, boom, we're in closer

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.180
to the hand that emerges
from the curtain.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.510
Then back to the master
shot, the shot is fired,

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.840
back to the hand, the
pistol is dropped.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.130
So, you could not miss it.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:24.470
You could not misunderstand
that that pistol shot was fired

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.890
from behind that curtain.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.850
If we'd had only the long
shot, this little shot here,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.200
who knows what you
would have thought.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.250
Interestingly later in the film,
we do find out who fires the shot.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.580
It's a woman who's been taken
to a mental institution.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.740
She's had a kind of
breakdown after doing this.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.230
And so we see her on
her deathbed confessing.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.760
And what's done is on the
left-hand side of the frame,

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.440
she's lying on her bed
and there's an attendant,

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.960
you can see I hope,
bending over her.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.140
The right-hand side of the frame
is a replay of the shooting

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.530
from behind the curtain,
if you can see

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.510
that silhouette there
on the front-right.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.870
Here. This is her, shooting.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:10.150
Here's the scene-- the present-time
scene of her in the institution.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.610
So the camera has not
only jumped back in time,

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:18.650
it's given us two spaces and
two times in the same framing.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.710
You know, this is a celebration
of the power of cinema.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.790
And of course it's not-- you
imagine, well, we could do this

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.770
in a comic strip, sure,
but it doesn't move.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.800
One of the things I discovered or
at least I should have known before

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.100
but kind of was brought home

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.720
to me during my stay here was
what I might call the punch

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.020
of the axial cut.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.460
Now an axial cut is editing

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.240
which doesn't vary the
angle on the subject.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.990
It comes right in on
the camera axis.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.860 position:56%
So the camera is pointed this way,
we have a shot from here, then here,

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.670
then here, boom, boom,
boom, straight in.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:53.600
So for instance, in "The Typhoon",
while woman's Asian lover,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.620
Japanese lover is arguing with
her French lover in his study,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.380 position:56%
we see her listening in the bedroom.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.580
And we cut back to the quarrel
between the men and we cut back

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.040
to her, but note that we've
had axial cut back to her.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.430
It's punching up our attention.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.980
It's focusing our attention.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.640
Just in case, you know,
remember, she's listening.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.320
Also, it's a kind of mimicry
of her act of attending.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.800
The fact that she's focusing more

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.460
and more what the men
are saying makes us--

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.440
is echoed in a way by
this closer view of her.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.700
And finally, as the quarrel gets
going, we go even tighter to her,

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.960
boom, boom, boom, three axial
cuts on her sort of sandwiched

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.970
between shots of the men.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.590
For even bigger punch, I
found in "The Juggernaut",

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.040
a magnificent film,
unfortunately only a fragment,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.490
released the same week as
"Birth of a Nation" actually.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.770
A woman has been rescued from a
train wreck that's taken place

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.530 position:56%
on a bridge, the bridge is
collapsing, the cars are underwater.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.970
It's a fantastic scene.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.800
And she's been rescued, she's
hauled up by the man who loves her,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.850
but it looks like she's dead.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.200
The axial cut takes us in closer.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.540
Is she dead or isn't she?

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.080
Bang, it's a very percussive
kind of cut.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.980
And then again, in on her.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.660
So here, there's nothing in
between, we go boom, boom, boom.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.070
And then back a bit, and
there's the suspense moment,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.520
will she revive or not?

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.350
Is she really dead?

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.440
Cut to the close-up of
her lifting her head

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.860
and cut back to the master shot.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.790
He doesn't even realize
it but we do.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.440
That's in alignment with us.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.420
So here, all the cuts are
along that camera axis

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:30.700
and are being used very carefully
to enhance the emotional effect

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.770
of what we're seeing, the
suspense of the moment and kind

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:38.280 position:56%
of riveting our attention to whether
her eyelids will flutter or not.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.580
One more example.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.200
This hasn't gone away.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.860
The axial cut is still with us.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.240 position:56%
You see it on TV almost every night.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.960
I picked a film I like,
"The Hunt for Red October",

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.330
when our two heroes are being fired
upon from the guy in the stadium

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.350
up above, the station
up above, boom, boom,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.480
boom, axial cuts all the way.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.380
And most action films use
axial cuts for this kind of,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.040
you know, fist-in-your-face look.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.590
So that's an example.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.690
Camera ubiquity from narrative
purposes gives you something else,

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.910
it buys you omniscience, can also
have that bump or pump effect

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.970
that I mentioned but it
lets you go anywhere.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.950
Here's a beautiful example
from another film I saw

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.600
of Rich Motion Picture
Division [phonetic],

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.590
"The Bargain", also
by Reginald Barker.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:28.130
William S. Hart is set on sides
by the sheriff and his men.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.350
He's trapped in his room and we get
a master shot of him in the room.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.610
We go outside to the door
he's pointing his pistol at.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.340 position:56%
The sheriff and his men are outside,
but they're on the other side too,

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.060
a closer shot of Bill
looking at the door.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.200 position:56%
And now we go walk to the other side

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.110
where we see the deputy
hammering away at the window.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.140
He starts to break the window
in fact to kind of get--

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.610
to surround or ambush Bill.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.270
And then we got the shot completely
from around the other side.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.570
So we can see the deputy

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.140
and actually see the glass
breaking in this shot.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.150
So the camera has been able
to hop around anywhere.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.260
It can go inside the
room, outside the room,

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.490 position:56%
at different points within the room.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.010
Thanks to editing, completely
clear, completely coherent

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.080
and focusing your attention
instant by instant

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.200
on each dramatic development.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.000
Now he really is surrounded.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.430 position:56%
So as I said, by 1917, editing wins.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.330
You are not a competent filmmaker
if you don't use editing by 1917

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.590
in America, in America this is.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.890
There are a few refinements.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.720
I'll just mention one enhancement.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.850
"Victory", we see it a little
bit later, 1919, filmmakers start

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.090
to give a kind of redundant
cue to let us--

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.660
to remind us that these
characters were

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.780
in proximity, so shoulders come in.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.290
You start to have what we call
now OTSs, over-the-shoulder shots.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.780
This come in the same golden
period I'm talking about.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.170
If you love shoulders,
you'll love Hollywood cinema

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.050
because they are everywhere.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.780
And again, same thing we find

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.600
in hidden figures,
shoulders all the time.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.900
So that's one of the enhancements.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.200
There are a few others.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.590
But basically, the
foundation has been laid.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.160
Editing is the dominant
mode of expression

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.450
for commercial mass market cinema.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.750
So what's the alternative?

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.800
What did editing defeat?

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.530
Well, what's been come to be called
mostly by film scholars rather

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.870
than filmmakers, tableau cinema.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.350
Here, the emphasis is on
staging rather than cutting

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:29.080
and a fixed camera rather than
that camera ubiquity that we get

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.940
with the power of editing.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.570
It's very strong in European
cinema in the period I'm discussing

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.940
where editing is generally
more minimal.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.200
Take this early example,
beautiful example, very early,

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.750 position:56%
"The Assassination of Duc du Guise".

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.300
This is-- You might think
it's like a theater play.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.700
It looks like very theatrical.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.360
I want to try to convince
you it's not theatrical.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.820
But at any rate, this becomes
very elaborate in Europe,

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.440
very refined in a film like "Life
of an Evangelist", the Danish film.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.510
You get shots of incredible
complexity in a single framing,

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.400
with apertures of people
poking in and out,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.750
the sort of peekaboo effect.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.500
It's all over the place.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.400 position:56%
It really is a very refined and
delicate art and it hangs on longer,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.990
this tableau approach,
in Europe than in the US.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.290
But what is it really?

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.590
I'll try to explain.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.810
At first glance, as I mentioned,

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.360
it seems very theatrical,
and that's not wrong.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.870
If you think in terms of
acting or performance,

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.610
it does draw on theatrical
traditions,

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.370
such as the Italian diva
films where you have kind

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.560
of operatic acting style
captured by the camera.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.630
It wouldn't be wrong
to call that dimension

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.220
of expression there
theatrical I think.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.950
But in another respect, it's
very indebted to painting

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.040
and in fact is somewhat
anti-theatrical.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.150
If you think about pictorialist
filmmakers like the Yevgeni Bauer

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:51.030
in Russia, we have images
that you just want to look at

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.660
and look at for a long time.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.150
Allan Levinson [assumed
spelling] talked about this.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.750
You want to soak yourself in them
and they seem to owe much more

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.780
to the traditions of
academic 19th century painting

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.670
than they do to theater.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.640
But I'm going to try to argue
that film is partly theatrical,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.850 position:56%
partly painterly, but also
something else, something different.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.550
And I have to give an example
from an early Danish film,

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.570
one of my favorites
called "Pat Corner".

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.590
There are scenes in "Pat
Corner"-- It's a detective film.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.500
There are scenes in "Pat Corner"
that are indeed very theatrical.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.140
The one I show you is of a man
trying to break into a bank

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.330
that has all these
different bank vaults in it.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.380
And he doesn't seem to notice
that he could simply walk

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.630
around the edge of the wall.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.200 position:56%
The theatrical convention is that
he is on the other side of the wall,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.880
burrowing in while
the guard is listening

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.470
for what's the noise
being caused here.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.770
We just take for granted

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.070
that there's been a
fourth wall sliced away

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.170
and he really can't walk around.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.860
That's a classic theatrical
convention.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.620
But, later, at the end of the
film, when the client comes

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.410
in to congratulate our detective
Pat Corner for a great solution

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.400
to the case, he comes
striding into his office.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.750
And you can see him
there, moving in I hope.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.230
And then he takes up a position
to thank Pat and shake his hand.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:10.390 position:56%
In the course of that though, he
blocks that third man who's a clerk.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.060
You see the clerk there in that
second shot standing there?

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:19.070
The client, the third frame I'm
showing you, stands in his way.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.660
You can't see him.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.470
The clerk knows this and so,
he takes a step to one side.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.860
He just steps in to let-- just
moves like this so you can see him,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.540
just like me and this stupid
column, you know, like this, this.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:38.040
Well, Pat steps in front of
him and says, "Oh, no problem,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.540
I was happy to solve your case."

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.860 position:56%
But the clerk is not to be defeated,

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.970
because he just takes
another step back to the left

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.610
and we can see him
again, scene-stealer, OK?

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.550
My point is it wouldn't
work on the stage.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.010
It could not work on the stage.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.310
It isn't theatrical.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.610
It's purely cinematic.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.010
Why? Well, because at
least in Western Theater,

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.380
but a lot of Asian Theaters
too, at least those I know of,

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.560
the audience can be arranged
in a circle or semicircle.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:16.030
But the stage is lateral, the stage
is a rectangle, it's horizontal,

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.850
as here in this room, this
is a theatrical setup.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.240
My playing space is this stretch
right here, and you're arranged

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.210
in a kind of semicircle around it.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.410
Well, if we go back to Elizabethan
theater, back still further

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.430
to ancient Greece,
we find this array.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.420
And it still continues into the
Renaissance with Lope de Vega,

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.680 position:56%
it continues with Eugene O'Neill and
other playwrights using these kinds

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.450
of horizontal, lateral
staging as the norm in theatre.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.860
And it makes sense
for the very reason

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.240
that you could see right
now, sight lines, right?

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.980
Every one of you has a different
sight line to me right now.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.140
No two angles are the same.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.430
So, if we're going to have me
and maybe my co-players hashed

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.040
out across here, interacting,

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.460
we have to do it pretty
much on a horizontal line.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.580
It can have some variance.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.310
I can turn my back if you
want to look at-- if I want--

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.670 position:56%
the director wants you to look at a
player, I can go on stage of course.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:16.760
But basically, this is the axis of
action in theatre, but not in film,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.650
because film isn't theatre.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.950
Film is a projection system.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.180
It's an optical projection system.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.330
In that respect, it's like
Renaissance perspective,

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.240
classic Renaissance perspective.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.950
I'll show you this
example from the period.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.790
People at that time were
thinking about this.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.590
It's a pyramid, a tipped-over
pyramid

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.690
with the point resting on the lens.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:39.170
That's the playing space
of every film shot.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:43.800 position:56%
Indeed, certainly, every live action
film shot, it's even that way in CGI

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.270
and in animation as
well, for the most part.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.210
There are some more experimental.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.020
But the most part, this is
the optical rule of cinema.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.450
Even though when you look at a
film frame, it seems to be a space,

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.240
a cubic space with something
just sliced out of it,

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.950
and all those people standing in
the box, mm-mm, it's that shape.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.490
That's what-- That's the contents

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:05.770
of the container, that
tapering pyramid.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:09.550
And indeed, in 1913, very
helpful for my purposes,

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.350
a screenwriting manual
spelled it all out.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:18.270
This is the stage base, right
there, that pie-slice-shaped wedge

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:23.170
of action is what the camera
captures, different from theatre.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.470
OK, so what?

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.770
Well, here's an example
by the way of a film

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.620 position:56%
that includes a theatre performance.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.870
And you can see the difference
I think rather clearly.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.460 position:56%
In the stage in the distance, people
are spread out like a gatefold.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.220
But in the space in front
of it, people arrayed

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.940
in all these different angles,
but our camera sees only one spot.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:49.040
The camera has only one sightline,
wherever the camera happens to be.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.650
By the way, that film was
by Sergio Leone's father.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.020
So what happens now with
the task of storytelling?

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.140
What happens with the
problem of guiding attention?

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.840
How do you do that with
that kind of playing space?

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.620
Well, my argument would be that
the punch and bumps that you feel

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.780
with editing, it gets replaced
by something we might call flow,

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:14.400
a continuous mobile changing
of what we're seeing onscreen.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.170
A simply example from a
fairly kind of crude example

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.350
but it's illustrative
from the Tannhäuser film

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.000
"David Copperfield",
not in your collection.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.110
I took this from a DVD.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.660
Two features I think
are worth mentioning.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.290
First, because of that tapering,
that triangular wedge-shaped piece

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:34.370
of space, there's a lot of
depth in a cinematic image.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.850
Theatre space is shallow,
film space can be deep.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.630
So, you have depth staging.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:43.000
Here in "David Copperfield",
when Betsey comes to the office

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.450
and greeted by Uriah Heep and
Micawber sitting there at the desk,

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:50.880
everybody gets their own little
piece of the space, foreground,

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.250
middle ground and background.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:58.720
That means you can do something
that's not so effective on theatre,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.560
what I call blocking and revealing.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.350
You can have the figures
in the foreground mask

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.330
at certain times what's
in the background.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:11.460
So what happens is as the man
who's ruined Betsey's investments,

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.110
I forget his name, you
probably remember, apologizes.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:20.070
Becky steps over so you can't
really see Uriah Heep's reaction.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.500
He's engineered the whole thing.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.800
He's stolen the money.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.560
And while David talks with
Micawber there on the back,

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.480
the contrite lawyer bends down.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.920
Betsey listens to him and then
bends down to forgive him.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.020
And then you get Uriah
Heep's reaction.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.820
See in there on the far right,
peeking and gloating there.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.400
Now, as I said, this is a TV
frame, so there would be more

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.740
for the original audience to see,
and it's a simple example of this.

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:48.800
But you see how the revelation
of his reaction has been delayed

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.010
by the blocking of his face.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.810
And when Betsey moves,
he can pop out.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.440 position:56%
This seems really simple, but it
couldn't work that way on the stage.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.060
Some of the peoples in the-- people
in the audience would see him,

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.070
Uriah, all the way through if
they were sitting over there.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:08.200
So that's kind of flow yielded by
depth, gets picked up undeveloped

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.720
through this blocking
and-- revealing strategy.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.020
It's worth mentioning that the
kind of depth the people think

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.270
about in cinema usually is
associated with the 1940s.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.360
We tend to think of Orson
Welles and his comrades

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.600
as developing deep space
or deep focus cinema.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.140
And it's true, he does in the '40s.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.190
But I would point out
that the foreground planes

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.700
in the '40s cinema
tend to be much closer,

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.920
much more aggressive
and in your face.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.700
In the 1910s, what
we get is something

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.680
that in some ways is
more attractive.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.980 position:56%
It's less violent use of foregrounds
where the characters are cut off

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.650
at the waist or the hips or the
crotch or the knee or whatever

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.390
to give a more fuller
sense, more air around them.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:53.030
But if you have more air around
them, you also have more room

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.080
to play that little chess game of
choreography of the other figures.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.890
So let me just run a couple passes
through here, once that I saw here.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.280
I was lucky enough to see
over in the Madison building.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.760
Take "The Case of Becky" from
1915, a very interesting movie

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.950
about a woman with a split
personality induced by hypnosis,

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.830
kind of a schizophrenic case.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:17.860
She comes to get a job at this
dry good store and the camera

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.560
as you see is cut off around the
knee or by the calf and the--

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.270 position:56%
what we get are three figures, the
supervisor then the women supervisor

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.420
and Becky and a man
in the background.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.920
And so we have depth already.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.790
In this case, it's
a little exceptional

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:36.720 position:56%
because the camera budges a little,
it swivels a bit, it pans as we say.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.540
Because as the woman supervisor
takes her back behind the counter,

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.340
this is kind of an audition to
see how she does with customers,

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.870
the camera nudges itself over a
little bit but still keeps the guy

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.170
in the background for us.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.470
You still get that rich depth.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.380
But what they did that's
rather daring, I think,

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.350
is they don't follow the way
a modern filmmaker would,

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.000
the people as they walk all the
way to the edge of the counter,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.370
the clerk and Becky,
they hold on the guy.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.040
They let-- He lets the
others go off screen

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.320
in a way no theatre director
would ever let them go off stage

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.560
and lets us-- there's'
really nothing else much

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.480
to look at except that guy.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.700
So his reaction is
very salient for us.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.250
And indeed, as Becky comes
up and she looks at him,

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.910
his reaction changes
and changes again.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:25.460
And you get a sense of the
rapacious interest on his part.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.920 position:56%
And by the end, when Becky has dealt
with the customer and turned away,

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.710
you can tell he's kind of sizing
her up as a possible girlfriend

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:36.820
without a close-up, no cuts,
just a little bump of the camera,

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:41.170 position:56%
and gave us just that moment to look
at him and be aware that he is going

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.000
to be important in this
interaction that's coming up.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.980
So that flow that I'm talking
about substitutes for the--

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.730
a percussive break that
you get with editing,

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.770
and is in many ways no
less effective I think.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.370
Let me show some tactics
in this strategy.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.990
"The Circus Man", I read a
little blog entry about this,

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.950
so you can look at it
online if you want.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.650
Here's a nice simple
example, I think.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:04.970 position:56%
The young man is uprighting the guys

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.930
who sent this woman's husband
to jail for some years.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.000
And he's giving him
a piece of his mind.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.130
Whenever you see a door in tableau
films, keep your eye on the door,

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:15.600
something is going to happen.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.290
And-- But he is dead center, he's
almost at the geometrical center

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:23.270
of the picture format, and
the wife pulls him away.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.370
It looks like a perfectly
spontaneous gesture.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.220
Don't be so aggressive,
you know, he'll hurt you.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.280
And indeed, the man on the
left is pushing a little bit.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.990
But, then, by virtue of the young
man's pulled back to the right

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:43.270 position:56%
and the business man's aggressive on
the left, he actually, businessman,

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.530
you have to believe
because it's true, actually,

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:51.130
moves his body a little
bit this way to allow us

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:55.320
to see the woman's husband come
in, just released from jail.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.520
This sort of micro-choreography
of these figures, moving slightly,

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.460
this way and that, it's the same
thing as the clerk in "Pat Corner",

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.990
only it's orchestrated now.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.600
Actually someone has
planned it to be this way

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.720
and to make the attention
saliency be on that center zone

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.070
that the husband is going
to come bursting into.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:19.410
If you want a comparison with
film and something, maybe not film

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.780
on theatre but film and dance
would be a better example.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.460
Here's another example, a subtler
one, I think, from Lois Weber

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.290
and Phillips Smalley's
film "False Colours".

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:32.230
And again, I put this on my
blog, you can look at it.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.090
The young woman in the
center is being consoled

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.090 position:56%
by the theater manager on the right.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:40.350
Her father who has abandoned her
when she was a baby has come in.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.440
And there he is standing
on the background.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.110
There, you get the
depth, the kind of depth

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.950
that I've actually talked about.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.190
And then, he comes
forward to apologize.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.150
He's very sad for what he's done.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.330
And the choice is what
the daughter will do.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:58.440
In the background steps, Director
Lois Weber is also one of the stars

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.800
in the film, who has
pretended to be the daughter.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.150
She's won this man's
affection by pretending

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.480
to be the long-lost daughter.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.560
And so she's completely upset

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.440
because of course she's
had this massive deception.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.770
And the father and the
daughter being reunited is

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:15.650
by no means guaranteed.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:20.430
The father then, in a gesture
contrition, begs forgiveness.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.570
Lois Weber in the background, even
though she is star, turns away

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.290
and it's a good thing too

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.980
because the father's hand
would have blocked her anyway.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.240
The crooked of his arm would have--
you couldn't have seen her face,

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.830
again, perfectly calculated.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.220 position:56%
The gesture and the two faces in the
middle, that's what we need to see.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.390 position:56%
We don't need to see Lois Weber yet.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:43.190
And then, when the hand comes
down and he offers his hand

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.150
in friendship, we get her
watching apprehensively.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.360
So here, what depth is being done--

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.220
being used for is to give
us both action and reaction.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.100
The two planes has give us
two dimensions of the drama,

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.380
the possible reconciliation
of father and daughter

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.340
and the self loathing really
of the woman who has pretended

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.440
to be the daughter, all in the same
frame, no cuts, needless to say.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.450
And at the end, when she begs
forgiveness and begs the father

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.000
to take-- to try again, to try

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.240
to win the daughter
over, we get her moment.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.930
She pops out saliently,
father turned away,

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.040
the theater manager has been
standing there like fireplug;

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.800
he hasn't done anything
on the far right.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.520
We don't need-- he-- if he
did, it would be a problem.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.210
Part of this is some people
have to stand very still,

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.690
unlike that clerk in "Pat Corner".

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.990
And of course to make sure

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.900 position:56%
that we see Lois Weber's anguished
expression, the daughter turns away,

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.640
motivated of course is her
clasping into herself and crying.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.350
This is Subtler, I think, than
"The Circus Man" example I gave you

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:46.560
because the flow is being
maximized on two levels.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.950
And the emotional power is very
great without the cutting option.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.090
This is not-- My stills aren't so
great from this, another film I saw

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.460
over across the street,
"The Sign of the Cross".

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.750
This might seem t be the prototype
of the mess, the messy tableau.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.900
It's one of those sword-and-sandal
pictures,

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.340 position:56%
then you have Marcus talking to Nero
with Poppaea crouching on his elbow,

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.470
and a major figure of this
counselor on the left and tons

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.870
of people behind, it
looks rather messy.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.560
Well, that's-- this taken
out of isolation, it does,

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.720
but let me give you
a little context.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.380
The scene begins with one of
those orgies where people seem

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.380
to be having much more fun than us.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.690
And Nero is-- he got people
spread around, dancing, all this.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.920
But then what happens is
they get cleared away,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.170
the whole open area gets emptied
out, all those revelers vanish

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:42.010
and in comes Marcus from the
depth, from the distant depth.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.900
He comes in and that's the
frame I showed you before

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.900
with him hailing Caesar and making
his proposal that at least one

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.590
of the Christians be
speared, the woman he loves.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.890
Poppaea objects.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.450
She has a right on Marcus anyway.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:59.570 position:56%
She objects and we get to see her
saliently by virtue of that gesture.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.340
She occupies the frame center,
Marcus pivots a little bit to her.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:08.830
She really commands your attention
within the big, big, dense frame.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.450
Nero says, "Let me think about it.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:11.770
I'm ruling this way."

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:16.040
And he stretches his hand
across Poppaea's face.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.620
So, we can't see her reaction.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:22.440
He hold his arm out there in
his decree and that's what has

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.250
to be emphasized here, the gesture,

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.280
the way the father's gesture was
emphasized in a much cleaner,

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.490
more open frame in the
Lois Weber example.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:33.600
So even in a very densely
packed composition,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.230
this kind of micro-movement of
choreography can take place.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.820
Let me give you a couple
more virtuoso moves.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.920
I know I'm collecting
butterflies specimens actually.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.950
I'm just looking for all these
different beautiful things.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.480
"The Man from Home",
this will be De Mille.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:51.060
This is a mind-boggler but I'll
just give you a piece of it.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.360
And by now, you know
what to look for.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.610
Door opens, we've got a door,
something is going to happen

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.220
around that door, the light pours
in beautifully, and this woman

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.430
who has abandoned her husband, just
standing there, very confident,

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.870
standing there in her
beautiful sheath.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.070
But then when he comes
in, she's less confident.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:10.100
And he comes roaring in there.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.160
And suddenly, we can
see those people behind.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.470
See those people crouching
behind the woman with a kind

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.450
of feathered hat and
the man, and he's ready

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:18.860
to wreak some violence on her.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.430
He's been a political
prisoner; she's betrayed him,

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:23.000
gone off with another man.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.080
And so, he's ready to fight.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.210
There's a struggle
on the front plane.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.850
The woman with the hat
very kindly turns away.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:33.150
You see her?

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.610
She sort of pivoted to
embrace that other guy.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.560
You see-- You can still
see her feather.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.080
Use that as your marker.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.490
And another man, the
villain of the piece,

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.540
is revealed far in
the background there.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.460
You see him there in a strip of--

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.010
a part of this involves
making sure faces can be seen

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.920
against darker backgrounds, so
that he's against that gray wall

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.090
between the two black curtains.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.670
So he's watching but he's
moving towards the window.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:02.830
And as he does so, the real
enemy, the returning refugee,

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:07.030
realizes he is the one he should be
going after and turns towards him.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:11.740
Everybody looks in that direction
and I swear this is true,

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.210
the villain back there by the
curtain steps into a spotlight.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:20.770
His face just bursts out at
you, no way you don't see that.

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.890
He's opened up the curtains
so the guard can come in

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:27.570
and the guard comes in to
arrest this escaped fellow.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.500 position:56%
Our man, he's an American of course,
and he stands up for this guy.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.670
So he says, "If you're
going to arrest him,

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.970
you have to arrest me too."

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:38.120
I love the way the wife just sits
crouching there this whole thing,

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.450
doesn't try to get
out, just sits there.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.950
She's the equivalent of
that theatrical manager.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:46.760
And in comes the commissar
who's going

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.720
to save the refugee from the back.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.190
And everybody turns so
that you'd be a fool not

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:53.600
to look in that direction.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.360
And then the quarrel ensues
and there's much more.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.170
I'm just giving you
a couple highlights.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:04.010
But you can see how much you can do
with that combination of deep space

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.530
and blocking and revealing,
lighting parts of the set,

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:11.200
but also actors block certain key
actions because actors can move.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.420
They move to reveal
to reveal things.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.560
One more, again, we
go back to Lois Weber.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.120
Earlier in the scene that I showed
you, the theatrical manager arrives

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.990
in the apartment, greeted
by the daughter

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.750
and apprehensively by
the impostor, Lois.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.910
The father is waiting
out in the wings there.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.970
We know that she can't see him.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:37.260 position:56%
The theatrical manager goes on in,
the daughter senses somebody else is

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.490
out there and already
also back there

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:40.790
in the background is
a little worried.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:45.920
And the father comes in and
this is really pretty good.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.430
He steps up and blocks
the two women we just saw,

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:53.220
so that only the daughter's
horrified reaction is visible.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.450
And then, he moves a little
and you get the other reaction,

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.410
the reaction of Lois, the
impostor, and even the man

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.110
on the left who's kind
of there to balance

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.630
to be the next part of the scene.

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:06.700
This flow is remarkable
and it's pointed.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.460
It's as if they drew a dotted
line around each of these figures

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.020
that pop out, this kind
of peekaboo effect.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:17.230 position:56%
Well, back to 1917, bye-bye tableau.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.470 position:56%
I can't find any American films that
use these techniques after 1917.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:24.180
In fact, I can't use any-- find any
in 1916 that use these techniques.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:28.280 position:56%
Don't say they're completely
extinct but I haven't found any yet.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:33.990
In that window between 19--
particularly 1911 to 1914-15,

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.710 position:56%
people really tried this in America.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.100
The Europeans hung onto it longer.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.380
It persists to the
teens as I say here.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.260
And some directors get very
hip to American methods,

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.770
someone like Abel Gance
in Paris figures

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.770
out the American continuity
system immediately

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.560
and does virtuoso things with it.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:56.560
Victor Sjöström does as well
in 1918 on Sweden, but it's slower

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.860
to achieve some saliency.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.000
By 1920 though, really only
the Germans cling to it.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.540
And the reason is simple,
I think, because German--

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:10.780 position:56%
Germany didn't import American
films until 1920, January 1st, 1920.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.410
So they're not seeing the
William S. Hart films,

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.160
the things like the
Lois Weber films,

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.980
all these things I've been showing
you, they're not seeing them.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.380
And what you get though are
some very interesting options

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.680
of the tableau method.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.550
I don't have time to go into
this but particularly interesting

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.930
for instance is Robert Reinert's
films, "Opium" and "Nerven",

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.110
which kind of looked forward
to Orson Welles in a way

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.460
with those big foregrounds,
the big head that we saw

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.910
and we saw in "Citizen Kane".

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:39.730
But they also seem to employ the
tableau method of jamming things in

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.110
and having figures
peek in and peek out.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:44.700
The daughter there on the
lower frame sticks her head

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.090
out from behind that
cabinet, for instance,

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.950
while her father just moves
in the foreground there.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:54.330
So even the tableau gets
subjected to a kind of retortion

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:57.300
where the camera is closer
than it would have been,

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.350
it's not just cutting people
off and fully down the body,

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:02.950
it's framing them tighter
but they're still squeezing

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.730
in all these other things.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.560
Tableau staging, I think it's
rediscovered at various points

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.200
in film history and on with this.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.290
In early CinemaScope for instance,
many of the techniques that we see

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:18.390
in those 1910s films are
spontaneously revived.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:21.700
I'm not saying that CinemaScope
directors of Hollywood went back

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.590
to the archives and
watched these old films.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:26.900
It's just that when they decided
they couldn't cut in CinemaScope,

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.560
wrong, but they thought they
couldn't cut in CinemaScope,

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.530
they reverted to that same
single shot tableau method.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:39.750
So, for instance, James Mason
and Suzy Parker are there

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:43.600
with Joan Collins, that fine
doorway on the background.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.740
Joan Collins coming in,
Suzy moves to the left,

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.560
into the kind of the
middle foreground,

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.860
James Mason looks after her.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.240
Here comes Joan.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.640
Joan goes to a mirror.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.270
Mirrors are much beloved
in the 1910s.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:58.530
And James is left standing
there at that classic framing,

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.160
and then she goes out
in the background again,

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.950
leaving James there, just
what we've been seeing

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.040
in the 1910s, revived in the 1950s.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.650
Again, that didn't last too long.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.810
It does return more
strongly, I think,

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.080
in what we might call
Asian minimalism.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.980
Filmmakers like Hou
Hsia-hsien in Taiwan,

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:20.090 position:56%
who gets heavily I think imitated by
Chinese filmmakers on the Mainland

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:25.160
and in Japan as well, develops
a kind of modern version

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.210
of the tableau approach, I think.

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.730 position:56%
So for instance, when the
gangsters meet in "City of Sadness",

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.890
the camera is one spot,
they come and sit down,

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.850
and you get this little geometry of
heads, display of heads, blocking

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.540
and revealing each other,
different expressions there.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.520
I hope you can see some of
those, until the climax bursts

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.430
out with the man on the far left,

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.460
threatening the other
man on the left.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:51.250
So, the tableau is not
absolutely dead in world cinema

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:52.550
but it certainly, I would say,

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.530
is dead in mass market
commercial cinema,

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:58.340
because Hou Hsia-hsien is not
making mainstream films even

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.250
to this day, I suppose.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:05.380
Finally, I want to say
some things about why.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.970
Why did the editing
approach gain supremacy?

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.310
There are several possibilities and
we can talk about them if you want,

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:14.760
but the one I think is most
compelling, at least as a major

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.180
if not the only cause, you know,
the conditions of post-production

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.670
and particularly production in
the American cinema at the time.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:23.080
Remember I mentioned this
explosion of filmmaking

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.350
because there's an immense
popularity of the medium.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:30.810
They way you shoot a tableau is
really dependent on the director.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.430
The director is the
conductor of the orchestra.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:36.200
The director is shouting out--
Remember, this is a silent cinema

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.400
and directors have megaphones.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.130
The director is shouting
out, move, pause,

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.890
step behind the table,
pause, and so on.

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:48.170
In fact, you can argue in fact
the bump that we get with editing,

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:54.340
the little sense of a bump in a
cuts is kind of matched by poise--

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:58.580
a position, freezing into place,
pausing in tableau cinema.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.690
So the rhythm of the
scene is partly dependent

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:03.090
on people halting and
just not moving.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.670
The director commands
that because that's

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.590
where the focus of
attention has to be.

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:10.290
So the director is really king

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.360
and controls the moment-by-moment
recording

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.010
of the thing on the camera.

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:18.540 position:56%
But the problem with that for a mass
market film industry is you can't

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.870
really change much
in post-production.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.200
You don't have close-ups to cut to.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.100
You don't have anything
but this one long ribbon

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.410
of film that's one long scene.

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:29.800
You can interrupt it with
titles, and maybe if you want

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.280
to take a few things out a
little bit, but it's very hard

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.690
to alter those shots
in post-production,

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:37.830
those long take tableau shots.

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:40.730
So you see here as an example of
it, this is an earlier film studio.

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.190
This is about 1907 or 8 I suppose.

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.570
But you can see, the directors
are all lining up there,

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:48.110
the cameras are all lined up,
several settings lined up side

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:50.330
by side, because they're
filming side by side.

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.380
And the directors are
really calling the shots,

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.410
well I should say, the shot.

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:59.200
But with editing, there
are two strong advantages.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.270
One-- For a mass market
industry, one is you can plan

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:04.090 position:56%
out all the shots in pre-production.

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:07.760 position:56%
Today, we have storyboards,
animated storyboards done digitally,

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.410
but you can map out every
shot in advance if you want.

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.040
You can make a shot
list, you can change it,

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.330
you can make the whole
movie in your head on paper

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:18.030
or on the screen before
you expose any film.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.370
Also, producers like the
possibility of editing,

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.530
because you can change things.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:26.670
If a scene seems to be too slow,
you have something to cut away to.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.480
The producer always
says, "I need coverage.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.340 position:56%
Show me different positions of the
camera, different parts of the scene

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.640
so I can pick up the pace,

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.490
I can emphasize a performance
thing I like.

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:40.180
I can cut out this actor
who is too mean," and so on.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:44.750 position:56%
That means the director is no longer
in the driver's seat scene by scene

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.850
and the film can be controlled by
many other hands, the producer,

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.070
the editor, people
further down the line.

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:54.370
I'll show you an image from--
This is from an exchange,

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:56.550
a film exchange, not a
film production company.

00:53:56.550 --> 00:54:00.500
Typically, when films arrive, you
know, in a city or really a center

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.460
of distribution, people usually
women would be assembling them

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.120
for distribution to
the actual theaters,

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.380
and they're checking the film, in
this case, probably they're cutting

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:13.030
in some titles, possibly tinting
the film, doing various things.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.480
The point is that once you've
got cuts, you can change things

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.080
around in many, many ways.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.650
You could if you were
one of women working

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:21.710
in this exchange actually
cut out things

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.400
that local sensors
didn't want to see.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.020
You can simply take them out.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.160
In Chicago, maybe they
don't a play it.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.950
But in Cleveland, you could see it.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:33.410
So all those kinds of manipulations
are much more usually done

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:35.530
with editing.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.650
So, I would argue that among
the prime causal reasons

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.930
for the push towards editing
is the need for controlled,

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:45.000
predictable mass production.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.320
If the tableau is the
friend of the directors,

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.810
let's say editing is the
invention of producers.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.690
I'll give you a quick example
of what that look likes

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.720
when the producer is
in the driver's seat

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.360
and you get the layout
of shots scene by scene.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.100
This is a 1917 film now lost I
believe called "Love or Justice",

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.400
but you can see very clearly,
at Nan's table, we have scene 5.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.220
They called shots scenes then.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.380
At Nan's table, Bill comes to the
table, moves around to Nan's side,

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.610
seems to be carefully-- everything
is mapped out for the performer.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:22.750
Nan listens a moment then looks
off toward the other table.

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.340
That's at scene 5.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.130
And the OK scribbled through
it means we made the shoot,

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:29.150
we did what we were supposed to do.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:33.110
Then, scene 6, flash
close shot on Jack Dunn,

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:35.330
close shot on Jack allowing
waiter's hands to come in.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:38.360
Even specifying the shot scale,
only see the waiter's hands,

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.250
don't see the waiter, and place
the sandwich and the drink.

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:42.600
He stares at them moodily.

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.400
Again, OK, we made the shot.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.300
Above it though is
something interesting.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:51.610
Before scene 5, someone scribbled
in 4A, long shot, 4B, close-up boy.

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:54.170
That was done on the set.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:58.520
But please not that now, the script
becomes a record of the production.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.580
We now know that the director
or somebody said, "Look,

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.430
we better have a couple
more shoots here",

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.860
maybe to give more playing
time or maybe it's to clear

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.770
up where this action
is taking place.

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.840
OK, the script girl, that's what
she was called, wrote in 4A,

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.080
that's not 5 but there was a 4
before that that we don't we see.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.810
This is 4A, a different shot , a
long shoot and 4B, the close-up.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:22.310
And those are X'ed out
as having been completed.

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:25.470
So, the script is controlling
not just production

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:27.580
in the front office
from the distance.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.760
Moment by moment in the filming,
you're fitting what you do

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.060
into the script, i.e. into the
shots as they're punching along.

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:40.240
I want to thank everyone
who's assisted me here

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.880
and it's a long list.

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.810
So, here is the list.

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:46.610
These are the people
in the Kluge Center

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:50.690
in the Motion Picture Division,
strangers who gave me directions

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:54.200
on the street, all these
people I owe a lot.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.980
I really have benefited
enormously from my stay here.

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.680
I'm grateful for-- to the
Kluge center for inviting me

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.090
to participate in their
important work and to--

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:06.270
particularly to my friends in
the Motion Picture Division

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:11.710
across the street who had then come
unfailingly courteous and helpful.

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.060
I really have enjoyed my stay here.

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.540
I wish it could go on forever.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.070
But thank you for your attention.

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:18.960
And of course, I'm happy
to answer any questions

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.260
or respond to any comments.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.060
Thanks very much.

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:27.070
[ Applause ]

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.010 position:56%
How do you want to handle questions?

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:31.420
You want me to take them or
do you want to take them?

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.720
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello:
You can take them

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.020
and there's a mic roaming around.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.320
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: OK.

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.620
There's a roaming mic.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.920
Yes, please?

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.220
Hi.

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.710
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm unsure about this but
is basically montage was developed

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:46.610
by Kuleshov and Eisenstein
on the '20s or was it the--

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:54.240
and didn't Eisenstein
commend D.W. Griffith for--

00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:00.720
So, those techniques
of editing really sort

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.250
of were developed very early.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.440
I mean, Griffith didn't himself
invent them, he just put--

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.740
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: No, he didn't.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.040
&gt;&gt; -- got them in one package.

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.930
But now this montage itself was
just this hyperkinetic form editing

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:14.440
in vague meaning.

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.320
How does this film spit into
what you've been saying?

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.760
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: It's
a very good question.

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.840
These films were seen
in-- the films or the kind

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.010
of films I'm describing
were seen in many parts

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:25.960
of the world during the teens.

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.470
And they eventually made their way
to Russia and were taken up the

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:31.950
by the younger generation
filmmakers,

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:34.780
the one you mentioned
Kuleshov, Eisenstein, Pudovkin,

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.230
they saw them as--
it is perfect example

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:38.530
of what I've been describing.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.920
They saw them as the
coolest new thing.

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:44.440
The tableau ruled Czarist cinema.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.870
But once the revolution took place,

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.810
the young directors decided
this is the way to go,

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.850 position:56%
just as Lenin wanted electrification

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:53.750
and power plants and
things like that.

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:56.530
They were able hitch their
wagon to that star and say,

00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:58.010
look, we have to modernize.

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:01.320
And the Americans are the source
of this kind of modernity.

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.130
So, we will take what
the Americans did.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:06.870
And in fact, you know,
we call it Soviet montage

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:10.420
but the Russians called
it American montage,

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.750
because they saw themselves very
much as influenced by this trend.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.220
And as you say, they
pushed it farther.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.580
They realized that there are
more possibilities in montage

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.390
than the Americans have realized.

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:23.800 position:56%
You can make shots very, very short.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.640
You can make abstract points with
shots and that's kind of an error

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.340
in some of the teen's films.

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.770
There's moralizing or allegorical
films that use sort of abstract--

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:35.020
use editing for abstractions.

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.230
But of course, people like
Eisenstein went much farther

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.900
with that, it sends us in
"Strike" and "October".

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:44.660
So, they push the American
continuity system to a kind

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.360
of crisis, I would argue,
and create a kind of cinema

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.630
of discontinuity that's built
on the continuity system.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.600
They keep pushing and
pushing in various ways.

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.690 position:56%
Each one of them has their own
style, those major soviet directors.

00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:57.990
But you're right.

00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:02.940
This is where it becomes
a new kind of cinema.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.530
The other point you raised about
Eisenstein is dead right also.

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:07.470
But that's in a period
of Eisenstein's work

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:10.040
where he's looking--
he's less of a radical.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.780
He writes that essay, "Later".

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.630
And he's less of radical
than he was in his 20s.

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:18.430
And he's looking for classical
sources for what cinema has done.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:21.070
He's trying to give cinema
a distinguished lineage

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:22.500
in the history of the arts.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.680
So just as he'll say, "Well,
here's a framing here from Pudovkin

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.060
that reminds you of
Del Greco," and so on.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:32.000 position:56%
He'll try to give a kind of
intellectual authority of legitimacy

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.530 position:56%
to what cinema has been as in cinema
is the next logical step for him

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.630
in the evolution of
the arts in general.

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:42.440
So, naturally, what the 19th
century novelists were doing,

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.130
Griffith with his crosscutting
in "The Cricket

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:48.530 position:56%
on the Hearth" is what Griffith did.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.640
Griffith did it too
but he did it on film.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.360
He swallowed up another art
form and pushed it farther.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.530
So that's a particular position
Eisenstein wants to push.

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:58.830
But you're right.

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:01.530
This American cinema is
very, very influential

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:05.620
on the Soviet montage people.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.000
Yes, Andrei, please?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.860
&gt;&gt; Doctor Bordwell, thank
you for this lecture.

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.820
A couple of years ago, I
was watching George Clooney

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.730
on "Inside the Actors Studio".

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:16.320
And James Lipton asked him,

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.840
what's the most important
aspect of directing?

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.360
And Mr. Clooney didn't hesitate.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.880
He said, point of view.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.620
And I thought about that
quite a bit since then.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:34.970 position:56%
So, point of view not just in the
sense of emphasis but identification

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:38.610
to get the audience to identify
with a particular character.

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:42.500
So my question is, for you, in
this period that you've focused

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.930
on for study, do you --
did you see, shall we say,

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:51.370
instances of the beginning of some
of these techniques for the purpose

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:53.640
of enhancing identification?

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.940
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: Mm-hmm.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.000
Well, I think there's two or
three ways to deal with it, yes.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.130
One is we could identify
with figures

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:01.900
that we see simply
because we see them.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.590
We're very responsive
to faces and postures

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:08.010 position:56%
and those can enhance identification
and I think that's the actor's craft

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.730
in both of the trends that
I'm trying to analyze.

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:13.350
You get a powerful sense
of empathy for instance

01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:15.230
in that Lois Weber example.

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:18.150
But a more broader sense, I think,

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:21.910
what you're asking is even more
interesting and that is one

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:25.190
of those faults of the
tableau cinema, you can argue,

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:28.100
is that it doesn't allow for
that kind of optical point

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.880
of view, the editing does.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.670
You can't really put the
camera in the shoes or the eyes

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:35.350
of another character
in the tableau cinema.

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.370
Everything is based on
a kind of omniscience.

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:41.040 position:56%
We see everything we need to see and
then maybe it's not like the kind

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.770 position:56%
of omniscience on the theatre stage.

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:45.600
Nevertheless, there's a sense
of hovering over the action

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.700
and we may be aware of things
that the actors aren't,

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.310
often because they're standing
with their backs to each other.

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:55.360
So, there is a harder hill to climb
to get that kind of say, let's say,

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.240
Hitchcockean shot of person
looking, shot of what they see,

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.520
closer shot of looking,
closer of what they see,

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.540
that kind of intensification
on point of view is harder

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:05.840
to achieve in the tableau cinema.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.360
And if that's one of the routes
we can take to an identification,

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.830
then that's, you know, one of
those things that it is a deficit

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:16.680
of the tableau cinema and probably
help the advance of editing.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.770
So it comes in-- POV shots come in
very early in the history cinema,

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:22.170
then they drop out for a while.

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:24.770
They're usually just stunts or
what Tom Gunning calls attractions.

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:27.540
Later, they get integrated
into stories

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.340
and editing is the
way it's done, yeah.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:33.150
So that mention of point of view
is really, I think, you know,

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:35.820
there's a bias in editing
towards that.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.570
But of course, you know,
empathy takes many forms

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:41.950
and you can find lots of cases
where extreme long shots,

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.850
people are watching in the
extreme long shot and crying.

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.150
You think of the end of say,

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:47.460
Kiarostami's "Through
the Olive Trees",

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.970
I don't know if you've
seen that film.

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:52.420
Well, it's prolonged long
shot, it must be a mile away.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.270
I don't know how far away it is.

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:56.440
And everybody is riveted,

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.360
and feeling for the
character who's in that shot.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.190
So, there are many avenues,
I think, towards that kind

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:04.420
of identification you're
talking about.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:08.520
But certainly, it can be bought
pretty cheaply through cutting.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.860
Yes, please?

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.940
&gt;&gt; When you said the tableau system
survived in Germany till 1919-1920,

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.300
then began running "The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"--

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.600
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: Yes.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.020
&gt;&gt; And that seems like tableau film
because they certainly want you

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.360
to make use of those sets.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.390
But it also incorporates
these shot cuts of Cesare.

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:31.020
So, I wonder how you
would categorize Caligari?

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.320
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: Yup, yup.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.620
That's a great point.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.900
I didn't have time to elaborate
on this but you're quite right.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.550
What happens in the teens in
both America and Europe is

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:44.070
that directors start to sort of go
halfway or partway towards editing,

01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:48.050
the tableau directors through
a simple axial cut in and out.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:51.120 position:56%
So for instances, they understand
you're supposed to emphasize things,

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.070
but instead of building the
scene out of cuts the way

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.600
in an American would, you simply
have the tableau, it goes on and on

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.730
and on, and then boom,
an enlargement of a face,

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.450
and then boom, back into tableau.

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:04.510
This might thought of as like
a proto-continuity system.

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:06.410
You're always in the master shot.

01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:09.320
And that is what you get in
Caligari for the most part.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.470
You get the enlargements of
either Cesare or the doctor,

01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:17.750
often in an iris, a kind
of circular-shaped mask

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:22.590
which emphasized that, a kind of a
little italicization of that Roman.

01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:25.800 position:56%
But Caligari also uses
crosscutting, a lot of crosscutting.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.940
And that shows by that
point, American cinema's--

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.700
that's seen everywhere now.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.000
The people adapt that.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.820
Even Fayyad who is very
conservative adopts crosscutting.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.360
So, it's a partial
concession, I would say,

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.030
to the American system, Caligari.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.830
But Caligari, you're
certainly right.

01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:44.600
The absorption of the
sets and the emphasis

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.120
on a quasi-dance-like performance
style in both Cesare of course,

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.840
but in the others, is there too.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.990
So, there a lot of compromises
in that tableau tradition,

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:59.140
particularly after the
Americans would get out there.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:03.100
Caligari was made when they could
see American films as is the film

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.220
that I mentioned, "Nerven"
by Reinert,

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.320
which was made the
same year as Caligari.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.350
And in my view, if you
can see it, it's on DVD.

01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:11.360
You can get on online.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.610
"Nerven" would be as
famous as Caligari

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:17.070
if people had seen it outside
Germany but it wasn't well-known,

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:19.500
it wasn't preserved in
archives, and not so--

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.680
it wasn't as publicized in
such a self-congratulatory way

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.980
as Caligari was.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.840
But in general, your point is
quite right, that there are--

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.090
these films have sort of
partial use of each tradition

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:32.540
and sometimes it's just the matter
of using one more than another.

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:37.780
Yup? This side.

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:46.570
&gt;&gt; The French Criticoms wrote this
in, wrote about the superiority

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:51.310
of the deep focus or the
deep sets and it seems

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:53.800
to have something in
common with tableau.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.640
It's more, I think-- he was saying
the audience had more freedom,

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.360
you're not directed every single--
And also, there's more ability to--

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.450
it's more of a contemplative--

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:08.750
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: Yes.

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- cinema than the editing style.

01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:11.380
Do you agree with that?

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.540
Do you see a similarity
with tableau?

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.050
How do you relate that?

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:16.410
&gt;&gt; David Bordwell: I
really am listening.

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:23.870
I'm just trying to find an image,
I think, that will help us.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:29.500 position:56%
Yeah. What I would say is this, that
Bezen [assumed spelling] generalizes

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.820
from the Welles and Wyler
films he's been seeing.

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.450
And he wants to know
where they come from.

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:38.380 position:56%
And I guess the complicated argument
about that deep focus style,

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.920 position:56%
if I can show you this, there, that.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.470
His argument as I understand,
it goes like this.

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:47.730
Back in the day, there is what
he calls primitive deep focus,

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.070
and that would include
the very earliest films,

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:53.520
mostly those shot outdoors like the
Lumière films and things like that

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.570
where you can see lots of space
in the background, cityscapes,

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:57.870
people moving around, all that.

01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:00.850
You have primitive deep focus but
that's kind of given automatically

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.570
by the camera, the nature
of lighting, and so on.

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:06.060
And then, thing become very
hermetic in the studios,

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.050
you're inside the studios
and cutting rules.

01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:12.350
And then, by the '30s,-- Bezen's,
this is a story Bezen tells.

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:15.680
By the '30s, everybody knows how to
cut, and sound has been mastered,

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.480
so we know how to cut
for sound cinema.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.140
So, there's a kind of
equilibrium reached throughout 1939

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.940
where you can really use this
standard continuity system

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.240
to say anything.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.540
You can tell a gangster film.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.840
You can tell a musical, whatever.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.650
What Welles and Wyler do is they
come to fulfill a kind of prophecy

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:36.930
of synthesizing the primitive deep
focus and the cinema of editing.

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:42.840
His argument is that shot like
this is a kind of compact diversion

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.170
of a close-up, a medium
shot and a long shoot.

01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:51.510
It's as if Welles had figured out a
way to give us all the information

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:56.780
that would normally be given in an
edited sequence in a single frame.

01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.080
He spaced them out almost--

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.130
Bezen, you know, suggests it's like
an explode a diagram of a motor,

01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:04.690
you know, like all the pieces
are kind of hovering in space

01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:06.640
but it's within this one diagram.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.730
So his argument is the
primitive deep focus is absorbed

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:15.010
but classicized or
continuitized in Welles and Wyler.

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:17.990
So the version of deep focus
he has here is a synthesis

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:20.710 position:56%
of the continuity, editing tradition

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:22.540
and what he called
primitive deep focus.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.140
From my standpoint, he
can't be blamed for this

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.610 position:56%
because people didn't see the films,
he didn't know about these films

01:09:27.610 --> 01:09:30.270
of the teens, the tableau
films of the teens,

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:33.570
which are not primitive deep focus
in the way he's thinking of it,

01:09:33.570 --> 01:09:35.830
but also aren't editing either.

01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:38.280
So, to my sense, Bezen, you know,

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.130
he saw what he could see
and he said what he can.

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:42.960
But there's a sense in which

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.980
that argument sees everything
is evolving towards this.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.560
He was a very much a
pretentious critic.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.580
He thought this is really kind
of the end of cinema style.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:52.880
There's no further to go than this.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.180
We can have color, yes.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.480
We can have 3D.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.780
You can have those things.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.740
But as far as style is concerned,
it's pretty much a dead end.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.040
We're finished.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.690
Welles and Wyler have given
us the perfect form of cinema.

01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.530
Editing is given to us in a way

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:07.710
that it respects the
integrity of time and space.

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:10.710
So the problem with editing
is it chops everything up.

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:15.350 position:56%
Here, we get the world organized,
dynamized, focused for our attention

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.030
without doing those things.

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:20.790
And it's part of his theory about
what is really artistic cinema,

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:23.170
the value of certain
kinds of filmmaking.

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:25.530
That's my take on it anyway.

01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:26.900
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello: Let's
thank David Bordwell.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.200
