CHERYL: I'm Cheryl,
and I'm super

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.360
pleased to be able to
introduce Chris Baty, who

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.740
is the founder of National
Novel Writing Month.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.100
Chris is a 15 time NaNoWriMo
winner and the author

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.020
of "Ready, Set,
Novel!" and "No Plot?

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.640
No Problem!"

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.464
CHRIS BATY: Thank you.

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:20.750
Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.620
Are we working?

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.060
Are we live?

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.000
OK.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.730
Well, welcome.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.775
Thank you so much
for organizing this.

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:30.150
Last time I was
here at Google, I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.119
ate the most
amazing Indian food.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.780
I think I was here with Anthony.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.750
I still think of
it fondly, so it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.737
is wonderful to be back here.

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:40.320
I've also heard that there are
a lot of National Novel Writing

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.400
Month experience
participants at Google.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.640
If you've done National
Novel Writing Month before,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.370
can you raise your hand?

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.410
Oh great, OK.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.490
And how many of you
are already planning

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.180
on giving it a go this year?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.080
OK, all right,
that's great to know.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.230
So what I want to do
today is just briefly

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.947
talk about what
National Novel Writing

00:00:59.947 --> 00:01:02.280
Month is for those of you who
are just-- kind of thought

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.260
it might be interesting,
or just learning

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.340
about it for the first time.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.810
Talk about where
it came from, kind

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.200
of the history of writing
a novel in November,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.700
and then get into a few of
these kind of weird lessons

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.617
that I have learned about
writing from National Novel

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:18.200
Writing Month.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.190
I think the event
breaks a lot of rules

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.700
and conventional wisdom
about the best ways

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.380
to go about creative projects,
and I want to talk about those.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.950
And then the main thing I want
to do is leave plenty of time

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.810
for discussion.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.240
So those of us at our sailing
into this month of literary

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.592
abandoned in November all need
tips and advice and strategy,

00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:38.300
and the great thing
about being in a room

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.675
full people who've
done it before

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:42.995
is that we all have these kind
of insights and approaches

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:44.120
that are great for sharing.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.376
So I would love to leave time to
have that kind of conversation.

00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:49.750
So if anybody has any questions,
we can talk about those,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.220
but really just
think about the tips

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.730
that you would have
given yourself,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.830
the things that you wish you
had known the first time you did

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.660
National Novel
Writing Month, and we

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.640
will share those as a group.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.510
So all right.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.740
So National Novel Writing
Month, in a nutshell,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.430
is based around this really
kind of ridiculous idea

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.310
that everybody in the world
should spend November writing

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.760
a 50,000 word or longer
novel from scratch.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.310
OK, so that that's not
a super long novel, that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.570
is-- so this for
instance, "No Plot?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.060
No Problem!" this is my book,
and this is about 50,000 words.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.670
So it's a short-ish novel.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.060
Kind of a little bit less than
a "Catcher in the Rye," or so.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.720
So you sign up on our
website nanowrimo.org,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.290
and we have some
amazing stickers here

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.850
that have-- will be a
good prompt for the URL.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.020
So before you leave, today
be sure to get a sticker.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.950
These actually will
write your novel for you,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.210
so if you apply
them to your laptop

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.480
they will handle the majority
of your word count for you.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.880
So you sign up on
nanowrimo.org, and you

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.840
create an author profile.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.064
You can add writing
buddies, so people

00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:00.730
that you know that are doing it,
so you keep track of their word

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.370
count, they can see
your word count.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.040
You get this really satisfying
stats graph, those of you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.998
who have done National
Novel Writing Month know

00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:08.730
the power of this graph, right?

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.450
So the goal of 50,000
words gets broken down

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.740
into 1667 words per day.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.190
And you update your word count
on the NaNoWriMo website,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.240
you write offline,
update that word count,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.860
and that you get
this progress bar.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.027
You know the progress bar.

00:03:22.027 --> 00:03:24.610
Starts to grow, it gets really
satisfying, you get this graph,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.160
and there's a par line, and
you're either over or below it.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.790
And this starts to
kind of take a hold

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.730
of your soul in really
interesting ways.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.580
Where you are on
that line determines

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.870
how you feel about life,
yourself, everything.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.110
So you also get these
great pep talks,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.360
and one of the things
that we really want to do

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.407
is encourage people
to keep going

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:45.490
when the going gets tough.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.160
So we recruit a great
group of authors.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.600
We've had pep talks from Neil
Gaiman, Philip Pullman, Dave

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.776
Eggers, Sue Grafton, of course
Aimee Bender, Nick Hornby.

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:57.150
Just all these
great authors that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.700
send out these messages that
tend to hit your inbox just

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.320
when you are about to die.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.220
And these things get
you back to the keyboard

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.920
and get you writing again.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.710
Another nice thing is that
we have local regions,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.850
so Google has a NaNoWriMo group.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.260
How many of you are in the
NaNoWriMo group here at Google?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.070
OK, great.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.724
So also, there are local
groups in the South Bay

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:21.140
and in the peninsula where
there are write-ins most nights

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.139
of the week in November.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.882
So if you want to, you
can go to Starbucks.

00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:27.340
Go to a coffee shop, meet up
with other people who are also

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.830
doing this, and write with them.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.460
And you can find
that schedule when

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.350
you sign up on the
NaNoWriMo website.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.470
So when the month starts, you
just really start writing.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.060
You keep going, and at
the end of the month,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.162
if you have written 50,000 words
or more, you take your website,

00:04:45.162 --> 00:04:47.120
and you paste it into
this browser window where

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.410
it is counted by our word
counting robots, right?

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.320
They're robots.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.840
Jeff-- we have a representative.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.966
Are they cyborgs?

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:55.840
JEFF:They are robots.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.923
CHRIS BATY: Robots, sorry.

00:04:56.923 --> 00:04:58.280
Robots always get confused.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.050
No human characteristics
whatsoever.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.959
So the words are counted,
and then immediately deleted.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.000
So I'm going to repeat
that, for those of you who

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.666
are new to National
Novel Writing Month.

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:15.060
So you spent all of November
toiling away on this book.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.310
You give up contact with
family members, friends,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.350
basic personal hygiene, all in
the quest of writing this epic

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.080
novel, which you
upload to our website,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.370
and it is thrown away without a
human being ever looking at it.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.810
It gets better.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.620
So the prize that you get for
winning National Novel Writing

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.890
Month is this golden PDF
of a winner's certificate

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.100
that you have to download
yourself and write

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.410
your own name on with a pen.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.890
So this is kind of a
curious writing contest,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.480
and it came out of this very
curious time in my life.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.730
So the very first national
novel Writing Month was in 1999,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.990
and I was living in
Oakland, California.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.820
And I think I was just kind
of hungry for some challenge.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.040
I felt like I was like
five years out of college,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.790
and things just nothing
was feeling exciting.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.560
I just was like-- I felt like
I just hadn't done enough.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.370
And I wanted to just
tackle something,

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.880
and I had always loved books.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.330
Always revered authors.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.500
And as much as I
loved reading them,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.280
I really never imagined
that I could write one,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.920
because I just was
like, oh novels

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.880
like those are
written by authors,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.200
and an author has a
different kind of brain

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.240
than the rest of us.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.210
But this idea of writing
a book in a month

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.780
had some appeal, where I was
like, OK whatever happens,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.360
it will be over in 30 days.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.910
And that seemed
appealing, right?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.040
So I sent out an email to all
my friends, and I was like,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.060
who wants to write a 50,000
word novel in a month with me?

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.370
And I was so surprised that
20 of my friends were like,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.720
Yeah let's do this!

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.047
I mean, none of us knew
what we were doing, right?

00:07:05.047 --> 00:07:07.130
The last time I think a
lot of had written fiction

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.320
was in ninth grade
English class,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.170
so we came up with
this strategy.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.270
And the strategy was that we
were going to write together.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.300
And again this was like
a decision was made out

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.230
of fear and
desperation, where like,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.688
if we're going to go down,
we're going to go down together.

00:07:24.688 --> 00:07:27.420
So we started getting together
at coffee shops after work.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.930
So week one starts,
and we're there

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.050
and we're actually--
so in 1999, this

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.350
was not a super common site.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.011
Now it's like laptops
are everywhere,

00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:37.760
but those of you who
were bringing laptops

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.260
into the coffee shops
in 1999, you were weird.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.450
And we were weird, and
people would call us

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.260
the Laptop People
when we would show up.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.012
We would get together in these
coffee shops in Berkeley,

00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:48.720
and we would sit.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.136
We would fill up
a booth, and we'd

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.200
have the backs of
our laptops touching.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.480
And we would be almost like
this freak show exhibit

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.600
where people would always
come over just to look at us.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.290
And then be like, are you
guys playing "Battleship"?

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.030
That was the only
reference we'd get.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.050
Or it was, so we're getting
together, we're writing,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.540
there's a lot of
smack talk, it's fun.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.990
And our books go off the
rails immediately, right?

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.580
It is not turning out into
the dream of the novel,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.592
where we kind of lose
momentum, we lose focus.

00:08:24.592 --> 00:08:26.050
but we stick it
out, because nobody

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.957
wanted to be the person
that did not show up

00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:29.290
for that writing session, right?

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.740
You did not want to be the
coward that didn't make it.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.419
So we kept coming, we kept
making our work counts,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.679
and week two comes and goes,
and then around week three,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.789
this really interesting thing
started happening, which

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.290
is that these books that
we had started completely

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.360
unencumbered with things
like plots, or characters,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.290
or competent storytelling
ability of any kind whatsoever,

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.310
started to come alive.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.310
And those of you who have
written novels kind of

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.490
know that moment when
the electricity starts

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.120
flowing through some writing
project for the first time.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.650
It feels incredible.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.990
And I think, for us, we had
heard about that moment.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.720
We would listen to
these interviews

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.650
with our favorite authors
on "Fresh Air," or the BBC,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.960
and there was always that
moment in the interview,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:28.100
and they would say, In
your latest masterwork,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.150
your protagonist meets
an untimely demise

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.825
at beak of an angry penguin.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.432
And the author says, Yeah.

00:09:43.432 --> 00:09:45.390
And then the interviewer
always says this thing

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.040
that I never fully understood.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.701
He always says, It was so true.

00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:53.450
And the author says,
Thank you, thank you.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.790
And he says, But
I have to ask you,

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.272
how did you pick a penguin?

00:10:00.272 --> 00:10:01.730
And there's this
great-- the author

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.010
kind of rises up to
full authorial majesty,

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.990
and says, Oh, I
didn't pick a penguin.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.780
The penguin picked to me.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.390
And I'd be like, authors!

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.730
They're amazing!

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.430
How do they do this?

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.590
And what I discovered that
first National Novel Writing

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.150
Month was that, if you
start writing a novel,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.220
and you keep writing a novel,
those penguins just come.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:27.720
OK?

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.540
They come for everybody.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.980
You do not need to have
a degree in writing,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.670
you do not need to know
what your story is about.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.730
There's just something
about this process

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.530
of starting a
project and seeing it

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.509
through that unlocks these kind
of amazing parts of ourselves

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:43.800
that we didn't know were there.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.420
So it's 1999, we're
heading into week four.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.290
This penguin-tastic
lifestyle is happening,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.400
and all of us that were writing
together in this coffee shop

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.580
ended up crossing the
50,000 word finish line.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:08.320
And you know the books that
we wrote were not good books.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.340
In industry parlance, I think
they would be called bad books.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:18.300
They were-- we wrote bad
novels, but they were promising.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.890
And I think having started
the month with nothing

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.500
and ended it with a reasonably
unhorrible first draft

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.490
of a novel, I think, to us,
was kind of this revelation.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.220
Because that was when
we realize that novels

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.810
aren't written by novelists.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.050
Novels are written by
everyday people like us

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.880
that give ourselves the
time, the permission,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.580
and encouragement
to write novels.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:49.460
And nothing was the same after
that, because I think all of us

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.410
came out of this
experience thinking,

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.330
if there was a reasonably
unhorrible book in us

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.160
that we didn't know
was there, what else

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.890
might be in there
that we know about?

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.770
So that was the first
National Novel Writing Month,

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.450
and I was like, great
let's bring this back.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.700
I'm going to put up a website.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.075
So the first year's website
was built with an amazing web

00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:13.280
development tool
called Microsoft Word.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.210
Have you guys heard of this?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:15.720
Amazing.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.928
You can do incredible things.

00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:19.090
I built a website
using Microsoft Word.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.940
I think it had two links.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.560
I think one of
those links worked.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.849
So the next year, we put
up an actual website.

00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:27.515
A web developer friend
of mine built it.

00:12:27.515 --> 00:12:28.320
It was nice.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.010
We jumped from 21
people to 140 people,

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.740
and I was just like, oh my god.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.460
It's like, we had clearly peak.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.060
This was incredible.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.090
There are literally
140 human beings

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.750
doing National
Novel Writing Month.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:48.250
And the next year, it went
from 140 to 5,000 people.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.470
So this was amazing, and
this is pre-social media.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.510
So this is all word of
mouth people either writing

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.670
about this on their blogs or
emailing links to each other.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.830
And, because I was expecting
a maybe like 180 people

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.930
to show up the third
year, I did not

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.400
have an automated sign-up
or registration process.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.140
Yeah, I'm seeing some
wincing in the crowd.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.274
Yeah, so imagine this.

00:13:13.274 --> 00:13:15.440
You are running a website
where you have brilliantly

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.210
set up a registration
system where people email

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.060
you their name and
their hometown,

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.650
you then hand alphabetized
that in an HTML page.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.551
You then send them a
personal welcome email

00:13:25.551 --> 00:13:28.050
letting them know that they
have been officially registered.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.250
And then you personally
send them separate email

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.240
inviting them to join
the Yahoo club that we're

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.910
using as a message
board at the time.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.190
So 5,000 people, getting
those people registered

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.419
took us about two weeks of
around the clock working.

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:43.460
And that same group of
people that had been there

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.680
for the penguin-filled
extravaganza

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.790
thankfully showed up again
with a lot of Red Bull,

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.230
and we would have these kind
of all night NaNoWriMo sign-up

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.960
processing parties.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.260
But we ended up kind of
getting everybody registered,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.540
and that was great.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.450
And I think that something
really interesting

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.150
happened, which is
I think the name

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.200
National Novel Writing
Month, that third year

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.770
when, again, there are
time people they don't know

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.850
that this event is run by
this group of over caffeinated

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.890
idiots that don't have any
idea what they're doing,

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.570
and they see this name, right?

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.510
This name is amazing,
and the name sort

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.320
of an inside joke that first
year where it was like there

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.172
are 21 of us all living in
the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:26.630
We do not know how
to write novels,

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.937
we shall call it National
Novel Writing Month, right?

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:33.520
And people the third year look
at this name, and they're like,

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.349
you can't just take a name and
call it like National Something

00:14:36.349 --> 00:14:37.390
Something Month, can you?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.890
Like, this must be like a
federally funded literacy

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:40.992
initiative or something.

00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:42.950
And then they would see
kind of tips and advice

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.130
from the previous year's winners
and they'd be like, all right,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.200
I guess I could do this.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.080
Other people did it,
this seems legit.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.541
So then they did it, and they
had a great month as well,

00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:53.540
and wrote a book that
they wouldn't have written

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.750
otherwise, and so it just kind
of kept snowballing from there.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.850
So the next year, we went
from 5,000 to 14,000, 14,000

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.800
to 24,000.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:09.229
So last year was our 15th
National Novel Writing Month.

00:15:09.229 --> 00:15:11.770
We were very honored to have
the National Novel Writing Month

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:12.540
staff here.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.000
How many people did we have?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.210
JEFF: We had 310
on the main site.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.835
CHRIS BATY: 310,000 adults.

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:22.060
JEFF: Yeah, and then about
closing in at 450,000 total.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.910
CHRIS BATY: OK, so almost a
half a million participants.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.120
We have volunteer run chapters
in 500 cities and towns

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.840
around the world.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.360
So wherever you
are in the world,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.990
there's a chance that there is
a local group of National Novel

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.031
Writing of participants
that you can go and write

00:15:36.031 --> 00:15:37.720
with in November.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.710
We have a Young
Writers program, it's

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:46.580
a free complete novel in a
month extravaganza for kids.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.670
We provide common core mapped
curriculum, free workbooks,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.420
we've got these
amazing progress charts

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.130
that we send out for
free to classrooms.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.500
So if you are classroom that is
teaching National Novel Writing

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.830
Month, you get to put this up.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.205
The kids put their names, they
set their word count goal.

00:16:02.205 --> 00:16:04.830
We do not make second graders
write 50,000 word novels.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.630
They can choose their
word count goal,

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.410
and then the amazing
secret about this

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.484
is that there are
stickers and buttons.

00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:12.150
Those of you who've
been around children

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.410
know they will do anything
for stickers and buttons.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.420
So this has been
amazing, where we now

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.080
have kids in all
these grades that

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.470
are sitting down and writing
their first books in November.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.040
And the great thing about
having a kid or a teen

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.520
write their first
book at that age

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.450
is that it forever
changes their relationship

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.740
to books and writing, right?

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.770
And nothing about
writing is scary again.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.980
When you've written
your first novel

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.390
as a nine-year-old, right, yeah,
no essay, no college entrance,

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.960
none of this is scary.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.100
And it's really just
this wonderful experience

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.570
to see that same joy and
understanding that hit me

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.670
that first year
start to roll out

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.830
in waves across
these classrooms.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.310
So that's been great.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.310
Along the way, we've also
had some really unexpected

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.290
literary successes.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.250
So people that wrote the
first draft of their novel

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.119
in National Novel
Writing Month that

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.560
have gone on to publish it.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.390
So I brought a few of them.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.069
I think it's probably two of
the biggest known that we have.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.230
"The Night Circus" by
Aaron Morgenstern is one.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.140
Another recent one
is by Hugh Howey,

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.190
this book "WOOL."
"Cinder" is another one,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.220
and then this is probably the
most famous National Novel

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.660
Writing Month manuscript, is
"Water for Elephants," which

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.410
was made into a big
Hollywood movie with Reese

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.760
Witherspoon a couple years ago.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.040
And so we've had I think, what?

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.470
Eight, 10 New York Times
bestsellers, or something?

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.553
We've also had hundreds
of traditionally published

00:17:46.553 --> 00:17:47.366
manuscripts.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.740
Anthony Francis
right here is one

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.257
of our widely published
NaNoWriMo writers.

00:17:51.257 --> 00:17:53.090
How many books do you
have out now, Anthony?

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.550
ANTHONY FRANCIS: I have
two novels published,

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.550
and I am editing the third
one for a release date

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.730
early next year.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.859
And the publisher
already has book four,

00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:06.275
which is also hopefully going
to come out early next year.

00:18:06.275 --> 00:18:07.316
CHRIS BATY: That's great.

00:18:07.316 --> 00:18:08.110
That's great.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.620
So we take credit
for all of this.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.471
We-- yeah, we did this.

00:18:11.471 --> 00:18:11.970
Yeah?

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:12.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.670
CHRIS BATY: Right.

00:18:16.752 --> 00:18:18.210
And the kind of
amazing thing, too,

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.120
is just seeing this social
aspect of transforming novel

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.280
writing from this kind
of more isolated activity

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.066
and making it a group thing
has really also created

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:29.190
these communities that live
on throughout the year.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.270
So people from Melbourne
to Singapore to Stockholm

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.950
get together and continue to
work and revise their books

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.350
after this initial big push.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.900
And that's been
wonderful as well.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.300
So I have continued to tackle
it every year since 1999,

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.079
and not ever a year has been
like as crazy and eye opening.

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:52.620
I think the first time you do
National Novel Writing Month is

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.630
a really sweet,
exceptional time.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.570
And there are, I
would say, probably

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.720
of the 15 first drafts
that I've written,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.620
I have not looked at
half of them again.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.420
They're just there
on my hard drive,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.250
but I have learned
something about writing

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.540
from every single one of them.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.690
I would not trade any
of them for the world.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.870
And this is kind of what
I want to talk about now,

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.560
or some of the things I've
learned that I did not

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.730
expect to learn about
writing and novel

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.394
writing from National
Novel Writing Month.

00:19:23.394 --> 00:19:25.810
But I want to start just by
asking, those of you do write,

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.640
what is getting
in the way of you

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.500
being a more productive writer?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.805
Anybody?

00:19:32.805 --> 00:19:33.930
FEAUDIENCE:Not enough time.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.230
CHRIS BATY: Not
having enough time.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.860
Great.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.735
Yeah, a lack of time.

00:19:36.735 --> 00:19:38.000
We're super busy, right?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.881
Yeah.

00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:39.380
Other?

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.680
AUDIENCE: Kids?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.533
CHRIS BATY: Sorry?

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:42.420
AUDIENCE: Kids.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.790
CHRIS BATY: Kids, yeah.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.070
Kids, exactly.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.130
Kids strangely are not
all about giving us

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.939
the space we need
to write our novels.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:50.980
What are some other ones.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.260
Yeah?

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.200
AUDIENCE: Self-consciousness

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.660
CHRIS BATY: What's that?

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.060
AUDIENCE: Self-consciousness

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.620
CHRIS BATY: Self righteousness?

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.650
AUDIENCE: Self-consciousness.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.460
CHRIS BATY: Self-consciousness!

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:56.840
Yeah.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.756
I was like, I love it,
a self-righteous writer

00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:01.170
who is just like I'm just
to self-righteous to write.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.500
Self-consciousness
is great, and that's

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.000
something I struggle
with, where you

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.630
have that sense of is this
really the best I can do?

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.834
Do I belong here?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:10.500
These are great.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.700
What are some other ones?

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.200
Yeah?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.687
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:13.687 --> 00:20:14.770
CHRIS BATY: You have what?

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.510
CHRIS BATY: You just
sit down, And you

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.160
don't know how to start.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.790
Yeah, not knowing what to say.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.290
Yeah?

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.900
AUDIENCE: Lack of
technical skills?

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.608
CHRIS BATY: Yeah.

00:20:22.608 --> 00:20:24.524
Feeling like, OK,
these are words,

00:20:24.524 --> 00:20:25.690
but they're not great words.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.360
This is not-- the
craft of writing

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.930
is not present in what's going
on at my computer right now.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:30.971
What are some other ones?

00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:32.647
Yeah?

00:20:32.647 --> 00:20:34.480
FEAUDIENCE: Not knowing
what to write about?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.860
CHRIS BATY: Yeah,
the ideas, right?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.270
What is worth
writing about, right?

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.686
We read these amazing novels,
and we're just sort of like,

00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:42.620
oh, they had such a
brilliant, beautiful idea.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.700
This all kind of-- the plots
and subplots come together, OK.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.180
So these are great and I
so relate to all of these.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.722
And I'm probably going to touch
on all of these in this things

00:20:52.722 --> 00:20:54.930
that National Novel Writing
Month kind of helps with.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.930
So the number one
thing that I think

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.100
is really great
about NaNoWriMo is

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.560
that it lowers your
expectations for your writing.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.610
So because we're into books,
because we're into reading,

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.950
we have read a lot of really
wonderful pieces of literature.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.300
And when we set out to
write our own books,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.240
unfortunately, we
make the mistake

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.660
of thinking that our novel
should sort of start out

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.620
in that ballpark.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.950
And when our writing strays
from that, and for most of us,

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.630
it strays from that like around
like the second word, right,

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.240
third word maybe--
sometimes you're on a roll

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.720
and you get to the end
of that first sentence,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.770
and feel like I was pretty good.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.145
But you said the
second sentence,

00:21:34.145 --> 00:21:36.000
and it's like, this is not good.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.500
And I think that
the problem is when

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.583
we hit that, we feel like
there's something wrong.

00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:42.460
We take this feedback is either
the idea isn't good enough,

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.800
or we aren't good enough.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.690
And we abandon the project.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.260
And this happens hundreds
of thousands of times

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.310
across writers.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.740
This is endemic.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.870
This outrageously
high expectations

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.770
for what's going to
come out is this burden

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.770
that writers carry with
us into every project

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.730
that we embark on.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.930
So in National
Novel Writing Month,

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.820
the great thing is that output
is really all that matters.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.610
If you write 1667
words that day,

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.320
and they are the worst words
that have ever been written,

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.450
that's great.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.860
You move on.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.260
And I think that's
what you're doing

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.230
is giving yourself permission
to write this deeply

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.270
imperfect, beautifully
flawed book.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.990
And this is such
a powerful place

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:35.620
to write from, because every
first draft, no matter how

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.570
much time you give yourself
to write it, will be flawed.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.270
It's going to be thrillingly
well written in places.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.330
There will be these subplots
that materialize out

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.829
of nowhere, these characters
that rise up and take the story

00:22:47.829 --> 00:22:48.680
and run with it.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.950
There will be things that
you write that you do not

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.950
remember writing in
National Novel Writing Month

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.260
that you will reread in
December and be like,

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.370
oh you think they've
got Pulitzer prizes

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.410
for novel excerpts?

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.370
I would be a shoe-in for this.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.255
But the book also is just
going to suck in places.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.570
The plot is going to
wither, the characters

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.940
are going to bore
you, and the dialogue

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.830
that you write in your
month long novel-- I'm

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.690
seeing some heads nodding
here-- your NaNoWriMo dialogue

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:27.780
is going to feel, at times, like
a remedial language lab tape.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.840
And I brought some of
my actual dialogue,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.550
this is from a very early
NaNoWriMo manuscript,

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.864
just to give you a sense
of what is in store for you

00:23:35.864 --> 00:23:37.530
and to commiserate
with those of you who

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.755
have written this before.

00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:39.380
OK, here we go.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.030
This is two characters.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.530
We've got Eric and Dan,
and Dan speaks first.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:48.040
And he says, "Oh, hello, Eric.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.790
The weather's nice today."

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.680
And then the response, "Yep.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.405
I agree, Dan.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.980
The sun is warm.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:09.370
August is my favorite month."

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.140
So when you write
dialogue like this,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.900
and you will write
dialogue like this,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.330
you really have one
of two choices, OK?

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.420
The first is that you can assume
that familiar fetal position

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.200
underneath your desk,
and you can just kind of

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.030
wait for the crying to stop.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.090
Or the second is
that you can get up,

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.840
and you can pat
yourself on the back

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.392
for having moved, whatever, 19
words closer to your day's word

00:24:38.392 --> 00:24:39.410
count goal.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:44.290
And if you are a Jedi
master, which I am,

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.300
you can make it so Dan did not
hear Eric's original greeting,

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:53.780
forcing him to repeat it, thus
netting you nine more words.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.330
And you can do all
of this knowing

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.316
that the books that
inspired you to write,

00:24:58.316 --> 00:24:59.940
the books that you
love, the books that

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.340
helped you see the world
in a new way, all of them

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.010
had their version of Eric's
and Dan's in the first draft,

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:06.510
right?

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.180
There's a very good
reason they do not

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.830
publish the first
draft of a novel

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.420
alongside the
final draft, right?

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.950
A novel is just
way too complicated

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.440
to nail on the first go around.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.690
And the really
powerful thing to do

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.260
is embrace this
warts-and-all perspective.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.330
Get that beginning,
get that middle,

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.770
and get that end down on
paper, and at that point,

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.560
you really know what
the book is about,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.150
and you can go back
in at that point

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.740
and start working on that
sentence level polishing.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.460
You can shine that
dialogue, do all of that

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.350
once you know what the story
is, and you will save yourself

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.340
so much time in the
revision process.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.890
There's this great saying
that you can revise a bad book

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.960
into a great book, but you
can't revise a blank page

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.880
into anything but a blank page.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.127
And I really feel like
that one of the things

00:25:53.127 --> 00:25:54.710
the National Novel
Writing Month does.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.120
It helps you get over
that fear the blank page

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.421
and helps you get
words down on paper.

00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:01.420
So that's the first thing
National Novel Writing

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.810
Month lowers your expectations.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.560
It's a good thing.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.340
The second is that writing so
much so quickly in this very

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.870
strange way actually
ends up improving

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.950
the quality of your writing.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.920
And this makes no
sense whatsoever,

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.620
but it gets into this
interesting world

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.290
of writerly momentum.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:23.840
So there is this writing coach,
you might have heard of him.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.160
His name was Isaac Newton.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.110
Excellent writer.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.940
So in 1687, he
accidentally wrote

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.810
this amazing book for writers
called the "Mathematical

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.420
Principles of
Natural Philosophy."

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.960
He thought it was about physics.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.620
He was wrong.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.240
This is actually
about novel writing,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.515
and he knocks it right out
of the park, like the "Bird

00:26:41.515 --> 00:26:42.390
by Bird" of its time.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.820
It's amazing.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.278
He was the writing
down your bones,

00:26:44.278 --> 00:26:45.920
and this is what he said.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.750
That first law of
motion, summarized here,

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.350
objects in motion tend to
stay in motion, objects

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.300
at rest of the stay rest, right?

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.520
And we know that
from our own writing

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.320
experiences that it is very easy
to become an object at rest.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.280
So I have spent a
lot of time looking

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.020
at successful
writers, writers who

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.270
are able to produce a
lot, write great books,

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.390
and one thing that I think
that they do exceptionally well

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.920
is harness the
power of momentum.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.270
And this means that they're
not necessarily really writing

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.530
quickly, but they are
writing consistently.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.010
And the great thing about
National Novel Writing Month

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.360
is that you have no
choice but to become

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.510
this literary object in motion.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.500
You have no choice but
to become this kind

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.400
of high velocity,
momentum-powered writer.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.180
And we had this great
pep talk by a YA author

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.340
named Rainbow Rowell that
I wanted to read from.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.250
This is her latest book,
it's called "Fan Girl."

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.810
And this was a National Novel
Writing Month manuscript,

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.490
and so she was writing about
her National Novel Writing Month

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.860
experience, and she says, quote
"Normally, I start each writing

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.000
session by rewriting whatever
I wrote in my last session.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.760
With my NaNoWriMo
project, I picked up

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.870
wherever I'd left off and kept
moving and never looked back.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.410
And what I noticed
right away was

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.750
how easy it was
for me to pick up.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.110
During NaNoWriMo, I never
left the world of the book

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.920
long enough to lose momentum.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.220
I stayed immersed in the
story all month long,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.189
and that made everything comes
so much smoother than usual.

00:28:16.189 --> 00:28:18.230
I got a much quicker grasp
on the main characters

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:24.080
and their voices, and the
plot lines shot forward."

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.400
I think when you write
this novel in 30 days,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.780
you don't have time to
second guess everything

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.870
that you're writing.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.840
That sense of
self-consciousness is not there,

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.530
because there just
isn't room for it.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.430
And as a result, you're
writing becomes looser,

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.810
you give yourself
permission in space

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.360
to try new things with your
writing, you experiment.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.100
You are building
without tearing down,

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.040
you're following tangents
just to see where they lead,

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.650
and as a result, you
end up connecting

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.150
with these characters in a way
that you wouldn't otherwise.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.810
If you approach writing the
way in the off season I do,

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.660
which is kind of parachuting
in and being like,

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.990
oh, god, this is such a mess.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.297
I'm going to-- I'm going to
watch one episode of "Game

00:29:07.297 --> 00:29:09.630
of Thrones," and then I'm
going to get right back to it,

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.130
you know?

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.950
And then two months goes by, and
you kind of parachute in again,

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.370
you're just like, oh,
god, this is really bad.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.050
And I feel like there is
this incredible power that

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.410
comes from being connected
to the story every single day

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.010
for a month.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.350
You're getting things
done a level you never

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.580
would otherwise.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.880
And the writing
actually does end up

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.190
soaring just because you're
in the guts of this thing.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.060
And that's why this
strange rule that when

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.330
you write for quantity
instead of quality,

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.550
you end up getting both.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.400
So that's the second thing
that I think it actually

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.820
does help you write
better in some ways.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.350
And the third one
is the simplest,

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:52.450
which is that it helps you
make time for your writing.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.420
So one of things that somebody
had said, busy being busy,

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.820
work, kids, all this stuff.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.540
The truth is we spend so
much of our time taking care

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.390
of other people's needs
that may be our family,

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.510
might be friends, it
might be work projects

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.624
that we need to turn in, right?

00:30:08.624 --> 00:30:10.540
That's what we're dedicated
to, and we kind of

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.472
have to because either we're
responsible to those people,

00:30:14.472 --> 00:30:16.430
and nobody else is going
to be able to do that,

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.054
or we're getting paid
to do that thing,

00:30:18.054 --> 00:30:19.942
we can't just not show up.

00:30:19.942 --> 00:30:24.240
I think, as a result, though
these things like writing,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.980
or art, or music,
these things actually

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.960
that are incredibly
sustaining to us

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.660
as adults end up forever
getting pushed down

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.390
to the very bottom
of our to do lists,

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.500
where they will
remain indefinitely.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.670
The nice thing about NaNoWriMo
was that, for 30 days,

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.390
we agree hell or
high water, we are

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:50.340
going to orient our lives around
our art rather than vice versa,

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.740
and I want to tell you
why this is so important.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.790
You came to this talk
today, you're in this room,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:57.890
you're in the
narrow club, you're

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.931
thinking about doing
NaNoWriMo, you're definitely

00:30:59.931 --> 00:31:02.330
doing NaNoWriMo, whatever
it is, you're doing it

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.280
because this idea of
creativity and writing

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.950
is interesting or
important to you.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:15.740
And our time on this
planet is really short,

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.380
and every year
that we are alive,

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.657
a new book becomes
possible, right?

00:31:20.657 --> 00:31:22.490
We have this new
understanding in the world.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.370
We're surrounded by this new
cast of characters, right?

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.760
We have all of these
inspirations and influences.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.660
And every year
that we are alive,

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.740
a book that we might have
written and did not write

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.110
slips away.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.070
And the thing that
I love about knowing

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.520
that every year, there's
this challenge of bashing out

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.930
this 50,000 word
novel in November

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:52.610
is that it forces us to
capture one of these stories

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.730
that only we can write.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.890
And that does great
things for us.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.400
I mean, I know in my
experience, this idea

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.480
of being creative and
really immersing myself

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.130
one of these projects really
does, it makes me feel happier.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.380
I feel like I have more
time rather than less.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.850
It makes me see life just in a
more interesting, engaged way.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:16.330
And that's great, and that's
a success on a personal level,

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.720
but I think it is
also you doing this,

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.430
you making time to do
this, and you prioritizing

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.970
this is a favor to
the world, as well.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:28.490
Because whatever project you
are thinking about working on,

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.010
whatever this thing is
that you've been mauling,

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.730
there are people
out there that have

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.770
been waiting their whole lives
to read that thing, right?

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.215
They are waiting for that story.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.070
And I think it's just so
important to remember,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.290
with everything else
going on in our lives,

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.480
that your voice is
really important.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.540
Your story really does matter.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:58.050
And I wish everybody an amazing
and over-caffeinated November

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.010
getting the first draft
of that story written.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.260
Thank you guys very much.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:08.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.440
Does anybody have
any questions first,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.360
before we get into kind of
like tips for NaNoWriMo?

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.960
The question was, what
sparked me to start NaNoWriMo?

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.302
I mean, I think for me--
so I'm an only child,

00:33:19.302 --> 00:33:21.385
and books were really like
my siblings growing up.

00:33:21.385 --> 00:33:23.560
I read so many books,
and there's nothing

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.130
more magical than a book to me.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.130
And so I think when I hit
this point in my life,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.020
that sort of like quarter life
crisis point where I was like,

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.260
I have nothing meaningful
in my life, you know?

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.900
I think books were
natural go-to where

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.340
it's like I want
to try that thing.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.190
And I think that, more
than anything else,

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.030
is just that sense
of reverence or magic

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.403
that I felt about books is what
inspired me to give it a shot.

00:33:45.403 --> 00:33:46.694
AUDIENCE: How many is this now?

00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:48.290
Because this is the first
year I've heard of it.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.248
CHRIS BATY: Yeah, how
many times has National--

00:33:50.248 --> 00:33:54.130
this will be the 15th annual,
the 16th National Novel Writing

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.850
Month.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.567
It's been happening is 1999.

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.015
Yeah.

00:33:58.015 --> 00:33:58.515
Yeah?

00:33:58.515 --> 00:33:59.980
AUDIENCE: Why November?

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.854
CHRIS BATY: Yeah, so
that's a great question.

00:34:01.854 --> 00:34:03.000
Why November?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.760
So we started it in July.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.180
That was the first
year, which is

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.770
an amazing month for
students and teachers, right?

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.690
But for everybody else, it tends
to be kind of the only time

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:17.489
you have to be on
vacation, so that

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.770
was-- the next year came around,
and people were on vacation.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.520
And so we kept trying
like subsequent months.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.520
In August was no good, September
nope, October, and then we

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.739
settled on November.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:32.870
So it's just pure
vacation happenstance.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.670
Which NaNoWriMo project
have I been most proud of?

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.260
I really-- I would say of them,
maybe three or four I've really

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.170
just loved and felt
like, oh my god.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.320
This could be a real book.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:48.000
And I've been working on one
now that I started two years ago

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.760
that is the heartwarming
tale of two monsters

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.280
who find a VHS tape and
set out to the human world

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.550
to return it to its owner.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.530
So soon to be an Oprah
Book Club selection.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.399
And I really-- I
feel like that's

00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:04.565
the thing is like, whatever
your current project is,

00:35:04.565 --> 00:35:05.940
is always the most
kind of exciting one,

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.520
so that's one I've
been working on.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.020
Yeah?

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.770
CHRIS BATY: That's
a great question.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:10.910
OK.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.490
Why novels?

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:12.450
Why not short stories?

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.491
The nice thing about
National Novel Writing Month

00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:17.530
is, in fact, we do have people
writing short stories as well.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.681
And you can really--
there are people

00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:21.805
that are sort of drafting
on National Novel Writing

00:35:21.805 --> 00:35:24.872
Month's deadline and energy
working on Ph.D. dissertations.

00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:26.330
They're working on
memoirs, they're

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.480
working on short stories.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.840
And it really is
kind of-- there's

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.270
a kind of room
for everybody that

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.662
wants to do a writing
project underneath that tent.

00:35:35.662 --> 00:35:37.870
What do traditional novelists
have to say about this?

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:38.750
So it's been interesting.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.374
At first, National
Novel Writing Month,

00:35:40.374 --> 00:35:42.900
nobody really knew about it,
so nobody had an opinion.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.730
And then it's-- it kind of
grew to this thing where more

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:51.380
and more people were doing it,
and probably around year six

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.250
or seven, there was enough
critical mass that people

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.690
started noticing was there
and making fun of it,

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.940
which I was honored by.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.130
Where I was like,
oh, this is great!

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.420
So it's been a real mix
where I think at first,

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.430
there was this concern that
we were ruining literature

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.970
forever.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.080
And

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:09.530
FEAUDIENCE: Single-handedly.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.405
CHRIS BATY: Right,
single-handedly destroying

00:36:11.405 --> 00:36:12.445
culture.

00:36:12.445 --> 00:36:14.820
I think because we had this
sort of lighthearted approach

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.374
to it where we were definitely,
absolutely committed

00:36:18.374 --> 00:36:20.040
to the process, but
I think we were also

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.770
kind of giving
ourselves space to sort

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.169
of laugh about the
ups and downs of it.

00:36:24.169 --> 00:36:25.960
But it's been pretty
amazing over the years

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.190
as more and more
professional novelists now

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.000
use National Novel
Writing Month, they're

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.790
under book contract, they need
to turn in 50,000 words more

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.830
than anybody.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.340
So we're now having
this really great mix

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.440
of professional writers and
first time amateur writers

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.050
coming together,
but we still do,

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:43.500
every couple years,
there's some epic story

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.400
about how we're like
killing kittens,

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.700
and this is the worst thing
that could happen world.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.650
AUDIENCE: NaNoWrongMo.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.850
CHRIS BATY:
NaNoWrongMo, exactly.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:52.560
Yeah.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.835
But I think it's hard
at a certain point,

00:36:54.835 --> 00:36:56.710
it's just kind of hard
to argue with the fact

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:59.530
that this is almost 4
billion words of fiction,

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.189
and this is a
meaningful experience

00:37:01.189 --> 00:37:02.480
to the people who are doing it.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.852
And a lot of people write
their NaNoWriMo novels

00:37:04.852 --> 00:37:06.560
without any intention
of publishing them.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.240
This is not like step one in
a global takeover of "The New

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.800
York Times" bestseller list.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.620
This is really just a personal
sense of joy and satisfaction

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.060
they get, and
that's all they want

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.577
is to either do
it for themselves

00:37:18.577 --> 00:37:20.660
or maybe do and share it
with some family members.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.420
So.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.355
Yeah?

00:37:22.355 --> 00:37:24.980
Yeah, so the question is how do
you have that balance where you

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.890
have this cast of
characters, and it's

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:30.310
like how do you tell the
story in a compelling way

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.972
where each of them
get some screen time?

00:37:33.972 --> 00:37:35.430
That's such a great
question, and I

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:39.180
feel like, to me, that is
almost a question I think about

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.880
and revisions.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.940
So the first revision,
like the first draft to me

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.830
is like this anything goes.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.685
There may be just like
two characters that

00:37:45.685 --> 00:37:48.060
are hogging the screen time,
and the third very important

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.643
character will show
up, have one line,

00:37:49.643 --> 00:37:51.170
and then like
mysteriously vanish.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.650
That's like being sent off on
a very important expedition,

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.760
and then just like
left field, gone.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.890
And I think that for me,
the most important thing

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.750
is like really getting
your story down.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.600
The full arc of it
down, and then seeing

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.310
kind of what characters are
needed, and where they are,

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:11.100
and that's a huge and
interesting question, and one

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.179
that writers really
struggle with on all drafts.

00:38:14.179 --> 00:38:15.970
But I think in particular,
that first draft

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.500
of hitting the balance,
it's just-- it's hard.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.660
I would just say,
read books that you

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.067
feel like you
really nailed that,

00:38:22.067 --> 00:38:24.400
and I've been really getting
into story structure, which

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.149
is something that I
never was into before.

00:38:26.149 --> 00:38:28.720
They're like story structure
for nerds out there that break.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.320
There's like the hero's
journey, and the 3x structure

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.390
versus the 4x structure versus
the 9x structure versus the 49

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:37.946
memes of storytelling.

00:38:37.946 --> 00:38:40.070
But I think just also
starting to look a little bit

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.179
about the way books but
you love are structured,

00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:43.720
and how they deploy
their characters,

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.678
has always been useful.

00:38:44.678 --> 00:38:47.470
But that's a great
question, a big one.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.280
So the question of dialogue.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.690
It's how do you know
if it's good or bad?

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:55.030
And I would just
say, let it be bad.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.790
And then, you're right,
and then again, I

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.400
would say like let that be
on the page, find your story,

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.191
and get through the
end, and then come back

00:39:01.191 --> 00:39:04.220
and you're so right, that
dialogue in both books

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.680
and movies is not realistic.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.870
If it were realistic, it
would bore us to tears,

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.860
because most of what we say is
not that interesting, right?

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.860
So it's this shaped thing
where somehow, there's

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.568
a little bit of conflict
that's happening

00:39:14.568 --> 00:39:16.200
in all of these
scenes, but I think

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.290
you can go back through
and kind of know what

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.380
the goal of each scene is
once you've written it,

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.691
and kind of hone the
dialogue towards that.

00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:23.690
That's a great question.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.790
So the question was tell
more about the Young Writers

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:26.670
program in schools.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.820
I want to, though,
quickly say the thing

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.610
that I would say
about good dialogue,

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:33.497
reading it out loud helps a ton.

00:39:33.497 --> 00:39:36.080
So when you're done with it, go
back through and read out loud

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:36.790
to find the pace.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:38.212
I'm going to turn this question
about the Young Writers

00:39:38.212 --> 00:39:39.760
program for him over
to the NaNoWriMo staff.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.009
You guys want to weigh in on--

00:39:41.009 --> 00:39:41.880
GRANT:Yeah.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.110
We have about 100,000
kids and teens sign up

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.580
for the Young Writers
program website.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.410
And we ship free
classroom materials

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.887
to 2,000 classrooms
around the world.

00:39:50.887 --> 00:39:52.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.600
GRANT: We're out.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.510
Yeah, but anyway.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.435
Yeah, so we support
them, and there are also

00:39:57.435 --> 00:39:59.810
like free resources on the
website, like you can download

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.150
a free workbook, there
are virtual classrooms

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.130
on the website for
teachers to use.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.520
And what's great
about NaNoWriMo is

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.770
that we have a staff of eight
and a very small budget,

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:11.910
so we can't go in to
all these 2000 schools,

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.130
but we give them the
foundation to teach it.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.760
And so they take it,
and they're going

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.540
to apply it to their classrooms
with their own style.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.100
And a lot of
teachers-- what I love

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.117
is that they'll take September
and October to like think

00:40:24.117 --> 00:40:25.950
about writing a novel,
and planning a novel,

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:28.710
and building a community of
writers in their classroom.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.210
They'll write the
novel in November,

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.440
and then they'll use
that for revision.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.990
And then later on
we have sponsors

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.810
who give free copies
of self-publish books.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.820
So it's amazing to
me because NaNoWriMo

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.500
wasn't around when
I was a teenager,

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.060
so I wouldn't even
fathom writing a novel.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.860
I didn't do that
until my late '20s.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.300
And I talk to teens who've
written six or seven novels

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.950
by the time they graduate from
high school and published them,

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.677
so it's a really amazingly
successful program.

00:40:55.677 --> 00:40:57.760
CHRIS BATY: Has NaNoWriMo
been replicated anywhere

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.218
outside the English
speaking world?

00:40:59.218 --> 00:41:01.680
Yeah, I would say-- I
mean, how many languages?

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.909
Maybe 30 languages?

00:41:03.909 --> 00:41:05.450
People are writing
all over the world

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.420
in their native languages.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.920
So if you go to the Icelandic
form of National Novel Writing

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.862
Month, there's people
posting in Icelandic.

00:41:11.862 --> 00:41:13.570
And we have chapters
in all those places.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.289
So you could go to
Reykjavik, or Moscow, and--

00:41:16.289 --> 00:41:17.580
GRANT: 200 different countries.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.780
CHRIS BATY: 200
different countries.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.250
Yeah, so that's a good question.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.749
I think National
Novel Writing Month

00:41:22.749 --> 00:41:26.500
is like unrivaled at
helping people turn off

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.130
that inner editor and get
that rough draft down, right?

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.010
And then the question
is, so this year, we're

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.720
probably going to have close
to 40,000 winners, right?

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.290
So 40,000 will write
50,000 words or more.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.750
And in the past, we just
didn't really have this.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.627
The staff is a very small staff.

00:41:41.627 --> 00:41:43.710
We do year-round programming,
but we didn't really

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.550
have much of like-- so, how do
you help people revise that?

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.800
Because that process will at
least take a year, probably,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.080
be many years.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.760
And so this is where I think
the National Novel Writing Month

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.051
staff has done an amazing
job in the last couple years.

00:41:57.051 --> 00:41:59.700
You want to talk about
sort of what happens,

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.272
how do we help people,
after November ends,

00:42:02.272 --> 00:42:03.230
do something with this?

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.060
GRANT: Yeah, is
this working now?

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:04.840
OK.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.250
Yeah, we have this program.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.790
It's a nascent
program that we've

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.440
been testing called "I
wrote a novel, now what?"

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.334
And so we try to keep
the spirit of NaNoWriMo

00:42:14.334 --> 00:42:16.750
but apply it to revision, which
is a little bit different.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.720
And so I think
a-- and it happens

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.264
in January and February, and
you basically, after NaNoWriMo,

00:42:22.264 --> 00:42:24.680
you sign a pledge that you're
going to revise your novels.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.680
That's the key thing,
accountability.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.730
And we provide
resources on our blog,

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.680
we kind of create conversations
in our online forums,

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.160
we hold tweet chats with
agents or published authors,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.180
we hold webcasts.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.995
So we try to reach people in
a variety of different ways.

00:42:39.995 --> 00:42:41.870
And one thing we're
really trying to build on

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.180
is that now I think what makes
NaNoWriMo so special and so

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.420
strong is the
community of writers.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.630
We have a fantastic
community of writers.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.210
And so we want to find ways
to keep building on that,

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.920
so the people aren't just there
to discuss writing in November,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.840
but to create a year
long conversation.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.412
So we're building various tools
online to make that happen.

00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:01.120
CHRIS BATY: Yeah.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.320
And It's so important.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.861
And that's the thing
I would say too,

00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:05.990
that if you do National
Novel Writing Month, that's

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.140
just like an
incredible adventure.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.450
But it's really the first phase
of this much longer adventure

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.730
of continuing to
revise this book

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.610
and eventually sharing
it with readers,

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.290
which is just so satisfying.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.020
So the question is
you have 50,000 words

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.270
is it a good target?

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.260
I think that it is good
in that we get complaints

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.870
from both sides, where some
people say that's too long,

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.636
it's exhausting, you
are writing so much,

00:43:30.636 --> 00:43:32.010
and then we have
other people who

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.752
say that's not even a novel.

00:43:33.752 --> 00:43:36.210
We have people every year that
complain that the word count

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.160
graph ends at, what,
half a million words?

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.960
500,000 words, it's capped.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.340
And we get complaints
about that.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.610
People that want to be
writing 800,000 words,

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.660
there are people who
do their entire 50,000

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.581
words in the first 24 hours.

00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:51.080
Yeah.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:51.900
AUDIENCE: I don't know how.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.350
CHRIS BATY: Yeah.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.586
CHRIS BATY: They-- yeah,
they've got like seven arms

00:43:55.586 --> 00:43:57.550
and they're just like whaaa.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.600
So I think the nice thing
about-- so ultimately,

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.740
so you look at a book like
"Water for Elephants," OK?

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.460
So this, I would
say, this is probably

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.360
that's probably
100,000 word novel.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.480
So 50,000 words,
unless you're writing

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.414
a kind of specific
kind of genre fiction,

00:44:13.414 --> 00:44:15.080
you're not going to
stop at 50,000 words

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.820
and have your whole arc.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.010
You're going to end
up adding to it.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:18.884
But I think the nice
thing about 50,000 words

00:44:18.884 --> 00:44:20.930
is that you can get
this beginning, middle,

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.890
and end within a month, and
then go in and kind of start

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:26.520
expanding from there.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.570
The funny thing about
that 50,000 word goal--

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.430
so the book that I
grabbed when I was

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.890
like, how long is
this going to be?

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.210
This is 1999.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.070
I'm looking at my
bookshelf and I'm like,

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.890
I need to find the shortest
novel that is legitimately

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:38.700
a novel.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.690
And so I saw this guy, which was
like, hello, "Brave New World."

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.056
And so this is "Brave New
World" by Aldous Huxley,

00:44:45.056 --> 00:44:46.430
and so I counted
the words in it,

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.575
and then it took
me awhile, somehow,

00:44:48.575 --> 00:44:50.200
and this was not
until much afterwards,

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.770
that I realized I somehow had
picked up the movie tie-in

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:54.270
edition.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.390
There's like an NBC
miniseries that actually

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.470
has a lot of photos in
the middle of Robert

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.125
Redford in kind of like onesies.

00:45:00.125 --> 00:45:01.640
FEAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.880
CHRIS BATY: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.650
Yeah.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.270
So the original
count of 50,000 words

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.050
may have been a
little off base, based

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:11.030
on the photographs in
this version of the book,

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:14.660
but I think it's a great
amount in that you can do it

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.430
without really-- it
doesn't kill you to do it,

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.310
but you really have to
be focused about it.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.530
Yeah, the great question.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.740
So the question is, do you tend
to just write linearly or do

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.120
you jump around?

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.540
I think it varies by writer.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.120
I tend to write
from the beginning

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.650
and through to the
end, but I do find

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.920
that if I'm getting
into this middle part,

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.310
and the month is kind of
starting to get away from me,

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:38.540
I will skip ahead.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.790
And it's just so much
easier to revise, I think,

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.197
when you do you have
all those parts,

00:45:43.197 --> 00:45:44.530
and you're just doing an infill.

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.735
So I would say
whatever works for you.

00:45:46.735 --> 00:45:48.360
Those of you who have
done this before,

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.930
what do you guys recommend?

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:50.760
Jumping around?

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.299
OK.

00:45:51.299 --> 00:45:53.340
GRANT: If you hit a wall,
you got to keep moving.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.681
So that's the way I do it.

00:45:54.681 --> 00:45:56.180
CHRIS BATY: Yeah,
Anthony, go ahead.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.420
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Jump around.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.100
So you start with some
kind of inspiration,

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.490
but then it's going to make
you think of things that you

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.390
will have never thought of.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:07.290
You're in NaNo, you
can't lose that.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.250
So you have to write it
as soon as you get it.

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:09.780
CHRIS BATY: Yeah.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.904
I would just say, I think
momentum is so important.

00:46:11.904 --> 00:46:14.744
And really, whatever it takes
to keep you moving forward

00:46:14.744 --> 00:46:15.410
with that story.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:17.419
It's all about making
decisions, and that's

00:46:17.419 --> 00:46:19.210
the hardest thing with
a novel, because you

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.110
want to wreck it, right?

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.734
You're like, oh this
is so good so far,

00:46:21.734 --> 00:46:23.244
I don't want to
make a bad decision

00:46:23.244 --> 00:46:24.660
and take it in
this bad direction.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.350
But the truth is,
there are really

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:27.910
no wrong directions
in a first draft.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.890
Just make the decision,
go, you can always

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.410
go back and change it.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:32.370
Where are they now?

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.830
OK, so of the original
crew, where are they now?

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:40.350
So people that did it that
first year are still doing it.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.010
Most of them have taken
a couple years off.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.110
They kind of dip back in again.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:47.920
I would say almost all of
them have won at least three

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.020
more times since then.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.490
But again, most people do not
see themselves as writers,

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:54.110
and a couple of
them hate writing.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.230
They're like, I hate this.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:57.640
And then they're like, yeah
I'm going to do it again.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.050
it just somehow gets in
your blood, you know?

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:04.322
But of those, yeah I
would say they continued

00:47:04.322 --> 00:47:05.780
to do National
Novel Writing Month.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.882
None of them have
published a novel, though.

00:47:07.882 --> 00:47:11.080
I'm leaning on them and myself.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.310
That is a great question.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.870
So NaNoWriMo is a grassroots
donations funded nonprofit.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.800
And individual donations
are really huge.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.550
Google has been
wonderful contributor

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.570
through the matching
gifts program.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.810
We are a registered
501(c)3 charity.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.850
Grant, you want to
talk about the name

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:27.170
they should be looking for?

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.404
GRANT: Yeah, so it's
National Novel Writing Month,

00:47:29.404 --> 00:47:31.570
we changed our name from
Office of Letters and Light

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.870
to officially National
Novel Writing Month now.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.410
Anthony's a donor
right here, and you

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:37.810
can donate on our
website there's

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.320
a Donate tab at the top.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.891
And so we run largely
on individual donations.

00:47:42.891 --> 00:47:44.140
We're a very unique nonprofit.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.860
We don't rely heavily on
grants, so I think about 55%

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.860
of our revenue comes
from individual donors,

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.490
and those are people are
just participate in the event

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:54.300
and love it and want
to support writing.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.170
CHRIS BATY: Yeah,
and that money does

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.220
go to both the kids and teens
program, and the adult program,

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.860
so any donation
helps tremendously.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.530
And continue to keep
this thing running.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.570
Well, OK, so how
many of you are now

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:11.720
on board with this idea
of giving it a shot?

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.220
OK.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.300
I like this, all right.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.496
So in the local--
those of you who

00:48:16.496 --> 00:48:18.370
have been part of the
Google NaNoWriMo group,

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.510
how can people get
involved here Google?

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.134
Does anyone want to share?

00:48:22.134 --> 00:48:24.050
ANTHONY FRANCIS: The one
I'm familiar with is,

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.810
there's a creative
writing fiction

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.410
list that people
on that try to do.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.420
Are there others?

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.720
CHERYL: There's also a
NaNoWriMo at Google group.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.530
So feel free to join, you can
find this in groups as well.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.890
And we'll probably have
write-ins for this November,

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:42.282
and then band together and
try to hammer this out.

00:48:42.282 --> 00:48:44.740
CHRIS BATY: Yeah, and I would
say if you are interested, so

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.420
has is also kindly subsidize.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.370
It looks like they bought
a whole table full.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.560
This is my guidebook to
writing a novel in 30 days.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.060
It's got tips and
advice from people

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.893
who have done it a
bunch, it's got pep talks

00:48:54.893 --> 00:48:57.860
from some of these authors
that have had great success.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.070
It's probably the best book
in the English language.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.959
and it's out there on the table,
so if this sounds interesting,

00:49:03.959 --> 00:49:06.000
and you'd like just a
little guidance through it,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.900
this is sort of
like a travel guide

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.520
to your month in NaNo Land.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.590
So thank you guys so
much for your attention

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.260
and have a great writing time.
