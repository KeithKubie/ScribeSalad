00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.601
- [Voiceover] Now we're gonna
talk about the two forms

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.279
of the Inductor Equation and get

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.161
familiar with these things.

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:08.236
I'm gonna do some examples to show you how

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:10.561
the Inductor Equations work.

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.199
So, we know that the
Inductor Equation is the

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.616
voltage across an inductor is

00:00:16.738 --> 00:00:20.738
a factor called L, the
inductance, times di, dt.

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:25.340
So the voltage is proportional

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.173
to the slope or the rate
of change of current.

00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:32.416
Let me do a quick review
of the two letters

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.029
that are used as variables for inductors.

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:37.029
When we have a resistor,

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:39.662
we have, we have a,

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:40.999
we call it a R,

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.692
and it's in units of ohms,

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:45.692
and that's named after Ohm, himself.

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:50.027
And when we have a capacitor,

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:52.793
the units are c, for capacitance,

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:54.876
and f for faraday, farad,

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:59.231
that's named after Michael Faraday.

00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:01.927
For the inductor, we have two

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.427
other letters we use, L and H,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:07.671
and L is the name of the component,

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.690
and that's named after
Lenz, Heinrich Lenz,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.027
and he did some research in induction,

00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:16.860
and the unit is named after Henry,

00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:22.879
and so that's the
corresponding R, c, and L

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:24.243
are the names of the components,

00:01:24.243 --> 00:01:27.910
and ohms, farads, and
henries are the units.

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:31.641
Okay, let's get back to our inductor.

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.381
There's another form of
the inductor equation

00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:36.795
where we write it in terms of just i,

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.388
in terms of v,

00:01:38.388 --> 00:01:39.671
and to get to that point,

00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:42.088
we need to get rid of
this derivative here.

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:43.838
So, what we, what I'm gonna do

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:47.051
is take the integral of
both sides of this equation.

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:49.617
So, we take the integral of v,

00:01:49.617 --> 00:01:51.367
with respect to time,

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:54.984
and that equals L times

00:01:56.828 --> 00:01:59.078
take the integral of di, dt

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.470
with respect to time,

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:09.190
and these two terms go away,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.425
and have the integral of di,

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:14.323
the antiderivative of di is, is

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:18.001
what, what function
has a derivative of di?

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.171
And that would be just i.

00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:23.185
So, let me flip this all around here now.

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:26.473
I'm gonna write i, on the left side

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:27.890
equals one over L

00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:31.060
times the integral of v, dt.

00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:37.163
Now we always put limits on this integral,

00:02:37.163 --> 00:02:39.923
so the limits in this case are

00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:42.490
time is goes from minus infinity

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.312
till some time now, and
this tells us that the, ah,

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:48.287
that the current through an inductor

00:02:48.287 --> 00:02:51.240
depends on the voltage
across that inductor

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.771
for the entire life

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.737
all the way back to time
equals minus infinity, and

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:57.402
that's not so convenient.

00:02:57.402 --> 00:02:58.710
We don't want to track this,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.480
the inductor's voltage
back that far in time.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.701
So what we'll do instead is we'll,

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.320
we'll say, let's say at t equals zero,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.794
that we know the vol,
that we know the current,

00:03:09.794 --> 00:03:10.870
that we know some,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.787
we know some i of zero.

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.159
And then we can change the limits on our,

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.742
our integral here to
be zero on the bottom.

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.359
One over L, integral from
time is zero until now

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.517
time t, big T,

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:31.420
of v of T times dt.

00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.856
In order to account for
everything that's happened

00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:38.710
before time equals zero,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.321
we'll just say, what was the current

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:41.820
at time equals zero?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.487
So that's i of zero.

00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:47.422
And I'll do one more little change.

00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:50.350
I, I, I want this variable up here to be

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.347
small t, and that means
I have to replace this t

00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:56.219
inside here with some other symbol as a,

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.229
as a dummy variable,
and so now I'm gonna get

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.562
i of t, little t

00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:04.728
one over L, integral from zero

00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:08.048
to little t of vd,

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:13.188
let's just call it Tao,

00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:15.655
plus i of zero.

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:20.878
So this is the integral form.

00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:23.962
There's the integral form
of the inductor equation

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:26.770
and here is the derivative form.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.617
And we'll use both these.

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:28.710
What I'm gonna do now,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.255
is we're gonna do an exercise

00:04:30.255 --> 00:04:32.922
where we use this one down here.

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:36.887
So, in our circuit we
have a voltage source

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:39.720
with a time pattern voltage in it,

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.821
and we have a current
going through this thing.

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.109
And we wanna find out,
what's this current?

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:52.315
So, we're connected to a inductor.

00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:54.709
It's a 10 millihenry inductor

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:56.440
and the voltage waveform is,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.858
it starts at zero,

00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:59.507
at time equals zero,

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:02.033
the, the voltage goes up to two volts,

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:05.385
then after two milliseconds
it goes to minus two volts.

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:07.177
After two more milliseconds,

00:05:07.177 --> 00:05:11.303
it goes to plus two volts and on and on.

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:12.783
So, we know v of t,

00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:14.487
and what we're going to
figure out is, what's,

00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:16.757
what's i through the, in the inductor?

00:05:16.757 --> 00:05:17.590
And to do that,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.343
we're gonna use our, our

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:21.121
inductor equation here, the integral

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.621
form of the inductor equation.

00:05:26.035 --> 00:05:29.202
So I actually need some
room on the screen here, so

00:05:29.202 --> 00:05:33.035
let me take a second and
clean out some stuff.

00:05:38.424 --> 00:05:40.424
Okay, we're ready to go.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:42.910
So let's look at what's going on here

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.317
before time equals zero.

00:05:44.317 --> 00:05:45.681
So, in the before state,

00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:46.836
we're gonna make an assumption.

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:48.363
We're gonna assume that

00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:50.530
i is zero a long time ago,

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.072
and if we look at our chart, here,

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:56.739
it says that v is zero, as well.

00:05:57.733 --> 00:05:59.332
And if I take this fact

00:05:59.332 --> 00:06:02.239
and I look at this equation right here,

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:03.788
if v is zero,

00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:05.955
L is some positive number,

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:09.741
so we can say that,

00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:10.682
so then we know that

00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:12.265
di, dt equals zero.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.648
So this circuit is
pretty much doing nothing

00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:20.648
before this waveform starts working.

00:06:23.763 --> 00:06:27.760
Over here I'm gonna
make a little time chart

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.737
of what, what we discover.

00:06:30.737 --> 00:06:34.654
That's time, and this'll
be, ah, current, here.

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:40.666
So before zero, before time is zero,

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.047
we can say that the current is zero.

00:06:43.047 --> 00:06:45.473
Now, we've plotted in
part of our, our curve.

00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:46.557
Okay, now something happens.

00:06:46.557 --> 00:06:49.574
Now the voltage goes up two volts,

00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:51.079
and we're gonna use this equation,

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.270
the integral form of the,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.429
the inductor equation to
figure out what happens

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:58.679
to i of t now that voltage has changed.

00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:02.018
So, we can say that i

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.347
equals one over L

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:08.532
times the integral from zero,

00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:11.699
times zero is our starting point here,

00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:16.345
to t, some time t of v of t.

00:07:19.187 --> 00:07:22.600
Now, v, in this little
region of time here,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.350
is two volts plus two

00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:28.851
times d Tao plus i zero,

00:07:32.847 --> 00:07:34.498
and we decided i zero was the current

00:07:34.498 --> 00:07:36.804
that it started at right there;

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:38.054
i zero is zero.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.356
Let's keep working on this.

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:43.773
We can say that i

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.283
equals one over 10 millihenries

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:53.546
times the two comes out of the integral,

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:54.858
and now it's the integral

00:07:54.858 --> 00:07:56.858
from zero to t of d Tao.

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:01.583
And the zero goes away,

00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:07.312
that equals two over 10
millihenries times what?

00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:12.214
What's this integral evaluate to?

00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:14.327
It evaluates to t.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.951
Integral of d Tao between zero and t

00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:20.618
is t minus zero or just plain t.

00:08:22.883 --> 00:08:24.183
So looking at this, I see that

00:08:24.183 --> 00:08:26.516
i equals a constant times t,

00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:30.298
and that's the equation of a line.

00:08:30.298 --> 00:08:31.504
That's the equation of a line

00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:33.504
if I plot it on t and i,

00:08:35.253 --> 00:08:38.773
so two over 10 millihenries is the slope,

00:08:38.773 --> 00:08:40.160
and to plot that line,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.561
what I need is two points on the line.

00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.103
I know one of the points already.

00:08:44.103 --> 00:08:44.936
I know one of the points is gonna be

00:08:44.936 --> 00:08:47.019
right there at zero zero.

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:51.412
What is the current at the
end of this pulse here?

00:08:51.412 --> 00:08:52.635
So, at two milliseconds,

00:08:52.635 --> 00:08:54.629
let's figure out what the current is,

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:57.938
and that equals, at two milliseconds it's

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:00.105
two times two milliseconds

00:09:02.561 --> 00:09:04.811
divided by 10 millihenries.

00:09:07.343 --> 00:09:09.794
The millis cancel themselves out

00:09:09.794 --> 00:09:11.961
and I get four over 10, or

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.693
zero point four, what, Amperes.

00:09:18.378 --> 00:09:20.378
So, at two milliseconds,

00:09:24.342 --> 00:09:26.592
the value of the current is

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.167
point four amperes, and I can
draw a straight between there.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.832
So now we have the value of the current

00:09:37.832 --> 00:09:40.972
during this first excursion,

00:09:40.972 --> 00:09:44.484
this first part of the voltage waveform.

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:45.636
Now, we're gonna switch again.

00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:47.112
Now we have a new i zero.

00:09:47.112 --> 00:09:50.195
Let's, let's go to a new point, here.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.709
Let's go to a new point,
at, now we have i,

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:57.792
i zero equals point four,

00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:03.242
and we have v equals what?

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:08.575
Now it goes to minus two volts,

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:12.345
minus two volts, so let's use our inductor

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.039
equation one more time

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:18.141
with these, with these,
ah, initial conditions

00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:20.891
that tells us i equals one over L

00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:25.923
integral from, what's the new point?

00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:28.851
Two milliseconds to t

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.930
and v of t after two milliseconds is

00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:38.828
minus two volts, minus two d Tao

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:46.664
plus, now we have a starting current.

00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:50.081
Our starting current was point four amps.

00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:53.078
Zero point four amps.

00:10:56.134 --> 00:10:57.538
And let's continue on here.

00:10:57.538 --> 00:11:00.871
Let's, ah, maybe can squeeze it in here;

00:11:03.302 --> 00:11:06.052
i equals one over 10 millihenries

00:11:09.223 --> 00:11:12.140
times minus two times the integral,

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:19.909
the integral from two
milliseconds to t of d Tao

00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:26.555
plus zero point four;

00:11:31.434 --> 00:11:34.184
i equals minus two over 10 millis

00:11:36.783 --> 00:11:38.459
times, what is this?

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.542
It's again, it's t minus,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.217
t minus two milliseconds plus point four,

00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:55.373
and again, we have the equation of a line.

00:11:55.373 --> 00:11:57.764
This is the equation of a line, i,

00:11:57.764 --> 00:12:00.470
there's a constant times t,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.649
there's a con, a,

00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:04.181
followed by a constant.

00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.798
And this is basically a sloping line.

00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:08.388
It has a negative slope,

00:12:08.388 --> 00:12:11.635
and the slope is negative
two over 10 millis,

00:12:11.635 --> 00:12:15.141
which is just the opposite
of what we had over here.

00:12:15.141 --> 00:12:17.588
We had two over 10 millihenries,

00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:20.110
so it's the same looking kind of line.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.110
So let me mark out here.

00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:26.019
Here's four milliseconds and it's gonna

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:28.602
be a line that looks like this.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.151
So, the current's gonna ramp up,

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:35.460
it's gonna turn around and
ramp straight back down

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.255
because the, the slope up

00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.486
and the time up is the same as

00:12:38.486 --> 00:12:41.068
the slope down and the time down,

00:12:41.068 --> 00:12:43.182
just with a negative slope.

00:12:43.182 --> 00:12:44.616
So there's an example of the

00:12:44.616 --> 00:12:46.858
inductor equation in action.
