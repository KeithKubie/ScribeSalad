00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:02.614
- [Voiceover] So I've written here

00:00:02.614 --> 00:00:04.211
three different functions.

00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:06.397
The first on is a multivariable function,

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:09.211
it has a two variable input, x, y,

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.907
and a single variable output,

00:00:10.907 --> 00:00:12.226
that's x squared times y,

00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:13.460
that's just a number,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.248
and then the other two
functions are each just regular

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.208
old single variable functions.

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.358
And what I want to do is start thinking

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:22.353
about the composition of them.

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:24.445
So, I'm going to take,
as the first component,

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:28.056
the value of the function x of t,

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:29.797
so you pump t through that,

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:33.046
and then you make that
the first component of f.

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.260
And the second component

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.120
will be the value of the function y of t.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.800
So, the image that you
might have in your head

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.823
for something like this

00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:42.713
is you can think of t

00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:45.677
as just living on a
number line of some kind,

00:00:45.677 --> 00:00:47.233
then you have x and y,

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:48.703
which is just the plane,

00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:50.550
so that will be, you know,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.210
your x-coordinate, your y-coordinate,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.653
two-dimensional space,

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.018
and then you have your output,

00:00:55.018 --> 00:00:57.171
which is just whatever the value of f is.

00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:58.555
And for this whole function,

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.095
for this whole composition of functions,

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:03.510
you're thinking of xt, yt,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.091
as taking a single point in t,

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:06.216
and kind of moving it over

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:07.922
to two-dimensional space somewhere,

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:10.797
and then from there, our
multivariable function

00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:11.942
takes that back down.

00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:14.110
So, this is just the
single variable function,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.897
nothing too fancy going on
in terms of where you start

00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:18.837
and where you end up,

00:01:18.837 --> 00:01:20.951
it's just what's happening in the middle.

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.657
And what I want to know is
what's the derivative of this

00:01:23.657 --> 00:01:25.104
function.

00:01:25.104 --> 00:01:27.363
If I take this, and it's
just an ordinary derivative,

00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:28.327
not a partial derivative,

00:01:28.327 --> 00:01:30.376
because this is just a
single variable function,

00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:32.454
one variable input, one variable output,

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:34.075
how do you take it's derivative?

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:35.973
And there's a special rule for this,

00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:36.851
it's called the chain rule,

00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:38.553
the multivariable chain rule,

00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:40.561
but you don't actually need it.

00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.917
So, let's actually walk through this,

00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:44.375
showing that you don't need it.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.516
It's not that you'll never need it,

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:47.060
it's just for computations like this

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.509
you could go without it.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.941
It's a very useful theoretical tool,

00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.115
a very useful model to have in mind

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.989
for what function composition looks like

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.951
and implies for derivatives
in the multivariable world.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.096
So, let's just start
plugging things in here.

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:03.649
If I have f(x) and y(t),

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.978
the first thing I might do is write

00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:06.658
okay, f,

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:10.453
and instead of x of t,
just write in cosine of t,

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:14.234
since that's the function
that I have for x of t,

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.281
and then y we replace that with sine of t,

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.564
sine of t,

00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:22.302
and of course I'm hoping to
take the derivative of this.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.693
And then from there, we can
go to the definition of f,

00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:29.053
f of xy equals f squared times y,

00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:31.539
which means we take that
first component squared.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:35.421
So we'll take that first
component, cosine of t,

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:38.010
and then square it,

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.633
square that guy,

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.564
and then we'll multiply it
by the second component,

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.919
sine of t, sine of t,

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.763
and again we're just
taking this derivative.

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:52.772
And you might be wondering,

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:53.563
okay, why am I doing this,

00:02:53.563 --> 00:02:56.371
you're just showing me how
to take a first derivative,

00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.031
an ordinary derivative?

00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:00.227
But the pattern that
we'll see is gonna lead us

00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:01.770
to the multivariable chain rule.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.989
And it's actually kind of
surprising when you see it

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:04.646
in this context,

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:07.325
because it pops out in a way
that you might not expect

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:09.215
things to pop out.

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:11.192
So, continuing our chugging along,

00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:12.678
when you take the derivative of this,

00:03:12.678 --> 00:03:14.210
you do the product rule,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.723
left d right, plus right d left,

00:03:16.723 --> 00:03:19.686
so in this case, the left
is cosine squared of t,

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:21.832
we just leave that as it is,

00:03:21.832 --> 00:03:23.243
cosine squared of t,

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:27.336
and multiply it by the
derivative of the right, d right,

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:29.323
so that's going to be cosine of t,

00:03:30.703 --> 00:03:32.768
cosine of t,

00:03:32.768 --> 00:03:34.396
and then we add to that right,

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:38.689
which is, keep that right side unchanged,

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.127
multiply it by the derivative of the left,

00:03:41.127 --> 00:03:42.383
and for that we use the chain rule,

00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:44.088
the single variable chain rule,

00:03:44.088 --> 00:03:46.335
where you think of taking the
derivative of the outside,

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:48.877
so you plug two down,

00:03:48.877 --> 00:03:50.568
like you're taking the
derivative of two x,

00:03:50.568 --> 00:03:53.736
but you're just writing
in cosine, instead of x.

00:03:53.736 --> 00:03:54.845
Cosine t,

00:03:55.867 --> 00:04:00.174
and then you multiply that by
the derivative of the inside,

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:01.388
that's a tongue twister,

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:04.575
which is negative sine of t,

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:05.874
negative sine of t.

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:08.002
And I'm afraid I'm gonna
run off the edge here,

00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:11.460
certainly with the many many
parentheses that I need.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.121
I'll go ahead and rewrite this though.

00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.040
I'm gonna rewrite it anyway because

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.545
there's a certain pattern
that I hope to make clear.

00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:21.316
So, let me just rewrite this side,

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.997
let's copy that down here,

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:30.882
I just want to rewrite this guy.

00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:32.944
You might be wondering why,

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:34.287
but it'll become clear in just a moment

00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:36.205
why I want to do this.

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:38.576
So, in this case, I'm gonna write this as

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:42.052
two times cosine of t,

00:04:44.212 --> 00:04:45.342
times sine of t,

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:50.529
then all of them multiplied
by negative sine of t,

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:51.931
negative sine of t.

00:04:55.555 --> 00:04:56.687
So this is the derivative,

00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:59.785
this is the derivative of
the composition of functions

00:04:59.785 --> 00:05:01.793
that ultimately was a
single variable function,

00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:04.589
but it kind of wind through
two different variables.

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:06.232
And I just want to make an observation

00:05:06.232 --> 00:05:08.789
in terms of the partial derivatives of f.

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.936
So, let me just make a copy of this guy,

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.120
give ourselves a little
bit of room down here,

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:17.227
paste that over here.

00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:20.357
So let's look at the
partial derivatives of f

00:05:20.357 --> 00:05:22.139
for a second here.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.210
So, if I took the partial
derivative with respect to x,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.749
partial x,

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.077
which means y is treated as a constant.

00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:32.925
So I take the derivative
of x squared to get two x,

00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:34.691
and then multiply it by that constant,

00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:36.496
which is just y,

00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:38.595
and if I also do it with respect to y,

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:40.267
get all of them in there.

00:05:41.532 --> 00:05:42.857
So, now y looks like a variable,

00:05:42.857 --> 00:05:44.409
x looks like a constant,

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.494
so x squared also looks like a constant,

00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:48.124
constant times a variable,

00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:50.483
the derivative is just that constant.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.486
These two, their pattern comes
up in the ultimate result

00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:56.344
that we got.

00:05:56.344 --> 00:05:58.074
And this is the whole
reason that I rewrote it.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:05:59.874
If you look at this two x y,

00:05:59.874 --> 00:06:01.528
you can see that over here,

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.413
where cosine corresponds to x,

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:06.443
sine corresponds to y, based
on our original functions,

00:06:06.443 --> 00:06:08.928
and an x squared here

00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:12.592
corresponds with squaring
the x that we put in there.

00:06:12.592 --> 00:06:15.569
Then if we take the derivative
of our two intermediary

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:16.462
functions,

00:06:16.462 --> 00:06:19.640
the ordinary derivative
of x, with respect to t,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.659
that's derivative of cosine,

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.943
negative sine of t,

00:06:25.827 --> 00:06:27.854
and then similarly derivative of y,

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:31.021
just the ordinary derivative,
no partials going on here,

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:33.007
with respect to t,

00:06:33.007 --> 00:06:34.256
that's equal to cosine,

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:35.860
derivative of sine is cosine.

00:06:36.957 --> 00:06:38.195
And these guys show up, right,

00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:40.866
you see negative sine over here,

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:43.357
and you see cosine show up over here.

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:45.403
And we can generalize this,

00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:46.617
we can write it down and say

00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:48.852
at least for this specific example,

00:06:48.852 --> 00:06:51.419
it looks like the derivative
of the composition is

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.898
this part, which is the partial of f

00:06:53.898 --> 00:06:55.861
with respect to y,

00:06:55.861 --> 00:06:57.305
right, that's kind of
what it looks like here,

00:06:57.305 --> 00:06:59.651
once we've plugged in the
intermediary functions,

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.957
multiply it by this guy, was
the ordinary derivative of y,

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:05.483
with respect to t.

00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:08.293
So, that was the ordinary derivative of y,

00:07:08.293 --> 00:07:09.779
with respect to t.

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:11.015
And then very similarly,

00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:13.493
this guy was the partial of f,

00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:16.153
with respect to x, partial x,

00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:19.108
and we're multiplying it
by the ordinary derivative

00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:20.141
of x of t.

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:23.682
So, over here, x of t, with respect to t.

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:27.753
And of course, when I write
this partial f, partial y,

00:07:27.753 --> 00:07:30.664
what I really mean is
you plug in for x and y,

00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:32.366
the two coordinate functions,

00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:34.406
x of t, y of t.

00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:36.255
So, if I say partial
f, partial y over here,

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:37.241
what I really mean is

00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:39.234
you take that x squared
and then you plug in

00:07:39.234 --> 00:07:42.908
x of t squared to get cosine squared.

00:07:42.908 --> 00:07:43.977
And same deal over here,

00:07:43.977 --> 00:07:45.273
you're always plugging things in,

00:07:45.273 --> 00:07:47.554
so you ultimately have a function of t.

00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:48.985
But this right here has a name,

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.047
this is the multivariable chain rule.

00:07:51.047 --> 00:07:52.175
And it's important enough,

00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:56.052
I'll just write it out
all on it's own here.

00:07:56.052 --> 00:07:59.413
If we take the ordinary
derivative, with respect to t,

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.945
of a composition of a
multivariable function,

00:08:01.945 --> 00:08:03.519
in this case just two variables,

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.586
x of t, y of t,

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:08.207
where we're plugging in
two intermediary functions,

00:08:08.207 --> 00:08:09.721
x of t, y of t,

00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:11.957
each of which just single variable,

00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:15.191
the result is that we take
the partial derivative,

00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:19.331
with respect to x,

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:22.785
and we multiply it by

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:29.189
the derivative of x with respect to t,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.986
and then we add to that

00:08:32.986 --> 00:08:35.762
the partial derivative with respect to y,

00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:41.336
multiplied by the derivative
of y with respect to t.

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:45.737
So, this entire expression here

00:08:45.737 --> 00:08:47.596
is what you might call the simple version

00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:49.338
of the multivariable chain rule.

00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:52.410
There's a more general version,

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.059
and we'll kind of build up to it,

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:56.062
but this is the simplest
example you can think of,

00:08:56.062 --> 00:08:58.761
where you start with one dimension,

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.993
and then you move over
to two dimension somehow,

00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:03.419
and then you move from those
two dimensions down to one.

00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.445
So, this is that,

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.542
and in the next video I'm gonna talk about

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:10.274
the intuition for why this is true.

00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:12.196
You know, here I just went
through an example and showed

00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:13.646
oh but it just happens to be true,

00:09:13.646 --> 00:09:14.963
it fills this pattern.

00:09:14.963 --> 00:09:16.991
But there's a very nice line of reasoning

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:18.935
for where this comes about,

00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:20.999
and I'll also talk about
a more generalized form,

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:22.456
where you'll see it.

00:09:22.456 --> 00:09:23.926
We start using vector notation,

00:09:23.926 --> 00:09:26.402
it makes things look very clean,

00:09:26.402 --> 00:09:28.936
and I might even get around
to a more formal argument

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:30.254
for why this is true.

00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:31.676
So, we'll see in next video.
