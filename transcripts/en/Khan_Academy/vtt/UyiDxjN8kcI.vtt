00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.670
- [Instructor] In this series of videos

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.880
about the Constitution,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.230
we've been discussing all the elements

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.230
of balance and compromise that
appear in the Constitution,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.520
the balance between large
states and small states

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.240
and between the different
branches of government.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.860
But in this video I want to talk

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.090
about one particular compromise

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.260
made at the Constitutional Convention

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.670
over how the president of
the United States is elected,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.360
and that is the electoral college.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.250
I think these compromises
reveal some real conflict

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.050
among the framers over how they think

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.940
the American Revolution did.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.430
Did they think that the Revolution

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.950
went too far,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.370
had created too much equality

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.720
and too much liberty for
people who weren't ready

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.770
to deal with it?

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.280
Or did it not go far enough?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.130
So let's talk about this idea

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.920
that perhaps the Revolution went too far,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.780
that the average American Joe,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.610
or Jedediah, I guess,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.250
could be the Revolutionary version of Joe,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.120
had too much a sense
of his own importance,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.660
was going to tear down
the social structures

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.730
that had seemed natural during
the American Revolution,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.450
the wealthy elites, the middling farmers,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.040
the rough and rowdy workers.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.620
You'll remember that one of the incidents

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.560
that led to the decision to revise

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.150
the Articles of Confederation
was Shays's Rebellion

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.150
in which a group of unruly farmers,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.390
Revolutionary War veterans,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.560
had marched against the
governor of Massachusetts.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.290
So the people were used to rebelling,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.310
and they first had rebelled
against Great Britain.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.230
But now that war was over,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.080
and they started rebelling
against state governments.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.010
So there's a real sense
throughout the Constitution

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.010
that the founders were
attempting to balance democracy,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.390
a representative government,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.160
with what they saw as too much democracy

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.050
or mobocracy in their words,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.450
that unruly mobs

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.060
who perhaps lacked the virtue

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.970
of elite, educated citizens

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.700
would foolishly tear down government

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.820
that they weren't prepared to be part of.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.143
Now, you see that in
things like the Senate.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.170
The members of the Senate
were appointed, not elected,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.570
up until the 20th century.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.010
The idea that there had to be one part

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.460
of the legislative
branch that was selected

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.440
by the better sort of men,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.260
the sort of people who really knew

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050
what good leadership looked like,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.480
not by a mob that might be swayed

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.430
by any fancy talking politician.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.430
The founders didn't want all
white men to be able to vote.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.770
They wanted voting to be
reserved to the elite,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.703
the propertied, the educated,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.770
those who were prepared
to be virtuous citizens.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.900
It wouldn't be until the 1820s

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.390
that all white men
could vote in elections,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.600
regardless of how much
property they owned.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.550
Of course, it wouldn't be until the late

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.030
19th and 20th centuries
that women and minorities

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.170
would get the right to vote.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.550
So they had a very dim idea

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.270
of the average citizen's ability

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.500
to engage productively in democracy.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.070
And another way that they
show this in the Constitution

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.020
is in the process of
electing the president.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.880
Article II establishes
the executive branch,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.480
and it also discusses how
presidential elections shall work.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.720
And it's a kinda complex
process, the electoral college.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.720
But the simple version is that
instead of having citizens

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.010
vote directly for the president,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.890
the citizens would vote in each state,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.570
and then that state would have electors

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.160
equal to the number of
senators and representatives.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.160
And those electors would then
cast votes for the president,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.130
and whoever got the most electoral votes

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.340
should be president.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.220
And we still have this system today.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.220
This is a map of the current
number of electoral votes

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.320
that each state has.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.140
And really, what the
founders intended here

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.340
was to have a safeguard

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.480
of the office of the president,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.120
believing that it would be possible

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.650
for a mob to be swayed,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.370
even the better sorts of citizens,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.700
into voting for a politician

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.680
who wouldn't be good for the office.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.130
And so they moved away
from direct democracy

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.130
into a slightly more
complicated indirect system

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.700
just to put an extra layer of safety

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.153
in between the office of
president and the unruly masses.
