00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this capsule we will see an example 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.839
 step by step procedure for 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.889
 update weights will solve 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.900
 artificial we saw the pseudo code for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.509
 do all the training of a network of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.490
 neurons so we start with 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 initialize the pwa then from his 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.740
 unitary on each of the examples for 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.710
 make a complete iteration of updates 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.150
 neural network day and for each 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.189
 example we have to do is a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.019
 forward propagation to calculate the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.360
 activation value each of the neurons 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.550
 to a back propagation to compute 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.680
 the deltas and finally an update 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.570
 peas and so we do that for everyone 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.640
 the training examples and then 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.770
 after doing a complete iteration 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.590
 here on our times without training on 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.079
 check his Latin stop criterion 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 otherwise we make a high idea ration 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.129
 complete on all together 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.649
 training and if the recruiter is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.899
 satisfied we can return the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.699
 network settings with our network 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.469
 of neurons and train and we can 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.650
 use it on new examples 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.840
 so what we're going to see here is a 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.369
 iteration inside the loop on 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 all the workout exams for a 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.850
 pair xy 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.930
 what are the steps to be done in the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.450
 calculation for m 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.040
 to do the spread with 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.240
 hourly spread and finally the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 update settings 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 suppose that in input of actors x of 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.720
 dimension 2 so we at the first entry 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.750
 exsangue entry and equals 2-2 between x2 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.030
 who voted was equal to -1 and that this 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.329
 example are labeled according to the class 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.659
 so belong to the class y equal 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.159
 so we start by signing 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.640
 neurons to enter their value 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.409
 present in the vector x2 here - 0 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.180
 and when we also see that the networks 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.180
 of neurons was put is initialized 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 with certain values ​​so I proposed 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 to take the road 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 - 0.01 and 0.01 in the capsule 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.069
 previous to simplify the example here 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 I took heads not too complicated 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.400
 who are pretty stupid but it's not a 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.360
 certain representative of value that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.440
 should use 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.090
 it's just for example +5 and there in 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.070
 spread before we calculate 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.590
 activation of each of the neurons in 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.910
 doing the logistics so the sig moïse 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.470
 applied to the sum of the neurons that 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.690
 are connected or neurons like 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.640
 weighted by the connection strength the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.490
 connection weight w jk so for example 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.160
 the first neurons of the first 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:49.970
 hide layer that would correspond to the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:52.850
 sigmoid the authority of 0.5 more times 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:59.250
 1.5 the weight of this commission the six 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.440
 times less 11.5 times less and so that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.860
 makes me the logistics 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.340
 2 - 0.5 who are doing the calculation so 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.000
 here is the value of in3 actually 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.430
 so that was the neuron labeled 3 here 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.870
 they did the logistics applied to - 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.640
 0.5 it gives me 0.37 8 know so 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.850
 what I'm going to put here is the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.810
 activation value of the neurons so this 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.519
 would be the bar with two or three I 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.750
 continue like this for the second run 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:38.549
 so two times less two times less one 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.820
 plus - two times less in minus two 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:47.480
 times minus 1 passes through the sig 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.480
 Moses as dancing web 2 0 which is 0.5 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.560
 I'm ready to calculate the neurons the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.830
 second layer hide so we would have a 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:02.280
 x 0.37 8.1 times 0.37 eight times the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.570
 collection also which is 2.3 times 0.53 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.970
 times 0.5 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:16.049
 it gives me the sigmoid of 1.7 1.878 which 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:19.650
 give me 0.87 I continue like this for 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.349
 the last neurons of the last 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.380
 hide layer and finally the neuron 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:31.050
 in output so we have 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:36.780
 once it's at point 8-7 sometimes it's 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.580
 more or less three times 0.08 5 to 3 times 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.060
 zero point 0.25 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.520
 I apply the sigmoid on it 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.750
 gives 0.6 free 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:52.800
 so that's actually my h2x simon at 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.470
 seysses and both are equal 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.050
 corresponds to the different notation for 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.630
 designate the same thing and so that's 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.950
 for the neural network 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.250
 the probability in fact that there is equal to 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.100
 1 knowing the value of x that we put in 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.770
 entrance so that too is another 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.550
 notation used for this value 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:21.570
 there too that the belief of the network 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.100
 neurons so that's the level of 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.820
 euro zone belief that ex 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.820
 belongs to the class 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.500
 now we are ready to play 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.510
 retro propagation and so we will calculate 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.300
 the deltas propagate them from the layer of 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:41.190
 output up to the input layer then 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.800
 the back for the output neuron that's there 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.900
 - activation of output neurons 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.340
 did not do it would be a recipe here 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:54.180
 we could also create h2x and so that 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:00.620
 is going to be the delta value here then there 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:03.270
 is equal to 1 1 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.870
 activation of neurons and 0.6 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.910
 Free 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:12.420
 so it's going to be the delta value for 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.020
 to go there here it would be delta 7 and 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.810
 we spread 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.030
 so you actually calculate it savannah 0.35 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.410
 who are spread to others are not worth 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:25.110
 so here we can spread 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:29.910
 we do not return here so in this case 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.200
 here the value would correspond to do so 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.140
 go through the arrows in this direction 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.770
 reverse we will take the weight here times 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.259
 the delta which 0.35 2 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.840
 and then sums so I try too 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:46.080
 in 0.35 times two years after that I see 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.129
 x what corresponds to the partial dlv 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.810
 of my function 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:52.800
 an acronym standing out from his 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.240
 intrigue and I gave as result 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.500
 that would be hidden by this one 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.750
 simply wildlife 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:03.900
 the neuron walk x 1 - the value 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:05.190
 of an aura so the j2 in times the 1 - g2g 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.960
 it was a real here a few multiply 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:12.780
 also and it gives me delta value 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.849
 of 0.04 found here I am the same 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.759
 thing for the second rank of the 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:19.380
 second layer hide I'm not going in 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:23.250
 the details but even served delta 2 - 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:26.400
 0 point 0 2 and here I am ready to go 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.539
 at the first layer hide alas what what 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.969
 is important to notice is that 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:32.099
 now i'm going to have two delta 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:34.740
 combined years in play the delta here that I 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:41.400
 multiplies by the value of the weight that is 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:44.250
 of 1.1 times 0.04 more - hours my 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.229
 connection here times the delta that comes from 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:49.169
 neuron that is connected so that its 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:54.120
 delta it's less 10.082 so I have less 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:55.979
 1 time - 10,082 which gives me so 

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.779
 I'm trying to settle here again 

00:07:55.979 --> 00:08:00.449
 must x 

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:04.169
 activation once a the activation of the 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:07.020
 neuron in question so 0.37 8 x 1 - 0 

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:11.669
 point 3 7 8 10 6 hours by the sum of 

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:14.509
 weighted of the layer the second 

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:20.550
 hide layer that gives me all together 

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:22.349
 0.02 do not have the same thing for the 

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.830
 second does not make the first layer 

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:27.029
 hide I have to combine the deltas that 

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.069
 just went there who is going to be 

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:32.370
 weighted by 3 then the delta that comes 

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:35.820
 to get to weight by less than 4 x 1 

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:38.060
 - so the value the name the disease does not 

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.469
 send back a month the baroness we have here 

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:46.770
 if I combine all together it gives a 

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:48.240
 delta of 0.11 3 is actually good in the 

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.920
 kde office that I gave 

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.270
 we could also calculate the deltas 

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.360
 here but in fact we do not need it 

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.360
 to update the settings 

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.589
 so we all have donations can 

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:13.080
 update our allow the update 

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:21.660
 day by year we have all our delta for 

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:23.279
 update our settings and we are 

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.380
 now ready to update everything 

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.149
 my father the mother and the update of 

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.060
 settings it's always going to match 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:33.089
 take the current value of the parameter 

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.830
 and add a learning rate 

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:37.800
 so for this example if I decided to 

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.450
 take 0.1 it's a choice to 

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.790
 the user to determine the rate 

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.520
 learning ok so I decided to 

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:47.040
 take 0.17 example if we miss is 

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:51.480
 the value of the current perimeter plus 

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:54.930
 the self learning times the value of the 

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.930
 neuron connected times the delta of 

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:00.450
 the aude neurons that is him by the 

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.200
 correction i'm updating ok so he 

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.510
 must avenge 

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.270
 it's not the best storing metal plays to 

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.459
 his daughter if it is the delta of the other 

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.170
 neurons that is connected so we see 

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:13.770
 only to update this collection 

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:16.920
 here I see again 0.5 plus my iphone 

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:19.920
 learning rate x 2 the value of 

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.500
 wall twenty times the delta of the other 

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:27.060
 neurons connected by my connection with 

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:29.250
 the weight 0.5 the delta which is 0.02 936 

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.050
 if I do the math in this case simon 

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:39.270
 delta not really w13 who have me 0.56 going 

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:42.000
 increase your becoming of 0.50 as well 

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:43.680
 thing for the connection here that a 

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.779
 ride 1.5 

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.670
 because if I'm going to update it 

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:53.850
 so I'm going to have passed line 6 

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:59.220
 genre 1.5 plus learning 

00:10:53.850 --> 00:11:01.110
 times minus 1 times the delta ii of the neuron 

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.010
 who is connected by that 

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:06.870
 action oc ii 1.5 connection 2.3 

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:10.140
 the state of 0.02 9 

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:12.420
 I like it here and it gives me a bone 

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:17.220
 Roma including an art collection that will 

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.630
 decrease from 1.5 to 1.497 and I 

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.950
 go on like this so I could do 

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.450
 this transaction lot w14 that matches 

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:28.350
 at this collection here that had a 

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.779
 value of 1 before updating at any 

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.760
 no forgiveness sport is less and less 

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:34.800
 that we do not see well so I have less 

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.230
 plus my learning round for the 

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.899
 value of the neuron once the delta ii is 

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:42.839
 make it here i connected by the 

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:45.300
 connection also if I'm putting in 

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:49.350
 day my weight goes up and goes from 

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.829
 less and less 0.27 I will remove 

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.180
 languages 

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:53.899
 so if we continue like this we go in 

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.899
 do another 

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.699
 we are presented so it could be 

00:11:57.329 --> 00:12:04.769
 this connection the water here that a value 

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:08.670
 of 3 he connects the neuron 4 with the 

00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:10.649
 simple neuron so the connection 3g I 

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.850
 will update it for almost a month on 

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:20.279
 must say at times the neuron 

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:21.209
 40.5 times the neurone delta 50.04 

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:24.600
 gives me a new value due 

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:25.769
 allow of 3,200 of so I'm doing this 

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.639
 for all parameters 

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:32.069
 I crush the old value of then 

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:34.259
 allow collections w by their 

00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:36.300
 news and when i will do what i 

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:39.660
 I will repeat this procedure the man 

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.490
 and for another example xy in my the 

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.100
 training room I will be safe for 

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.500
 all but example I will look at this world 

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.819
 khiter stop is satisfied or not if he 

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.930
 not satisfied I redo another 

00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:51.050
 nicknamed operation example 

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:55.319
 otherwise I will stop 

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:58.879
 that was our example of how 

00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:58.879
 the parameters of a reasoning
