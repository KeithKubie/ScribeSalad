00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.150
Art as they say, is subjective, what one person
considers a priceless masterpiece others might

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.390
see as nothing more than a giant black square…

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.350
But there’s one very specific kind of painting
that most everyone sees the same way- the

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.460
kind with the weird eyes that seem to follow
you around the room.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.399
So what causes this optical illusion of sorts
and how do artists achieve this effect?

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.280
It turns out, for even a moderately skilled
artist, this “ubiquitous gaze” effect

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130
isn’t a difficult thing to achieve.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.610
In a nutshell, all you need is a little illusion
of depth, so the person depicted appearing

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.780
at least somewhat 3D despite being on a 2D
canvas, and to direct the gaze of the eyes

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.800
such that they would be looking at someone
standing right in front of the picture.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.701
So what exactly is going on here in our brains
that then makes it seem like the eyes follow

00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:18.909
you even if you move away from being front
and center?

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.430
As demonstrated in 2004 by a team of researchers
from Ohio State University, as you move to

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.799
the side, the “near” and “far” points
of the 2D image don’t really change.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.000
These near and far points are defined as visible
points that, if the image was 3-dimensional,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.659
would appear nearest and furthest away from
the viewer at a given angle.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.540
Summarising their findings, co-author of the
paper James Todd had the following to say:

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.810
The idea is simple – no matter what angle
you look at a painting from, the painting

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.360
itself doesn’t change.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.220
You’re looking at a flat surface….

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.960
The key is that the near points and far points
of the picture remained the same no matter

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.189
the angle the picture was viewed from.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.680
When observing real surfaces in the natural
environment the visual information that specifies

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.880
near and far points varies when we change
viewing direction.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.350
When we observe a picture on the wall, on
the other hand, the visual information that

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.060
defines near and far points is unaffected
by viewing direction.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.739
Still, we interpret this perceptually as if
it were a real object…

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.879
Thus, because the perspective, shadows, and
light on the painting don’t change as you

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.959
move around, if the eyes in the painting would
be staring directly at the observer if said

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.650
individual is standing in front of the painting,
it creates something of a mild optical illusion

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.069
in your brain such that the eyes will continue
to seem to stare at you as you move to the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.069
side.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.739
In contrast to the eyes following you trick,
if the artist tweaks the painting a bit such

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.150
that the eyes are looking off somewhere else
instead of directly out at a potential observer,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.450
no matter where you stand, the eyes will never
seem to be looking at you.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.430
The technique first began popularly showing
up in art around the 14th century when the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.580
artist and architect Fillipo Brunelleshi introduced
the art world to the idea of “linear perspective”,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.510
linear perspective being painting with the
idea of everything in the picture converging

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.970
on a specific point on the horizon, creating
the illusion of depth.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.790
This, combined with skilled use of light and
shadow, allowed artists to create masterfully

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.760
realistic paintings, including sometimes of
people that stare at you creepily no matter

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.209
where you stand, and totally aren’t Scooby
Doo villains stalking you with the intent

00:03:23.209 --> 00:04:30.940
to murder you in your sleep.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.599
Speaking of one of the most famous and valuable
paintings in history being literally just

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.569
a big black square on a white canvas, and
just as unimaginatively named Black Square,

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:42.479
in 1964, a new avant-garde artist was introduced
to the art scene in the Swedish city of Gōteborg.

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.720
The fresh new artist was Pierre Brassau and
his work received rave reviews from critics

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.330
and art fans alike.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.370
One critic in particular, Rolf Anderberg,
was so overwhelmed by Pierre’s talent that

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.009
he wrote the following review about his work,
which appeared in print the morning after

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.839
the exhibition: “Brassau paints with powerful
strokes, but also with clear determination.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:08.639
His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.330
Pierre is an artist who performs with the
delicacy of a ballet dancer.”

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.370
The reviews were almost universally glowing.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.830
All but one, that is.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.059
One critic’s commentary on the new artist
was short and to the point: “Only an ape

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:28.759
could have done this.”The opinion was unpopular,
despite that the pieces of art looked strikingly

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.629
similar to “art” you commonly see stuck
to refrigerators, produced by 2 year olds

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:34.629
the world over.

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.400
It turns out, though, that the “ape” review
more or less hit the nail on the head.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.539
Pierre Brassau was actually none other than
a young West African chimpanzee named Peter

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.610
who lived in the Borås djurpark zoo in Sweden.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.379
The mastermind behind the hoax was journalist
Åke “Dacke” Axelsson.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.830
Axelsson worked for the Swedish tabloid Gotebors-Tidningen
and came up with the idea of featuring the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.889
primate paintings in an exhibition in order
to put the critics to the test- could they

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.380
distinguish between the work of true, highly
skilled avant-garde modern artists when compared

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.819
to the work of a random chimpanzee?

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.580
It turns out the answer is mostly no.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.949
Although it should be noted that we’re guessing
the chimp couldn’t have painted a perfect

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:11.069
black square.

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.839
So that’s something I guess.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.630
And if you’re wondering, once the hoax was
revealed, the critic who had previously compared

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.439
Pierre Brassau with a ballet dancer, Rolf
Anderberg, doggedly stuck by his assessment

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:32.360
and stated that Pierre’s work “was still
the best painting in

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.279
the exhibition”.
