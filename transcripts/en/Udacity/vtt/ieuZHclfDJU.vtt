00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.370
You've made a few reports and charts and put them

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.610
into a dashboard. Let's take a minute and discuss the kinds

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.870
of charts that you can use to visualize your data.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.060
Let's take a minute to discuss the different types of charts

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.190
that are available to us. Bar or column charts are

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.110
good for comparing amounts. Line charts are good for showing changes

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.550
over time. Pie charts are good for showing a proportion

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.970
of a single value. Doughnut charts are like a pie chart,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.430
but also displays the total amount itself. Funnel charts are often used

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.050
to represent stages in a sales process, and show the amount of potential

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.040
revenue for each stage. Scatter charts show the relationship between two sets of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
data. See if you can choose the best chart for the following scenarios.
