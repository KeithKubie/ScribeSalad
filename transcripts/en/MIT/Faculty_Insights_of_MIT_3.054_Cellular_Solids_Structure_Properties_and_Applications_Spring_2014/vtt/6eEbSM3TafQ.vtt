LORNA GIBSON: My
name's Lorna Gibson.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.300
I'm the professor
for 3.054, it's

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.490
a course on cellular solids.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.160
And I've been working
on cellular solids

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.940
since I was a graduate
student, since I did my Ph.D.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.240
And cellular solids
are materials

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.300
that are made up of
an interconnected

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.080
network of struts or plates.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.510
And there's examples like
engineering honeycombs

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.380
and foams, and there's
lots of examples in nature.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.970
Things like wood and cork and
there's a type of porous bone.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.080
And there's lots of
examples in medicine too.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.600
Tissue engineering
scaffolds, for example.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.640
So my background is
in civil engineering,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.140
and in civil engineering
we study structures.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.850
And typically people
think of large structures

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.810
like bridges or buildings.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.840
But in fact when we analyze
the cellular solids,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.320
we use the same
kind of mechanics.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.240
It's just the scale
is very much smaller.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.070
So we're looking at structures
where the scale might

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.060
be hundreds of microns or
millimeters, things like that,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.602
but the same sort of mechanical
principles apply to that.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.640
OK, so I grew up in
Niagara Falls, in Ontario.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.680
And people always
think of Niagara Falls

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.180
as being the waterfall
and all the tourist stuff,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.380
there's a casino there now.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.310
But in fact, there's loads and
loads of big civil engineering

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.810
works in Niagara Falls,
mostly associated

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.190
with the hydroelectric
power station.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.310
So when they make hydroelectric
power in Niagara Falls,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.790
the power station is actually
about a mile downstream

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.060
from the Falls.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.070
And what they do is they have
a big hydraulic gate that

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.370
goes into the river
and it diverts water

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.420
from the river above the Falls
into a whole series of canals

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.830
and tunnels and there's
a big reservoir where

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.210
they store water.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.870
And then the water
from this reservoir

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.430
goes into the
penstocks, the tubes

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.794
that go down to the turbines
and then make the electricity.

00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:57.460
Niagara Falls is not a big town,
but if you drive around Niagara

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.790
Falls, you see these canals,
you see the reservoir,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.646
you see the big power station.

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:05.020
And so there's
these really huge,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.740
impressive civil
engineering works.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.910
And my father worked for
an engineering company

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.680
in Niagara Falls
and they specialized

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.940
in the design of
hydroelectric power stations,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.231
and I think that's how I got
interested in engineering.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.980
So I've been interested in
bird watching for some time.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.620
Mostly just because
birds are beautiful

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.536
and there's all sorts
of interesting behaviors

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:29.080
you can see with birds.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.270
But since I started
doing research

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.680
on cellular solids
and, in particular,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.760
teaching this course,
I realize there's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.170
lots of examples of things
about birds that have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.130
to do with cellular materials.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.380
So for instance,
some people had once

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.100
told me that woodpeckers
avoid head injury and brain

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.730
injury by having a
special cellular material

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.780
in between their
brain and their skull.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.010
And that this acted kind of
like a foam in a bicycle helmet.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.160
That it would absorb the
energy of the impact.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.130
And I thought oh, well,
I like bird watching

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.750
and I study cellular materials,
I should find out about this.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.470
So I started looking
into it and people

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.470
had looked at the anatomy of
the woodpecker skull and brain.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.364
And, in fact, there is no
special cellular material.

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:13.030
But by that point, I
was kind of hooked.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.320
And I actually did a
project at one point

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.320
looking at why it
was that woodpeckers

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.780
don't get brain injury.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.560
And it's largely a scaling law.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.860
It has to do with the fact that
their brains are very small.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.830
Another aspect of birds that
has to do with cellular solids

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.300
is how birds make
themselves very light.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.210
And here we have an owl skull.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.350
This owl, unfortunately,
had an accident with a car.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.380
But somebody picked up its body
and took it to Mass Audubon,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.840
and I got this from somebody
at the Massachusetts Audubon

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.740
Society.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.340
And if you look at
the skull-- I don't

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.650
know if you can do
a close-up here--

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.480
if you look at
the skull, you can

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.190
see there's a dense layer
of bone on the outside

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.450
and there's another dense
layer bone on the inside,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.450
and there's a sort of foamy
layer bone in between.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.130
And that's called a
sandwich structure.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.130
And this foamy type of bone
is called trabecular bone.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.250
And that's one of the
things that I study.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.050
And it turns out that
particular structure gives you

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.640
a very stiff, strong,
lightweight structure.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.130
So you can see an example of
how cellular materials are

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.899
used in engineering but here
sort of manifested in the owl's

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.069
skull in making the
skull very light.
