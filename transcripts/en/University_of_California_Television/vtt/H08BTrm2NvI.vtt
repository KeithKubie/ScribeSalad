00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.820
- So I'd like to start by
sharing a personal story.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.600
So all scientists have I think,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.360
a memory, a story that they can go back

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.110
to when they think about
they became interested

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.980
in science and I wanted to share mine.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.340
This is mine here, these
are baby leatherback

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.900
turtles that are hatching from a nest

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.220
not far away from where I was born

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.400
and raised in Puerto Rico
and when I was a child there,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.175
I always found fascinating
that these animals

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:38.670
are coming out of the nest and they

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.100
haven't been to turtle school

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.280
and they know exactly where to go.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.960
They are bee-lining it towards the ocean.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.220
There's something really
profound happening here also,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.910
very important for the turtle,
but invisible to our eyes.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.770
Which is that these turtles
are forming a memory.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.380
They are forming a memory of this beach.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.120
These are leatherback
turtles, they grow up to be

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.770
about the size of a Volkswagen,
about nine feet long.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.410
And they will travel the world's oceans

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.550
and decades later when they have to make

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.350
what is perhaps the
most important decision

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.630
in a turtles life, which is where

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.990
its gonna lay it's eggs,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.120
it will remember this beach,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.730
because that's where it was born

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.400
and it'll come back to it and
lay its eggs at that place.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.383
So with that I'd like to
course grain behaviors

00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:20.690
and essentially group them
into innate or hardwired

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.650
behaviors like these
animals capacity to know

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770
to go towards the ocean when they're born,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.770
and experiential memories
like their capacity

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.570
to remember this specific
beach and come back to it.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.149
Now innate behaviors are facilitated

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.550
by the developmental
program that leads to the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.230
formation of the neural
circuit architectures.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.040
And experiential memories are facilitated

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.020
by a pre-complex interplay
between that architecture

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.160
that develops, and the environment

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.440
that the animal is experiencing,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.620
what the animal is seeing.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.810
But I wanna emphasize that both of them

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.890
are ultimately facilitated
by the architecture

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.723
of the nervous system.

00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:54.980
So what do I mean by the architecture

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.310
of the nervous system, and this
is essentially what I mean.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.540
If you look at a mouse
hippocampus for example,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.689
you'll see these incredibly
exquisite organization

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.060
of the neurons.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.410
This is actually an image
here using a technique

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.120
called Brainbow by Jeff
Lichtman at Harvard.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.330
And this organization raises all sorts

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.340
of interesting questions, one of them

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.610
which my lab is interested on,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.950
is how is it that this organization
is actually established?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.630
And in thinking on how this
organization is established,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.510
if you take for an example
the case of the human brain,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.500
you have about 80 billion neurons.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.184
That's about, that's more neurons

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:29.082
in a healthy human brain that you have,

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.757
starts in the milky
way and about a hundred

00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:34.040
trillion synapses and during development

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.660
you have hundreds of millions of neurons

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.010
almost simultaneously during development,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.800
specifying fate, growing out axions,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.330
connecting to each
other, finding each other

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.767
in a very specific way to layout

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:45.830
this amazing architecture.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.080
So how does that happen?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.070
What are the organizing principles

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.320
that rules this
organization that ultimately

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.759
underpin human behaviors?

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.892
Now we look at this
question and we don't do so

00:02:55.892 --> 00:03:00.120
in turtles or humans or mice actually,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.860
we do so in a worm.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.920
It's a tiny Nematode called
C.elegans, it's over here.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.730
One of the characteristics
that C.elegans has

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.040
that we really like is
that it's transparent,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.200
so it allows us to look
at the organization

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200
of the nervous system which
is very finely organized

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.400
as you can see here.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.260
Now I wanna acknowledge that C.elegans

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.030
is far simpler than a healthy human brain,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.070
so instead of 100 billion neurons,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.926
C.elegans has exactly 302 neurons

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:29.671
and instead of 100 trillion synapses,

00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:32.910
C.elegans has approximately
7,000 synapses.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.130
So some of you might be wondering,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.930
how is it that we can extract
any useful information

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.650
out of such a simple
system that will tell us

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.030
anything useful about a complex
organ like the human brain?

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.740
And to address this,
I'd like to use a quote

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.070
by Diderot That said,
"A worm is only a worm.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.030
"But that only means that
the marvelous complexity

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.890
"of its organization is hidden from us

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.460
"by extreme smallness."

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.250
Now, I'm not as eloquent as Diderot

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.020
so I'll say it in a wordier way.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.220
When nature finds a solution to a problem,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.930
it recycles that solution
over and over again.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.600
So the fundamental principles that allows

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720
for the proper functioning
of the nervous system

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.852
in this tiny worm, are not
unlike the fundamental principles

00:04:09.852 --> 00:04:12.740
that facilitate the
functioning of our own brains.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.911
And to exemplify that, I'll
just give a few examples.

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:19.512
Studies done on this worm by other groups,

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:21.860
ranging from the development of neurons

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.620
like sulfate specification
or axion guidon,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.530
to fundamental physiology having to do

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.510
with the biogenesis of neurotransmitters

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.050
or neurotransmitter release, how neurons

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.276
talk to each other, to even systems levels

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:38.250
examination of sensory
perception and behavior

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.146
all done in this Nematode
have actually shed light

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.810
on important and fundamental
aspects about how

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.410
our own brains and brains
in higher meta neurons work.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.670
So it's actually, it's
really true that evolution

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.670
kind of conserves these principles.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.320
So using that as a foundation,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.150
we wanted to essentially
examine this question

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.960
of how this nervous system comes together.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.480
And both are studies and the
studies I just mentioned,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.460
benefited from the fact that this is also

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.540
the only animal for which
we have a wiring diagram.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.140
Now we're hoping this is gonna change soon

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.630
and you're gonna hear other talks today

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.620
that are working very hard to make this

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.360
a thing of the past and we're very happy

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.550
that that's the case, but
today this the only animal

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.110
for which we have that wiring diagram.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.000
So what is the wiring diagram?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.650
Is the ability to know
where each neuron is,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.350
essentially the morphology of the neuron

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.300
and what that neuron is connecting to.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.430
And we use this wiring diagram

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.570
to examine two fundamental questions.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.340
One of them is, how is it that the brain

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.300
of this animal is organized?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.410
And the second one is,
how does this organization

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.030
comes out during development?

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.860
Now we've had the wiring diagram

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.260
for about 30 years.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.690
The first wiring diagram was done in 1986

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.460
and we still have these two questions

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.810
that we need to address.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.560
And I'll explain what we know

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.600
and what we don't know in the next slide.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.980
So the way that the wiring
diagram was originally done,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.670
was that somebody took,
a group of scientists

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.187
led by John White took this animal

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:05.070
and essentially fixed it
and sliced it like a salami.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.400
So imagine that you're slicing
all over the animal here

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.570
and then you get this cross sections.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.710
And then they did electro
microscopy on the cross sections

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.710
and by segmenting each of the neurons

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.990
which we are putting
here in different colors,

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.140
by hand, this is 1986, they
segmented them by hand.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.790
They were able to recreate
the connectivity map

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.590
for every single cell.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.940
Now this was incredibly powerful

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.390
for the field and it has
benefited our studies,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.410
but I just wanna emphasize
that all of this was,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.700
it wasn't digitalized.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.700
It was all done by hand.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.740
So you could go neuron by neuron

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.910
and you can kind of tell the shape

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.100
and who it connected
to, but we didn't have

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.440
a systems level understanding

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.010
about how this happened until recently,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.590
where Scott Emmons at
Albert Einstein University

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.910
and his student Steve
Cook actually went in

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.120
and did the same segmentation
that John White did

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.330
30 years ago, but with computers.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.608
What that allows us to
do is to be able to know

00:06:57.608 --> 00:07:00.960
who's neighboring who
in a quantitative way.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.150
In a way that we can actually analyze.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.011
And we can analyze using
tools not unlike the tools

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:07.920
that are being used by companies

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.123
like Twitter and Facebook to understand

00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:12.220
interactions between human beings.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.020
So our collaboration
included computational

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.850
scientists Smitha and
Alex and what they did

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.380
is that they took that data

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.080
and we worked together with them

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.290
in using clustering algorithms.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.500
Again similar to clustering
network algorithms

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.910
that are used to understand
personal interactions.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.410
And cluster neurons with
similar contact profiles,

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.000
so essentially neurons that are contacting

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.480
each other as they're traveling together

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.274
in the nervous system in fascicles.

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:40.173
And iterative clustering to understand

00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:43.800
how that structure of
the brain is organized.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.320
And you end up with
essentially a flow diagram

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.470
like this where in one corner you have

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.010
all the neurons and this
clustering algorithms

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.730
iteratively bring them together.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.640
So this different
clustering of the different

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.190
sub-groups of neurons that eventually

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.200
cluster into these larger families.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.880
What it represents, what underlies

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.550
that is real biology of how these neurons

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.740
are interacting with each other.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.350
Real biology that we, that
was inaccessible before

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.680
we were able to digitize these programs.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.620
And we're capable of overlaying

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.783
that on top of the
original EM micrographs.

00:08:15.783 --> 00:08:18.490
Each of these pseudo colors here

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.100
that we have placed represent a community

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.020
of neurons that are interacting together

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.500
more than the other neurons.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.610
I'm gonna just walk you through the brain

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.260
of the animal and this is gonna be playing

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.600
and moving so that you
can see how the different

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.040
communities are actually snaking

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.180
and how they relate to each other

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.980
and how they come together.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.760
As this movie plays, I'll
explain that what I'm showing

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.190
you here is actually
reproducible across the animals

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.630
for which we have connectomes.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.540
So this has been a really fun project

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.190
because we were able to work

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.145
with the computational biologist

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:51.870
informthe algorithms with the biology

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.250
and use the algorithms to
inform our own biology.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.180
We were able to find four main bundles,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.790
that account for 83% of
the whole connectomes.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.510
So now we have a pretty good idea

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.850
about how these different brain regions

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.050
are organized and this neighborhoods,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.397
I just mentioned that they reveal

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:10.220
important biological insights.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.600
So there's a reason why
they're organized this way

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.829
that have to do with development
and function and I'm,

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:17.380
I could give a one hour talk about this.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.020
So I'm gonna use one
example to present this,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.170
and I'll talk about
how these neighborhoods

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.110
led to insights about
how this organization

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.800
is actually established
during development.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.450
And this gets to a fundamental question

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.560
that is a blind spot in the field.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.240
Which is how do you go
from a group of cells

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.760
in an embryo to this organized
connectome in the worm?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.105
And this, this is essentially

00:09:39.105 --> 00:09:40.780
a question that we wanted to understand.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.499
And the reason that this
has been a blind spot

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.750
is that for many organisms this part

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.720
of the development happens inside,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.750
like for example in mammals,

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.850
it happens inside the uterus,

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.490
so the organisms are
essentially inaccessible.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.580
In C.elegans, they lay eggs
so the organism is accessible,

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.000
but there were a number of challenges

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.630
that have prevented in the past,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.260
like four or five decades to image

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.440
embryonic neuro development.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.070
So this is a pretty large blind spot.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.435
We have this information
but we didn't know

00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:06.160
how this was happening.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.360
The reason that imaging neuro
development in C.elegans

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.360
was challenging, were multi-fault.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.510
One of them is that, embryos
when they're inside the egg,

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.585
they're moving very quickly.

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:18.060
So if you're looking for example,

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.540
the development of a single neuron

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.900
using even the fastest
microscopy that we had available

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.830
at the time which spinning disc microscopy

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.600
for the aficionados in the audience.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.610
This is a single neuron
and you get a motion blur

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.350
where it looks like four neurons.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.910
Because the animal is
moving and you're taking

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.400
different pictures so it
looks like you're taking

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.620
four neurons there.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.290
The other problem that
it's hard to capture

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.240
in an image is the animals just die.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.750
So when you're imaging for
prolonged periods of time,

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.840
which is what you want to do,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.260
to be able to capture these different

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.120
neurodevelopmental events,
many of the embryos

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.770
just die so you're end up taking

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.980
snapshots at different
point of development

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.810
that you have to stich together later.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.450
And neurons are actually pretty thin.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.780
These are, they're near the
fraction limit of light.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.930
So and they're traveling in ways

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.750
that are not convenient for imaging.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.120
They're not traveling in planes,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.880
they don't care about our imaging needs.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.220
They're actually snaking in through

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.620
the whole nervous system
so we needed methods

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.680
that allow us to have good resolution,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.880
not just in two dimensions
but in all three dimensions.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.260
So to address this, we
established a collaboration

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.098
with a fabulous Microscopist, Hari Shraff

00:11:19.098 --> 00:11:21.570
and his team of scientists.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.300
And Hari essentially,
we had these discussions

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.730
together and he came up with
the design of this microscope.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.090
I won't go into the nuts and bolts

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.870
about how this microscope work,

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.050
but what I will tell you is the aspects

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.810
of this microscope that makes
it usable for our studies.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.790
This microscope is called
a light sheet microscope

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.860
which essentially means
that instead of imaging

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.300
a single point of light like
many other microscopes do,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.940
it creates a whole sheet of light

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.750
so it's much faster
than regular microscopes

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.550
because you're, it's like in
Star Trek when they scan you,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.370
they're just scanning you point by point.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.540
So it's faster, because it's faster,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.490
it exposes the animal to less light.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.110
So less photo toxicity
also the way the light

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.580
is generated to be able to image

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.940
this animal exposes the
animals to less light.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.490
And the other aspect of this is that,

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.320
for the microscopist in the audience,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.470
or people that have done microscopy,

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.210
they will recognize that when you take

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.010
a three dimensional image of an object

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.630
in a microscope, the resolution in X Y

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.560
is always really good,
but when you turn it

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.020
the resolution you see is always bad.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.118
And that has to do with just the physics

00:12:25.118 --> 00:12:27.337
of light which I'm not going to go into,

00:12:27.337 --> 00:12:30.000
but I will say that X, Y, and Z

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.850
is relative to how you're standing.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.820
So you guys right now are in my Z,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.950
but if I was standing this way,

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.940
that will be my Z, so if I had two images,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.900
where the Z varied, then
I could combine them

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.710
to essentially have an isotropic image.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.700
So if I could, so if I look
at this object like this,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.210
this is my X, Y, and then
I look at it this way,

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.016
and this is my X, Y, and I
combine those two images,

00:12:49.016 --> 00:12:52.870
it's the same resolution
in all three axis.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.980
And this is essentially what we're doing

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.614
with this microscope
because we have two cameras.

00:12:56.614 --> 00:12:58.730
This one illuminates, this one image

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.540
and then they take turns,
you end up with two images

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.680
that you can then fuse
and the Z of this axis

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.870
is different from this one.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.900
So again, I'm discussing
this superficially

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.139
because I know Phil Keller will
discuss this in more detail.

00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:14.450
So we have this microscope
working in my lab

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.650
and this is a slide that I put here

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.740
just to acknowledge two institutions

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.240
the Marine Biological Laboratories

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.723
and the University of Puerto Rico,

00:13:20.723 --> 00:13:24.180
which were meeting
places where technologies

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.270
like Microscopy, like
people from Hari's group,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.660
and biologists from my group were able

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.110
to come together and exchange ideas.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.730
And I think that these places
are gonna be increasingly

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.310
more important for
interdisciplinary collaborations

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.895
necessary to address these problems.

00:13:36.895 --> 00:13:40.000
So what can we do with this?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.340
So this is actually the brain

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.830
of the animal here in an embryo, the tail,

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.350
the head, and that's the brain,

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.710
that ring that you're seeing there.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.677
And I'm gonna play a movie
where we can actually see

00:13:49.677 --> 00:13:53.750
the development of this
animal in real time,

00:13:56.058 --> 00:13:58.210
as a biologist, this is
spectacular that we can see this.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.050
You're gonna see the
animal starts to move,

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.510
he starts to twitch as the
nervous system comes online,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.710
but even when it's twitching,
you can get very crisp images.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.480
Now if you look at subsets of neurons,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.410
which we're going to do here,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.250
you see sub-cellular markers,

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.280
or markers that are more restricted,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.090
you can still see, you can see neurides,

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.360
specific neurides growing
into the brain of the animal.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.715
This is all taken again in live animals

00:14:18.715 --> 00:14:21.640
and essentially you can stop it at anytime

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.185
and you can rotate it, so I'm doing two

00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:25.970
dimensional projections
because I'm using a screen,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.660
but these are three dimensional data,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.780
so as you can see the resolution

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.870
very good in all angles
that you look at it.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.270
And you can continue the movie.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.920
So this gives us unprecedented access

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.700
to events that are
leading to the formation

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.920
of this nerve ring.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.530
And then we had another collaboration

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.810
that was really enabling which is that

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.330
in C.elegans we know the
linage of every single cell.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.480
We've known that since the animal

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.670
was developed as a model organism.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.310
That's how the original studies

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.280
on programmed cell death were done.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.710
And this person, Zhrong
Bao, he's a scientist

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.319
at Sloan Kettering who's
a computational biologist

00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:00.260
and a developmental biologist.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.830
And what I'm gonna be playing here

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.160
is an embryo that is in a four cell stage.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.290
Now this is like playing a movie

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.400
that you know what's gonna happen,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.360
because we know the lineage.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.990
So we know for each one of this cells,

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.930
we know who their progeny is gonna be

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.710
because those studies
have been done before,

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.670
but what he did is that
he trained a computer

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.750
to be able to recognize this in real time.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.210
So as the animal is developing,

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.710
the computer can keep
track of all of this nuclei

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.760
and he knows what each
cell is gonna become.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.150
So why is this important to us?

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.810
It's important for two reasons:

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.900
one of them is because
when we're marking neurons,

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.918
as we're gonna be doing here,

00:15:30.918 --> 00:15:34.240
we can tell their identity
because if we have nuclei

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.230
that we're labeling in
the background in red,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.300
then we can keep the
identity of every single one

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.040
of these neurons that are emerging.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.160
But the other aspect is that we have

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.260
an internal coordinate system,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.350
as the neurons are growing out,

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.920
and crossing the different nuclei,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.610
we know where each neuron is,

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.120
so if we take different embryos,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.140
and we're imaging different embryos,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.880
we can overlay them because we essentially

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.270
have a multi-point
internal coordinate system.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.370
Does that makes sense?

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.500
So what can we do with that?

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.340
Here I'm gonna summarize the work

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.330
of a post doc in my lab, Mark Moyle,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.640
this is five years of work
summarized in one slide.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.873
So essentially, what Mark
did is he was interested

00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:15.755
in identifying the pioneering neurons

00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:18.140
that lead to the
formation, that trail blaze

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.010
the formation of the brain of the animal.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.204
So he looked in embryos
he labeled O membranes

00:16:22.204 --> 00:16:24.330
and he found the first
membranes that are formed

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.020
that are part of the brain, he traced them

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.670
back to the cells here,
we're pseudo coloring

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.880
here so you can see
them, then if he looked

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.616
at the nuclei he can actually identify

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:36.257
by name and last name
those specific cells,

00:16:36.257 --> 00:16:38.710
then he can image as I mentioned before

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.479
the development of the
brain, so he can take

00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:43.420
the cells and kill them
and the hypothesis is,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.350
if you kill them because
they're the first cells,

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.810
if the first cells are important,

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.710
then you shouldn't be
able to develop a brain.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.290
And we get these brainless animals,

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.340
in which we cannot see,
essentially the brain

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.237
is really abrogated so these neurons

00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:56.360
are actually very
important, and it turns out

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.122
when we look back in the
maps that we have created,

00:16:59.122 --> 00:17:01.320
with the computational biologist,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.610
that this pioneer cells
are actually the cells

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.330
that are that are here in purple,

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.320
and they're like SIM cells, they're cells

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.080
that are holding together
the whole nerve ring.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.870
And with that, I'd like
to essentially bring you

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.870
to the attention of how we can both look

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.330
at how the brain is organized
and how the organization

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.790
is established during
development and I'll finish

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.850
by saying that what we have
been able to do with this

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.290
and our aspiration is
to create what will be

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:30.600
the first map of meta neuro
development for any animal.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.791
So we're systematically
tracking all of the ascensions

00:17:32.791 --> 00:17:35.490
of this neurons and creating
these virtual embryo

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.930
that allows examination
of all of these decisions

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.240
in the contest of developing embryo

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.320
which we think will be
enabling for neuroscience.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.070
And with that, I'll finish by thanking

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.540
the people that did the work.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.500
This motley crew and you
for listening to me today.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.599
Thank you.

00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:50.702
(audience applauding)

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:53.452
(relaxing music)
