to go i mean when i was a kid i was

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760
to go i mean when i was a kid i was
 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.360
to go i mean when i was a kid i was

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.830
exhibit the tour the states back in the
late 70s and you know came away from

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840
late 70s and you know came away from
 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.200
late 70s and you know came away from
that just totally obsessed with the past

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210
that just totally obsessed with the past
 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.690
that just totally obsessed with the past
and the idea that maybe I could travel

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700
and the idea that maybe I could travel
 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.580
and the idea that maybe I could travel
back in time and imagine myself of it

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590
back in time and imagine myself of it
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.010

the time of King taught 3,500 years ago

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
the time of King taught 3,500 years ago
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.920
the time of King taught 3,500 years ago
and read everything I could on ancient

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
and read everything I could on ancient
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.990
and read everything I could on ancient
history and the Middle Ages and all

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000
history and the Middle Ages and all
 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.880
history and the Middle Ages and all
sorts of other things and was convinced

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890
sorts of other things and was convinced
 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.530
sorts of other things and was convinced
that that was the direction I was headed

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540
that that was the direction I was headed
 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.480
that that was the direction I was headed
in and around the time I was nine or ten

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
in and around the time I was nine or ten
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.860

my mother and went back to school to get

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870
my mother and went back to school to get
 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.710
my mother and went back to school to get
her PhD in biology and as you do

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720
her PhD in biology and as you do
 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.600
her PhD in biology and as you do
sometimes you know your kids go into the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610
sometimes you know your kids go into the
 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.250
sometimes you know your kids go into the
into work with her parents i went to the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260
into work with her parents i went to the
 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.020
into work with her parents i went to the
lab with her and i discovered that

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030
lab with her and i discovered that
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.580
lab with her and i discovered that
science is really kind of cool it's

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590
science is really kind of cool it's
 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.200
science is really kind of cool it's
really fun you know it's about solving

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210
really fun you know it's about solving
 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.240
really fun you know it's about solving
puzzles on a daily basis and what kid

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250
puzzles on a daily basis and what kid
 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.300
puzzles on a daily basis and what kid
wouldn't like that and so I decided that

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310
wouldn't like that and so I decided that
 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.190
wouldn't like that and so I decided that
I you know I was interested in science

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200
I you know I was interested in science
 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.540
I you know I was interested in science
but I didn't want to give up history

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550
but I didn't want to give up history
 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.890
but I didn't want to give up history
either and I wanted to combine the two

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900
either and I wanted to combine the two
 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.900
either and I wanted to combine the two
so use science as a tool to study the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910
so use science as a tool to study the
 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.480
so use science as a tool to study the
past and that led me to study genetics

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490
past and that led me to study genetics
 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.219
past and that led me to study genetics
in college which is kind of the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229
in college which is kind of the
 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.440
in college which is kind of the
historical branch of biology if you will

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450
historical branch of biology if you will
 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.180
historical branch of biology if you will
we get our DNA from our parents they got

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190
we get our DNA from our parents they got
 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.980
we get our DNA from our parents they got
it from their parents and so it traces

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
it from their parents and so it traces
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.580
it from their parents and so it traces
this lineage back in time and it studied

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590
this lineage back in time and it studied
 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.350
this lineage back in time and it studied
population genetics which is the study

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360
population genetics which is the study
 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.969
population genetics which is the study
of genetic variation in natural

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979
of genetic variation in natural
 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.090
of genetic variation in natural
populations for my PhD and by the time I

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100
populations for my PhD and by the time I
 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.919
populations for my PhD and by the time I
was finishing up my PhD was convinced

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929
was finishing up my PhD was convinced
 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.419
was finishing up my PhD was convinced
that this was going to be you know the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429
that this was going to be you know the
 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.460
that this was going to be you know the
main tool for studying human origins and

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470
main tool for studying human origins and
 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.830
main tool for studying human origins and
how we populated the world and went out

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840
how we populated the world and went out
 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.170
how we populated the world and went out
to Stanford and did a postdoc there and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180
to Stanford and did a postdoc there and
 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.790
to Stanford and did a postdoc there and
ran a research group at Oxford and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800
ran a research group at Oxford and
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.950
ran a research group at Oxford and
followed a typical academic path and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960
followed a typical academic path and
 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.230
followed a typical academic path and
then ended up making a film the journey

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240
then ended up making a film the journey
 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.490
then ended up making a film the journey
of man which aired on PBS in 2003 and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
of man which aired on PBS in 2003 and
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.080

off the the back of that film which was
 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.190
off the the back of that film which was
a co-production with the National

Goodall all these people over the years

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090
Goodall all these people over the years

about the work we were doing the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920
about the work we were doing the
 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.430
about the work we were doing the
scientific work and they literally asked

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440
scientific work and they literally asked
 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.020
scientific work and they literally asked
me this open-ended question if you could

me this open-ended question if you could
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.420
me this open-ended question if you could
do anything next what would it be and I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
do anything next what would it be and I
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.010
do anything next what would it be and I
said we need more samples we need to
