00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.310
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: I couldn't
be more excited

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.240
to introduce Pati Jinich today.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.300
She is a fellow food lover,
writer, PBS television host, and,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.190
in the interest of full disclosure
as we like to say in newspapers,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.340
she is a very dear friend
of mine and, honestly,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.530
one of my favorite
people on the planet.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.980
And that is the only
time I've ever said

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.710
that at The National
Book Festival just

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930 position:56%
in case you've been to other things.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.060
I first got to know Pati the way
a lot of people in D.C. have,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.370
by going to one of her
absolutely incredible classes

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.360
at the Mexican Cultural Institute.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.910
Now this was a big class if I
remember, 100, 150 people maybe?

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.420
And as soon as I was
there and I saw Pati start

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.520
to speak I just thought she can
hold the attention of a crowd

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.990
like no one I had ever seen, or
at least no one I had ever seen

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.760
who wasn't already a star.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.680
There are naturals and there are
naturals and it seemed obvious

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.610
to me that Pati was a natural.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.450
So I've been so thrilled to see her
audience, the people who have come

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.470
to realize as I already
had amazing she is,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.830
I've been so thrilled
to see it grow and grow.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.620
She works incredibly hard
to make her PBS show,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.760
"Pati's Mexican Table",
as rich, and complex,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.680
and gorgeous as her home country.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.250
She is passionate about the idea
that American audiences should grow

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.570
to understand just what
Mexican food is all about,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.550
that it is so different from
region to region of Mexican,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.550
that it is so full of freshness,
and life, and love, just like Pati.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.850
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Oh.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.470
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: In her latest
book, "Mexican Today",

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.510
she sets out to prove that
Mexican dishes should be part

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.560
of any modern cook's repertoire.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.300
I've always thought that Pati
has the mind of a scholar,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.740
the soul of a storyteller, the
heart of a mom, and a wife,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.270
and a friend, and the
smile of a star.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.510
Please welcome Pati Jinich.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.080
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.130
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: So
you're making me cry.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.430
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: I know.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.730
We're going to cry.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.050
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: I'm Pati
Jinich and I love Joe.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.350
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: [Laughs].

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.380
So in case you hadn't noticed, I
was just going to introduce Pati

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.290 position:56%
but Pati asked me to stay,
[laughs], and ask her some questions

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.430
on the stage and we would have
a conversation with you guys.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.440
So I guess one of the first
things that I'm curious

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.150
about is how you feel like your
background, because you have

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.920
such an interesting background,
and I'm not sure everybody knows,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.620
how you feel like your
background led you to food

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.050
and how it continues
to inform what you do?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.350
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Sure, yeah.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.970
Well, I think, you know, many
people ask me when I do book talks

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.870
or demos I always get a few people
at the end that want to talk one

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.240
on one with me and that ask
me how did you switch careers?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.290
How did you do it?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.510
And I immediately look into
their eyes and say, "Do it."

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.810
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Mm-hmm.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.830
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Because I feel like
we all have these personal quests,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.090
you know, where should
we be, what should we do.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.970
I happened to have a very early
on existential crisis when I was

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.940
like 30, 33, 34, I was
already the mom of two

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.690
and I had been trained
as a political analyst.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.620
I studied political science in
Mexico and did a three year thesis

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.850
on Mexican federalism, and
democratic institutions,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.270 position:56%
and the different local governments.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.880
So I was a wealth of
information, you know,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.600
about Mexico all academically
and then I married Danny

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.290
who you know, a lovely, lovely man.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.590
I'm very lucky.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.090
And we moved to Texas
and it was very weird

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.280
because I felt like I was in limbo.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.250 position:56%
You know the scenery looks a little
bit like Mexico but, Mm, not really.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.380
You went into grocery stores and
you saw jalapeno, you saw avocado,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.080
you saw it but they
didn't taste like down

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.960
in Mexico and the restaurants -- .

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.190
I got very nostalgic
and started cooking

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.280 position:56%
and very stubbornly continued with
the academic path and did a master's

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.610
and working at think tank, all
the while Danny telling me, "Pati,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.230
change, change, change,
cook, cook, cook."

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.710
And until one day I
just had a crisis.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.350
I mean, it had been, you know,
as you know, brewing up for

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.810 position:56%
like a year, a year-and-a-half, I
had been so unhappy in my workplace.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.940
And I'm typically like
a happy person.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.240
I'm accessible.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.180
I am accommodating.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.480
I'm the youngest one of four
and I'm the one in my family

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.360
that people always call for advice
when things are going wrong.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.070 position:56%
And I'm always the one to say, "Look
at it the other side," you know.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.660 position:56%
And for a year-and-a-half I hadn't
been able to look at the other side.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.420
I was miserable.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.700
And I was pregnant with my third

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.220
and suddenly I thought what
example am I going to give my kids

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.190 position:56%
that they should work like mad to
be fully unhappy twelve hours a day?

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.460
And I resigned and
I felt at that time

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.480
that I was jumping into the abyss.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.640
Like, you know, I had no
training in cooking, no nothing.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.910 position:56%
And of course loved food and decided
to join L'Academie de Cuisine,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.210
their night intensive
program, and was loving it

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.930
and suddenly everything that I had
learned in politics, sociology,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.600
history of Mexico started
to have meaning and started

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.250
to like unlock its
real meaning to me

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.700
as I started cooking those recipes.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.690 position:56%
And suddenly everything makes sense.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.150
And, of course, didn't
know, you know,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.450
what I was going to do or what.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.850
I wanted to start writing
and instead

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.000
of doing policy research papers to,
you know, food writing, you know.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.820 position:56%
And I wanted still to be an academic
and of course my dad was very upset

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.570
when I switched careers, as I
know I've told you many times,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.250
and he was like, "Oh,
after we put you in college

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.280
and it was that much money.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.860
And then your husband paid for
your master's and you're going

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.900
to go rinse pots and pans,"
like it makes no sense.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.830
And I feel at the beginning I
really felt like I was risking,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.350
like it was a loss, like everything

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.420
that I had done before would just
go, you know, down the chute.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.520
But as years started going
by I realized that everything

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.500
that I had learned and trained was
really giving such a unique bastion

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.720
from where to teach cooking
and to write about cooking.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.020
And I feel, when people ask me,
going back to my introduction

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.310
to this question, when people
ask me, "Should I change?

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.240
I've been a lawyer 30 years,"
you know, I say, "Well,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.340
if you want to be landscaper,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.330
you know how to negotiate
with your clients."

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.090
You know, like, you never know
when, because life is such a zigzag

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:26.270
and now I see the value in
not wanting to always go

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.290
in a straight path and
everything make sense.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.070
And then I think things
naturally started coming together.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.370
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Yeah.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.590
You know, it's striking me when
you were talking about being,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:43.460
when you first moved to Texas, it's
the expat story really in a way.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.500
And, you know, I don't know if the
audience realizes this but so many

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.840
of our great works of culinary
arts have come from the perspective

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.460
of expats when you think of
Diana Kennedy, another expert

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.020
in Mexican cooking, Madhur
Jaffrey, Edna Lewis even.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.430
You could consider her to be an
expat I think from the South.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.930
You know they're people whose
motivation to write about food

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:17.100
and articulate a certain cuisine
was born out of nostalgia in a way

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.850
like they wanted to explore
something that they really missed.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.290
And that seems the same for you.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.990
So when you're in Texas, like how
do think that affected your outlook

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.940
on cooking, you know, being exposed

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.600
to the Mexican food
in Texas particularly?

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.850
&gt;&gt; Pati Janich: I love
that question, Joe.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.150
I love Joe.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.450
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: [Laughs].

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.750
&gt;&gt; Pati Janich: It
such a great question.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.050
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: We'll
just talk to each other.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.350
You guys -- .

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.650
&gt;&gt; Pati Janich: Yeah.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.950
We just, yeah.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.250
I think it is so true.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.150
Distance does so much to you.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.570
I mean many fabulous
writers about, you know,

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.370
Mexican history writers
have been foreigners.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:59.010 position:56%
They're able to come into Mexico and
see what Mexicans take for granted.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.310
We're used to the colors.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.610
We're used to the warmth.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.920
We're used to the eclectic
celebrations and to sucking

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.850 position:56%
on sugar scones on the Day of the
Dead and celebrating with the people

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.860
that have left, you know.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.770
Like a foreigner see all
that with awe and admiration.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.300
And I feel that happened
to me when I left to Texas.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:25.880
And it was many, I think it's that
constant pair that I feel that is

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.550
at the same time painful and
at the same time beautiful.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.940
You know, I always like to say

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.110
that I'm happily torn
between two countries.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:39.470 position:56%
I love Mexico, the roots that I have
there, the roots that nurtured me.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.310
And I mean every time I fly
back I'm teary eyed, you know.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.590 position:56%
At the same time I love the U.S. I'm
so grateful for the opportunities.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:55.130 position:56%
I now have three American boys whose
eyes water with the American anthem.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.350
And I love the U.S., you know.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.040
I'm so grateful for America.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.450
And at the same time I've learned
so much about the United States,

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.850
things that I thought
I knew as a Mexican,

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.060
as an ignorant Mexican, you know.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.440
U.S. is so young.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.910
U.S. has very little history.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.350
Food is very shallow.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.990
You know, the same
things that people think

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.730
about Mexican food,
"Oh, just tacos."

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:22.140
I feel it goes both ways and
it's made me really humble

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:27.360
and it's made me have this
continuous fear of feeling not

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.620
from here, not back there.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.350
I'll tell you something
my mom told me.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.630
When I moved to the
U.S. and I got pregnant

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.200
with Alan who's now a head
taller than me and I love Texas.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.240
He was born in Texas, you know,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.580
I root for the Dallas Cowboys
even though I don't like football.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:55.160
But my mom, when she realized that
to give birth in another country

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.000
for a mother is like painful.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.750
My mom wanted me in Mexico.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.630
She wanted to see that baby born.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.130
She wanted to be the
one holding my hand.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.850
And I'm staying in Dallas.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.270
When she realized that my baby
was going to be born in the U.S.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.630
and that meant that my family
was now Mexican-American

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:18.850
and that I now had commitments and
feelings for these other countries,

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.570
she said, "You know
what you've become.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.200
You've become [foreign
language]," which is a big insult.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.940
That is, but I know she
did it to bring me back

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.770
so I, you know, didn't -- .

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.250
But that is, and then
she took it back.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.150
The [foreign language] means
somebody that doesn't have roots,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.080
somebody that doesn't have a
home country, somebody that is

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.570
like floating and is from nowhere.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.870
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Oh, that's painful.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.170
Yeah.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.260
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And
it was really painful.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.940
Anyway, every time I go back
to Mexico to fill my empty soul

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.930
and I bring the boys to
rediscover something that I knew

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.750
or I learn something
new, I feel that there.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.740
I feel that there like
ah, my Mexico.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.390 position:56%
But then when I get back to our
home in D.C. I'm like yea, I'm home.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.740
It's like this crazy
woman, you know.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.740
But I think it is so true
that nostalgia is very heavy.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.330
Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:25.940 position:56%
It makes you see things in sort of a
magical realism way, very fictional,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.470
you romanticize and some
things you exaggerate.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.380
And my dad tells me all
the time, my sisters,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.030
they make fun of me,
full disclosure.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.370
They're all like -- I once
wrote a piece for my blog

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.850
about how my grandfather
used to come on Sundays --

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.150
you would have loved him.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.250
He was like an angel
fallen from the sky, okay.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.440
My grandfather was just adorable.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.890
And he used to come on Sundays and
we used to make huevos rancheros,

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.810
and beans, and [foreign language]
and it was like incredible.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:02.040
And he used to show me how to pick
figs from the fig tree and when

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.200
to pick apples from the apple tree.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.030 position:56%
And then, you know, he'd tell me the
stories in the hammock of he came

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:14.500
from Poland, from very poor peasant
family and Mexico welcomed him

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.170
so beautifully and he was
just fascinated with Mexico

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.550
so he was it was his
-- you know, anyway.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.100
I wrote this story and my sisters
and my dad read it and when I went

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:31.380
to Mexico they're like, "Pati, our
backyard was the size of my car.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.010
When you write about, 'we
walked through the garden

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.140 position:56%
and we picked the figs'," and I'm
like, "Was there a fig tree or not?"

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.620
And they're like, "Yeah," and
I'm like, "Well, did grandpa used

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.140
to help me pick the figs?"

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.930
"Yeah." And I'm like,
"Well, that's what I said."

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.830
You know. And then "Did we used to
have those gigantic breakfasts?"

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.830
"But you make it sound big, Pati.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.750
You make it sound -- ."

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.420
And I'm like, "That's
what's in my head."

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.390
And it's not like --
I'm not making up facts.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.660
I'm just that romantic,
nostalgic person.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: And you were
smaller so the garden seemed bigger,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.080
you know, that's the other thing.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.380
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Exactly.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.250
It was very funny because
went back to Mexico and wanted

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.880
to show the boys where I grew
up and I told them, you know,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.210
the house used to have these wooden
garage doors where my dog used

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.360
to bark at me when I
came back from school.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.090
And I remember I used to be
in the [foreign language],

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.430
in the roof of the house.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:36.300
I used to take my dog,
take a blanket, take a --

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.200 position:56%
you all are going to think I'm crazy
-- take a flashlight and my notebook

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.120
and bring snacks for my dog
and used to write stories.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.420
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Oh, that's so great.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.720
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And my
mom was very worried

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.230
because she thought I should be
like playing outside or whatever.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.410
And I'm like, "Well,
you're going to see in top

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.100
of the house was full flowers."

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.800
Somebody bought the house
when my parents divorced.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.350
We were driving through the house

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.860
and there's no more
wooden garage doors.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.640
It was just like aluminum.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.410
There were no flowers there.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.000
The house is ugly, guys.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.410
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Oh, no.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.730
[Laughs]. You can't
go back sometimes.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.030
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: I mean
twenty years later.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.800
And I was all willing to go
and ring the bell and I'm like,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.250
"I'm not ringing that bell."

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.550
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: [Laughs].

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.850
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Just
keep the memories.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.690
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Well, it's so
interesting with food and memory

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.650
to me because there's a palpable
sense of nostalgia on your show

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.320
when you go to Mexico
there's just your tone

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.690
of voice changes a little bit.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.750
The light looks different.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.310
You can tell that you're
caught up in a lot of memories.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:39.520
But I also find that food
has the strongest connection

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.980
to memory of anything.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.570
They've even, scientists have said

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:48.680
that the olfactory sense
is the strongest connected,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.400
connection to our memory because
of the way our brain is wired.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.210
And I feel like taste is, too,
like you can taste something

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.790
and it takes you right back.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.810
So when you're looking at
things to film for the show

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.480
and even developing
recipes, how does memory play

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.910
into what you do in the kitchen?

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.590
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Memory is so big.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.140
I mean, I feel it has
such a big role.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.460
I don't know if I told you
the story about the hot dogs

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.760
that I wanted to tell you.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.060
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Yeah.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.360
Mm-hmm.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.660
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: So many people
complain about Mexican food

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.780
in the U.S. It's a
bastardization of the real thing.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.780
It's not the real thing.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.000
And I mean I keep finding
incredible Mexican food.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.240
I've been on book tour on twenty
cities and I'm eating my way

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.570
through some of the
best tacos, you know.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.300
And anyway, I think things
are changing dramatically.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.440
And south of the border,
Mexicans love American food.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.340
So whenever people complain about
Mexican food in the U.S. I respond,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.760
"Have you eaten a Mexican hot dog?"

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.010
Because, you know, the
same thing can be said.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:02.370
Right next to the best and most
popular taco stand is the best hot

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.670
dog stand.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.970
And we Mexicans love them.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.450
You know, it's like that kind of
in a good way love-hate thing.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:09.750
You know, we want to be proud.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.050
We want to be independent.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.390
We're Mexican but we want
that Coke, we want a hot dog,

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.160
we want to watch that
Hollywood film.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.580
We want the Levi jeans, you know,
it's like that kind of a -- .

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:24.820
But so my sisters and I used to
go to this hot dog stand that was

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.260
on the way from school back home.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.360
So when my oldest sister, who's
eight years older than me,

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.670
started driving my parents
didn't drive us anymore

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.560
and on the way back we'd
stop at this hot dog stand

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.450
that was called El Galan which
translates to hunk or dreamboat

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.090
and I always say he was not.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.580
But his hot dogs were insane.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.680
It was, he used the
turkey, a turkey hot dog,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.940
and then he had pork bacon grilling
and it had all the bacon fat.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.020
And then -- you can
see I'm hungry --

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.390
in that bacon fat he would
throw chopped white onion,

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:09.790
pickled jalapenos, tomato and once
that softened he would add ketchup

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.800
which in Mexico we say,
"catsup", and yellow mustard,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.760
and then he had an orange bottle
that had a secret ingredient

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.030
and he would squirt some of that
in there and then he would mix

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.260
that sauce until it
was thick and sizzling.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.170
He would grab a bun,
put it on the bacon fat.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.470
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Oh, wow.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.440
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And then
turn it around, put some --

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.810
who says that Mexicans don't
love American and yellow cheese?

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.410
We love American cheese.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.010
And he'd put a couple of yellow
cheddar, you know, American cheese.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.310
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: American
cheese, yeah.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.280
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And once it
melted and it created a crust,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.150
he'd put the bun, pick up the
cheese, and then put the bacon,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.560 position:56%
put the sausage, and then the sauce.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.950
And then if you wanted
your hot dog special,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.250
which everybody wanted special -- .

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.860
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: More
special than that?

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: More, so he would
add more, more bacon and more sauce.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.400
So you end up with
a thing like that.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.120
And so we're four girls, okay, the
four of us, we'd say, "You know,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.760
let's just, let's be decent.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.190
Let's split two between the four."

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.890
And we'd eat it like
in one second, "Okay,

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.480
let's split another
two between four."

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.780
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: [Laughs].

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.080
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.380
I mean sometimes we would
eat like three per head.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.680
I mean we were starved.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.430
When we got back home my mom used
to make these really delicious,

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:31.320
delicious meals, you know, chicken
Milanese, the alphabet soup,

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.320
mashed potatoes always to start.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.520
And we'd show up -- in Mexico
everybody comes together for lunch

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.270
at 3:00 p.m. and so it's not
like dinner doesn't matter.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.570
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Right.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.310
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And so
we'd all sit at the table

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.220
and we wouldn't touch a thing
because we were so stuffed.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.910
So my dad got really upset and
after a couple of weeks he took

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.700
out [foreign languages] and he
said, "Nobody's going to cook

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.130
in the house for you anymore.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.310
From now on you all are
just going to eat hot dogs."

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.010
And we were like, "Yeah."

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.970
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: [Laughs].

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.970
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: So and I always
think, you know, when I'm trying

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:10.380
to discipline my boys on something
and you decide on a strategy

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.630
and you realize that it was
the wrong, wrong strategy

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.050
but you can't take it
back because you said it

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.070
so that's what happened
until, you know,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.700
we realized we were making
my mom feel very sad.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:28.240
We went back and then so many years
later, oh, my God, 30 years later,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.440
my parents divorced, my sisters
live all in different places

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.130
and I'm here taping season
five, no it was season three

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.330
of "Pati's Mexican Table",
the first time I was working

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.120
with this new production company
which was, as you know, you know,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.610
a great departure from what I was
doing because it was unscripted.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.910
&gt;&gt; Joe Yoanan: Right.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.210
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Totally natural.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.950
And when we got to [foreign
language] and we were deciding what

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.650
to film -- so many
things we have said.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.280
You were asking, you know,
things that I know that in

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.930
that state we need to try,
people that we need to meet,

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.890
but many things we leave, let's
see what we feel like doing.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.190
Let's see what we hear.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.280
And they kept telling us
about Richard's Hot Dogs.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.660
And all the crew, they're
all American, they're like,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.570
"We're not going to
have hot dogs in Mexico.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.870
That's ridiculous."

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.860
And I'm like, "Oh, you don't
know what you're missing.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.160
We have to go."

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.710
So we go to Richard's Hot Dogs
and they turn on the cameras,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.710
they start filming and then, you
know, the director says, "Pati,

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.330
go in the back with him so he
can teach you what he's doing."

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:32.850
And suddenly he's doing the hot
dog and I'm like there, you know,

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:38.330
and I see the hot dog and he puts
it together and he gives it to me

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.130
and I usually, when we go film,
I'm feeding the crew because I get

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.110
so excited, you know,
this so good you have

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.190
to try it, you have to try it.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.450
I'm like telling the camera this
tastes like this and this --

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.280
and I get the hot dog
and I give it a bite

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.280
and then Dan says, "Pati, tell us.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.580
What does it taste like?"

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.170
And I'm like, like, you don't know.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.170
And he's like, "Show it to camera."

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.000
Like, "Aren't you going
to give Dave a bite?"

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.350
But, no, you know.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.530
So I had a really hard time.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.050
And, okay, fine, "I
had the hot dog taste

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.830
like this," and here to the camera.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.940
And I just wanted to
devour the thing, you know.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.780
We finished taping and Richard
noticed like my suffering

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.150
and he said, "I'll
give you one to go."

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.880
He gave me a hot dog, I jumped
in the van and I closed the door

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.310
to eat my hot dog and like
five minutes later Dan comes,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:34.200
opens the door, we're all leaving,
and I'm like crying, crying my eyes

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.780
out and he's like, "Pati."

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.270
It was our first day working
together and he's like,

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.770
"Did I do anything wrong?

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.500
Like, was I screaming or -- ?"

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.640
And I said, "No, no, no,
it was just the hot dog.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.940
I'm fine."

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.240
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Oh, man.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.540
Wow.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.840
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And he's like,
"Oh, this is what I'm going

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.140
to have to deal with, huh?"

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.440
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: [Laughs].

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.750
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: So,
the love for a hot dog.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.000
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: That's
such a beautiful story.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.660
And you have a hot dog recipe in
your book, in your new book so -- .

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.960
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And, yeah.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.260
I have a hot dog.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.990
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: How did you
interpret it then for your book?

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.500
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: So I
did, you know, I did --

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.080
oh, this is what I did not
do because my sisters and I,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.270
after many years of going
to the hot dogs found

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.880
out what was in the orange bottle.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.320
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Uh-oh.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.810
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: It was orange soda.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.110
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Wow.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.750
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Because we saw
El Galan, which he was not,

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:31.440
pouring like Orange Crush,
you know, in the soda.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:37.420 position:56%
And, of course, when you think about
it, it's sweet, you know, it's --

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.860
we didn't care when we found
out but I didn't add it.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.160
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Right.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.630
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Because I just felt
it was unnecessary to add orange

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.100
in our Orange Crush to
the hot dog [inaudible].

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.860
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: That's a
very different cookbook.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.160
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Exactly.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.830
I think he trying to thin
out the sauce, you know,

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.050 position:56%
to make it last longer or something.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.470
But, and then I played
with the other one.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:04.460 position:56%
So in doing this book I really tried
to do because when I was working

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.390
with the editor she's
really fabulous.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.830
You know [Inaudible] and
she was telling me, "Pati,

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.060
do you want to do more of the
traditional and, you know,

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.480
for the contemporary kitchens?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.390
Or do you want to do
more of the new?"

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.510
And since I love doing
both I said, "You know,

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.240
why don't we try doing both and
we do it by themes, you know,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.380
taco night, enchilada night?"

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.590
And I was having fun doing both.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.160
And I realized that for
people it's been a big change

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.520
from the first book to this book.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.270 position:56%
And I think people have had, I mean,
even though they love the recipes

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.940
and I try to be, you know,
very innovative with the tacos

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.890
and enchiladas, people want

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.410
to find a chicken chapter
and a fish chapter.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:48.710
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Oh, interesting.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.450
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And I
think it gives more order.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.930
Like we're not used
to going to the index.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:59.850
But so I tried to do a new hot
dog so I gave, which is delicious,

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:05.030
so this one has so The Dreamboat
is the one I grew up eating

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.870 position:56%
and the hot dog [foreign language] I
just tried to add my favorite things

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.170
that I go for when I
go to a Mexican market,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:18.560
chicharron which is
pork rind, queso fresco.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.800
I die without pickled jalapenos
in my life, so pickled jalapenos

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.030
and the juice and it
turned out really good.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.510
So it was something that
I knew and something new.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.270
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Great.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.270
So another really interesting
aspect of your background and your,

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.570
the way you approach cooking

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.440
and your personality
is that you're Jewish.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.990
So and your family
background's really fascinating.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.170
We were talking about it at
dinner a couple of weeks ago.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:53.450
So maybe can you tell us a little
bit about how your family ended

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:58.130
up in Mexico and how that comes
into your cooking and work.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.430
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:04.300
Well, I'm definitely not religious
or kosher, hence my love for pork,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.360 position:56%
and chorizo, and all things seafood.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.360
But my grandparents
immigrated to Mexico

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.310
at different historical times.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:21.690
On my father's side they came
from Poland like in the 1920's,

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.390
running away from pogroms.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.350
They were trying to get
into the U.S. but the quota

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.150
for Polish people was closed.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.480
And then my other grandparents,
my grandmother came from Austria

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.090
and my grandfather came
from Czechoslovakia.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.280
And they came during
the Second World War.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.840
Most other family died
in concentration camps.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.070
So it was two very
different immigrant ways.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:50.020
And when I was growing up in
Mexico we weren't religious at all.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.850
We weren't an active part
of the Jewish community.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.510
My parents were a little
bit, you know,

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.490
very independent even though we
celebrated the Jewish holidays

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.880
with my grandparents
when they were alive,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.230
it was more a family cultural,

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.710
especially a gastronomical
experience

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.760
because there is something
called Mexican-Jewish cuisine

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.300
and it is delicious.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.690
I mean, what happens with Jewish
people and Jewish communities

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.390
as they moved and settled around
the world is that, thankfully,

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.520
especially for Eastern European
and Yiddish or Ashkenazi foods

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.900
which are very bland,
they get stamped

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.030
or enriched with the ingredients.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:35.930
The mingling of Mexico and the
Jewish community has been one

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.130
of warmth and a lot
of things in common.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:44.590
You know, the Jewish people are a
lot about family, eating together,

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.450
sharing, always stuffing your
kids when they don't want

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.510
to eat any more, you know.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.710
Mexicans are, you know, the same.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.750
There's a lot of shared values.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.900
And but when I grew up in Mexico,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:03.340
I must have been the only
Jew is a class of 120 people

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.490
and so [inaudible]
there was something

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.320
about it that wasn't comfortable.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.690
I wasn't, I wanted to
be like everybody else.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.230
So you had Gomez, Pereira,
Drijanski, like who's that?

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:18.470
You know. And it always
stood out a little and I felt

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.350
like I was treading between worlds.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.120
I felt very Mexican of course.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.390
You know my parents
are first born Mexican.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.690
I'm a second generation Mexican.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.030
Like to me I'm like
100 percent Mexican.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:36.500
As a Mexican you celebrate
Catholic celebrations

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.330
because they're national.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.600
I mean [foreign language],
who doesn't?

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.810
You know. And Christmas, and
Easter, and Day of the Dead,

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.540
and because all those
celebrations are

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.410
like embedded in the Mexican DNA.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:56.270
And I grew up also
mostly raised by my Nana,

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.860
my mom used to work full
time and my nanny who came

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.020
from [foreign language], she was
this lovely woman who was Catholic

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.070
in the very Mexican eclectic way.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:09.920
And I used to go with
her to mass on Sundays,

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.130
like do the full thing, you know.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:16.010
And my parents when they were
married they were a little selfish

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.490
and they used to leave my sisters
and I with nanny, with my Nana,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.930
and she used to make
[foreign language] and turkey

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.350
and we celebrated Christmas
and exchanged gifts

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:31.410
and I feel very spiritual
when I go into a church.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.750
You know, I know it
sounds very weird

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.530 position:56%
but I have those things mixed in me.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:41.990
And I remember when my grandmother
who, you know, survived the war

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.300
and came to Mexico and
felt very welcome but went

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.990
through all the trauma, when she
saw me like go like that in front

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.490
of a church, she nearly
had a heart attack.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.090
And she's like, "Pati,
do you realize?

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.450
Do you realize what you're doing?"

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.750
I didn't know.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.060
I had no idea.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.020
But anyway so I grew up
feeling like what am I?

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.460
You know, like am I from here?

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.770
Am I from there?

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:10.640 position:56%
And then when I moved to the U.S. it
like got exponential because I was

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.710
in Dallas and when people saw
me they were like, and I'd say,

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.660
"I'm from Mexico," they
were like, "No, you're not.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.340
You're not Mexican," you know.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.750
And it was very, you know,
"The people that I know

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.510
from Mexico don't look
like you at all.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.910
They don't sound like you at all."

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.440
And then when I would say my last
name they'd be like, "Jewish?"

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.120
you know, like they couldn't
put two and two together.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.610
And so for me it was
this clashing thing.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.850
And then I have American
kids, you know.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.210
So my boys are born.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.370
So now they're
Mexican-American-Jews, you know.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:51.800
And I think it took me to be over
40 years old to come to terms

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.450
with all the different
parts of my being and feel

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.850
like they don't exclude each other.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.970
I used to be very defensive when
people, when I started cooking

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.620
and I would get requests for, "Can
you do something for Passover?"

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.920
[inaudible].

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.220
I'm like, "I'm Mexican,
why should I do?"

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.520
you know?

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.820
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Right.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And I think now I've
come to terms with all those sides.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:17.670
And I think one wants your
children to be very strong

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.360
in the things that you felt weak.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.110
And I feel that's why we decided
to put our kids in Jewish school

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:29.120
for the elementary school
years because I wanted them

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.180
to be very comfortable
within their skin

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.880
which I think they are much
more than when I was growing up.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.640
But still when they came out of
the bus I used to take kippah off

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.590
of their heads, you know.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.300
But I feel like now
it was a little fear,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.970
a little embarrassment,
a little, you know.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:53.120
But I feel like now I'm so proud
about all my pieces, you know.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.490
And I don't think I could have
spoken this way five years ago.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:02.780
Now ask me for a matzo ball
recipe, I'll share, you know,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.990
because I feel I'm not -- .

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.550
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: With
pickled jalapenos.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.220
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: With exactly.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.660
So I feel I'm a very
opinionated person and I [laughs]

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.250
and I tend to go yes or no.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.050
I like something, I love it,
I don't like it, [inaudible],

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.350
you know, I can't stand it.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:28.020
And I've learned with age to just,
you know, not be so up and down

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.390
and just learn because
I know that also change

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.720
in the way I perceive things.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.630
And that has happened
with Tex-Mex food as well.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.810
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.650
So I want to open up to
audience questions in a minute

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.710 position:56%
but there was one other thing that I
wanted to make sure that I asked you

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.230
because I have a particular
interest in it.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.750
And that is one of the differences

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:53.960
between your two books was really
thrilling to me which is that --

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.260
you know where I'm
going with this --

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:00.960 position:56%
which is that in your latest book
there are a lot of vegetables dishes

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.660
which I was so excited to see.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.530
And I think that a lot of people

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:10.410
who misunderstand Mexican food
don't realize how many beautiful

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.100
vegetables and treatment of
vegetables are in Mexican dishes.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.430
They think that it's
just always -- .

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.730
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Pork.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.030
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Pork or
[inaudible] meat or, you know,

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.940
if you do an American
dish, that it's chicharrons

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.640
on a hot dog which it sometimes is.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.940
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: [Laughs].

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.240
Yeah.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.630
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: But so
talk to us about that,

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.640
about putting more vegetables
in the book and why and sort

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.940
of how you think about that.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.240
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yeah.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.970
I mean I think this is a
great question and I'm going

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.950
to give you a very funny answer.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.870
You know what I was saying
about Mexico and the U.S.?

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.170
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Mm-hmm.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.990
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And
Mexico, you know, wanting --

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.390
so the trends that happen
in the U.S. usually get

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.720
to Mexico a little bit later.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.140
You know, like quinoa.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:53.250
It started getting to Mexico and
now we're making quinoa tortillas.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.550
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: You are?

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.850
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yes.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.150
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: I want to try that.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.450
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: I know.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.640
But it's like we, you
know, we have these things.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.480
With the vegetarian and vegan
and more vegetable dishes,

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.130
in Mexico there has never
been a trend for vegetarian

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.050
or vegan until very recently.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:17.570
So there wasn't that category as
in a dictionary of a [inaudible].

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:23.550
However, Mexican cuisine is
inherently vegetarian and vegan.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.760
So, you know, by the time
we realized that, oh,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.070
vegetarian is super cool, Mexican
chefs and cooks start doing

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:35.240
but like purpose of the vegetarian
dishes we realized, wait,

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.330
all these [foreign language], all
these vegetables, all these sauces,

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:43.800
all these soups are
inherently naturally vegetarian,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.890
we just haven't gotten
that trend with that name,

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:50.070
with that title fast enough.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.560
But Mexican cuisine have been
farm to table since the Aztecs.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.860
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Right.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.160
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: You know,
when people here say farm

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.140
to table I'm like, "That's
how we grow up in Mexico."

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.760
You go to the farmer's market
which is literally the people

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.480
from the farm with their things
on a roll from the market.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.770
And the farm to table, you know,
all these movements for fresh

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.320
and seasonal, Mexico,
Mexico, Mexico.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.590
And it turns out that
vegetarian and vegan is also --

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:22.420
if you go to the provinces
especially in Mexico,

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.760
and not necessarily Mexico City,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.520
you will find that the Mexican
diet is mainly vegetarian.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.080
It's black beans, pinto beans.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.490
It's [foreign language]
squash, chilis.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:39.710
It's corn, corn tortillas,
corn masa.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.350
There's very little meat.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.240
It's of course the
taquerias and the -- .

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.540
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Sure.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.940
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: You know, and
the things that become popular.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.240
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Great.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.540
Delicious.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.840
Thank you.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.140
So, I want to open
it up to questions.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.620
So anyone who has questions
please come to one

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:01.620
of the microphones
so we can hear you.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.550
Otherwise I have to keep asking
questions which I'm happy to do.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.200
Pati and I could talk
all day but we want

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.800
to hear what you guys
are curious about.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.260
Mexican food?

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.560
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: I think I was -- .

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.860
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Vegetables?

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.160
We just covered -- .

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.460
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: I was
getting to personal.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.760
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: We're
such completest.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.180
You have to stand up and you
have to go to the microphone.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.180
Stand up. Come to the microphone.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.480
Thank you.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.780
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yea, a question.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.080
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Hi.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.040
&gt;&gt; Hi. Have you tasted any
other food besides Mexican

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.510
and American food?

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.560
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yes, yes, yes.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.370
We love all foods.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:40.900
My family loves Italian,
Japanese, Chinese.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:47.280
Yeah, we love to explore and we
love to find where, you know,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.380
there are the common things and
where the different things happen.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.080
We were just in Japan this summer.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.570
And I was so amazed with all
the ceremony and attention

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.010
that goes into the way we eat.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.010
So radically different from Mexico.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:09.400
You know Mexicans, you have an
enchilada and you have, you know,

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.620
it's like a potato and
swiss chard enchilada.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.640
And we have the sauce,
and we have the garnishes,

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.260 position:56%
and we have the chiles and we put
it all there for you already, there.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.300
You know. You take a bite
and everything is there.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.640
When we went to Japan and I
asked for the Japanese breakfast,

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.960
it was like twenty things
and I was like, "Okay.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.290
So what goes on top of each other?"

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.860
And they're like, "No, no.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.900
You pick a little this,
you pick a little that."

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:36.220
And I like to have a little bit
of everything in a spoon so I was,

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.880
first of all I'm horrible with
the chopsticks, embarrassingly.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.090
I mean it was a challenge for me.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:49.140
And then I learned to
appreciate why and how you really,

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.080
you're playing with your palate.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.130
You had a little bit salty,
you had a little bit -- .

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.520
And Mexican cuisine is more
everything's there for you.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.830
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Right.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.130
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.060
But, yes, so yeah.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.630
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Questions?

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:05.930
Hi.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.230
&gt;&gt; Hi. I want to know
if you're going

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.300
to write a Mexican-Jewish cookbook?

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.600
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yeah.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.900
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Great question.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.200
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yes.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.910
I've been asked a lot about
that and in fact, you know,

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.360
we're friends with Jo
Nathan, who's phenomenal,

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.240
and I've told her many times that
she should do it because she's

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:32.200 position:56%
so great at doing the Mediterranean,
the American, the Latin American.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.560
I feel I love Mexican-Jewish food.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.440
You know I grew up eating that
on the holidays and every Friday.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.420
And there's so many
foods that I like making

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.920
at home from my grandparents.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:51.520 position:56%
But since I am not kosher, you know,
I don't know if that prevents me

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.420
from having the authority
to say, you know,

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.890
here is a Mexican-Jewish cookbook

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.870
because I think the
expectation would be

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.490
that it would also be kosher.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:06.220
And, I mean, maybe I'd have to take
a course on, so that I would be,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.320
you know, but I feel like I have a
little bit of a weak point there.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.420
I appreciate kosher food and I
appreciate all different kinds

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.980
of Mexican-Jewish food but I feel

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.770
that I would be very
weak on that part.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.220
&gt;&gt; I'm a culinary instructor
in Maryland and I would love

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.520
to read the book if you had it.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.010
And I have your first cookbook.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.310
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Oh, yea.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.610
Thank you.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.390
In the second cookbook I
have a great matzo ball soup.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:30.690
&gt;&gt; Ah, great.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.580
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: You know
what I do to the matzo balls?

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.990
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: What?

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.290
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: I -- .

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.590
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Chicharron?

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.890
No.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.190
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: No.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.490
Let me tell you what I do to them.

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:45.540 position:56%
My grandmother who came from Austria
who was such an extraordinary cook,

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:50.370
she used to add nutmeg instead
of black pepper and, of course,

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.710
parsley, and a little
bit of sparkly water

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.690 position:56%
to make the matzo balls very fluffy.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:59.940
And I started adding, you know,
you add vegetable oil to the dough,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.010
to the matzo ball dough,
I started adding a splash

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.310
of toasted sesame oil.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:09.450
And the combination of the
toasted sesame oil with the nutmeg

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.060
and the matzo meal is insane.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.270
It's like you have three
layers of nuttiness.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:19.310
It's like toasty, like toasty
layers, different kinds of --

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.570
help me with the word
-- it's not toasty.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.570
It's like toasty.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.870
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Like nutty?

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.320
Nutty.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.620
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yeah.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.920
Like nutty, toasty.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.220
They're really good.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.520
You should try them.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.120
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Thank
you, thank you.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.420
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Yes.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How much has Tex-Mex
influenced your books and,

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.100
question two, do you
have any recommendations

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.670
for restaurants in the D.C. area?

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:45.820
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: In D.C.
I feel that it's not

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.250
like Tex-Mex has influenced
my cooking but I think

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:54.430
like Tex-Mex has opened my mind
and I've learned to appreciate

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:58.600
that there's regional Mexican
cuisine south of the border,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.560
there's Tex-Mex which its
own animal, its own being,

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.670 position:56%
that it's evolving, and then there's
other Mexican regional cuisines

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:12.660
that are evolving north of the
border that are not Tex-Mex

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:17.210
or [inaudible] but they're
Mexican and it's just,

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:22.860 position:56%
Trump wouldn't be happy with this,
but the border in gastronomic terms,

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.910
you know, regional Mexican cuisine
is just everywhere to the benefit

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.590
of everyone because
it's so delicious.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.080
You go to California there's one
kind of regional Mexican food.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.670
You to Chicago, there's
a different one.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:42.220
And it's Mexican, you know, just
like the nominal Italian cuisine

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.690
in the U.S. I mean I think,
it was so funny because we

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.410
like to take the boys
wherever we can, you know,

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.710
especially now that they're older.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:55.240 position:56%
So every summer we try to take them
something that's very exotic for us.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.620
So a few summers ago
we took them to Paris

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:05.090
and we ate the best Italian
food we tasted in our lives.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.420
And we were sort of disappointed

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.760
with the French food we
were eating, you know.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.650
But that Italian restaurant
was insane, you know.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.750
You had another question,
oh, recommendations, okay.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.230
There's, from the time
that I moved here to D.C.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:29.190 position:56%
which I think was sixteen years ago,
there's been an explosion in terms

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.360
of food and restaurants,
not only Mexican,

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.680
the scene is so much better.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.980
It's phenomenal now.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.580
So there's Oyamel, you know,
Jose Andres' Mexican restaurant

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.160
which is really fabulous.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.990
His tacos are really good.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.880
He makes his own masa.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.920
There is a restaurant that I
really love that's called El Sol

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.710
Tequileria [inaudible].

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.010
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Yes.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.310
Very good.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:52.610
So good.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:53.910
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: He's so good.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:58.430
I mean that Mexican,
Mexican like you would eat

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.970
in a Mexican's grandma house.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.270
And it is phenomenal.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:06.290
He also makes everything, his
sauces, his moles, his corn.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.590
It's packed now.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.890
I mean it's 10 days.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.190
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: [Inaudible]
Eleventh Street.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.020
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Eleventh
Street then and he's adorable.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.560
If Chef Solis is there, ask for
him and he'll send you the --

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.590 position:56%
he has great queso fundidos as well.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.230
There's Habanero which
I also went to.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.660 position:56%
It's, I think, on Fourteenth Street.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.960
It's very good as well.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.260
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Columbia Heights.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.560
&gt;&gt; Did you say Habanero?

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.860
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Taqueria,
Taqueria Habanero.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.160
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Yes.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.460
Really good salsa.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:38.180
I think, I mean, and then of course
there's Victor Albisu's Taco Bamba.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.520
I haven't been to Taco Bamba
but I've eaten his tacos.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.820
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Mm-hmm.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.120
&gt;&gt; Pati Janich: At
presentations he's done

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.290
and they're really good as well.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.100
&gt;&gt; Pati Janich: Sure.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.200
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Other questions?

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.500
Yes.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.310
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little
bit about what it took

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.930
to get published the first time?

00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:02.530 position:56%
The process that you went through to
decide to write in the first place

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:07.940
and then how you went about, if you
needed an agent, if you published

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.880
with difficulty or
ease, how did that go?

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.180
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Absolutely.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:17.880
I think there's a big advantage
in life when you jump blind

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:23.530
into something because if you
start researching about, you know,

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.890
the process and how difficult
it is, you'll freeze.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.270
And it was very hard.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.110
It was very hard especially in
the field of Mexican cooking

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:34.150
because there's so much out there.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.740
There's so many Mexican cookbooks.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.540
That it really, really needed
to be something very different

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.620
from what was in the market.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:49.580
And I think I sent it to
maybe 30 or 25 publishers.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:55.210
And I think I must have gotten
24 rejections in one year.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:58.180
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: And when you, just
to interject for a minute, you,

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.790
what was the -- where
were you in your show

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:04.010
when you were writing the book?

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:07.500
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: So when I was
writing the book I was working

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.960
on season one.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.260
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Right.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.320
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: And that also
helped, you know, in them thinking

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.880
that I would -- so this
is what I recommend.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.060
Like I think these days there
needs to be some kind of platform,

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.310
you know, either you blog, or
your strong on social media,

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:28.590
or you teach classes,
or you write something.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.180
But you already have,
don't you think?

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.030 position:56%
Like if you already have some people

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:37.440
that like your content I
think that's very powerful

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.970
when you come and try
pitch yourself.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.970
Now publishing versus
self publishing,

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.170
I wholeheartedly recommend
publishing

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.910
because publishing they're going
to be very critical with your work

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.340 position:56%
and you can't just publish whatever.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.640
They're going to be very tough.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.940
They're going to be critical.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:46:00.190
They're going to help you say, you
know -- oh, two minutes left, okay.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.920
It's a much harder process but you
went with a much better product

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.320
than if you self publish.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.660
And also, they'll help market.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.370
They'll help position the book.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.990
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Time for one
very quick one from someone

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.780
who hasn't asked I'm afraid.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.530
&gt;&gt; You mentioned L'Academie
de Cuisine.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:25.320
Do you find that was a necessary
step for you looking back?

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.810
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: For me, yes,
because I did it later in life

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:34.400
and I felt like I needed the tools.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.090
And, yeah, I think it
helped me realize --

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:43.200
I mean you don't have to do
the full four years in the CIA,

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.290
just like jump into a
course, or, you know,

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.310
ask to intern at a restaurant.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:53.050 position:56%
Like I always say if you're thinking
about switching careers into food,

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:56.780
just try to get a taste
of what that will be

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.490
and so you can get some tools.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:02.910
I believe that the most preparation
is the better preparation

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:08.440
and over-preparation is
being barely prepared.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.610
[Laughs].

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:11.990
&gt;&gt; Joe Yonana: Well,
thank you very much, Pati.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:14.110
I think that's about
all we have time for.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.410
Thanks so much.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.980
&gt;&gt; Pati Jinich: Thank you.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.250
[ Applause ]

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:23.110
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
