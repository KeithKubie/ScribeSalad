00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.039
While it’s commonly stated that the practice
of marking important dates in red didn’t

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.870
begin until the Middle Ages, in fact, in ancient
Rome red ink was sometimes used on calendars

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.140
to identify significant dates, as well as
occasionally used on important text in documents,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.679
with the underlying reason in both cases seemingly
being the same as today- to make the text

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.930
stand out, in the case of the calendar marking
a noteworthy day.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.150
Through the years this practice continued,
and in particular with medieval scribes who

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.770
used red ink in much the same fashion for
initial capital letters and certain important

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.560
words (called rubrics) in their illuminated
manuscripts.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.350
As writing became more widespread, others
quickly adopted the use of red ink in their

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.840
writing, too, as noted by John Trevisa in
Polychron (1387): “we writep capital letters

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.430
wip reed colour.”

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.820
Likewise, particularly important days, such
as a saints’ feast or one of the holy days,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.220
were identified on medieval church calendars
with the color red.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:20.270
It was first identified in English by William
Caxton in The boke yf Enyeydos (1490): “We

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:33.720
wryte yet in

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.979
oure kalenders the hyghe festes wyth red lettres
of colour of purpre.”

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.870
In 1549, the first Book of Common Prayer included
a calendar with the holy days marked in red,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.820
thus spurring use of the phrase; however,
the first print reference to red-letter day

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.369
is not seen until 1663, when Edmund Gayton
wrote in The religion of a physician: “the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.520
Red-letter daies being the Ornament of her
Year.”

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.920
Using the term in reference to a secular day
is first seen in The Journals of Madam Knight

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.600
in which Sarah Kemble Knight (1666-1727) wrote:
“Their Chief Red Letter day is St. Election,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.110
wch is annually Observed according to Charter,
to choose their Govnr.”

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.360
Notably, even today in England there remains
an official practice of recognizing certain

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.730
special days as “Red Letter days,” such
as the Queen’s birthday and some saints’

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.570
days, at least with its High Court; on these
days, all High Court judges wear scarlet robes,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.609
while on ordinary days, only judges hearing
criminal cases wear the long red garments.

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.169
Because the rest of the calendar was written
in black ink, ordinary days used to commonly

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.519
be referred to as black-letter days; for example,
Tobias Smollett wrote in The tars of old England.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.169
A Comedy (1757): “O! the month of November,
She’ll have cause to remember As a black

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.859
letter day all the days of her life.”

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.160
The legal phrase black-letter law, meaning
well-established, basic principles of law

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.720
that are no longer up for debate, traces its
history to at least 1831 when the US Supreme

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.989
Court wrote in Jackson v. Huntington, 30 U.S.
402: “It is seldom that a case in our time

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.100
savors so much of the black letter, but the
course of decision in New York renders it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.100
unavoidable.”

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.790
Interestingly, the phrase does not derive
from Black’s famous dictionary or the color

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.790
of the ink.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.400
Rather, black-letter refers to an old-fashioned
form of type that used to be called blackletter,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.390
but today is known generally as Gothic, – a
formal, difficult-to-read script that, as

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.160
it was used for all legal printing well into
the 18th Century, symbolized both the law

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.010
and the authority of the State.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.910
In fact, even though Roman type had been adopted
for most English printing during the Renaissance,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.410
legal printers purposely retained their nearly
unintelligible Gothic script, at least in

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.780
part because lawyers liked keeping the fundamentals
of the law to themselves.[1]

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.169
Many attribute the changeover to William Blackstone
who broke with tradition and published his

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:01.190
famous Commentaries on the Laws of England
(1765-1769) in Roman type.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.070
As the Commentaries soon became the go-to
treatise for lawyers of the age, it influenced

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.900
others to begin publishing law books in the
far easier-to-read Roman type as well; this

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.120
was, perhaps, not so much because Blackstone
was the premiere authority on English law,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:29.539
but rather because his book was far easier
to decipher than other, earlier texts.
