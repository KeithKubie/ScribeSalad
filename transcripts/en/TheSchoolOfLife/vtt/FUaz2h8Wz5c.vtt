00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
it's an enormous and very rare privilege

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.000
to have lived in the days of good government

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.480
across nations and centuries

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.230
few people have ever done so by a rare bit of

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.360
of luck certain groups in a few corners

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.789
of the globe tasted decades of this

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.119
remarkable anomalous blessing they might

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.490
foolishly especially if they traveled

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.130
little seldom read history books or had

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.689
a very high estimation of their own

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.880
populations they might even have started

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.369
to assume it was a natural or god-given

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.940
norm yet the default state of almost all

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.370
nations is quite other it is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
authoritarianism bullying demagoguery

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.579
corruption monopoly racial segregation

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.129
and state-sponsored aggression and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.030
murder

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.300
we will not now it seems be living in

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.600
dramatically unusual times it was the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.000
years before that will be remembered as

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.539
unusual a daring bet against the facts

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.899
of our nature we are sliding into a new

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.290
age of darkness we are reverting to a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.850
mean civilization was always simply an

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.090
unlikely concept those who are afraid

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.750
are typically reassured by optimism all

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.600
will eventually be well the kindly tell

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.140
them but we need stiffer darker council

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.990
we should explore not what might ideally

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.909
happen which leaves us oscillating

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.340
painfully between hope and despair but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.380
what will happen if the worst comes to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.320
pass we need to make ourselves entirely

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.960
at home with catastrophe looking at it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.090
squarely in the eye so it's not to keep

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.040
catching glimpses of it here and there

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.500
and so taking fright and you every time

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.439
we stand to see that whatever comes to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.320
pass will in a desperately reduced and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.670
pitiful form

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.150
still be survivable a home could be

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.310
built among the ruins there might be

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.200
some sort of life to be led

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.420
despite everything nothing is ever

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.630
properly unbearable not least because we

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.880
always retain access to the best escape

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.610
route the stoic philosophers of ancient

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.970
Rome those poor souls agitated beyond

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.010
compare by the antics of their

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560
hysterical thin-skinned murderous

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.720
Emperor's would known to calm themselves

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.930
down by holding up their veins to the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.950
light and calling out freedom knowing it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.160
could if it came to that all be over in

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.209
minutes

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.880
we shouldn't be surprised by our fellow

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.280
citizens this is what the human animal

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.190
is really like very sweet at points from

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.470
close up usually generous two small

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.840
children and the elderly hard-working

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.690
but highly prone to delusion tribal

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.239
offended by strangers an inclined to

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.370
rational analysis and with a fondness

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.799
for slaughter and reckless messianic

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.040
plans the elite routinely derided as

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.980
out-of-touch and not so on the basis of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.019
forgetting how much milk or the rent

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.810
costs rather on the basis of forgetting

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.109
have dark and broken human nature really

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.070
is

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.140
there's a natural longing to do

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.209
something quickly and angrily there's an

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.579
equal longing to give up and hide the

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.730
Council of quietism neither feels quite

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.510
right

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.720
neither endurance nor explosion the only

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.910
true avenue is to commit ourselves to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.269
years of careful adroit plotting to

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.670
bring about a renewal of that now ever

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.670
more implausible dream a land governed

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.670
for a little while longer by a spirit as

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.790
fragile as crystal of wisdom and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.450
tolerance
