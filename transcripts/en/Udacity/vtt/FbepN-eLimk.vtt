00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's observe in more detail why the hospital example gives us such a wrong conclusion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We study two variables--in-hospital and dying or passing away.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We rightfully observe that these two things are correlated.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If we were to do a scatter plot where we have two categories--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
whether or not we're in the hospital and whether or not a person passed away--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you find there's an increased occurrence of data over here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and of data over here relative to the other to data points over here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That means the data correlates.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What does correlation mean?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In any plot, data is correlated if knowledge about one variables tells us something about the other.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is a correlated data plot. Here's another data plot.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Correlated or not? Yes or no?
