00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.980
So now, you're almost at
the end of your program.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.750
And this is also the system that you'll
be using to apply for graduation.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.230
Click Student Services and
Financial Aid.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.310
Then click Student Records.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.790
Next, click Apply to Graduate.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.650
Select the term in which
you want to graduate.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.060
And from here, follow the prompts.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.690
After, you can view your
application to graduate as well.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.430
&gt;&gt; Typically, you should apply to
graduate the term before you want to

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.230
graduate.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.590
So, if you want to graduate in spring,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.740
you should apply to
graduate the previous fall.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.730
If it turns out you don't
complete the classes necessary,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.410
that's all right,
you can always postpone graduation.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.270
But you need to have applied by
the end of the semester before.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.100
Check the registrar's website for
specific application deadlines.
