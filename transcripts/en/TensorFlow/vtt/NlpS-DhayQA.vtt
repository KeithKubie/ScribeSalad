00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.800
Cassava is a really important crop. It
provides for over 500 million Africans

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.540
every day. When all other crops fail
farmers know that they could rely on

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.940
their Cassava plants to provide them
food.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.140
"One of my biggest challenges for the Cassava is diseases."

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.840
There are several diseases that affect Cassava and these diseases makes the roots inedible.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.300
It is very crucial to actually
control and manage these diseases.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.500
So we're trying to use machine learning to
respond to those diseases and Tensorflow

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.739
is the best foundation for our solutions.
The app that we've designed can

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.950
diagnose multiple diseases.
It's called Nuru, Swahili for "light" -

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.320
the light that farmers can use to
see their problems and find solutions.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.219
You wave your phone over a specific
leaf, look at it, and if it has a symptom

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.540
a box will pop up saying you have this
problem. When you get a diagnosis we have

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.300
an option for you to get advice and
learn about the best management

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.520
practices. The object detection that we
use through Tensorflow relies upon our team

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.900
annotating images we've collected over
5,000 high quality images of different

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.939
Cassava diseases for this project. We
use a single shot detector model on a

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.170
mobile net architecture it's able to
make predictions in less than one second.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.369
Instead of having to implement thousands of lines of code, Tensorflow

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.799
provides a library of functions that allow us to build architectures in much less time.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.750
We need something that can be deployed on a phone without any connection.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.100
Tensorflow is able to shrink these mural networks to be able to fit on your mobile device.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.970
The human input is absolutely critical.
We're really building something

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.740
that augments your experience and makes you better at your job so with AI tools

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.430
and machine learning you can
improve the yields, you can protect your

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.180
crops, and you can have a much more
reliable source of food.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.980
AI offers the prospect to fundamentally
transform the life of hundreds of

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.280
millions of farms around the world. "I have seen for myself how the technology works to detect diseases."

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.800
You can see a product that can actually
make someone's life better.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.880
This is a kind of revolution.
