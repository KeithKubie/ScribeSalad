00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.849
In today's video,

00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.360
we're testing out
a comment asking

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.200
if it's possible to boil
water in a wooden bowl.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.560
[Music]

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.820
All right, we've got
a couple of wooden bowls,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.200
and we're going to try
boiling water in them.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.400
The problem of course is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.446
that wood does not conduct
heat nearly as well

00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:24.120
as say a metal bowl,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.000
which is what you'd
normally want to do this in,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or maybe glass
if it were in the microwave.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.651
Wood pretty uncommon
for boiling.

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:31.101
It doesn't conduct heat well.

00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:32.600
It's a little
bit more insulated.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.152
So it's going to be
a little bit harder

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:35.500
for that heat
to transfer through.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.400
And maybe it's so insulated even
at the outside washer

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.400
like catch on fire
or something like that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.200
before it gets
the water boiling.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.400
So the question is
if we can get the water to boil

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.700
without the bowl burning
up and disintegrating.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.520
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.094
We are going to try and boil
water in our wooden bowl.

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:54.200
First on the electric burner,
then on the propane stove,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.980
and last in our forge.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.860
First, let's try it
on an electric burner.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:09.300
[Music]

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.429
All right, we did not get water
to boil on our electric stove.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.300
Maybe it just
doesn't get hot enough.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.100
It burned quite a bit
on the bottom.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.900
It didn't ever
really light on fire,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.960
and we got water
that started heating up,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.700
like there is steam.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.251
and was even I think some little
bubbles down at the bottom.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.200
It's very hot water,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.100
but it definitely
wasn't boiling water.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.024
So I think we need
to step our game up.

00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:31.100
Now, we're going to try
the propane stove.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.500
As a comparison
with this propane stove,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.900
I want to try a metal bowl,
and we're going to time it.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.755
We're going to see
how long it takes

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:40.399
for it to boil in a metal bowl,

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.891
and then compare
that to the wooden bowl after.

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:44.800
If it will even boil
in the metal bowl.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.635
Is it bad that I'm hoping
this doesn't work just so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.120
that we can light the foundry?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.600
I am very cold.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.600
It's a metal bowl.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.500
It's going to go
pretty quick I suspect.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
That is a decent
amount of water,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.095
and so, it does have a certain
amount of energy it has to take

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:00.500
before it gets
to a boiling point,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.400
but it's already making

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.180
little bubbles right
at the very contact,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.500
like the bottom of the bowl.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.200
I think it's going
to go pretty quick.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.512
We shouldn't have
a problem here.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.440
[Music]

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.360
Oh!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.760
Wow!

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.820
You say that's boiling?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.680
That's boiling.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.900
That looks like boiling water.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.361
2 minutes and 48 seconds,
it took for that to hit full boil.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.600
That's pretty quick.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.100
Yeah.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.560
[Music]

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.340
All right.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.500
Now we see if we can get
the water to boil,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.800
or if we just have a bowl

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800
that on fire, or maybe like
the top will be on fire.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.900
Normally, when you put anything
that contains water in the fire,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.021
the edges might burn.

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.366
But the water, it waits
until it evaporates

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:50.600
until the material
itself starts to burn.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.400
So we could get a fire up here,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.800
we could get scorching
on the bottom,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.553
but I don't think the sides
are going to burn.

00:02:55.553 --> 00:02:56.800
That's just not going to happen.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.600
We'll find out.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.080
Here we go.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.050
It's a lot of fire.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.200
And it is going up the sides
of the bowl quite a bit.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.779
In fact, some
of those yellow flames

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.900
I believe are the bowl catching
on fire already.

00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:09.500
So we've got a bowl on fire.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.360
Yeah.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.900
But that doesn't mean
this isn't going to work.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.000
With paper cups, I have seen it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.100
If you put a paper cup

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.200
and you fill water,
maybe with egg in there,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200
and it burns the edge,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.400
like it burns down
to the level of the water,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.900
because what keeps burning
is all the heat going

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.500
into the water instead of
staying on the cup itself,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.140
but on this top rim around it,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.920
which definitely looks
like it's lighting on fire.

00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:31.377
Yup, that's the lacquer.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.592
I think we're burning
the lacquer coating right now.

00:03:33.592 --> 00:03:34.973
It does kind of smell like that.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.340
Yeah.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.900
This doesn't smell
like a wood burn.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.520
This is a definitely a chemical,
like lacquer burn here.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.500
But it's also,
down at the bottom, yeah,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.945
we, the wood is like cracking
and stuff down at the bottom.

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:44.746
So down there...

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:45.891
Oh actually, that's true.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:46.941
This is a glued bowl.

00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:48.736
This isn't like carved
out of one piece.

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:51.500
So if we crack apart whatever
is holding the bowl together...

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.540
It could just...

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.900
We might want to move away.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.400
All right.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.940
Well, can I just point out

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.520
that this looks
like the Goblet of Fire

00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:59.100
or something from Harry Potter,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.400
because it's like a bowl
that's on fire.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.730
Does anybody have
a scrap of paper?

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.100
I need to write
my name immediately.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.300
[Music]

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.020
The flame is definitely going
out from where it was burning

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.000
the bowl, but look.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.800
There are bubbles forming
on the side of the bowl,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.500
and I don't know
if that's gas is expanding

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.600
through the sides of the bowl,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.000
or if that's actually
from the heat of the water.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.240
Know what I'm loving here is

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:24.200
you can actually see
this charred edge,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200
and then down below,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.300
you're still seeing
that beautiful wood finish.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.600
Not only the chart edge,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.840
but as you said, it is a bowl
that's been glued together,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.140
and it's splitting apart.

00:04:33.143 --> 00:04:36.100
So we've just got these very
even sections going.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.000
It's looking like
a flower with petals.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.994
I wonder what would happen

00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:40.600
if you just set one
of these bowls on fire,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.200
would it just like boom out?

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.940
We definitely are
not at a boil yet.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.940
No, I can still put
my hand in that so...

00:04:46.944 --> 00:04:48.500
This is going to take longer.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:05:04.260
[Music]

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.800
Well, it's been
31 minutes and counting.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.840
Yeah, we are over half an hour.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.500
Remember, it took 2 minutes
and 48 seconds to boil

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.029
in our metal bowl,
and over half an hour,

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.100
a lot of the bowl is burned.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.920
The bottom of the bowl is
just like made of embers.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.000
The inside of the bowl,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.200
the lacquer is actually
starting to bubble up,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.550
meaning the whole thing
is starting to separate.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.480
Yeah.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.400
If I wasn't wearing gloves, yes,
these aren't very insulating,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.900
but there's still
some protection.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.300
If I didn't have gloves on,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.940
I wouldn't be putting
my hand in that,

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.472
but the fact

00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:38.000
that I can still put my hand
in there for several seconds,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.100
I don't think we're
that close to boiling yet.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.100
I think we need to scale
it up one more time.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.900
We've got our foundry.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.100
We're going to try
a couple things.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.000
First, we're going
to use a lot more heat,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.500
because that thing
puts out a lot of heat,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.349
and second, we're going to try
filling the bowl all the way,

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.569
and it might be counter
intuitive thinking like,

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.600
oh more water is going
to be harder to boil,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.908
but it should
insulate the sides,

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:01.000
so less of the bowl burns up.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.500
We're going to try it.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.520
[Music]

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.060
This is much nicer.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.500
I like this much more.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.300
This is better.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.240
Plenty of roaring
heat coming off that.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.800
Now, I expected still going
to burn the outside of the bowl.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.540
Oh yeah.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.700
But the nice part about this is

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.582
that we're going to get
an ambient heat all the way

00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:27.082
around it just from the heat
coming off of the top.

00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:28.400
I think that's
really going to help.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.080
There we go.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.900
There's our lacquer.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.000
Yes, there it goes.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.500
And I'm sure some
of the wood lighting.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.260
Already on the inside,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.520
we've got that ring
of bubbles forming so...

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.060
But you can also see--

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.260
And black ring
around the top.

00:06:40.263 --> 00:06:41.381
I think our lacquer

00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:43.500
on the inside has
already begun to melt.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:54.440
[Music]

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.400
All right, we don't have
the same kind of boil

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.300
that we did with the metal pot.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.183
But we do have water boiling.

00:07:01.183 --> 00:07:04.300
Weirdly, it seems to only
be boiling on one side,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.300
where more of the heat
is directly going.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.237
It was centered originally,
but for some reason,

00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:11.800
it has started to settle
over to one edge,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.900
and the other side just
isn't boiling as much.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.808
So it's very much

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:18.000
where it's right
in contact with the fire.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.550
We're getting this frothy boil,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.600
and it's less than
half the amount of time

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.000
that we spent on the one
with the propane burner.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.600
So yeah.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.300
Yes, it's boiling.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.800
We have--

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.300
We did it.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.200
We made it happen.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.600
So a rolling boil,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.900
that's what happens when
the average temperature is hot

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.726
enough that it will evaporate,

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:38.100
and I don't think we
actually have that.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.000
We have something
you could cook in.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.500
I think it is boiling,
and you could cook with it,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.200
but I don't think we have
the same type of rolling boil

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.200
where the average temperatures
hot enough to evaporate,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.800
because it's only boiling

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.700
on the side with more heat
directly blowing on to it.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.750
But it's less than
half the amount of time

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.100
that it took to even get
this to start bubbling,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.400
and there was more water,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.600
so I'm calling
that a success.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.700
All right.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.551
This is probably
going to fall apart.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.300
But let's see
if we can pick it up.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.280
Oh, it's soft.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.600
Still bubbling.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.200
That to me means
we really did it,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.900
because the water
is still boiling.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.758
Our bowl actually is basically
on fire down here,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.200
so it's still putting
heat into the water.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.960
So Nate was hungry,
and it's lunchtime,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.500
and we have some boiling water.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.300
Mmm...

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.400
Chemical water.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.760
But while Nate makes lunch,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.000
I'm going to try and pick
up the bowl that we had

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.120
on the propane burner.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.700
I'm curious to see
if it's gonna hold together.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.280
So right now,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.500
you can see there's
ash in there,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.100
the varnish has bubbled.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.600
Going to pour this
out real quick.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.400
I think mostly at this point,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.500
it's just steaming
because it is freezing in here,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.100
but you can see the varnish

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.400
that's just bubbled up
off of this bowl.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.560
Now, let's look at the bottom.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.600
Nate, look at this.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.820
I got this one now too.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.120
Oh, wow!

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.500
So you can already
the heat difference here.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.700
That's pretty cool
looking bowl honestly.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.720
It's also much lighter weight.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.300
Right?

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.440
It lost a lot of mass.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.820
We set out to see

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.400
if you can boil water
in a wooden bowl, and yes,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.060
it turns out you can,
it's just horrendously impractical.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.217
In a survival situation,

00:09:17.217 --> 00:09:19.100
if you didn't have a metal bowl,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.600
you would probably have
to stick a wooden bowl

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.400
right in the center of a fire.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.420
So...

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.200
And I don't think you'd be able
to do it too many times

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.700
before your bowl got used up.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.260
There are traditional methods

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.012
of boiling water inflammable
containers by like taking

00:09:32.012 --> 00:09:33.600
a hot rock out of the fire,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.300
and putting that into the water
inside the container,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.419
but we were trying

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.400
to actually just boil it the way
you boil stuff in a bowl or pot.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.100
Guys, that's it for today.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.435
But you know,
we've always got more

00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:45.019
for you to see.

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:47.608
That box up at the top will take
you directly to our last video.

00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:48.765
You should go check that out.

00:09:48.765 --> 00:09:49.578
The other box shows

00:09:49.578 --> 00:09:51.523
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:52.820
Give that a click as well.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.712
If you hit this bomb
in the middle,

00:09:53.712 --> 00:09:54.820
you'll be subscribe
to our channel.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.290
That way, you'll never miss
out on a video.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.302
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:09:57.302 --> 00:09:58.445
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:09:58.445 --> 00:09:59.360
Talk to you then.
