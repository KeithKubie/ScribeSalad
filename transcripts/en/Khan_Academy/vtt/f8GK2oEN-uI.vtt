00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:01.650
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.600
talk a little bit about maybe
why the plates are actually

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.979
moving in the first place.

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.770
And nothing I'm talking
about in this video

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.780
has been definitively proved.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.630
This is just kind of the current
thinking, the leading thinking,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.682
on why plates are
actually moving.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.890
Although we haven't seen
the definitive evidence yet,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.380
and it's probably a combination
of a bunch of things.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.050
Now, before we even
talk about plates,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.180
let's just talk
about convection.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.640
And you might already be
familiar with the term,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.500
but just in case
you're not, let's do

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.370
a little bit of
review of convection.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.600
So let's say I have
a pot over here.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.280
So that is my pot.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.520
And it contains some water.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.850
So I have water in my pot.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.610
And let's say I only
heat one end of the pot.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.970
So I put a flame right over
at that end of the pot.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.410
So what's going to happen?

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.070
Well, the water that's
right over the flame

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.980
is going to be warmed up more
than any of the other water.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.200
So this water is
going to get warm.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.010
But when it gets warm, it
also becomes less dense.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.550
When you have a fluid,
if you warm it up,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.800
the molecules are
vibrating more.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.400
They have more kinetic energy.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.600
They're going to a bounce
further distances away

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.270
from each other.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.967
They will become less dense.

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:15.800
And if you have something
that's less dense,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.883
and it's surrounded by
things that are more dense,

00:01:17.883 --> 00:01:20.930
and we're dealing in kind
of a fluid state right here,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.760
that warm, less dense water
is going to move upwards.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.770
It's going to move upwards.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.470
Well, when it moves upwards
something has to replace it.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.270
So you're going to
have cooler water

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.350
from this side of the
container kind of replacing

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.040
where that water was.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.200
Now, this water, as it rises,
what's going to happen to it?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.450
Well, it's going to cool down.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.750
It's going to get
further from the flame.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.958
It's going to mix with maybe
some of the other water,

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.580
or transfer some of
its kinetic energy

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.390
to the neighboring water.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910
So it'll cool down.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.820
But once it cools down,
what's it going to want to do?

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.650
Remember, in general, the
closer you are to the flame.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.460
So the water closer to
the flame in general

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.550
is going to be warmer.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.341
So all of this stuff
is going to be warmer,

00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:09.820
and all of this stuff up
here, like the coldest water,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.340
is always going to be
furthest from the flame.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.980
And so the coldest water
is going to be over here.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.030
But remember, the coldest water
is also the densest water.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.670
So this water over
here is dense.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.050
And so it will sink.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.612
It's denser than
the water around it.

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:26.070
And it also helps
replace the water

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.112
that's going here to
get warmed up again.

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:30.070
And so what you do is
you have this cycle here.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.320
Warm water rises, moves
over to the right down here,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.140
and then goes back down as it
cools down, and it's dense,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.570
and then it gets
warmed up again.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.850
And so this process,
essentially what it's doing

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.340
is it's transferring the heat.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.020
It's allowing the heat to be
transferred from this one spot

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.070
throughout the fluid.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.630
And so we call this
process, this is convection.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.600
Now, the reason why we
think the plates are moving

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.370
is because we think that there
are similar types of convection

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.240
currents in the
asthenosphere, in the mantle,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.930
in the more fluid
part of the mantle.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.870
Remember, most of the mantle
you can kind of view it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.260
as this mooshy, spongy, not
quite liquid, but not quite

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.060
solid state, kind of plastic.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.030
It can kind of moosh past.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.080
It can kind of flow like super,
super, super thick, like super

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.130
viscous fluid.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.400
So not quite solid,
not quite liquid.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.180
But the same thing
could be happening.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.209
You have certain areas
in the mantle that

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.000
are hotter than others,
and this particular

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.390
in the asthenosphere.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.100
And those areas,
that's where you're

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.670
going to have the material
in the mantle move

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.060
up, because it's
hotter, it's less dense,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.610
and it will move up.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.260
And maybe it'll cause one
of these divergent rifts

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.000
where kind of plate material
and crustal material is forming.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.650
And then as it moves
up, it cools down,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.080
and eventually sinks, only
to get heated up again.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.830
So it has this kind
of circular motion

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.380
just like we saw with
the boiling water.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.500
And so that process, remember
this isn't completely liquid.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.459
It is rocky.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.200
So it's going to
potentially be able to take

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.140
other things with it.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.760
It could maybe drag the
crust along with it.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.404
Or I should say it could
drag the lithosphere along

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:33.570
with it, not just the crust.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.130
It could drag all this rigid
rock up here along with it,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.520
causing it to move in
that general direction.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.800
So you have the drag there.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.340
You could also imagine this
kind of a suction effect,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.060
where, if you view
it as a fluid,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.180
you have a bunch of
fluid coming down here.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.380
So it would kind of pull
the lithosphere down

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.130
at those points, and it would
kind of push the lithosphere up

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.300
at those points.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.770
So you have these
convection currents

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.790
that are essentially driving it.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.710
These aren't going to be super
fast moving fluid convection

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.800
currents, like you would
expect with boiling water

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.180
or with heated water.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.350
These would be slow moving
convection currents,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.540
but they're moving
enough, and they're

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.650
able to kind of put enough
drag on the lithosphere

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.240
to take the lithosphere
along with it.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.380
And so that's kind
of at a high level

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.000
the dominant theory as
to why they're moving.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.200
There's other ones
that talk about maybe

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.780
these lithospheric plates,
they kind of thicken

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.870
as they move further
away from this area

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.640
where the ridge is forming.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.380
And if we look at this
oceanic crust right over here.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.670
And so over time,
they're denser over here,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.390
because there's more cooled
down material at these points.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.555
And it's already
a little bit lower

00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:53.930
because this is where a lot
of the land is being created.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.030
And so there's maybe some
gravitational effects.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.760
But the dominant
effect, we think,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.160
is due to this convection
in the upper mantle.
