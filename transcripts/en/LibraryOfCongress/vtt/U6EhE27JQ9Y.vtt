From the Library of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.530
Good morning!

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.010
I'm Carla Hayden, the
Librarian of Congress and I want

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.000
to welcome you to this
very special Story Time

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.300
at the Library.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.830
I love reading, don't you?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.050
It's so much fun to let
our imaginations run wild.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.980
We're excited to be teaming

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.940
up with Ms. Dolly Parton's
Imagination Library

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.930
to introduce you to
some wonderful authors

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.770
who will share their
stories with us.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.500
Ms. Parton's work through
her Imagination Library

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.800
is awe-inspiring!

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.550
She and her team have given
away over 100 million books

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.860
to help encourage young readers
like you across the world.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.770
Here at the Library of
Congress we share that passion

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.170
for developing young readers!

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.520
And we know that the best way
to encourage people like you

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.710
to read is to make reading fun!

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.760
So that's what we're here to do.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.230
I hope you enjoy
today's story time!

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.100
