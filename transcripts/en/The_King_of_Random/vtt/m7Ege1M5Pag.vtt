00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.299
We're gonna see if we can cook a steak with salt

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.149
And I don't mean we're gonna cook a steak that has salt on it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.270
I mean we're gonna see if we can use a molten salt as the heat source

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.629
To cook a steak fans of the YouTube channel backyard scientist may remember a time when he tried to cook a steak using molten

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.760
Aluminum and it sort of worked

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.499
But you couldn't really eat the steak because it had a lot of molten aluminum stuck to the meat

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.660
Well hopefully if our salt does stick to the meat it will still be edible because it's salt

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.329
So we're gonna give this a try. We're gonna take some of our salt

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.459
We're gonna melt it down to a liquid in our crucible, and then we're gonna pour that onto our steak

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.329
We might try pouring it onto one side and we might try pouring the salt into the pan

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.569
And then putting the steak on top of some of that salt for the other side

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.320
We'll see

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.320
It's just kind of gonna be a little bit of an adventure

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.649
So let's fire out the furnace melt some salt and see if we can cook our dinner

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.519
This Coarser Salt is really good for putting on a steak when you're cooking in a normal method

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.080
But of course this is gonna melt down into a liquid. I don't know if it's gonna make much difference

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.900
to find out

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.230
Our salt has melted down to a liquid and our stake is in the pan ready to go

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.829
I've put this jacket on because there is moisture on the surface of the steak

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.219
And there's a chance that it could cause the molten-salt to splatter up into the air

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.330
And I don't want to get that on me

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.899
There's not so much moisture that I think there's any risk of a large steam explosion

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.539
But I do want to protect myself a little bit, so I've got the glasses and the long sleeves and of course the gloves

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.069
That is hot all right, I'm gonna try and start pouring on one end and move down to the other end

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140
We'll see how this goes

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.569
Oh that smells so good

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.079
My goodness

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.679
Wow that is a fantastic looking crust on there

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.339
So our salt as you can see has definitely solidified

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.109
It did that pretty much as soon as it hit the pan, and we probably could have avoided that by heating up the pan

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.399
But I feel like that would be cheating then we'd be cooking your steak with a hot pan instead of with molten salt

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.689
However even though it has solidified. It is still holding a lot of heat

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.589
This kind of salt melts it just below 1500 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.340
Which means that even though it's cooled down to the temperature where it's solid again

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.639
It's still very hot so it's cooking our steak pretty well

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.389
At least on the outside. We'll have to see how it's doing on the inside

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540
All right, here's our steak

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.749
cooked on salt cooked on molten salt

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.209
We've first poured molten salt on top of it mostly it just ran off the sides it landed in the pan

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.688
And then we cook the steak on the mold and salt in the pan the outside has got a pretty good sear on it

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.819
We've got some good dryness

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.978
We've got some the Maillard effect has started giving us some nice crispy outside places

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.870
But I do suspect that the inside of the steak is going to be pretty much raw

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.599
Let's cut it open and find out how if I'm right?

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.599
Oh Yeah, so we can see that it did get cooked for about an eighth of an inch  of the way through and then the inside

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.269
Is still - oh boy, I think even calling this blue rare would be generous. It's let's see

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.539
It's cool. It's not even a little bit warm so

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.750
If you like your steak ultra blue rare, I mean this thing this thing is still mooing

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.459
I'm pretty sure I think a good vet could bring this back. It wouldn't be too late

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.370
I personally am NOT a big fan of

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.629
Super rare steaks, and I know all you stake in Thuvia South they are gonna. Be mad at me for that

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.819
I'm more of a medium. Maybe medium rare kind of guy, but this is a little too much for me

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.749
Ultra blue rare. I will still take a small bite of it

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.739
It's the texture really that I can't handle just slimy at this point, but I'll cut a piece off

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.970
mostly I just want to see if it got some good salt flavor by being cooked on salt

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.729
I didn't salt the state except for cooking it on the salt

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.269
so if I can taste any salt at all we know where it came from a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.549
Little there's a little bit of salt flavor to it not a lot

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.270
There's a good steak

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.030
Cooked properly that would be fantastic

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.818
Turns out pouring molten hot

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.479
minerals

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.339
Salt is a mineral which means that what we made is sort of like lava

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.250
Kind of so yeah pouring molten hot minerals on top of a steak is not the ideal way to cook it

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.899
But I do have another thing that I want to try but first let's learn about our sponsor

now let's get back to the steak before we started melting the salt for this steak

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.349
We actually took a second steak and put it in what's called a sous-vide cooker

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.359
That's a device that keeps a bath of water at an extremely precise temperature so right now

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.940
I've got some steak cooking in a bath of water at about

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:53.218
134 degrees Fahrenheit, which is a good temperature to get a nice medium-rare cook all the way through it's in a plastic bag

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.799
Which keeps it from being in contact with the water directly

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.770
But it still gets all of the heat and since the water

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.489
Is being held at a very precise temperature the steak will cook all the way through at exactly that temperature without overcooking anywhere

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.619
So now let's take our sous-vide cooked

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:13.349
Stake out and let's put that into the pan and try the same thing with that and see if we can use salt

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.670
Instead of for cooking the steak all the way through just to finish up the outside of it

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.949
Alright there we go our steak is now cooked all the way through at just the perfect temperature however

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.229
Being heated by water doesn't really give us a nice outside look to our steak

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.259
And that's why we want to cook the outside with our molten salt

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.260
That is some very hot salt

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.919
That's pretty good, that is a delicious looking ribeye right there

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.139
All right see how this looks on the inside

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.679
Still got a little bit of pink. I'll admit that even though I don't like it rare

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.940
This is probably a little overcooked for me a little bit more pink on the inside

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.990
Is more of what I look for but that still looks pretty delicious

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:07.570
Now this again see if it's got any salt flavor to it the last one didn't have much

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.140
See if this is any different

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.850
Not a lot

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.320
This is a very good steak

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.010
Like I said, I really enjoy it when the texture has changed

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.309
This is why I don't prefer my steaks rare this the texture has definitely changed

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.850
And it did get cooked a little bit more than I wanted so I probably had my sous-vide machine

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.220
Set a few degrees too high even though

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.100
I cooked this with salt none of it really stuck to the steak

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.279
So I'm going to add a little bit more salt, and this is gonna be my dinner

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.020
Cooking a steak using molten salt. It does get a pretty nice sear on the outside

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.280
Especially if you take care to flip the steak down in the salt as is cooling in the pan

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.449
It doesn't really do a whole lot of searing as you pour it on it. Just sort of skitters across

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.710
I think we have the Leighton prospect making the salt not really stick to or touch the steak very much

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.349
Overall if we pre cook the inside of the steak

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.440
And then use the salt as a sear on the outside it does work although

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.510
It's a bit of a roundabout way of doing it

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.319
It would be easier to just sear it in a pan or on a grill or something like that

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.739
Or maybe just sear it directly in the foundry

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.411
If you've got some cool ideas of other things you want to see us try using molten salt, let us know down in the comments below

00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:18.309
If we use your idea will send you 25 bucks
