off when you actually need making this

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539
off when you actually need making this

was talking about but it's really nice

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
was talking about but it's really nice
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.210
was talking about but it's really nice
because they just sort of clicked

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
because they just sort of clicked
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.529
because they just sort of clicked
together and I believe there's two

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
together and I believe there's two
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.359
together and I believe there's two
layers of

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369
layers of
 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.160
layers of
here it's a real nice feature because

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170
here it's a real nice feature because
 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.080
here it's a real nice feature because
being on the north side you're not going

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
being on the north side you're not going
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.850
being on the north side you're not going
to get the sun exposure the other side

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
to get the sun exposure the other side
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280
to get the sun exposure the other side
but amazingly this room even without the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
but amazingly this room even without the
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500
but amazingly this room even without the
lights on is still very bright and that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510
lights on is still very bright and that
 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.729
lights on is still very bright and that
was another feature of the house we

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739
was another feature of the house we
 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.960
was another feature of the house we
really wanted to incorporate was a lot

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970
really wanted to incorporate was a lot
 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.899
really wanted to incorporate was a lot
of natural day lighting and this room

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909
of natural day lighting and this room
 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.819
of natural day lighting and this room
originally served as the bedroom for the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829
originally served as the bedroom for the
 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.949
originally served as the bedroom for the
house and we had I believe a double bed

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959
house and we had I believe a double bed
 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.259

some furniture that was designed by

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269
some furniture that was designed by
 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.920
some furniture that was designed by
students and this room as well has the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
students and this room as well has the
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.960
students and this room as well has the
benefits of the natural ventilation so

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
benefits of the natural ventilation so
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.309
benefits of the natural ventilation so
we're actually on the second floor of

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319
we're actually on the second floor of
 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.800
we're actually on the second floor of
the Solar Decathlon home and you can see

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810
the Solar Decathlon home and you can see
 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.530
the Solar Decathlon home and you can see
that students have actually gone and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
that students have actually gone and
 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.449
that students have actually gone and
after the competition of installed

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459
after the competition of installed
 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.240
after the competition of installed
sensors throughout the house in the 2007

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
sensors throughout the house in the 2007
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.800

house we're hoping to install more
 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.869
house we're hoping to install more
sensors from the get-go so we can know

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879
sensors from the get-go so we can know
 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.280
sensors from the get-go so we can know
how the house is performing during the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290
how the house is performing during the
 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.440
how the house is performing during the
competition and even serve immediately

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
competition and even serve immediately
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.330
competition and even serve immediately
afterwards the house actually has a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340
afterwards the house actually has a
 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.490
afterwards the house actually has a
pretty high air exchange rate so we have

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500
pretty high air exchange rate so we have
 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.440
pretty high air exchange rate so we have
good air ventilation and good air

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
good air ventilation and good air
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.289
good air ventilation and good air
quality for that reason and you can

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299
quality for that reason and you can
 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.270
quality for that reason and you can
actually pan out sign you get to see a

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
actually pan out sign you get to see a
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.729
actually pan out sign you get to see a

the 2005 house however the idea is that
 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.140
the 2005 house however the idea is that
you could go and expand it start to

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
you could go and expand it start to
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.030
you could go and expand it start to
expand it in other directions and the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040
expand it in other directions and the
 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.680
expand it in other directions and the
idea being is that it's configurable to

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
idea being is that it's configurable to
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.140
idea being is that it's configurable to
your taste to your needs to your budget

your taste to your needs to your budget
 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.000
your taste to your needs to your budget
so you can actually go and change that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010
so you can actually go and change that
 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.830
so you can actually go and change that
and trying to not just make it a sort of

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840
and trying to not just make it a sort of
 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.270
and trying to not just make it a sort of
boxy shape we have this natural

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280
boxy shape we have this natural
 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.670

integration of vegetation throughout it

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680
integration of vegetation throughout it

but going and using that water that
 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.770
but going and using that water that
falls and actually showing that the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780
falls and actually showing that the
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.270
falls and actually showing that the
vegetation can be integrated to the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280
vegetation can be integrated to the
 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.849
vegetation can be integrated to the
building and we can go and mix the built

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859
building and we can go and mix the built
 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.449
building and we can go and mix the built
environment with the natural environment
