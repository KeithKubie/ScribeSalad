DANIEL PHAM: Hi, my
name is Daniel Pham,

00:00:09.924 --> 00:00:12.340
and welcome to This Week in
Android Development on Monday,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.170
December 17, 2013.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.170
Last week, Todd and Wolf hosted
an awesome episode of game

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.220
on, showing off the
new open source physics

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.040
engine, Liquid Fun.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.130
Today, Nazmul and Laura
Klein talked about Lean UX.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.600
And Todd returned for Lesson
2.0 in his DevBytes series "Play

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.530
Games for iOS."

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.120
Look for next episode
to drop later this week.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.720
In the latest app news, Google
Santa Tracker has launched--

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.620
Yay!-- with three built-in games
and Chromecast integration.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.900
We also heard that you
like managing your devices,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.740
so we gave you the ability
to manage your devices,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.720
from your device, with
Android Device Manager.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.640
Last but not least, the Google
Play Games plug-in for Unity

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.270
was launched.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.455
Head on over to Github
for everything you need.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.455
That's all for This Week
in Android development.

00:00:57.455 --> 00:00:59.590
We'll be going on
holiday for a few weeks,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.450
so we'll see you next year.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.900
I'm Daniel Pham.
"You are my fire,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.970
the one desire, believe me when
I say-- I want it that way."
