size of the user base to the size of
that audience and if you look at that

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959
that audience and if you look at that

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:56.590
the pre-launch reports this past July
 

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.490
the pre-launch reports this past July
we've helped flag over 35 million issues

00:15:59.490 --> 00:15:59.500
we've helped flag over 35 million issues
 

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.210
we've helped flag over 35 million issues
across 500,000 apps and while this seems

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:03.220
across 500,000 apps and while this seems
 

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.790
across 500,000 apps and while this seems
like a fairly large number I think the

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800
like a fairly large number I think the
 

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.770
like a fairly large number I think the
thing to point out here is that a lot of

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:07.780
thing to point out here is that a lot of
 

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.750
thing to point out here is that a lot of
these are very simple fixes things

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:09.760
these are very simple fixes things
 

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.430
these are very simple fixes things
you're able to fix before you publish

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440
you're able to fix before you publish
 

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.410
you're able to fix before you publish
your app publicly and so we again

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:13.420
your app publicly and so we again
 

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.760
your app publicly and so we again
encourage you to take a look at the

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:14.770
encourage you to take a look at the
 

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.020
encourage you to take a look at the
pre-launch reports around accessibility

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.030
pre-launch reports around accessibility
 

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.420
pre-launch reports around accessibility
to ensure you're providing your users

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:18.430
to ensure you're providing your users
 

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.190
to ensure you're providing your users
with the most inclusive and accessible

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:20.200
with the most inclusive and accessible
 

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.590
with the most inclusive and accessible
experience when that I'm going to hand

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600
experience when that I'm going to hand
 

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.270
experience when that I'm going to hand
it back to max it's going to talk about

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:24.280
it back to max it's going to talk about
 

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.530
it back to max it's going to talk about
what we're doing throughout the rest of

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:25.540
what we're doing throughout the rest of
 

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.210
what we're doing throughout the rest of
the year and it's 2019 around

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.220
the year and it's 2019 around
 

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.130
the year and it's 2019 around
accessibility cheers Brandon some of you

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:32.140
accessibility cheers Brandon some of you
 

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.960
accessibility cheers Brandon some of you
may be wondering well this looks

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:33.970
may be wondering well this looks
 

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:40.320
may be wondering well this looks
beneficial but how much work is this

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.330
beneficial but how much work is this
 

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.930
beneficial but how much work is this
going to be for me or for my team also

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940
going to be for me or for my team also
 

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.270
going to be for me or for my team also
how will I be able to prioritize this on

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:48.280
how will I be able to prioritize this on
 

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:53.370
how will I be able to prioritize this on
my roadmap well we were thinking exactly

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:53.380
my roadmap well we were thinking exactly
 

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.100
my roadmap well we were thinking exactly
the same earlier this year and we

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.110
the same earlier this year and we
 

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.980
the same earlier this year and we
decided to take a look so I'm going to

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:58.990
decided to take a look so I'm going to
 

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.550
decided to take a look so I'm going to
walk you through what we've done since

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560
walk you through what we've done since
 

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.390
walk you through what we've done since
this summer in fact we got together with

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400
this summer in fact we got together with
 

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.760
this summer in fact we got together with
a couple of you we we got together with

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:08.770
a couple of you we we got together with
 

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.730
a couple of you we we got together with
19 developers from all the global

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:11.740
19 developers from all the global
 

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.690
19 developers from all the global
regions and we did a play accessibility

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:15.700
regions and we did a play accessibility
 

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.570
regions and we did a play accessibility
review pilot and we wanted to do two

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:18.580
review pilot and we wanted to do two
 

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.660
review pilot and we wanted to do two
things we wanted to understand and learn

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:20.670
things we wanted to understand and learn
 

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.600
things we wanted to understand and learn
how can we review apps for accessibility

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:24.610
how can we review apps for accessibility
 

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.430
how can we review apps for accessibility
at scale and more importantly we wanted

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440
at scale and more importantly we wanted
 

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.640
at scale and more importantly we wanted
to understand how difficult would it be

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:32.650
to understand how difficult would it be
 

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.690
to understand how difficult would it be
for developers to make fixes to make

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:36.700
for developers to make fixes to make
 

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.549
for developers to make fixes to make
their app more accessible

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559
their app more accessible
 

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:43.779
their app more accessible
and so here are the results here you'll

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:43.789
and so here are the results here you'll
 

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:46.720
and so here are the results here you'll
see the top nine issues that were

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:46.730
see the top nine issues that were
 

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.960
see the top nine issues that were
discovered during the pilot you can see

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:49.970
discovered during the pilot you can see
 

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.509
discovered during the pilot you can see
the frequency which by which they were

00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:52.519
the frequency which by which they were
 

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:56.610
the frequency which by which they were
discovered on the egg under y-axis and

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:56.620
discovered on the egg under y-axis and
 

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.009
discovered on the egg under y-axis and
the difficulty of fixing them on the

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:00.019
the difficulty of fixing them on the
 

00:18:00.019 --> 00:18:03.279
the difficulty of fixing them on the
x-axis and I think the key takeaway here

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:03.289
x-axis and I think the key takeaway here
 

00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:07.810
x-axis and I think the key takeaway here
is that a lot of the frequent fixes were

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:07.820
is that a lot of the frequent fixes were
 

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:12.129
is that a lot of the frequent fixes were
easily fixed but I want to look at the

00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:12.139
easily fixed but I want to look at the
 

00:18:12.139 --> 00:18:14.980
easily fixed but I want to look at the
two most frequent fixes at two most

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:14.990
two most frequent fixes at two most
 

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.529
two most frequent fixes at two most
frequent issues in a little bit more

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:17.539
frequent issues in a little bit more
 

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:22.570
frequent issues in a little bit more
detail so let's look at an issue that

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:22.580
detail so let's look at an issue that
 

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.359
detail so let's look at an issue that
was seen in almost every single app we

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:25.369
was seen in almost every single app we
 

00:18:25.369 --> 00:18:27.480
was seen in almost every single app we
reviewed during the pilot which is

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:27.490
reviewed during the pilot which is
 

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.440
reviewed during the pilot which is
missing or ambiguous ambiguous hints and

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:31.450
missing or ambiguous ambiguous hints and
 

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.950
missing or ambiguous ambiguous hints and
labels so imagine you're using your

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960
labels so imagine you're using your
 

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.019
labels so imagine you're using your
phone and you're blind or you have

00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:38.029
phone and you're blind or you have
 

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:39.669
phone and you're blind or you have
severe vision impairment and you're

00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679
severe vision impairment and you're
 

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:44.169
severe vision impairment and you're
using a screen reader and focus on the

00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:44.179
using a screen reader and focus on the
 

00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:47.710
using a screen reader and focus on the
search box at the top so the screen

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720
search box at the top so the screen
 

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.299
search box at the top so the screen
reader would read this as try Beijing

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:51.309
reader would read this as try Beijing
 

00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:54.639
reader would read this as try Beijing
edit box and if you don't have any

00:18:54.639 --> 00:18:54.649
edit box and if you don't have any
 

00:18:54.649 --> 00:18:57.340
edit box and if you don't have any
visual context as a user you would not

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:57.350
visual context as a user you would not
 

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.529
visual context as a user you would not
know that this is the way you go to

00:18:59.529 --> 00:18:59.539
know that this is the way you go to
 

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:03.399
know that this is the way you go to
search for your next destination the fix

00:19:03.399 --> 00:19:03.409
search for your next destination the fix
 

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:06.460
search for your next destination the fix
for this is actually super super simple

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:06.470
for this is actually super super simple
 

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.680
for this is actually super super simple
all you would have to do is change the

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:08.690
all you would have to do is change the
 

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.600
all you would have to do is change the
hint text here and maybe call it

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:10.610
hint text here and maybe call it
 

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.090
hint text here and maybe call it
something like search for a place to

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:13.100
something like search for a place to
 

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.330
something like search for a place to
visit and immediately users of screen

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:16.340
visit and immediately users of screen
 

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.970
visit and immediately users of screen
readers would have a much easier time

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:18.980
readers would have a much easier time
 

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.539
readers would have a much easier time
navigating your app the really cool

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:22.549
navigating your app the really cool
 

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:26.019
navigating your app the really cool
thing here is that this also improves

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:26.029
thing here is that this also improves
 

00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:28.570
thing here is that this also improves
the usability for any user of your app

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:28.580
the usability for any user of your app
 

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.669
the usability for any user of your app
not just users of screen readers because

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679
not just users of screen readers because
 

00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:33.609
not just users of screen readers because
it's clearer what you intend this box to

00:19:33.609 --> 00:19:33.619
it's clearer what you intend this box to
 

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:37.899
it's clearer what you intend this box to
do by the way we've anonymized all of

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:37.909
do by the way we've anonymized all of
 

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:40.119
do by the way we've anonymized all of
these examples because of the sensitive

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:40.129
these examples because of the sensitive
 

00:19:40.129 --> 00:19:43.899
these examples because of the sensitive
nature of the accessibility topic so

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:43.909
nature of the accessibility topic so
 

00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:46.930
nature of the accessibility topic so
these are real examples but you won't

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:46.940
these are real examples but you won't
 

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.500
these are real examples but you won't
recognize the apps now

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.510
recognize the apps now
 

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.220
recognize the apps now
the second problem which was the second

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.230
the second problem which was the second
 

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.510
the second problem which was the second
most frequent during the pilot is that

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520
most frequent during the pilot is that
 

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.500
most frequent during the pilot is that
users of screen readers

00:19:59.500 --> 00:19:59.510
users of screen readers
 

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.740
users of screen readers
we're losing context because of the

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:02.750
we're losing context because of the
 

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.680
we're losing context because of the
focus order with which the screen

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:05.690
focus order with which the screen
 

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.710
focus order with which the screen
readers are going through the apps now

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720
readers are going through the apps now
 

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.840
readers are going through the apps now
the issue here is that if you're using

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:10.850
the issue here is that if you're using
 

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.789
the issue here is that if you're using
linear navigation it may result in your

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799
linear navigation it may result in your
 

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:19.630
linear navigation it may result in your
focus falling on secondary actions like

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640
focus falling on secondary actions like
 

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.490
focus falling on secondary actions like
share or save to favorites before the

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:24.500
share or save to favorites before the
 

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.010
share or save to favorites before the
focus order comes to the main title or

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.020
focus order comes to the main title or
 

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.890
focus order comes to the main title or
the the main element of the card and so

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:29.900
the the main element of the card and so
 

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.470
the the main element of the card and so
as a screen reader user I don't know

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480
as a screen reader user I don't know
 

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.539
as a screen reader user I don't know
what I'm saving to favorites or what I'm

00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:34.549
what I'm saving to favorites or what I'm
 

00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:38.289

a highly successful accessible app is
part of that mission and so they're

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:54.020
part of that mission and so they're
 

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.740

using that to justify their investment

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:56.750
using that to justify their investment
