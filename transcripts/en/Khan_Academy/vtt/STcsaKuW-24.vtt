00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.490
The height of a triangle
is four inches less

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.750
than the length of the base.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.300
The area of the triangle
is 30 inches squared.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.200
Find the height and base.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.170
Use the formula area
equals one half base times

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.521
height for the
area of a triangle.

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.020
OK.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.640
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.630
We have the-- let me
draw a triangle here.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.240
So this is our triangle.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.060
And let's say that the
length of this bottom side,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.083
that's the base,
let's call that b.

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:32.400
And then this is the height.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.390
This is the height
right over here.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.090
And then the area is equal to
one half base times height.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.770
Now in this first
sentence they tell

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.900
us at the height
of a triangle is

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.460
four inch is less than
the length of the base.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.740
So the height is equal
to the base minus 4.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.540
That's what that first
sentence tells us.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.220
The area of the triangle
is 30 inches squared.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.240
So if we take one half
the base times the height

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.810
we'll get 30 inches squared.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.460
Or we could say that
30 inches squared

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.850
is equal to one half times
the base, times the height.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.852
Now instead of putting
an h in for height,

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:21.560
we know that the height
is the same thing

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.850
as 4 less than the base.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.380
So let's put that in there.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.741
4 less than the base.

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:29.240
And then let's see
what we get here.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.480
We get-- let me
do this in yellow.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.490
We get 30 is equal to
one half times-- let's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.560
distribute the b-- times
b, let me make it clear.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.690
So let's do it this way.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.830
Times b over 2,
times b, minus 4.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.760
I just multiplied the
one half times the b.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.690
Now let's distribute
the b over 2.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.320
So 30 is equal to b
squared over 2, be careful.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.980
b over 2 times b is
just b squared over 2.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.300
And then b over 2, times
negative 4 is negative 2b.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.650
Now just to get rid
of this fraction

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.880
here let's multiply both
sides of this equation by 2.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.040
So let's multiply
that side by 2.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.400
And let's multiply
that side by 2.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.390
On the left hand
side you get 60.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.740
On the right hand side
2 times b squared over 2

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.350
is just b squared.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.870
Negative 2b times
2 is negative 4b.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.450
And now we have
a quadratic here.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.537
And the best way to
solve a quadratic-- we

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:31.120
have a second degree
term right here--

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.360
is to get all of the terms
on one side of the equation,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.280
having them equal 0.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.240
So let's subtract 60 from
both sides of this equation.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.327
And we get 0 equal to b
squared, minus 4b, minus 60.

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:52.910
And so what we need
to do here is just

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.180
factor this thing right
now, or factor it.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.250
And then, no-- if I have
the product of some things,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.080
and that equals 0, that
means that either one or both

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.950
of those things need
to be equal to 0.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.150
So we need to factor b
squared, minus 4b, minus 60.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.470
So what we want to do, we
want to find two numbers

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.505
whose sum is negative 4 and
whose product is negative 60.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.430
Now, given that the
product is negative,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.480
we know there are
different signs.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.920
And this tells us that
their absolute values

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.530
are going to be four apart.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.510
That one is going to be
four less than the others.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.746
So you could look at the
products of the factors of 60.

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:44.900
1 and 60 are too far apart.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.920
Even if you made
one of the negative,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.350
you would either get positive
59 as the sum or negative 59

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.480
as the sum.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.450
2 and 30, still too far apart.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.800
3 and 20, still too far apart.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.260
If you had made
one negative you'd

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.280
either get negative
17 or positive 17.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.986
Then you could have 4 and
15, still too far apart.

00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:10.360
If you made one
of them negative,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.940
their sum would be either
negative 11 or positive 11.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.040
Then you have 5 and a 12,
still seems too far apart

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.844
from each other.

00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:20.510
One of them is negative,
then you either

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.410
have their sum being
positive 7 or negative 7.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.586
Then you have 6 and 10.

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:27.710
Now this looks interesting.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.180
They are four apart.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.094
So if we make-- and we want
the larger absolute magnitude

00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:35.260
number to be negative so
that their sum is negative.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.180
So if we make it
6 and negative 10

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.130
their sum will be negative
4, and their product

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.340
is negative 60.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.270
So that works.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.770
So you could literally
say that this

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:55.260
is equal to b plus 6, times
b, minus 10. b plus the a,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.210
plus b minus the b.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.210
And let me be very careful here.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.230
This b over here, I want
to make it very clear,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.740
is different than the b that
we're using in the equation.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.500
I just used this b
here to say, look,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.314
we're looking for two numbers
that add up to this second term

00:05:11.314 --> 00:05:11.980
right over here.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.771
It's a different b.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.720
I could have said x plus
y is equal to negative 4,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.470
and x times y is
equal to negative 60.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.070
In fact, let me do it that way
just so we don't get confused.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.090
So we could write x plus
y is equal to negative 4.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.600
And then we have x times
y is equal to negative 60.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.390
So we have b plus 6,
times b plus y. x is 6,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.300
y is negative 10.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.446
And that is equal to 0.

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:40.820
Let's just solve
this right here.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.319
And then we'll go
back and show you.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.980
You could also factor
this by grouping.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.240
But just from this, we know
that either one of these

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.120
is equal to zero.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:57.320
Either b plus 6 is equal to 0,
or b minus 10 is equal to 0.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.530
If we subtract 6 from both
sides of this equation,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.480
we get b is equal to negative 6.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.290
Or if you add 10 to both
sides of this equation,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.970
you get b is equal to 10.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.660
And those are our two solutions.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.740
You could put them
back in and verify

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.200
that they satisfy
our constraints.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.492
Now the other way that
you could solve this,

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:18.200
and we're going to
get exact same answer.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.110
Is you could just break
up this negative 4b

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.550
into its constituents.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.080
So you could have broken this
up into 0 is equal to b squared.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.860
And then you could have broken
it up into plus 6b, minus 10b,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.210
minus 60.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.050
And then factor it by grouping.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.530
Group these first two terms.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.680
Group these second two terms.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.390
Just going to add them together.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.280
The first one you
could factor out a b.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.240
So you have b times b, plus 6.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.440
The second one you can
factor out a negative 10.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.210
So minus 10 times b, plus 6.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.680
All that's equal to 0.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.180
And now you can
factor out a b plus 6.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.280
So if you factor
out a b plus 6 here,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:09.020
you get 0 is equal to b
minus 10, times b, plus 6.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:16.090
We're literally just factoring
out this out of the expression.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.770
You're just left
with a b minus 10.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.930
You get the same thing that
we did in one step over here.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.020
Whatever works for you.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.920
But either way,
the solutions are

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.529
either b is equal to negative
6, or b is equal to 10.

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:28.820
And we have to be careful here.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.440
Remember, this is
a word problem.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.580
We can't just state, oh b could
be negative 6 or b could be 10.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.510
We have to think about
whether this makes sense

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.480
in the context of
the actual problem.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.500
We're talking about
lengths of triangles,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.500
or lengths of the
sides of triangles.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.720
We can't have a negative length.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.910
So because of that,
the base of a triangle

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.840
can't have length of negative 6.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.210
So we can cross that out.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.340
So we actually only
have one solution here.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.697
Almost made a careless mistake.

00:07:57.697 --> 00:07:59.780
Forgot that we were dealing
with the word problem.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.720
The only possible base is 10.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.130
And let's see, they say find
the height and the base.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.320
Once again, done.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.590
So the base we're saying is 10.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.350
The height is four inches less.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.620
It's b minus 4.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.810
So the height is 6.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.870
And then you can verify.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.469
The area is 6 times 10
times one half, which is 30.
