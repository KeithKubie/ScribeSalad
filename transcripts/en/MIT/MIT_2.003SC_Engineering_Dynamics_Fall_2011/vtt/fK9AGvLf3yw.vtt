00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.010
PROFESSOR: So
we'll start quickly

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.614
going over the concept questions
for the homework this week.

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:34.210
So you have a two rotor system.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.425
It says, if you
give it a deflection

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:44.450
at a exactly the mode
shape of mode two,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.750
what frequency
components do expect

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.480
the transient response to have?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.890
So most people said only omega
2, but quite a few people

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.450
said both.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.830
So this introduction
to vibration

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.870
that we have been
doing for the last few

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.700
lectures-- my goal in it is
to have you folks go away

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.610
with a pretty good conceptual
understanding of the basics

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.290
of vibration, and
on the final exam,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.620
I'm not going to have
you derive anything,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.410
like finding the natural
frequencies of a 3

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.210
by 3 degree of freedom system,
solving a sixth order system

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.780
in omega squared.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.980
I won't do that kind of thing
to you, but questions like this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.280
are really fair game.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.070
So if we did this business
bimodal analysis--

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.020
and we did an example the
other day where with the system

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.040
we had here, if you deflect
it in exactly the shape of one

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.330
mode, what kind of
response do you get?

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.560
Initial conditions
that are shaped exactly

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.190
like one the mode shapes.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.960
AUDIENCE: It has exactly
that natural frequency in it.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560
PROFESSOR: Well, it'll not only
have that natural frequency

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.270
in it, but if you deflect
it initially in the mode

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.100
shape, what will the
responding motion look like?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.350
AUDIENCE: Just the mode shape.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.849
PROFESSOR: Just
like the mode shape,

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.100
and if the motion is in
a particular mode shape,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.140
it will be at-- this
is transient vibration.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.465
No external force.

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:21.600
You deflect it and let it go.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.920
You will see only
motion in that mode

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.880
if you give it an initial
deflection exactly in that mode

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.310
shape.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.900
If you went to the other mode,
and deflected it that way,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.960
and let go, it would
change frequency,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.610
and it would vibrate
only in that shape.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.870
And any other
combination of motions

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.370
is some linear sum of
those two mode shapes.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.740
Any other allowable
motion of the system

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.060
can be made up of some weighted
sum of the two mode shapes,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.340
right?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.480
And that's the
amount of each mode

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.570
that you get-- is
the weighted sum.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.320
What are the weightings?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.350
If the weightings
are 1, 0, then it's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.280
all one mode and not of another.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.430
If it takes some of
each mode to give you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.110
the initial deflected shape,
that's how much of each mode

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.090
you get.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.780
So the answer to this
question is only mode two.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.400
OK, next.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.590
I forget what you were given.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.340
Apply the concept.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.050
Which mode is likely to dominate
the steady state response

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.360
for the excitation of part D?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.440
So it was probably being
excited harmonically

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.770
at the natural
frequency of mode two.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.510
So which mode?

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.470
So harmonic
excitation, which mode

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.080
do you expect to respond the
most when you excite it at one

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.610
of the natural frequencies?

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.860
AUDIENCE: I'd say [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.401
PROFESSOR: At that
natural frequency.

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.590
Why?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.090
Why?

00:03:59.436 --> 00:04:01.695
AUDIENCE: Because that's
what the eigenvalue is.

00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:03.570
PROFESSOR: Well, there's
an eigenvalue there,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.653
but now we're talking about
steady state response.

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:07.770
What's the transfer
function of a single degree

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.900
of freedom system look like?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.270
Just trace it in the air.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.100
This is a response per unit
input, and where does it go?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.686
Way up high--

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:20.810
AUDIENCE: At the resonance.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.610
PROFESSOR: At the resonance.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.693
And so if you have two 2
degree of freedom system,

00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:25.676
how many resonances do you have?

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:27.300
What do you think
the transfer function

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.800
is going to look like for a
two degree of freedom system

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.002
if you just plotted it just
plot as a function of frequency?

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.150
AUDIENCE: Double peak.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.650
PROFESSOR: Double peak.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.650
So the transfer
function is likely to do

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.455
that at one frequency and that
at the next natural frequency.

00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.830
And that's what we're going
to talk about today, in fact.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.320
OK so if you excited the
second natural frequency

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.870
and it's lightly damped,
it's likely to be dominated

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.990
by that modal response.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.720
In that question, is it
guaranteed to be only that mode

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.190
responding, even if you derive
it at the natural frequency?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.690
Another way to
saying this question,

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.440
can the first mode
have some response

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.791
at any frequency you
excite the system at?

00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:11.290
Sure.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.260
It has transfer function.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.480
It's continuous in frequency.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.840
It just won't be very big.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.060
OK, next.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.260
For what value is
omega over omega

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.020
n is the force transmitted
to the wall going

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.990
to be the greatest.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.310
So this is-- when
we make this, this

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.500
is now we're doing--
it's rotating around.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.420
OK, so this thing
is rotating mass now

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.220
at a constant frequency.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.890
So it's got a static imbalance.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.719
And at what frequency would you
expect the force transmitted

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.885
to the wall be the greatest?

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.070
AUDIENCE: At resonance.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.994
PROFESSOR: At resonance, because
that's when you get the most--

00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:05.160
AUDIENCE: The most response.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.368
PROFESSOR: Greatest response.

00:06:06.368 --> 00:06:09.214
And the force transmitted to
the wall is through the spring

00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:10.880
and through the dash
pot, and the bigger

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.970
the motions, the bigger
those forces are going to be.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.060
OK, next.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.070
And so this is-- now, if
you'll account for the spring,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.690
do you expect the counting
for the mass of the spring

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.950
to increase the predicted
natural frequency

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.525
or decrease it?

00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:30.957
AUDIENCE: Decrease.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:31.790
PROFESSOR: Decrease.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.820
Natural frequencies
behave like square root

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.090
of k/m kind of thing.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.950
And if you do anything
that drives up the m,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.550
frequency is going to go down.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.190
Another way of asking
the same question

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.710
is, if you neglect
mass when you're

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.610
estimating the natural
frequency of a system,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.590
which way are you
likely to be in error?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.037
This system, normally we just
ignore the mass of the springs,

00:06:56.037 --> 00:06:57.620
and we calculate the
natural frequency

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.590
as square root of
k/m, and we're almost

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.920
certain to be-- predict what?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.950
Too high or too low?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.870
AUDIENCE: Too high.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.620
PROFESSOR: Too high,
because we've ignored

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.890
some mass in the system.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.830
OK, next.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.990
I think that's it.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.320
I want to get on
with today's lecture.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.882
We have done
vibration from point

00:07:17.882 --> 00:07:19.340
of view of single
degree of freedom

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.190
systems, transient response,
and steady escape response.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.170
And then we've started looking
at multiple degree of freedom

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.722
systems, but we
actually started it

00:07:28.722 --> 00:07:30.430
from the point of view
of modal analysis,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.730
and we looked at two
degree of freedom systems,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.450
and found the
modal contributions

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.640
of each of the modes, and sort
of did them one at a time.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.129
So is there another
way-- one of you

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.670
asked me after class
last time, well,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.000
can't you just solve the
differential equations directly

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.195
and not bother with separating
the modes out and figuring out

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:52.195
the modal contributions.

00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:55.690
The answer is yes, and you
do it via transfer functions,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.987
except now you will
need more than one

00:07:57.987 --> 00:07:59.820
if you have more than
one degree of freedom.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.385
So that's what we'll
focus on today.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:17.220
And we're going to do it by
thinking about the example

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.920
actually from the homework.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.950
So in the homework
you have this problem

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:33.510
of this cart with this
pendulum hanging off of it.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.179
And we-- in problem
three, I think it is--

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.059
is say, OK, now the
pendulum is going

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.000
to go around a
constant rate, and it's

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.750
going to turn this into a
rotating imbalance problem.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:50.810
And I shorten it up so it's just
a little mass spinning around.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:09:00.350
You have k1, c1, x1 here.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:05.410
And I think you have
draw in there as theta.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.500
This is point A
about which it spins.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.320
And you know the
non-linear equation

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.460
to motion for treating this as
a two degree of freedom system,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.040
just pendulum on a cart.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:31.515
And then nonlinear
equation of motion.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.170
And I'm going to
put subscripts here,

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.890
and I'm going to call
this coordinate x1,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:51.324
because we're going to
need a second coordinate--

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.500
or actually, do we?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.580
What am I saying?

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.770
We don't need to do that.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.750
Just x will do.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.560
We do need the m1
and m2, though.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.650
And so that is all-- I'm
going to move the remaining

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.100
stuff to the right hand side.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:18.390
So this is your
nonlinear m2L theta

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:26.060
double dot cos theta
minus theta dot

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:35.760
squared sine theta on
the right hand side.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.290
And I think I need a
minus if I do that.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.030
Now, what I do in
this problem, I

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.375
say let's let theta dot equals
omega, and that's a constant.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.050
And so that says
theta double dot is 0.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.080
When you do that, then
this term goes away,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.220
and this becomes omega
squared minus times a minus.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:14.570
This equals 1/2 m2L
omega squared sine.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.685
And theta is just omega t.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.870
So by forcing what was
previously an unknown variable

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.720
that you had the
solve in this-- you

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.610
had two equations
and two unknowns

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.730
because you had two
generalized coordinates

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.970
it took to describe the motion
of this thing, x and theta.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.690
Now, once you prescribe
theta and it's given,

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.530
it's no longer a variable.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.590
It's no longer a coordinate
in your generalized--

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.260
in your equations of motion
that you have to solve for,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.270
and it reduces this equation to
the equation of a single degree

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.110
of freedom system.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.280
On the left hand side is
the response quantities

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.200
just like usual-- mx double
dot plus bx dot plus kx.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.370
And on the right hand side
is our harmonic excitation,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.620
and that's this unbalanced
mass going around and around.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.760
So this has the form here.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.650
This is some-- if you want
to think of it this way,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:22.190
this is some F0, and it
looks like sine omega t.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.610
So this is just a single degree
of freedom system excited

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.120
by harmonic excitation,
and you know

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.022
it has a transfer
function, and you

00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:30.730
know that there's
going to be a resonance

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.930
at the natural
frequency of the system.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.660
And if you don't like
working with sine omega t,

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.750
you could say, well, let's
measure omega theta from here

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.760
if you want to, and now
that's cosine omega t.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:58.500
OK, so that's sort
of the set up.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.740
Let me say one-- if
I asked you to solve

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:20.620
for the magnitude of
the response x1 here,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.010
how would you do it?

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.240
So this is now a single degree
of freedom system excited

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.990
by harmonic excitation.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.795
Steady state response--
how do you do it?

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.910
This you do have to know.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.202
AUDIENCE: Transfer function.

00:13:44.202 --> 00:13:45.660
PROFESSOR: Use a
transfer function.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.020
So this going to be the
magnitude of the force

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:55.392
times the magnitude of the HxF
of omega transfer function,

00:13:55.392 --> 00:13:57.600
and that's how you get the
magnitude of the response,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.170
and it happens to
be a resonance.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.050
Then you'd be at the peak,
and if you're not a resonance,

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.496
wherever you happen
to be in frequency

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.562
is where you would
evaluate this,

00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:08.645
and there's your response.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:22.670
Now, a few years ago--
every year-- twice a year,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.760
in fact-- and they're
coming up in January,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.070
we have doctoral
exams for students

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.130
who want to do PhDs in
mechanical engineering,

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.010
and most departments
at MIT have these also.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.900
And in the dynamics portion,
there's an oral exam part.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.990
There's a written exam,
also, but in the oral exam

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:48.380
in this particular year,
gave a single degree

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.310
of freedom system.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.480
And we posed-- and
we all know that,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.590
if we excite this thing
with a harmonic excitation,

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:15.830
some F1 cosine-- and I
will use complex notation,

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.750
because we're going to need
it in a minute-- some F1 e

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.550
to the i omega t.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.200
That's the excitation.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.210
We know what the steady state
response of this looks like.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.070
The magnitude looks like
that transfer function.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.794
But we posed-- so most
would be doctoral students

00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:38.210
would know all about single
degree of freedom [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.790
So we posed the
following question.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.060
Well, we know that
the response of this

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:47.250
is going to do
something like that,

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.060
and you evaluate this
at whatever frequency

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.242
you're interested in,
including right at resonance.

00:15:53.242 --> 00:15:54.700
And the question
we asked is, is it

00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:06.210
possible to add a second spring
and a second mass, m2 and k2,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:31.720
such that-- so is it possible
to pick a k2 and an m2,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.660
such that, with this
excitation on here,

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.170
the motion of that
thing will be 0?

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.890
And in order to
solve this problem,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.540
as soon as you put this on here
and assume it's sliding along--

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.250
it can't fall.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.380
It only has horizontal
possible motion,

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.394
and we'd give it some coordinate
describing its motion x2.

00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:55.810
So now how many degrees of
freedom does this problem have?

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.020
Two.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.830
How many equations of
motion do you expect?

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.970
How many peaks in
a transfer function

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.970
would you expect to see?

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.040
Two resonances.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.160
So now we need to
know how to find

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.480
transfer functions for a
multiple degree of freedom

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.140
system.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.950
enough in everything I've said
about two degree of freedom

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.990
systems, everything
is generalizable to n

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.244
degrees of freedom.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.660
Though, what I'm
going to show you

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.205
now is how to do transfer
functions for multi-degree

00:17:30.205 --> 00:17:31.580
of freedom systems,
and I'm going

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.000
to do it by way of example of
a two a degree of freedom one,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.210
but just keep in mind that you
can completely generalize this.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:49.090
So there is my system-- two
masses, two springs-- and I

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.420
could even have dash
spots in here-- a c1,

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.356
and I might have a c2.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.110
And I could even, in
general, additionally have

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.220
a force acting on this
second mass, which

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.580
I'll call F2e to the I omega t.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.118
So that's the completely
general problem now.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:27.820
Now, the equations of
motion for this system

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.660
you could write down.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.810
We've done it many times
now-- this particular system

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.630
even-- but we could
write them in matrix form

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:45.370
as mx double dot
plus cx dot plus k.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:50.170
Stiffness matrix x
equals and excite

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.280
the excitation in this
two degree-- well,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.030
I'll just keep this
is completely general.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:19:00.800
This is any n degree of freedom
system, some Fe to the i omega

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800
t.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.740
So here's kind of
an important point.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.920
We solve for the motion of
a multiple degree of freedom

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.200
system to a harmonic input.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.140
We do it one
frequency at a time.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.820
So this doesn't
mean that I could

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.090
have force on the
first mass at omega 1

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.900
or at some omega, and
force of the second mass

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.090
at some other omega.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.720
I'd never do that
at the same time.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.950
It's a linear system.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.690
Superposition holds.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.320
You do things one frequency
at a time, get the answer,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.230
and if you have
another frequency part,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.980
you do that separately,
then add the two answers.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.320
So this is assumed.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.070
All the forces
acting on the masses

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.146
are assumed to occur
at one frequency,

00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:46.770
but you can't have
different amplitudes

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.047
on the different masses.

00:19:49.047 --> 00:19:50.130
So that's what that means.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:20:03.960
So this then for the two
degree of freedom system-- F,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:11.310
for examplet-- F of t
would be some constant F1.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:16.110
Another constant magnitude,
F2e to the i omega t.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.870
That's what we mean by that.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.540
Actually, if you do that,
if these are just constants,

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.450
some constant force vector
applied at a single frequency,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.720
what frequency do
you expect to see

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.850
in the response of the system?

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.540
Steady state response.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.940
AUDIENCE: Driving frequency.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.876
Driving frequency.

00:20:39.876 --> 00:20:42.000
PROFESSOR: Right, it's a
linear system more or less

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.870
since you really
want to go away with.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.410
This is an intralinear system.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.040
Steady state response
of a linear system--

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.045
the frequency in is
the frequency out.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.290
Always true.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.285
So we expect to see a solution.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.360
We're going to get a
solution of the form x

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.650
equals some magnitude
vector times an e

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.670
to the i omega t also.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.790
And the magnitude
might be complex,

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.100
because it there be phase
angles there due to damping

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.000
and so forth, but nonetheless,
they're constants.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.660
This part is a constant
vector, and that's

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.680
its frequency dependence.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.890
And if we know that is
true, then we can say,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.330
well, take the time
derivative of that.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.840
The only time dependent
part is the e to i omega t.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:46.030
So x dot becomes i omega
xe to the i omega t.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:54.500
And x double dot becomes
minus omega squared xe

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.660
to the i omega t.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:05.203
So we can substitute this, this,
and this into this equation.

00:22:05.203 --> 00:22:06.786
Of course, these are
matrix equations.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.030
And when you do
that, minus omega

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:26.870
squared times the mass
matrix i omega times the c

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:42.990
matrix plus k xe to the i omega
t equals Fe to the i omega t.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.010
You can get rid of
these, and now you

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:51.610
have a algebraic equation that's
no longer a function of time--

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.340
function of your
original mass, damping,

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.010
and stiffness matrices.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.050
And it's certainly a
function of frequency.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.700
And if you think
back, this is how

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.570
we derive the transfer function
for a single degree of freedom

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.770
system.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.314
And this statement is true for
single degree of freedom, too.

00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:07.480
With single degree of
freedom, that's just the mass.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.800
That's just the damping, and
that's just the stiffness.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.939
And you could solve directly
for the hx/f transfer function,

00:23:14.939 --> 00:23:16.480
but with multiple
degrees of freedom,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.150
we can't just quite
divide this out.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:25.460
This piece here is known
as the-- I'll write

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.540
it is z omega-- z of omega.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.670
This is known as the
impedance matrix.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.470
And if I want to solve,
I'm looking for x.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.370
I want to know my solution x.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.496
So this is essentially
of the form z.

00:23:46.496 --> 00:23:54.600
It's a matrix times x, a
vector, equals F, a vector.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.670
And just using what you
know about linear algebra,

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.730
to solve for x, you just
multiply through by z inverse.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:14.350
So x equals z
inverse F. All right?

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.860
And z is a two degree
of freedom system. z is

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.090
a two by two matrix with
frequency and everything in it,

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.220
but it's a two by two.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.010
So z inverse will
be a two by two.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:33.170
And for two by two, we can
just write down the answer,

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:33.930
but let's see.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.870
I'll write out z of omega here.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.550
So just to be clear
about what all this is,

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:56.490
z of omega is this,
and in this problem,

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:01.330
that's minus omega squared
times a mass matrix, which

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:06.990
looks like m1, 0, 0, m2.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:14.830
And you add to that a damping
matrix, i omega, times c.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.550
The c is from the
equations of motion.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:28.100
c1 plus c2, minus c2, minus
c2, c2, and plus our k matrix.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:41.150
k1 plus k2, minus
k2, minus k2 k2.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.680
So that's what the z of
omega actually looks like.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.310
And so you would collect--
so it's a two by two matrix,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.670
and its upper left term is
minus omega squared m1 plus i

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.410
omega times this plus that.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.150
Collect them all together.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.420
And this has a form--
this collects together

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:13.010
in a form we call
z11, z12, z21, z22.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:21.560
And very often z12
and z21 are symmetric.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.800
Not always.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.130
The kind of problems
we generally do here,

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.270
they will be, and it will
be generally symmetric

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:34.260
if your coordinate
system is measured

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.240
from a static
equilibrium position.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.810
So if you've been
doing 2001, there's

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.460
a thing called Maxwell's
reciprocal theorem,

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.151
which proves this for
the stiffness matrix.

00:26:46.151 --> 00:26:47.650
They essentially
need to be measured

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.060
from static
equilibrium positions,

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.860
but for today's example,
this is indeed symmetric.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.850
Minus c2, minus c2,
minus k2, minus k2.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.790
0, 0.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.680
Everything is symmetric.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.550
So we'll take advantage of
that, and I'll write out

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.800
one of the components
here-- z11,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:13.970
for example, when you
collect the terms together,

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:26.260
is in general, it would be
minus omega squared m11 plus i

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:36.430
omega c11 plus k11, the corner
elements of these three pieces.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:52.150
And in this problem, that's
minus omega squared m1 plus i

00:27:52.150 --> 00:28:03.230
omega c1 plus c2
plus k1 plus k2.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:09.070
You just substitute in
this, this, and this.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.850
So that's z11, for
example, and the other ones

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.010
you can figure out what each
of the other terms would be.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:34.130
All right, so we've said that we
want to know what the x's are.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:41.140
And we know that we can get
that by doing z inverse times F.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.030
And this gives us
our definition.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:52.000
This z inverse is our H, our
transfer function matrix,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.060
times F. So just by
getting z inverse,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.240
we get this little set of
four transfer functions

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.580
that we're interested in.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:14.710
So H is an N by N matrix
of transfer functions.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:30.910
So in a two by two-- or
for the two by two case,

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.170
our N equals 2.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:39.690
We know we can write out
directly what z inverse is.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:56.530
And z inverse-- z22, minus z12,
minus z12 when it's symmetric,

00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:04.880
z11, all over-- how
should I write it?

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.882
All over the determinant of z.

00:30:08.882 --> 00:30:10.115
So this is the determinant.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.640
So the determinant
of z [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.760
do these double bars.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.580
So this over the determinant
is the inverse of that matrix,

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.940
and this gives you
a new result, which

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:52.760
is H11, H12, H12, H22, where
Hij-- this is the response at i

00:30:52.760 --> 00:31:00.762
per unit force at j.

00:31:00.762 --> 00:31:04.480
And I've made this-- I took
advantage of the symmetry here,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.990
but this one would
normally be called 21,

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.500
so this is response at 1
caused by the force at 1.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.230
So we have forces
in our problem.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.610
One is the force
on the main mass.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.660
So how much response do you
get at the main first mass

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.545
due to the force
on the first mass?

00:31:22.545 --> 00:31:23.920
This is how much
response you get

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.880
on the first mass due to the
excitation in the second mass.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.400
Response on the second mass due
to the excitation on the first.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.240
Response in the second
mass due to the excitation

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.240
on the second mass.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.300
So you get four possible
contributions here.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:50.830
And the determinant
of z for a two by two

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.100
is also very straightforward.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:59.520
z11, z22, minus z12 squared.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:09.020
So we can and will work out
exactly what the algebra tells

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.040
us for this two by two case.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.076
So we've already been discussing
it, but what do you expect.

00:32:17.076 --> 00:32:18.450
Let's say let's
look at this one.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.660
What do you suppose
the response at 1

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:29.470
due to a harmonic
excitation at 1--

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:36.690
what do you think the sketch of
the magnitude of H11 of omega

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.050
would look like as a
function a frequency?

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.230
AUDIENCE: Will C12 and
C21 always be symmetric?

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.510
PROFESSOR: No, but for the kind
of problems we do, probably.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:54.060
And if it's simple beams, or
masses connected by springs,

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.700
if you choose your generalized
coordinates in a way that

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.950
is, for example, measuring
the displacement of each mass

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.280
from an inertial static
equilibrium starting point,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.930
it'll be symmetric.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.630
But if you measure the-- even
in this two degree of freedom,

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:18.370
I can make it non-symmetric
just by choosing the coordinate

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:22.030
for the second mass as to be
relative to the first mass.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.110
Soon as you do that, it
makes it non-symmetric.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.590
You can still solve for transfer
function and everything,

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.070
but it gets messier.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.840
Though, notice I picked
coordinates-- x1 relative

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.970
to the inertial frame, x2
relative to the same inertial

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.710
frame-- and they're both
measuring displacement

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.630
from a static
equilibrium position.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.126
Then they are symmetric.

00:33:45.126 --> 00:33:46.625
And there's the
determinant we need,

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:50.630
and this determinant-- see,
this is divided into all four

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.560
of these terms.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.845
So these four transfer functions
all share the same denominator.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.700
They all have the
same denominator.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.884
So I just want you to
use your intuition.

00:34:04.884 --> 00:34:06.550
Tell me what this is
going to look like.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:15.050
What's it look like for a
single degree of freedom system?

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.679
It's HxF for a single
degree of freedom--

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.679
it's H11 for a single
degree of freedom system

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.800
as a response of those
systems to a harmonic

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.810
force on that single mass,
and that looks like what?

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:28.971
Peak, right?

00:34:28.971 --> 00:34:31.179
This one-- what do you think
it's going to look like?

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.820
Show me again.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.380
OK, but I see one peak.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.219
How many peaks?

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:40.909
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:41.893
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:34:41.893 --> 00:34:42.877
AUDIENCE: Because it's
two degrees of freedom.

00:34:42.877 --> 00:34:44.820
PROFESSOR: Two different
natural frequencies.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:50.400
This thing is going to
look something like this,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.195
and I don't know quite
how it behaves in here,

00:34:53.195 --> 00:34:55.500
but it's going to
do that for sure.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.970
It's going to have two
resonances-- this one at omega

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.180
1, this one at omega 2.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.800
We already know that because
we did it by modal analysis.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.210
We know each mode is going
to have a resonance in it.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:10.400
OK, so let's find out
exactly what it looks like.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.150
So for this two degree
of freedom system,

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:26.275
there's an F1 and an F2,
and we're looking for x1.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:48.490
So x1 x2 here equals H11,
H12, H12, H22 times F1 F2.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:36:00.727
So if I want to solve for
x1, H11 F1 plus H12 F2.

00:36:00.727 --> 00:36:02.310
And for the problem
I'm going to solve

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:10.030
today, I'm going to let F2
be 0, just to keep it simple,

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.310
but also to address
the original question

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.390
we ask the doctoral students.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.900
You have a force
on the first mass.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.540
Can I add a mass and
spring to it in such a way

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.860
that I can make the response
of the first mass go to 0.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.710
So there is no second force.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:31.030
There's only a first force,
and so this term goes away.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:37.580
And so this problem,
x1, is H11 F1.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:44.360
Therefore, we need to
know what H11 looks like.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:58.290
So H11 is going to be z22
divided by the determinant.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:15.530
So x1 is going to be z22 over
Z11, Z22 minus Z12 squared

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.620
times F1.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:38.230
And actually I can
do this so-- and I'm

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:43.780
going to let, for
now, damping be 0,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.620
because it also simplifies
it for the purposes

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.790
of illustration today.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.480
And that's how I was posed
to the doctoral student.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.730
Didn't even show any damping.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:56.110
It was just a simple
system, a string and a mass.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:56.990
How can you do this?

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:59.300
So we'll let the damping
be 0 and that considerably

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.600
simplifies things then.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:32.710
So Z11 is minus omega
squared m1 plus k1 plus k2.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:45.430
z22 minus omega
squared m2 plus k2.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:39:02.330
And z12 just minus k2.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.340
So now these are pretty
simple expressions,

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.630
and all I have to do
is plug them in here.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:12.070
And notice what's going to
happen. z11 times z22-- that's

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.710
something involving
omega squared

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:18.170
times another term
involving omega squared.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:20.990
It's going to give
you a polynomial

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.990
and omega to the fourth.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.190
This is the polynomial
that has two roots,

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.195
and the two routes are?

00:39:29.824 --> 00:39:31.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
frequencies.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
natural frequencies.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.010
The determinant of the z
matrix is the same problem

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:41.510
you solve when you've
found the roots

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.450
of the characteristic equation.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.400
It is the
characteristic equation

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.250
for the system, the
denominator, the determinant

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:50.670
of the z matrix.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.220
Therefore it's going to be a
fourth order equation in omega.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.870
It'll give you two
routes for omega squared.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.690
They're your two undamped
natural frequencies

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.390
when we leave damping
out of this expression,

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.050
and they'd be damped--
the damped expressions--

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.500
they'd have complex stuff
if you leave in the damping.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.530
But they give us our two roots,
and they go in the denominator.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:12.501
Yeah?

00:40:12.501 --> 00:40:13.914
AUDIENCE: If we set the
denominator or the determinant

00:40:13.914 --> 00:40:15.562
of the matrix equal
to 0 and solve,

00:40:15.562 --> 00:40:16.980
you get the modal frequencies?

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.920
That denominator is the
characteristic equation

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.260
that we did when we set it up
to do the natural frequencies.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.230
Same equation.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:32.136
So we know that this thing
has two roots, one at each

00:40:32.136 --> 00:40:33.260
of the natural frequencies.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.440
And when omega is at a
natural frequency, what

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.870
is the value of this
characteristic equation?

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.924
Well, no.

00:40:43.924 --> 00:40:45.090
The characteristic equation.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.740
Think of the denominator.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.350
Add a root, that
expression goes to?

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:50.850
0.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.120
So you're dividing by 0.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.146
That's what causes the peaks.

00:40:54.146 --> 00:40:55.520
That's where the
peaks come from.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.180
That's where the
denominator goes to 0,

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.530
and that's at the
natural frequencies.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:14.760
OK, so x1 for this
problem equals H11F1,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.450
and now we can
just write it out.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:30.460
H11 is minus omega squared
m2 plus k2 times F1.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.960
And the denominator, the
characteristic equation,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:41.570
is minus omega
squared m1 plus k1

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:47.610
plus k2 times
minus omega squared

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:57.160
m2 plus k2 minus k2 squared.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.240
So this whole thing
down here-- there's

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.500
your characteristic equation.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.333
You multiply it out.

00:42:01.333 --> 00:42:03.620
You get your fourth
order polynomial.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.180
Solve it.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.300
You get two roots,
but this is now

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.990
a total expression for the
response we were looking for.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.080
So right away this
gives me the answer

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.320
to the question that was posed
to the doctoral students.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.230
So is there a value-- can
you set k2 and m2 such

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:33.480
that you can make the
response of the system 0

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.510
at a particular omega?

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.370
All you have to do is make
the numerator go to 0, right?

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:48.030
So if you make this
go to 0, x goes to 0.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:43:01.750
So x1 equals 0 when minus omega
squared m2 plus k2 equals zero,

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:09.200
and that happens when k2
over m2 equals omega squared.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:23.420
So how many-- once you set k2
and m2, how many frequencies

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.342
does this happen at?

00:43:25.342 --> 00:43:27.620
At how many different
operating points

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.430
can you make the response
of that main mass go to 0?

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.040
Well, just one.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.550
Once you choose k1 and m2,
whatever you've chosen to be,

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:45.260
they give you some
value of omega.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.500
And when I said I was kind of
vague about what happens here,

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.040
this is H11.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.030
Looks like that.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:03.615
Right here is when omega
squared equals k2/m2.

00:44:12.086 --> 00:44:15.746
AUDIENCE: So when it's
at the frequency that

00:44:15.746 --> 00:44:20.870
makes the numerator 0, wouldn't
it also-- I don't remember.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.830
Would the denominator be 0 also?

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:23.950
PROFESSOR: No.

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:24.480
No.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.269
Because, look at
the picture here.

00:44:27.269 --> 00:44:29.477
Where are the two natural
frequencies of this system?

00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:34.790
There's one here,
and there's one here.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.520
And that's when the
denominator goes to 0.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.360
When the denominator
goes to 0, the response

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.830
goes to infinity
with no damping.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.840
So the system has two
natural frequencies-- one

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.180
to either side of this point.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:57.890
So I've picked kind of
a particular example

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.305
to illustrate the use
of a transfer function,

00:45:01.305 --> 00:45:02.930
and the fact that
you can have transfer

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:05.600
functions for multiple
degree of freedom systems,

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.940
and they essentially become
transfer function matrices.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.850
And you use what you need,
and for this problem,

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.762
we needed H11.

00:45:15.762 --> 00:45:17.350
We worked it out.

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:18.810
There it is.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:22.060
This is a complete equation
that describes, for me,

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.410
the behavior of mass
1 per unit input force

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.310
as a function of frequency.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:32.226
And it will always have a point
right there that it goes to 0.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.582
And we don't have any damping
in here, so intuitively,

00:45:38.582 --> 00:45:40.540
what do you think damping
will do to this plot?

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.720
What's the first thing
it does to the peaks?

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.470
What?

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:49.334
They become?

00:45:49.334 --> 00:45:50.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:51.270
PROFESSOR: Finite.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:55.480
And so the small damping, you're
going to have very high tops.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.830
More damping, they're
going to be lower.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.580
So damping especially
affects the peaks.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.020
Damping will also pull this
off the bottom a little bit.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.510
It won't perfectly go to 0.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.980
So I want to do a
very particular case.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:19.240
So an obvious one is
your original system.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:24.110
It might be just a mass
spring with a rotor in it

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:27.350
that's unbalanced, and it's
running near resonance,

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:28.860
and it's vibrating like crazy.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.070
A single degree of freedom
system vibrating like crazy.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:38.290
Can I put on a second mass
spring and stop the motion?

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.140
Well, we can theoretically.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.520
And we'll just say
let's let the problem

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.520
we're trying to solve--
that first system had

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.380
a natural frequency.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:55.170
I'll call it cap omega n that
was the square root k1 over m1,

00:46:55.170 --> 00:47:00.360
and I'm going to let that be
equal to square root of k2

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.240
over m2.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.260
So I've now chosen
k2 and m2 such

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.350
they're exactly at
the natural frequency

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:11.820
of the original single
degree of freedom system.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.450
So this is the
original system, k1 m1,

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.130
and it has that
natural frequency.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:25.890
And now I'm going to stick
on a second mass, k2 m2,

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.870
but the value k2/m2 of
the second little system--

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:33.281
by itself, it has the same
natural frequency as the first

00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:34.780
if you want to think
of it that way.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.610
If I make this fixed,
what's the natural frequency

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.350
of that mass and spring?

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:41.730
Same natural frequency.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.290
I'm just making it that way.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:46.690
So this is now my system.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:53.640
That's the parameters,
and now we can--

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.300
I'm going to give you
a plot of the response

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.640
of that particular system.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.850
You know how we
non-dimensionalize

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:26.300
the single degree of
freedom transfer function?

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.415
We set x divided by
the static motion.

00:48:29.415 --> 00:48:31.490
I want to do that again here.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:34.651
So let's look at this system.

00:48:34.651 --> 00:48:38.600
It's a two degree
of freedom system.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:44.010
It has a force F1 on it, and
as the frequency goes to 0

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:52.910
and has displacement x1 and
x2-- so at omega equals 0,

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:56.120
x1 equals x1s.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.580
I'll call it x1 static.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.940
And how much is it?

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.650
So what's the
static displacement

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:04.433
at 0 frequency of this
system to that force?

00:49:12.381 --> 00:49:12.880
Come on.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.180
It's just a spring and a force.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.850
How much will that
spring stretch

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:21.204
when you put a force F1 on it?

00:49:21.204 --> 00:49:22.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.400
PROFESSOR: F1/k.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:27.223
So x1 static equals F1/k1.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:33.850
And F2 is 0.

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:34.860
There's no F2 force.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.480
So how much is x2 static?

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.100
There's no forces
on the second mass.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.676
How much will it move?

00:49:44.676 --> 00:49:45.638
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:45.638 --> 00:49:48.740
PROFESSOR: It just moves the
same amount as a first mass.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:54.810
So this is x2 static, because
the forces on the system

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.170
are F1 and 0.

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:57.250
There's no force in this.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.310
It's not going to do
anything to that spring.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.430
It'll just move with
the whole system.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.925
So I want to plot
x1 over x1 static.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:25.040
In general, x1 is a function
of frequency-- is F1 times--

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.250
and I'm going to do
the magnitudes here--

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.595
times the magnitude of H11.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:39.680
And I'm going to divide
that by F1 over k1.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.180
So the F1's go away.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.420
k1 comes in the numerator.

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.500
This looks like k1 h11.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:51:00.340
So a plot of k1 magnitude h11.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:04.760
We know roughly what
it's going to look like.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.441
It has a peak.

00:51:07.441 --> 00:51:09.570
It has a 0.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:10.890
It has another peak.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.960
Over here, this plot goes to 1.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.540
There's x1 over-- this is
also x1 over x1 static.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.310
Same thing.

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:24.370
It goes to 1.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.510
Here it goes to 0.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.030
Here is omega 1.

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.400
Here is omega 2.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:40.219
And right here you're at
the original cap omega n,

00:51:40.219 --> 00:51:42.260
because that's the way
we've designed this thing,

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.820
and we know this is
the way H11 behaves.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.850
It goes to 0 at the
value we've chosen

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:51.290
for square root of k2/m2.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.270
So we started out with
an original system that

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.470
had a natural frequency here.

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:58.760
k1/m1 was right here.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.930
We stuck on this
second little mass,

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:04.870
and it made into a two
degree of freedom system.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.680
It no longer has a
natural frequency there.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.340
It has a natural
frequency below it,

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.270
and a natural
frequency above it,

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:14.110
and a 0 right where the
original natural frequency was.

00:52:29.127 --> 00:52:30.710
Imagine what's going
on in the system.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.060
You've got this force being
applied to the first mass,

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.192
and the first mass isn't moving.

00:52:35.192 --> 00:52:37.392
Do you think the
second mass is moving?

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.000
Think about the free body
diagram of the first mass.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.200
F equals ma.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.980
There is a force on that first
mass-- F1 cosine omega t--

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.170
and it's not moving.

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:55.880
Mx1 double dot is 0.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.580
So in order for the thing not
to move, there's a force on it.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:03.190
There must be some other
force exactly canceling it.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:04.366
Where does it come from?

00:53:04.366 --> 00:53:05.340
AUDIENCE: Mass two.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:09.770
PROFESSOR: Mass two
through the spring.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:15.560
OK, so I'd also like
to know, what is x2?

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:23.670
Well, x2 from our
transfer function matrix

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:30.930
is the response of 2 due
to a force at 1 times F1,

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.680
plus a response at 2 due
to a force at 2 times F2,

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:39.330
but that second term
is 0 because F2 is 0.

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:46.250
That's a one term
expression, and H21

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:52.690
is z11 over the denominator.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:54:08.670
And Z11-- so x2 is
going to look like that.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.640
I wrote that wrong.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.590
This is not z11.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:39.160
It is z minus z12 like that.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:51.640
And if you work that
out, it's F1 times k2

00:54:51.640 --> 00:55:00.670
over the same denominator, but
let's evaluate-- here's our--

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.320
this is the frequency
we've been interested in.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:09.090
Let's evaluate the response
of x2 right at this operating

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.500
point.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:18.110
So let's evaluate this at
omega equals cap omega n.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:25.870
So that's k2 down here
minus omega squared

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:30.640
m1 plus k1 plus k2.

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.325
It's the same
denominator as always.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:43.760
k2-- I'm not going
to write it out.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.260
It's exactly the
same thing as before,

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.460
but I want to plug in to this
denominator the operating

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.880
frequency.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.940
We're going to operate
at cap omega n, which

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.790
is k1/m1 squared--
square root of k1/m1,

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.190
or square root of k2/me.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.810
I'm going to plug in in this,
and let's see what we get.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:08.400
And I'm going to let omega
equal k1/m1 or k2/m2.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.580
It's the same thing, and
I'm plug them in whatever

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.570
is convenient.

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:16.314
So here I'm going to put
k1/m1, N1 and the m1's are

00:57:16.314 --> 00:57:16.980
going to cancel.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.438
I'll be left an k1.

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:27.790
F1 over k1 and down in
the denominator, this term

00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:36.380
turns into k1/m1, so that's
minus k1 plus k1 plus k1.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:37.600
Those two cancel.

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.440
I just get a k2.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:48.980
Over here, I'll use minus
k2/m2 times m2 plus k2,

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.030
and that gives me
a minus k2 plus k2.

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:59.540
This whole thing goes to 0, and
I'm left with minus k2 squared

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.510
and in the denominator a k2.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.980
This whole thing
turns into F1 over k2.

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:18.460
So the total response of that
second mass at this operating

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.430
frequency is just F1 over k2.

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:37.330
And I would like to plot it as
what does x2 over x1 static--

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:41.290
and x1 static and x2
static are the same.

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:57.850
Well, that is F1 over
k2 over F1 over k1.

00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:03.200
The F1's go away,
and I get k1/k2.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.300
That also happens to
be m1/m2, and it's

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:11.410
a quantity we call 1 over mu.

00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:18.270
And we have just designed what's
called a dynamic absorber.

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:21.270
And a dynamic absorber
is a little device

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:24.240
you can use to stop vibration.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.605
So when we were talking
about vibration isolation

00:59:26.605 --> 00:59:29.010
and vibration mitigation
a few days ago

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:32.320
and I said you've got some
rotating imbalance [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.380
or something to
shake, well, give me

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.575
three ways of solving it.

00:59:37.575 --> 00:59:39.330
We said balance the rotor.

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:42.170
What were the other two ways of
perhaps reducing the vibration?

00:59:48.821 --> 00:59:50.770
AUDIENCE: Adding a
[INAUDIBLE] damper?

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:52.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
but also if you've

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:53.885
got something that's
shaking like crazy,

00:59:53.885 --> 00:59:55.718
and it's putting
fibrillation into the floor

00:59:55.718 --> 00:59:57.700
or into the table,
you can isolate it

00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.000
with a mass and a spring, or
a microscope over here that's

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.860
vibrating like crazy,
you can isolate it

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.940
with a mass or a spring.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.290
So this is to stop a
vibration isolation, which

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:09.820
is guaranteed to
be on the final--

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.020
the simple practical
applications of single degree

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.140
of freedom stuff.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.930
So we have three
ways-- fix the rotor,

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:18.020
isolate it with a
mass and a spring,

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.370
isolate the sensitive
instrument mass and a spring.

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:22.192
Now you have a fourth way.

01:00:22.192 --> 01:00:23.900
If it's a particular
operating frequency,

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.790
we can operate right
here with this thing

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.480
called the dynamic absorber.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.430
This mu quantity is
called the mass ratio.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.535
That's m2/m1.

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:46.990
Basically, these
things are real.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:48.620
They're actually used
in real machines,

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.640
and usually you can't-- this
dynamic absorber thing you

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.590
stick on there can't be as
big as the original system.

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:57.120
It's going to be some small
fraction of the original system

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.390
size-- 5% or 10%
if you're lucky.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.040
So the bigger this
thing is, you'll

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.250
find out the better it works.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:07.650
So how much is this little
second mass bouncing around?

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:11.560
Well it's bouncing around
compared to x1 static

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:17.030
in the ratio of k1 to k2, which
is this 1 over mu quantity.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.950
So if mu is 10%-- if you've
added the second mass,

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:22.310
it's 10% the size
of the first one.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:25.990
1 over mu is a factor of 10.

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:29.370
So this transfer
function basically

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:42.950
looks-- do I have some
colored-- so the x2/x1 transfer

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.420
function basically behaves
the same right here

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.410
and pretty much the
same way out here.

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:54.900
And in here, it comes down
like this and comes back up.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:03.220
And this height right
here is 1 over mu.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.060
So the smaller you make this
thing, the tinier you make it,

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:14.000
the more it has to shake to
force the first mas to go to 0.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.890
So basically, the reason this
thing works-- the free body

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:30.200
diagram-- at the 0 point, the
main mass m1, x1 equals 0 here.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.860
It's not moving.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:37.610
It's got a force acting on it
that is some F1 cosine omega t.

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:41.110
It's got a spring
force acting on it

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:42.950
from this second mass going.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:46.640
Here is m2 over here, and
it's going back and forth

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.080
like crazy putting force
through this spring.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.180
And the spring force had better
be exactly equal to that.

01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:02.390
So the F spring is going
to be equal to minus F1,

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:08.490
and that will be
equal to x2 times kx2.

01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:10.390
The second mass
has to move enough

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:13.350
that it'll compress the
spring enough that it provides

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:15.830
a force equal and
opposite to this one

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:19.830
so that it's in equilibrium
and it doesn't move.

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.430
All right.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.930
Yeah?

01:03:26.286 --> 01:03:27.738
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:27.738 --> 01:03:28.706
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:28.706 --> 01:03:32.473
AUDIENCE: So the
building, if you

01:03:32.473 --> 01:03:34.514
want the masses to be
fairly equal to each other,

01:03:34.514 --> 01:03:35.889
how is that ever
going to happen?

01:03:35.889 --> 01:03:37.090
PROFESSOR: It's not.

01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:39.700
Not usually.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:44.640
Dynamic absorbers are
used in real things,

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.440
like the Hancock Building.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.230
And they're used in engines.

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:51.150
They're used in all
sorts of little devices

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:53.130
that you're not aware
they they're there.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.000
And you have to
usually hide them

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.700
inside the footprint
of the original device.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.660
So you don't want
them-- for a real thing,

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.660
you don't want to have a pump
with this huge appendage on it.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:08.780
It's just not practical.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.440
So they tend to be small.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.677
And so, as a
consequence, in order

01:04:12.677 --> 01:04:14.635
to make them work at this
particular frequency,

01:04:14.635 --> 01:04:16.590
you have to vibrate like crazy.

01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:19.450
So the design cost of
one of these things

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.230
is you have to design to be
able to allow this second mass

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:25.080
to shake like all get out.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.630
Now, how many frequencies
does this work at?

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:32.250
Once you've designed it, it
only works at one frequency,

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:33.750
so this is only
useful for something

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.330
that has a fixed
operating frequency,

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.810
like a synchronous motor.

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:41.520
This isn't a good
thing for something

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.240
that has a range of frequencies
over which it can work,

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.570
but it is a different,
more complicated theory.

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:51.120
There's a type of
dynamic absorber

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.905
that you can make work over
a wide range of frequencies.

01:04:54.905 --> 01:04:56.670
I need to tell you
one other thing.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.820
When we put this thing on,
the original natural frequency

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:04.380
of the first system was here,
and it created two new ones.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.256
You had a further question.

01:05:06.256 --> 01:05:09.488
AUDIENCE: So how does making
it vibrate like that help?

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:11.404
It's only going to work
at that one frequency,

01:05:11.404 --> 01:05:13.063
and you're always
going to have that gap.

01:05:13.063 --> 01:05:14.438
So making it
vibrate really fast,

01:05:14.438 --> 01:05:17.420
how does that help at all?

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.170
PROFESSOR: If, for
some reason, you really

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:21.830
don't want that
first thing to shake,

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:25.160
this makes it stop
shaking at that frequency.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:32.170
So for example, one of the
widest distributed textbooks

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:35.260
in the world was written by an
MIT professor named Den Hartog,

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.874
and it's called
Mechanical Vibration.

01:05:36.874 --> 01:05:38.040
It was written in the 1930s.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.570
It's got a wonderful chapter
on dynamic absorbers in it.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.150
And the example that he
gives of a real device that

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:50.040
actually uses one was
an electric hair clipper

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.850
that a barber uses.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:55.990
The head on a hair
clipper-- it has

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:59.510
to go back and forth like
this in or to cut the hair.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:02.340
That is an oscillating mass,
and you're going to feel it.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.630
You're going to feel the mass
times the acceleration-- ma

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:12.300
omega squared acceleration--
at the frequency it runs that.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.800
So they did a clever thing.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.270
They built inside the
case of this thing

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.890
a little second mass and spring.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:21.790
And so that when you're
holding the clippers,

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.830
it doesn't feel like it's-- OK?

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:26.300
So that was an example.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:30.590
It was actually a great
example in his 1938 textbook.

01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.870
And just so you
know, you really do

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:35.910
have two natural frequencies
when you do this,

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:37.260
and I'll write them like this.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.080
Omega 1 squared
and omega 2 squared

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:45.270
are the original
frequency squared times 1

01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:54.550
plus mu over 2 plus or
minus mu plus mu squared

01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:58.570
over 4 square root.

01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:03.040
So as your mass
ratio gets bigger,

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.500
the two frequencies move
further and further apart.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.460
When the mass ratio
is 0, this quantity--

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.960
they have two
natural frequencies.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.290
It goes to 1 natural frequency.

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:13.915
It's a single degree
of freedom system,

01:07:13.915 --> 01:07:15.710
and it's at the original value.

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:19.270
As the mass ratio gets bigger
and bigger, these two roots--

01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:23.860
this one and this one-- as you
add mass to that second system,

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:24.930
they spread apart.

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:27.320
And the bigger the mass ratio,
the further apart the two

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.920
natural frequencies become.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.070
So we've got 10 minutes
left, and I have a demo

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:37.220
which illustrates this thing.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.449
It's a little delicate
to make it work,

01:07:40.449 --> 01:07:42.240
because actually it
was really frustrating.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.530
I had it all set up.

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:46.350
It worked great in my office.

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:49.590
Came in 10 minutes early
today to set it up,

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:52.740
and the table in here is
so flexible I can't make

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:56.020
it behave like a fixed surface.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.990
So I tweaked it, and I
think I've got running now,

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:03.840
but now what it is
is a beam with my pen

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.360
on it, my little squiggle pen.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.640
And you've seen this before.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.870
It's a rotating mass.

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:10.630
It's a static imbalance.

01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:13.500
It shakes this beam.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.960
And I've added to it
a second little beam.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.180
It's a little blade of steal
with a heavy magnet on it.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.700
That's my m2.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.700
This is my k2-- is
this little beam.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.345
This is the original
system, a mass,

01:08:27.345 --> 01:08:29.229
it's close to a
natural frequency,

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:33.084
and the rotation rate
of the eccentric mass

01:08:33.084 --> 01:08:36.439
is right at the natural
frequency of this beam.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:39.250
So because it's
delicate to set up,

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:43.109
I've got to show you the system
first with the second mass

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:45.819
attached to it, and I
think I've got it tweaked

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:46.920
so that it'll sit there.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.960
It's right at the
operating point,

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.189
and you ought to see the
second mass moving like crazy,

01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:56.340
and the original mass, the
beam, not moving much at all.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.005
So let's see if we
can make it work.

01:08:59.005 --> 01:09:00.630
We're going to need
to kill the lights.

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:19.529
And you can see in here the
rotating mass going around

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.300
and around, and so I
have the strobe light

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.790
detuned just a little bit so
that you can see the system.

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:27.080
It's not quite synchronous.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.939
Watch this little
white blob out here.

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:31.420
You see it going up and down.

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:36.390
That's your second mass,
and is the main beam--

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:41.840
it's moving a little
bit, but not much.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.340
It's got a little
damping, and so it

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.729
isn't perfectly down at that
0 point, but very close.

01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:52.390
So this is the system operating
close to that null point.

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:57.900
So now if I remove
the dynamic absorber,

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.330
the second little mass spring
system, then the main mass

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:04.316
and the beam ought
to shake like crazy.

01:10:15.052 --> 01:10:17.940
Just changing the
tuning a little here.

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:40.035
So now I'm going to
remove the absorber.

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.180
All right?

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:55.740
And now it's going like crazy.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.415
So that's an illustration.

01:11:01.415 --> 01:11:02.950
You can come up with the lights.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.080
Now, you hear beating?

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.950
This little pen-- this
little rotor in here

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:21.280
is driven by a little DC
motor and a single AA battery,

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.210
and it's not
feedback controlled.

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:26.539
Its frequency can vary,
and it isn't that powerful.

01:11:26.539 --> 01:11:28.330
So as this thing starts
moving up and down,

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:32.200
it actually takes real torque
to make that weight go around

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.340
while this whole system is
accelerating up and down.

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.010
And the motor just
isn't up to it,

01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:41.280
just isn't powerful enough,
so the speed changes.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.390
This thing can't hold
constant frequency.

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:46.260
So that's the demo.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:46.759
Questions?

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:52.460
So we've kind of embedded in
this lecture-- this lecture was

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:55.240
to introduce you to the idea
that you can write a transfer

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.830
function for a multiple
degree of freedom system--

01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:00.140
has embedded in it all
the natural frequencies

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.440
of the system.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.350
When you use a transfer
function to calculate

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:07.900
the response of the system, you
are getting the contributions

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.870
of all the modes at once.

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:15.470
So you essentially solve the
equations of motion directly.

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:17.390
So you now have seen
there's two ways

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:21.020
to go about analyzing multiple
degree of freedom systems--

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.400
the technique known as modal
analysis-- one mode at a time

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.780
and then add it together.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.120
Or like with transfer
functions, where you're just

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.040
solving the whole thing at
once, and each transfer function

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.710
has in it all of the information
about all of the modes

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:37.519
of the system.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.310
So if it's a five degree
of freedom system,

01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:43.261
you're going to see
five peaks out here.

01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:43.760
Questions?

01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:50.838
AUDIENCE: So this
is for [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:50.838 --> 01:12:54.230
But initially, since
you have a [INAUDIBLE],

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:57.885
does it have to start out moving
to be an [INAUDIBLE] moving

01:12:57.885 --> 01:13:00.140
and then it stops.

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:03.210
PROFESSOR: So there's going
to be a transient phase, sure.

01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:06.010
Any system, when
you start it up,

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:09.450
is going to have transients,
and the transients

01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:12.400
are the equivalent of
initial conditions.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.920
So displacement and
velocity-- and the response

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.210
of a linear system
that vibrates,

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:25.200
that has natural frequencies
to a set of initial conditions,

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.740
is vibration at
what frequencies?

01:13:36.027 --> 01:13:37.652
AUDIENCE: Do you know
how they overcome

01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:39.636
this in helicopters?
[INAUDIBLE] that we saw

01:13:39.636 --> 01:13:42.120
at the beginning of the year?

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
the helicopter-- so

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.080
I want to answer the question.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.850
Response to that transience
is at the natural frequencies

01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:50.030
of the system, maybe
some combination.

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:52.460
The original
displacement requires

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:54.020
contributions of several modes.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.250
You'll get decay
contributions at each

01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.100
of the natural frequencies,
and once they've died out,

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.570
this motor has started up.

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:05.730
The thing will settle into what
we call steady state response,

01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.355
and it will only be at
the excitation frequency.

01:14:08.355 --> 01:14:09.980
And I haven't show
you anything about--

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.440
can you solve the equations of
motion from start up at time 0

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.350
through the whole
messy transient phase

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.210
to steady state?

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:17.710
Sure.

01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:20.330
And we haven't talked
at all about that.

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:24.410
And actually, for vibration
stuff, it is very important.

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:25.840
Steady state answer
is important.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.548
The transient answer
is pretty important,

01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:29.560
and for you to have
a feeling for that,

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.690
you actually know quite a fair
amount about the basic concepts

01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:34.810
of how things vibrate now.

01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:37.250
Now, your question
about the helicopter--

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:39.005
so if you have a
uniform helicopter

01:14:39.005 --> 01:14:42.642
blade-- they rigged
that to do what it did.

01:14:42.642 --> 01:14:44.600
I don't know what they
were experimenting with,

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.590
but if you do-- there's a
problem that I've actually

01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:48.940
given in a vibration course.

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:51.470
If you design a really
simple helicopter

01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:53.380
that has a uniform blade.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:58.990
It's a uniform rod, and
it's pivoted at the center,

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:00.680
and you spin it up,
and if you spin it

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.290
fast enough-- if
you spin it slowly,

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:04.470
it will droop because of
gravity, but if you spin it

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:07.570
fast enough, r omega squared
is a lot bigger than g.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.320
And the thing flattens
out, and the blades

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.510
are going around and around.

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:14.990
The natural frequency
of that system

01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:18.762
is exactly the rotation rate.

01:15:18.762 --> 01:15:23.050
A uniform blade pivot at the
center, going around fast,

01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:24.740
has a natural
frequency like this.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.340
It happens to be exactly
at the rate of rotation.

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:32.760
So any perturbation will
start it doing bad things.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.290
Helicopters are never
ever designed like that.

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:40.930
The helicopter has a
rotor disk in here,

01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:43.250
has a finite radius
before the pin,

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.270
and then the blades
are out here.

01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:49.160
The pin around which-- and
that changes the resonance

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.060
frequency.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.800
And of course, you can
change the mass distribution

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.110
in the blade and so forth.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.254
So what they had
done in that case

01:15:58.254 --> 01:16:00.670
to rig it so the thing beat
itself to death, I don't know.

01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:03.770
But there's good design
practices with helicopters

01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:08.255
so that the blade frequency
is not at the rotation rate,

01:16:08.255 --> 01:16:09.838
because at rotation
rate, you're going

01:16:09.838 --> 01:16:13.040
to have a lot of excitation,
hitting turbulence in the air

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.460
and so forth.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:16.960
Yeah?

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.900
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that you use something

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.370
like this in the
Hancock Building,

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:23.820
but I would imagine that the
wind force on the Hancock

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.740
Building does not have a
uniform frequency all the time.

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:31.660
So is the idea that
[INAUDIBLE] control

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.620
based on resonant
frequency [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:40.769
PROFESSOR: I've forgotten
the correct name now,

01:16:40.769 --> 01:16:42.560
even though I've used
these many times now.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.740
The optimally tuned and
damped dynamic absorber

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:56.610
is sort of the second level
of dynamic absorber design.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.590
Typically, a two degree
of freedom system

01:16:58.590 --> 01:17:01.330
looks like that if
it's lightly damped,

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:06.000
but you can design that second
mass spring and a damper

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.200
so that you can make
the transfer function,

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:18.950
H11 here, look like
this, where you

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:24.910
get the two peaks are of
equal height, and the worst--

01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:27.910
and you can design them so
that the worst case amplitude

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:29.490
response over here
is pretty low.

01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:40.660
x1 static is square
root of 1 over 1

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.230
plus mu or something like that.

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:47.250
So the bigger you make this,
the better the performance,

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:50.410
but you have to have
optimum damping,

01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:52.860
and you have to
have optimum tuning.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:18:00.410
And tuning means, if
the there were-- we

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:05.010
tune this thing
so that k2/m2 was

01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:10.470
exactly equal to a particular
frequency, in this case k1/n1.

01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:14.070
But for the optimally tuned
and damp dynamic absorber,

01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:17.820
you actually tune things-- it's
tuned a little differently.

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.590
You put damping in
it, and you make

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:23.440
it behave pretty well
over the entire frequency,

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.980
range rather than almost
perfect at one frequency.

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:35.440
And the Hancock Building had its
transfer function, so to speak,

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.720
without the dynamic absorber--
it has many, many peaks,

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:45.450
but it had two problematic ones
that were very close together,

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:55.089
and they were at about 0.8
radians per second, and 0.81,

01:18:55.089 --> 01:18:55.630
or something.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:59.115
And this was bending,
and this was torsion.

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:06.660
And at these two resonances--
and the wind would come along,

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.561
and it would excite
both of them.

01:19:08.561 --> 01:19:10.810
And the one resonance was
just the same as this thing.

01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:12.890
It just bends.

01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:15.720
And the other resonance was
the first mode in torsion.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.095
So if you were standing on one--
and a building cross section

01:19:19.095 --> 01:19:21.530
is a funny-- the
Hancock Building

01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:23.390
looks kind of like
that in cross section,

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:31.660
and so it would rotate in
torsion and deflect in bending.

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:36.090
So it would be rotating
and deflecting,

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:37.900
and if they were
in equal amounts

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:41.910
and they're close in frequency,
if you're standing up there,

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.450
what would you feel?

01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:45.700
They would beat.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:46.630
The motion would beat.

01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:49.369
You'd get a lot of
motion, because if you

01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:50.910
are on one end of
the building, you'd

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:54.040
get a lot of torsional
motion out here combined

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.296
with the bending motion.

01:19:55.296 --> 01:19:57.170
And then they would
cancel, and then the beat

01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:58.970
would build up again.

01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:02.540
And so that was what was
happening in the building.

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:12.140
And they put in two, so on
the 58th floor on each end

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:20.640
they put in a mass spring system
and over here another one so

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.199
that they would resist
the torsion-- actually,

01:20:23.199 --> 01:20:24.740
really I lined them
up the wrong way.

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.850
They line up this way.

01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:28.570
So it has two of them.

01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:32.590
They can resist both the
bending and the torsion.

01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:37.300
They each weigh
300 tons, and they

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.410
it's a box filled up with
50 pound lead bricks.

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:46.240
And the box is about-- it's been
20 years since I was up there,

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.540
but what I recall is this
like 8 by 10 feet yea tall.

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:55.400
And it slides on a pressurized
oil film, and the spring on it

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.360
is a big pneumatic
spring, a big air spring,

01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.910
and a computer runs
the whole system.

01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:02.910
It's shut down until the wind
gets above 40 miles an hour,

01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:04.720
and then turns it on.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.390
And it's actually
kind of self tuning.

01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:08.540
It can optimize itself,
and then it'll sit there,

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:11.740
and it's designed to do this,
because this building has

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:14.750
these two problem frequencies.

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:19.410
And so it has been designed
to address both of them.

01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:26.505
All right, I think I have to get
out of here for the next class.

01:21:26.505 --> 01:21:27.380
See you next Tuesday.

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.834
Last lecture.
