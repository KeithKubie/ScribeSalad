hey Bill my name is Thomas and I'm from

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540
hey Bill my name is Thomas and I'm from
 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.240
hey Bill my name is Thomas and I'm from
Los Angeles California and I was

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250
Los Angeles California and I was
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.520
Los Angeles California and I was
wondering if mathematics is truly

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
wondering if mathematics is truly
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.339
wondering if mathematics is truly
universal I'm not disputing it I'm just

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
universal I'm not disputing it I'm just
 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.670
universal I'm not disputing it I'm just
really wondering if mathematics such as

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
really wondering if mathematics such as
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.890
really wondering if mathematics such as
calculus really like is the same near

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
calculus really like is the same near
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.620
calculus really like is the same near
the edges of the universe for all that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
the edges of the universe for all that
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.859
the edges of the universe for all that
we know or like near black holes does

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
we know or like near black holes does
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.209
we know or like near black holes does
Masum do mathematical laws break down

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219
Masum do mathematical laws break down
 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.610
Masum do mathematical laws break down
thanks Thomas that is a great question

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
thanks Thomas that is a great question
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.330
thanks Thomas that is a great question
about mathematics as far as we know it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
about mathematics as far as we know it
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.360
about mathematics as far as we know it
works everywhere now whatever if we go

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
works everywhere now whatever if we go
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090
works everywhere now whatever if we go
to a place as you suggested near a black

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
to a place as you suggested near a black
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.090
to a place as you suggested near a black
hole the edge of the universe and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100
hole the edge of the universe and
 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.310
hole the edge of the universe and
mathematics doesn't work we would say to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
mathematics doesn't work we would say to
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290
mathematics doesn't work we would say to
ourselves well there's just mathematics

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
ourselves well there's just mathematics
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569
ourselves well there's just mathematics
that we don't understand and we have to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
that we don't understand and we have to
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.380
that we don't understand and we have to
add some more more math to our to our

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390
add some more more math to our to our
 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.990
add some more more math to our to our
Canon of mathematical equations it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
Canon of mathematical equations it's
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090
Canon of mathematical equations it's
very reasonable that there's math that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
very reasonable that there's math that
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820
very reasonable that there's math that
nobody knows how it works but just

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
nobody knows how it works but just
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.039
nobody knows how it works but just
understand that when it comes to the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
understand that when it comes to the
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.719
understand that when it comes to the
motion of planets when it comes to how

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729
motion of planets when it comes to how
 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.520
motion of planets when it comes to how
Rockets work when it comes to the paths

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
Rockets work when it comes to the paths
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.149
Rockets work when it comes to the paths
of comets and asteroids meteors we

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
of comets and asteroids meteors we
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399
of comets and asteroids meteors we
understand this stuff inside out however

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
understand this stuff inside out however
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.910
understand this stuff inside out however
it was only in the 1600s that these

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
it was only in the 1600s that these
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.730
it was only in the 1600s that these
discoveries were made and so you'll also

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
discoveries were made and so you'll also
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.609
discoveries were made and so you'll also
hear people talk all the time about the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
hear people talk all the time about the
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.999
hear people talk all the time about the
singularity the singularity and this is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
singularity the singularity and this is
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.330
singularity the singularity and this is
to me is when you get one over zero and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
to me is when you get one over zero and
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.499
to me is when you get one over zero and
one over zero is infinite or it is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
one over zero is infinite or it is
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.719
one over zero is infinite or it is
unknowable and I'll give you an example

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729
unknowable and I'll give you an example
 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.179
unknowable and I'll give you an example
what's what's 1,000 what's bigger one

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
what's what's 1,000 what's bigger one
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.840
what's what's 1,000 what's bigger one
tenth or one thousandth a tenth is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
tenth or one thousandth a tenth is
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.080
tenth or one thousandth a tenth is
bigger than a thousandth okay then

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
bigger than a thousandth okay then
 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.459
bigger than a thousandth okay then
what's bigger one thousandth or one ten

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
what's bigger one thousandth or one ten
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.999
what's bigger one thousandth or one ten
thousandth a thousandth is bigger all

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
thousandth a thousandth is bigger all
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.550
thousandth a thousandth is bigger all
right now what about one over one ten

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
right now what about one over one ten
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.060
right now what about one over one ten
thousandth that's 10,000 but one over

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070
thousandth that's 10,000 but one over
 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.980
thousandth that's 10,000 but one over
one-millionth is a million one over a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
one-millionth is a million one over a
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.170
one-millionth is a million one over a
billion thisa billion so as the number

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
billion thisa billion so as the number
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.020
billion thisa billion so as the number
gets smaller and smaller the total the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
gets smaller and smaller the total the
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.670
gets smaller and smaller the total the
inverse the the denominator causes the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
inverse the the denominator causes the
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.610
inverse the the denominator causes the
total of the quantity to become bigger

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
total of the quantity to become bigger
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.850
total of the quantity to become bigger
and so if it's over zero it would become

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
and so if it's over zero it would become
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.760
and so if it's over zero it would become
infinity or infinite and nobody knows

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770
infinity or infinite and nobody knows
 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.530
infinity or infinite and nobody knows
what happens at infinity no one knows

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
what happens at infinity no one knows
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.080
what happens at infinity no one knows
what happens exactly at the singularity

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090
what happens exactly at the singularity
 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.100
what happens exactly at the singularity
oh-hoh people speculate oh but yeah as

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
oh-hoh people speculate oh but yeah as
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.570
oh-hoh people speculate oh but yeah as
near as we can tell math applies

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580
near as we can tell math applies
 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.070
near as we can tell math applies
everywhere that is a great question

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
everywhere that is a great question
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.010
everywhere that is a great question
thank you
