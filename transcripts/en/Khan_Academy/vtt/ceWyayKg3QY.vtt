00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.860
- [Instructor] What we are
going to do in this video

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.620
is talk a little bit about
experiments in science

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.060
and experiments are really the heart

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.050
of all scientific progress.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.080
If you think about,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.540
let's just say this represents
just baseline knowledge

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.560
and then people have hunches in the world

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.810
and for a lot of times people say, hey,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.230
I have a hunch that that
thing is good for you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.120
or that thing is good for you

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.820
but they really had no way of measuring

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.233
how confident they were.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.560
They really had no good way of proving it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.930
and even more, because they
had no good way of proving it,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.110
it was hard for people to
build on top of that knowledge

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070
but with the scientific
method and experiments,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.620
people were able to say, hey,
we have a hypothesis here

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.150
and we were able to do some
well-designed experiments

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.020
and so we feel pretty
good that this is true

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.640
and then future people are going to say,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.190
hey, since we feel pretty
good that this is true,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.170
maybe we can design experiment
to see whether that is true.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.510
Hey, that actually is true and
then they can build on that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.630
and we end up having scientific progress

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.460
that can accumulate over hundreds of years

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.260
and this is really important

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.930
that the experiments are well-designed

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.470
because in the future and
this happens all the time,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.810
we might realize that hey,
actually there was a little,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.880
a few assumptions baked in
here that weren't accurate

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
that allowed us to make
essentially misleading conclusions.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.180
So our conclusion wasn't quite right there

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.910
and then we will have to
rebuild from that point

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.230
in order to make sure that
we are truly making progress.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.340
So the key question is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.440
how do we set up well-designed experiments

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.020
and it's a whole field of study

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.440
but the whole purpose of this video

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.450
is to really give an introduction to it.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.370
So let's just start with a hypothesis.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.860
Let's say that you have a hypothesis

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.860
that some pill that is made up
of the petals of some flower,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.210
that this pill right
over here, it improves,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.663
it improves running, running speed.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360
It improves running speed
if someone were to take it.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.720
So the important thing of any hypothesis,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.800
it has to be testable

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.160
and so what you do is you have to think

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.320
well, how am I going to test it?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.570
Well, what you can do,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.660
so how are you going to
test your hypothesis?

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.840
At first, you might say, give the pill,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.840
so give the pill to some runners,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.330
to some runners and test their time,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.400
test their 100 meter time,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.400
test their 100 meter time before the pill,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.320
before the pill and after

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.830
and you might say, hey,
maybe if, I don't know,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.990
their times improve after,
maybe my hypothesis is correct.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.200
Pause this video and see
if you feel comfortable

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.580
with this test right over
here, this experiment.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.490
Well, actually, there's several problems

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.750
with this experiment.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.230
How are you selecting these runners

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.440
and if you give them the pill
and their speed improves,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.870
did it truly improve because of the pill

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.780
or did it improve because
of some other thing

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.613
that they are doing?

00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:13.850
Maybe they got new shoes

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.130
or maybe their diet improved in some way

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.890
or maybe they just had a
psychological improvement.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.240
This is often known as the placebo effect.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.340
If people are taking something

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.610
that they think will help
them, it often will help them

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.650
even if that thing is
just an empty capsule

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.440
or just a sugar tablet.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.750
So how do you avoid these types of errors?

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.590
Well, what you could do
is you can find runners

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.030
and put them into two groups.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.030
So let's say this is one
group right over here

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.050
and then this is another group
and what you would wanna do

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.000
is you'd wanna go into
the population of people

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.930
and you would want to randomly select

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.660
whether someone goes into
one group or another group.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.830
Why random?

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.120
Because if you don't randomly select,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.690
there's a chance that there
might be some implicit bias

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.360
that you might just happen
to be picking people

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.640
who maybe their running speed
is on an upward trajectory

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.570
and they just happen to go into the group

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.060
that will eventually get the pill.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.770
So you randomly, randomly
put them in those groups

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.250
and what you wanna do is
you'll have a control group

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.240
and you'll have a group
that gets your pill

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.240
and so this group gets
the pill, gets the pill

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.540
and now you might be tempted
for this group to say,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.090
oh, they don't get a pill and
then after a few months of it

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.950
and it should be the same amount of time,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.830
you say, hey, did this
group's times improve

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.880
over the 100 meters?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.890
How did that compare to this group?

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.200
But be very careful.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.480
If this group gets the pill
and this group gets nothing

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.940
then the pill might be providing
that placebo effect again

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.860
just making people think
they're getting something

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.700
that's making 'em faster.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.520
It might actually be a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.920
So it's actually important

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.290
that you also give these people a pill

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.270
although this pill would
just look like a pill

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.980
so this would be just an
empty, empty, empty pill

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.480
that looks the same.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.050
Now, there's another idea

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.240
when you're designing
scientific experiments

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.530
that it needs to be double blind.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.440
Let me write this down.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.680
Double blind.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.950
So as you could imagine,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.970
it implies that two things are blind here.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.520
So the first thing that needs to be blind

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.380
is the people themselves

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.110
should not know which group
they're getting put into.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.370
They should not know
which pill they are taking

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.640
because obviously, if you
put someone in this pill,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.390
in this group and you say, hey,
you're in the control group,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.210
we're just gonna give you an empty pill,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.810
well, then the placebo
effect might not be,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.300
it might not work.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.150
It's also important
'cause it's double blind

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.100
that the people who are
working with the runners,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.330
the people who are measuring them

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.030
so that the researcher is right over here

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.070
so I'll draw someone with a clipboard.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.140
So the researchers who
are observing these people

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.500
and maybe administering the pill

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.100
and telling them about the experiment

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.940
that they too do not know

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.860
which group they are administering it to

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.020
because if they did, they might
be able to signal somehow.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.730
They might be able to even subconsciously

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.970
give a sense of which group folks are in

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.890
and so let's say we do all of these things

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.190
and so we're getting in the direction

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.920
of a well-designed experiment

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.920
and we find that the
10 people in this group

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.900
versus the 10 people in this
group after three months,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.130
these folks had a 5%
improvement in running speed

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.260
and these people had a 10%
improvement in running speed.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.650
Is that enough to conclude
that our hypothesis is correct?

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.660
Well, you might be tempted,
it seems suggestive

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.910
but that's where
statistics come into order

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.110
because there's just some random
chance that you got lucky,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.820
that you happened to pick the people that,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.890
your pill does nothing

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.660
but you just happened to pick the people

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.510
who are going to improve more

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.160
and there's a whole field
of inferential statistics

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.640
when you take a statistics course

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.260
that will go in more depth into this

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.880
but essentially, what you're
gonna do is you're gonna say,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.320
hey, assume that your pill does nothing,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.290
what's the probability of
getting this result for 10 people

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.360
or what's the probability

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.740
of getting this difference in result

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.890
and if that probability is very low,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.900
well, you say, hey, that would suggest

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.670
that my pill actually does do something.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.670
Now, another important principle
of an experiment like this

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.460
is it needs to be replicable, replicable

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.040
because even though you
thought you did a good job,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.620
people might not wanna
take your word for it

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.750
and it's important in science
for people to be skeptical.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.650
When people do experiments,
they want to have a result

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.880
and that bias might creep in

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.920
and so if someone else does an experiment,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.640
you need to say how
you did that experiment

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.060
so other people can see if
they get the same results

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.360
because even though you
think you randomly selected,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.830
you might only do it with
people from a certain country

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.780
or under certain weather conditions

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.900
or assuming other constraints

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.620
and then these people might
do it slightly differently

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.410
or in a different country or
under different constraints

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.660
and realize that hey,
the explanation for this

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.020
maybe was something else.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.350
Another thing to keep in mind

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.070
is the larger your
samples right over here,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.080
the larger groups that
you're able to do this with,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.330
the stronger that the
statistics actually become

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.840
and I would say not just larger

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.970
but the more diverse across genders,

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.880
across ethnicities, across geographies.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.840
So the big picture here
is all scientific progress

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.180
is based on us designing good experiments

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.670
and being very rigorous

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.040
about how we think about those experiments

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.820
and what I've highlighted
here is just the beginning

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.780
of how we might think about
designing those experiments

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.520
and as you go into your
scientific careers,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.620
look at other people's experiments

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.870
and see whether they've done these things

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.600
because many times you will find

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.723
that it is not as rigorous
as it might seem at first.
