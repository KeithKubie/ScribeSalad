00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.060
Are you feeling overwhelmed from work,
struggling to stay on top of all your classes?

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.760
Maybe everything is happening all at once.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.900
They say that when it rains it pours.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.510
When you're feeling low, it's easy to convince
yourself to stay there.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.119
After all, how can you fall when you're already
on the ground?

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.279
Nevertheless, your heart wants to heal so
give it what it wants.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.510
Help yourself get back on your feet with these
five self-care tips when you're feeling broken.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.489
One; step outside for some fresh air.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.980
Our thoughts can be even louder than the ruckus
of busy cities.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.620
Whether you're still a student in school or
constantly working in front of a computer,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.290
it's easy to feel congested by deadlines,
projects and never-ending tasks.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.520
Make use of your mornings, lunch breaks and
evenings when you're off the clock to step

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.100
outside for walks.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.280
This will help clear your head and improve
your mood.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.280
In Japan, going for walks in the woods is
called shinrin-yoku, which means taking in

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.240
the atmosphere of the forest.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.000
In one study at Kyoto University, researchers
discovered that the scent of fresh pine helps

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.909
reduce one's levels of anxiety and depression.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.340
Spending time outdoors also helps improve
our concentration.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.670
We aren't meant to experience life in stuffy
bubbles, even if you can't step outside right

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.750
away, crack open a window when you can and
allow nature to heal you.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.220
Two; take a nap.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.759
When we don't get enough sleep, our moods
can take a turn for the worse and spiral down

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.520
into an endless abyss.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.759
If you're feeling cranky from exhaustion,
take some time, even if it's just half an hour

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.690
to curl up on the couch and close your eyes.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.710
There's no shame in closing the curtains,
flicking off the lights and allowing yourself

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.140
to recharge.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.950
Once you wake up, you'll feel better rested
and you'll make up for lost time by carrying

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.149
out your daily tasks with a fresh and sharp
mind.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.740
Three; allow yourself to be ordinary. We are
all perfectly imperfect.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.900
Take a break from using Instagram filters
and Facebook posts that show your life only

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.450
at its best.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.920
Social media is a place where we can share
our favorite moments with others but it has

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.650
also become a platform where people feel pressured
to compete with others.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.240
Sometimes, it feels more like a beauty pageant
instead of a second home.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.790
You don't owe anyone a performance.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.340
Your sense of self is worth more than a digitalized
reputation, embrace your flaws and allow yourself

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.010
to be average, simple and sincere is always
better.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.750
Four; clean and give your space a makeover.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.550
Cleaning doesn't have to be overly excessive
to make a difference. Whether it means organizing

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.840
your bookshelf or clipping your favorite photos
onto the wall, changes, big or small can enhance

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.400
the atmosphere.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.530
After all, you spend a lot of time in your
space.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.930
Giving it some love and attention can go a
long way.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.409
Five; reach out and tell someone about what
you've been going through. Feeling down often

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.160
leads to shutting down.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.470
We fear burdening others and as this develops
into a habit, we suffer silently making it

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.190
harder to heal.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.760
Don't feel ashamed about your struggles, sometimes
you just need someone to hear your story.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.060
You'd be surprised with how much people understand
you.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.080
As a bonus, you'll also end up strengthening
your relationships.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.459

you feel broken?
