Translator: Jenny Zurawell

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:16.306
I am Awele.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.999
Daughter of Alice, granddaughter of Ruth,

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:24.152
great-granddaughter
of Big Momma Alice and Madir Corine,

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:28.660
great-great-granddaughter
of Anna and Zitii Benyen.

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:32.320
It is my hope

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:36.646
to find my best possible self
in the service of others.

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:41.192
Now, my daddy, he used to tell me stories.

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:43.004
My daddy, he would say,

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:45.652
"I want you to know who you are
and where you come from.

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:48.995
That will guide you as you discover

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.468
who you must be.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.627
Now, you listen to this story,
you hear me, baby girl?

00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:55.152
It's not going to be in a book.

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:56.969
Your teacher is not going to tell it,

00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:59.861
but you need to understand who you are."

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:02.363
That became a guiding principle

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:04.295
in the stories that I wanted to tell.

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.288
Stories about legacy of who we are.

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:12.356
I used to hear all the time
that children are the future,

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:15.054
but what does that clichÃ© really mean

00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:16.507
and how are we preparing them?

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:19.991
So I looked for narratives
about young people

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.440
and the legacy that they bring
as agents of change.

00:01:23.464 --> 00:01:25.565
The power that you have right now.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.459
Today, March 2, 1955 --

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:32.847
the story that I want to share with you

00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:36.112
comes from 1955, March 2.

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:39.053
It's about a courageous 16-year-old girl,

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:41.044
Claudette Colvin.

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:43.184
And it comes full circle today

00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:45.708
because a week ago today,
in San Francisco,

00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:47.473
my middle school students,

00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:50.048
they performed a program
that I had written,

00:01:50.072 --> 00:01:51.857
"Agents of Change,"

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:54.521
starting with the reenactment
of Plessy v. Ferguson

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:57.568
from 1892 to 1896,

00:01:57.592 --> 00:02:00.441
moving to Brown v. Board
and a student-led strike

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:02.454
by Barbara Rose Johns,

00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:06.047
jumping to Claudette Colvin
and the Montgomery Bus Boycott

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:09.637
and ending in 1960
with the Sit-In Movement,

00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.596
the non-violent movement led by students.

00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:16.276
So I'm going to share the story,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.158
and I would like to also share
the work I do with it,

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:20.574
as a case study.

00:02:23.403 --> 00:02:25.515
I paid my dime at the front of the bus,

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.539
and then I ran to the back door

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:29.319
with the rest of the colored kids

00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:32.110
so the driver wouldn't take off
before we got on.

00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:36.398
Also, well, whites don't want us
walking down the aisle next to them.

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:38.402
When I got back on the bus,

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:39.791
colored section was full,

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:42.755
so, I sat in the middle section.

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.557
I took the last row seat on the left,

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.207
it was right by the window,

00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:48.755
wasn't thinking
about anything in particular.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.478
"Hey."

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:55.804
I didn't know the girl
next to me either, this older girl.

00:02:55.828 --> 00:02:57.536
So I just looked out the window.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.816
Driver went more stops,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.514
more people were getting on,
colored and white.

00:03:01.538 --> 00:03:04.122
Pretty soon, no more seats were available.

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:06.256
"Give me those seats,"
the driver called out.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.106
Colored folks just started getting up.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.996
White folks started taking their seats,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.209
but I stayed seated.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.572
Girl next to me
and the other two across --

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:14.758
they stayed seated.

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:17.873
I knew it wasn't the restricted area.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.364
"Make light on your feet!"

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:21.057
Girl next to me got up immediately.

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:23.778
She stood in the aisle,
then the other two girls.

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.853
But I told myself,
this isn't the restricted area.

00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:29.469
The driver, he looked up,

00:03:29.493 --> 00:03:31.059
looked in the window,

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:32.283
that mirror.

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:34.226
He pulled over.

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:37.137
A pregnant lady, Mrs. Hamilton,
got on the bus.

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:39.141
She ran to the back and got on,

00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:42.174
not knowing he was trying
to have me relinquish my seat.

00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:44.457
And she sat right next to me.

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:47.311
"The two of you need to get up
so I can drive on."

00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:50.684
"Sir, I paid my dime, I paid my fare.

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:52.875
It's my right, you know,
my constitutional --"

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.912
"Constitutional?
Ha-ha, let me get the police."

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:00.416
Well he got off and he flagged down
two motormen, and they came.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.176
And those motormen,
they came onto the bus.

00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:05.737
Looked at Mrs. Hamilton.

00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:08.714
"Now the two of you need to get up
so the driver can drive on."

00:04:08.738 --> 00:04:11.969
"Sir, I paid my dime. I'm pregnant.

00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:15.485
If I were to move right now,
I'd be very sick, sir."

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.041
"Sir, I paid my dime too,
you know, and it's my right,

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:19.649
my constitutional right.

00:04:19.673 --> 00:04:21.341
I'm a citizen of the United States.

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:24.532
You just read the 13th
and 14th Amendment, it'll tell you so.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:27.209
I know the law. My teacher,
she taught it at school."

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.522
You see, my teacher,
she taught the Constitution,

00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:32.011
the Bill of Rights,
the Declaration of Independence,

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:34.444
Patrick Henry's speech --
I even memorized it.

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:38.634
My teacher, she would prick our minds,

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:40.439
trying to see what we thinking about.

00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:43.223
She would say, "Who are you? Hmm?

00:04:43.247 --> 00:04:45.384
Who are you, sitting right here right now?

00:04:45.408 --> 00:04:48.956
The person that people think they see
from your outside?

00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:51.618
Who are you on the inside? How you think?

00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:53.649
How you feel? What you believe?

00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:56.304
Would you be willing to stand up
for what you believe in

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:59.512
even if someone wants to hold you back
because you're different?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:03.089
Do you love your beautiful
brown skin, children? Hmm?

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.319
Are you American?

00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:08.668
What does it mean to be an American? Huh?

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:12.803
Homework tonight, write me an essay:
"What does it mean to be an American?"

00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:14.740
You need to know who you are, children!"

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:18.001
My teacher, she would teach us
history and current events.

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:21.376
She said that's how we can understand
everything that's going on

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.499
and we can do something about it.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:27.276
"Sir, all I know is I hate Jim Crow.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.768
I also know if I ain't got nothing
worth living for,

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:33.241
I ain't got nothing worth dying for.
So give me liberty or give me death!

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:35.677
Ouch! I don't care! Take me to jail."

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.693
They dragged her off the bus.

00:05:37.717 --> 00:05:41.212
Next thing, Claudette Colvin
was in a car seat,

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:42.793
backseat of the police car,

00:05:42.817 --> 00:05:45.803
handcuffed through the windows.

00:05:48.508 --> 00:05:50.048
The following year,

00:05:50.072 --> 00:05:52.745
May 11, 1956,

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:56.278
Claudette Colvin was the star witness

00:05:56.302 --> 00:05:58.848
in the federal court case
Browder v. Gayle.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.204
Her, an 18-year-old teenager

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:05.651
and two others, women, Mrs. Browder.

00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:12.446
Their case, Browder v. Gayle,
went up to the supreme court.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.290
On the heels of Brown
v. Board of Education,

00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:19.173
the 14th Amendment
and her powerful testimony that day,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.534
the rest is history.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:27.062
Now, why is it we don't know this story?

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.467
The Montgomery Bus Boycott --

00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.658
we hear Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King,

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.733
they will forever be lifted up.

00:06:32.757 --> 00:06:35.553
But the role women
played in that movement,

00:06:35.577 --> 00:06:40.096
the role of Claudette, as an up-stander,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.224
it teaches us important lessons
that challenge us today.

00:06:44.853 --> 00:06:47.700
What does it mean to be a participant?

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.244
A responsible citizen in a democracy?

00:06:52.172 --> 00:06:54.864
And lessons of courage and of faith?

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:59.383
So I find freedom movement history
that includes young people

00:06:59.407 --> 00:07:01.745
so that they can explore these big ideas

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:04.894
of identity, your chosen identity,

00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:07.035
and the imposed identity.

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.088
What does membership in society mean?

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:11.659
Who has it? How do we make amends?

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:15.846
Race and violence in America,

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.171
as well as participatory citizenship.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.946
So these stories allow me
to have conversations,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.276
to speak the unspeakable,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.151
that many are afraid to have.

00:07:29.175 --> 00:07:30.841
Once in Eugene, Oregon,

00:07:30.865 --> 00:07:33.772
a young, blond-haired,
blue-eyed boy, middle schooler,

00:07:33.796 --> 00:07:36.087
at the end of a performance
in the dialogue said,

00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:38.118
"But Ms. Awele, racism's over, right?"

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And not wanting to answer for him, I said,

00:07:41.024 --> 00:07:44.755
"Turn to the person sitting next to you.
See if you can come up with evidence."

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.868
And I gave them four minutes to talk.

00:07:46.892 --> 00:07:50.015
Soon, they began to tell stories,

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:53.251
evidence of racism in their community.

00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.622
A girl wrote to me,
a high school student in San Francisco:

00:07:57.646 --> 00:07:58.953
"I was going to skip school

00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:01.976
but then I heard
we had an assembly, so I came.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.420
And after listening to the students talk

00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:06.565
and seeing your performance,

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:08.471
I thought I should organize my friends

00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:10.936
and we should go down to a board meeting

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.287
and tell them that want
to have advanced classes

00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:15.001
for A through G requirements."

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:20.570
So, I tell you this story today

00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:23.803
in honor of the legacy of young people
that have come before,

00:08:23.827 --> 00:08:26.678
so that they will have
guideposts and signs

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:30.754
to be the change
that they want to see in this world,

00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:32.683
as Claudette Colvin was.

00:08:32.707 --> 00:08:35.280
Because she struck down
the constitutionality

00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:37.494
of segregated seats

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:39.419
in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:08:40.097 --> 00:08:41.248
Thank you.

00:08:41.272 --> 00:08:46.991
(Applause)

00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:48.832
Thank you.

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:53.186
(Applause)
