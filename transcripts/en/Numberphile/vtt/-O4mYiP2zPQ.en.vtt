00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.180
Our calendar is just a mess.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.460
It's a very complicated mismatch
of different cycles

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.600
and different lengths of time.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.130
And every once in a while, we
have to make an adjustment to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.410
those lengths of time to
make things match.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.710
And one way we do that is every
once in a while adding

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.200
an extra day to our calendar.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.375
And that extra day
is February 29.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.850
When we have an extra day, we
call that year a leap year.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.540
So there are two fundamental
units of time that we use that

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.020
are tied to actual,
physical events.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.110
One is the day, and that's the
time it takes for the Earth to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.940
make one rotation
around its axis.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.110
The other is the year, and
that's the time it takes the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.970
Earth to make one revolution in
its orbit around the Sun.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.370
Every other unit we use-- the
week, the second, the hour--

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.730
is fairly arbitrary, but those
two are tied to actual,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.040
physical events.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.380
In a more well-behaved universe,
our calendar would

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.550
be a lot easier to deal with
if 365 of these exactly

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.190
matched one of those.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.770
But of course, that's not
the way it works.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.280
Actually, our year is made up
of about 365 and 1/4 days.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.990
That means that every time the
Earth had gone around the Sun

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.770
once, it's actually rotated
365 and 1/4 times.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.190
If we rotate 365 and 1/4 times
every year, but we're only

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.480
counting 365 of them in a year,
that means every four

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.700
years, we've got an extra day
that hasn't appeared in our

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.010
calendar, so we have
to put it back in.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.410
And that's where February
29 comes in.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.410
But that's not quite enough.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.270
The number of days
in a year is not

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.250
exactly 365 and 6 hours.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.570
It's 365, 5 hours, 49 minutes,
and 16 seconds.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.250
That means if we do what I just
said, by the end of 100

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.900
years, we've accumulated too
much time in our calendar, and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.250
now we need to take
a full day away.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.570
So every 100 years, on a year
that would've been a leap year

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.910
going by the four-year rule, we
skip one, and we take away

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.020
that extra day.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.100
So every time the year is
divisible by 100-- that means

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.650
1900, 2000, 2100--

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.220
we skip the leap year.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.810
And so, on those years,
February has 28

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.830
days and not 29 days.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.440
Except that's still
not quite right.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.880
There's an extra bit that we
need to correct again, because

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.420
now, every 400 years, we've
missed an extra day.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.430
So now, every 400 years, we
reverse that rule, and we add

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.290
the leap year back in.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.400
So this becomes very
complicated, but the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.810
fundamental rule is for a given
year, if the year's

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.800
divisible by 4, then
it's a leap year.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.000
Unless the year is divisible by
100, in which case it's not

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.110
a leap year.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.950
Unless the year is divisible by
400, in which case it's a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.220
leap year, and we have
February 29.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.760
The mismatch between the
rotation of the Earth and the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.810
revolution around the Sun is
such that that extra amount of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.140
time is taken care of to a
fairly high precision by all

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.160
these actual corrections.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.290
In actual fact, it still means
that we will need an extra

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.220
correction at the end of 3,200
years, but that's not actually

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.270
built into our calendar.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.820
We stop at the end of 400 years
in these corrections.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.890
Astronomers are used to dealing
with all sorts of not

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.060
very convenient measurement
systems.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.990
That's, unfortunately,
the legacy of our

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.610
very historical science.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.590
So we are used to dealing
with this.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.175
And if we need to calculate the
number of days that have

00:03:56.175 --> 00:04:00.250
passed between two dates, it
does become very complicated,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.380
and you have to calculate how
many months, and how many days

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.630
in that month, and whether there
are leap years involved.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.320
We simplify that by using our
own calendar for the passage

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.940
of time known as Julian dates,
and all that is is a single

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.300
number that counts the number
of days that have gone by

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.050
since a very distant
day in the past.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.690
The zero point of that calendar
is Monday, January 1,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.140
4713 BC, 12:00 noon, Greenwich
Mean Time.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.880
And of course, being
here in Nottingham,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.700
that's our time zone.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.430
We're in the same time zone
as the Greenwich meridian.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.370
By that reckoning,
February 29, 2012

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.646
is Julian date 2455987.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:50.088
Yes.

00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:51.440
Got it right.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.070
You can add a decimal place
after that date which records

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.290
purely the decimal fraction of
the day that's gone by, but

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.670
one Julian date is
equal to one day.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.750
So if you hear a Julian date
that ends with a 0.5, that

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.800
means half a day has passed in
addition to the full day that

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.710
it's counting.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.790
Yes, this is going to sound
familiar to a lot of people,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.070
because of course in the Star
Trek universe, you often hear

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.610
"Captain's log, stardate
2455.73," which is a similar

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.210
kind of concept.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.400
But the Star Trek writers and
producers deliberately didn't

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.650
make it an official, fast and
fixed rule as to what a

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.090
stardate meant, so that they
could factor in all the

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.410
different concepts like speed of
travel, and different parts

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.690
the galaxy, and that
sort of thing.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.650
So stardate is not the
same as Julian date.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.420
So normally, I would probably
record the date of an

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.160
observation as April 3, 2010,
something like that, because

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.010
the work I do is not
particularly time-critical.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.210
However, if you're recording
something like a gamma ray

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.630
burst or a periodic event like
the transit of a planet, then

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.830
a Julian date would be given
to a very high precision.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.190
So having just said that I don't
use Julian dates very

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.720
often, here is a paper that I
wrote where I did use it.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.360
So here, I made a plot with
Julian date, but I've

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.060
subtracted all of the large
part of the number just to

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.070
leave the cumulative number
of days here.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.230
And so you can easily see that
we've gone from 545 to 560,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.260
which is 15 days, and that's a
lot easier than saying we've

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.970
gone from January
25 to February

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.990
whatever in that reckoning.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.400
See, I can't even do
it in my head.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.890
So a leap second is the same
kind of concept in the idea

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.380
that it's correcting our
calendars to make things match

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.330
up, but it's not related to
the leap year at all.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.440
It's purely adjusting for the
variable rotation of the Earth

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.150
to make a day last a day.
