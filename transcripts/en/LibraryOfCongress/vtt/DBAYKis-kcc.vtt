00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.850
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.150
&gt;&gt; Amy Argetsinger: Hello.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.430
My name is Amy Argetsinger.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.950
I'm an editor with the Style
Section of "The Washington Post."

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.590
And I'm here to introduce
Carl Hiaasen.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.520
"The Washington Post"
is a charter sponsor

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.420
of the National Book
Festival, which would love

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.230
to have your support, too.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.490
Inside your program
you can find a way

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.550
to give a donation if you'd like.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.160
The Library of Congress has
been the festival's host

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.050
since it began 16 years ago.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.230
We want to thank the co-chairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.900
and the many National Book Festival
sponsors who made this possible

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.840
to have this event in 2016.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.260
There will be time for
questions after this talk.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.160
Mind you, if you come forward
to speak, you will be filmed

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.600
for the library's archive.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.440
So, it's your big chance.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.800 position:56%
A couple years ago the great wits of
the Internet started to have a lot

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.480
of fun with a certain trope
in our culture, Florida Man.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.160
Somehow all the bizarre
crimes/misadventure sagas

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.680
that were making it into
the national news all seemed

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.260
to have the same protagonist:
Florida man arrested

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.220
for shuffleboard rage
attack at senior center.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.650
Florida man jailed for golf cart
DUI at parent's retirement home.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.330
Florida man suspected of stealing
naked Donald Trump statue.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.920
And then, of course, his
sister, Florida woman surprised

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.000
to learn car she set on fire
doesn't belong to her ex-boyfriend.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.730
As funny as this has all
been, the anthropologist

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.930
who actually deserves credit

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.040
for first discovering
Florida Man years before any

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.960
of this hit the Internet
is Carl Hiaasen.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.960 position:56%
A veteran journalist, he has
brought his sharp eye for the quirks

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.920
of Sunshine State denizens
and a sweeping understanding

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.610
of how things really
work there to a series

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.080
of hilarious best-selling
satirical thrillers.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.880
"The New Yorker" once wrote that
Hiaasen has a forensic taste

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.830
for autopsying the ruin
of a once beautiful place.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.590
He wants to find out exactly

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.260
who has made south Florida what it
is today, Newark with palm trees.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.550
And so, in "Tourist Season" we have
a cell of eco-tourists who decide

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.460
that the only way to save Florida
is with a spate of violent killings

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.800
to scare off the tourists.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.310
In "Strip Tease" the climax comes

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.160
in a plucky FBI secretary turned
stripper allures a corrupt

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.910
congressman into a sugar cane field
with a promise of a special dance.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.620
And in "Skinny Dip" the
action is set in motion

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.090
by a corrupt marine biologist
who has been doctoring the stats

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.220
on the Everglades health
for the sake

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.540
of the agri-business
polluters who pay him off.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.330
When he tries to kill his wife
by throwing her overboard,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.220 position:56%
she survives, of course, by clinging
to a floating bale of marijuana.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.190
But Hiaasen has also had a
knack for finding the humanity

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.410
and the poignancy in his somewhat
cracked and warped characters.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.750
In "Lucky You" there is JoLayne
Lucks, his protagonist there, who,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.750
as he wrote, played the same
number she'd played every Saturday

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.270
for five years: 17,
19, 22, 24, 27, 30.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.020
The significance of her
lotto numbers was this:

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.090 position:56%
Each represented an age at which
she had jettisoned a burdensome man.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.580
And he goes on.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.350
And in several very deft sentences
you have not just a portrait

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.930
of JoLayne, but of all
these men in her life.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.170
And going up to at age 30,
JoLayne dumped Lawrence, a lawyer,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.690
her one and only husband.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.060 position:56%
Lawrence had been notified of his
disbarment exactly one week after he

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.570
and JoLayne were married.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.760
But she stuck with
him for almost a year.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.260
JoLayne was fond of
Lawrence and wanted

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.250
to believe his earnest denials
regarding the multiple fraud

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.900
convictions that precipitated
his trouble with the Florida Bar.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.580
While appealing his case,
Lawrence took a job as a toll taker

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.860
on the Beeline Expressway,
a plucky career realignment

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.350
that nearly won JoLayne's heart.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.660
Then one night he was caught
making off with a 30-pound sack

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.410
of loose change, mostly
quarters and dimes.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.410
Carl Hiaasen was raised in the
once rural outskirts of Ft.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.670
Lauderdale and graduated from
the University of Florida.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.940
He joined the "Miami
Herald" as a local reporter

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.150
and has spent the past
40 years there,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.920
later becoming an investigative
reporter.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.670
And he's now a columnist.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.080
Since the 1980s he has
published 15 novels solo,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.150 position:56%
three others with William
Montalbano, five young adult novels,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.340 position:56%
two non-fiction books and three
collections of his "Herald" columns.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.010 position:56%
Two of his books have been made into
movies, including "Strip Tease,"

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.070
which I think we can all agree
should have been Burt Reynolds'

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.250
Oscar role.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.740
And his new novel, of course, if
"Razor Girl" just out this month,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.820
where the protagonist
is Merry Mansfield,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.980
a con artist who makes a living
by intentionally rear-ending cars.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.970
As it happens, there
was a real life story

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.290
that may have inspired
this a few years ago:

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.150
Florida woman causes crash
shaving bikini area while driving.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.510 position:56%
Readers, let me introduce the author
of "Florida Man," Carl Hiaasen.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:27.870
[ Applause ]

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.170
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Thank you.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.750
I hadn't thought of that Burt
Reynolds scene for a while.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.440
Now I'm going to be
sleeping with the lights on.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.750
The -- welcome, first of all.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.320
I bring greetings from Florida
where apparently we're going

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.130
to have some say in
the upcoming election.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.960
We live in terror at least every
four years that we're going

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.050
to have any responsibility, any
influence at all over the election.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.860
We feel, after the year 2000, we
feel lucky they even let us vote.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.920
And we also live in mortal
fear of Russian hackers

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.660
because if you're a Russian
hacker and you're going

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.480
to hack any state's electoral
system, and you're looking at a map

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.150
of the United States,
where would you pick?

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.990
Florida. And we screwed it
up even without any hackers.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.650
So, this -- I'll talk a
little bit about "Razor Girl."

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.840
Ann mentioned the opening
scene, which is unsettling,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.110
but it was based on a real
accident that happened

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.480
down in the Florida Keys.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.470
And this book is set in
the lower Florida Keys.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.400
And it's a place I love.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.780
I lived down in that
area for a while.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.860
My oldest son was working
at the "Herald" at the time.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.780
And wherever he worked he would
send me the sickest clippings he

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.080
could find.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.210
And the sicker they were, the
faster they came into my email box.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.370
And he knew where they
were going to end up.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.340
But this one I mulled over a lot
because this accident happened,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.830
this car full of innocent
tourists --

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.420
if there is such a thing
as innocent tourists --

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.660
was struck from behind by a
motorist traveling at high speed.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.960
Nobody was hurt.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.260
When the cops got there --

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.470
and Florida State troopers have
seen everything you can imagine.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.050
There's nothing that
really shocks them.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.120
But they were shocked when they
walked up to the car and they found

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.210
that this woman had crashed because
she was distracted because she was,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.270
as we said in our family newspaper,

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.420
shaving her bikini
area while driving.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.790
This is a whole -- you
think texting is a problem.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.730
Now you've got a problem.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.960
She had the razor in
her hand and everything.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.160 position:56%
And in real life, in the true story,
the cop of course said to her,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.630
"What in the world are you doing?

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.650
Why are you doing this right now,
of all times to be doing this?"

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.450
And she says, "Well, I've
got a date in Key West.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.760
I want to look good."

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.060
And he said, "Okay.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.330
And who would that be in
the seat next to you?"

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.010
And she goes, "That's my husband."

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.060
So, it's just another
Florida romance, apparently.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.950
I'm used to this sort of thing.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.930
So that's how "Razor Girl" starts.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.420
And except in my book it's not
an accident, it's a staged event.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.090
Because we have another cottage
industry in south Florida.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.390
You may have it here.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.690
I don't know.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.890
But we have people who just crash
into other people for a living.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.360
They crash their cars into other
individuals for a living just

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.990
to get the insurance money, to
settle on the insurance thing.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.370
I mean, it's a hell of a thing.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.150
I mean, when you think about, they
have to be pretty good drivers.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.470
They don't want to get really hurt.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.990
They just want to be able to
wear a little cervical collar

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.820
and get a few bucks out of
State Farm or GEICO or whatever.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.370
It's just -- it seems like
another normal occupation to us.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.570
But I sort of combined all
that and launched the book.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.860
In this book, "Razor Girl" is the
first time I think I've ever --

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.180
well I know -- the first time I've
ever brought back a main character

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.770
or protagonist from
a previous novel.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.670
And that last novel I wrote for
grownups was called "Bad Monkey."

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.650
And there was a guy in
there who had been a cop,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.450 position:56%
a really good cop, down in the keys.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.940
And he lost his badge because of
some personal problems that he had.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.170
And there was an altercation
that took place in front

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.610
of 2,000 cruise ship
passengers debarking.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.240
If you've ever been to Key
West, it was a bad place for him

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.860
to sort of lose his temper.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.940
And he loses his detective badge.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.970
And the sheriff feels kind of
rotten about it and says, "Look it,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.270
I'll get you another job.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.010
But from now on you're going
to be a health inspector.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.260
(What we call roach patrol,
in Florida ) You're going

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.000 position:56%
to be doing restaurant inspections."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.630
And this is not a lateral
move for any police officer.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.990
So, I've got Yancy, poor Yancy
throughout the whole course

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.440
of "Bad Monkey" he loses 30
pounds right away on this new job.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.740
He cannot eat anything.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.340
He's in the back of these kitchens.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:54.290 position:56%
And in Florida, I don't know if
it's like this in DC, but in Florida

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:59.340
because we still have what's
left of our public records law,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.150
all restaurant inspections
are online.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.450
You can look them up.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.440
Now, there's an app you can
actually put on your phone.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.740
Don't do this.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.040
I'm begging you.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.890 position:56%
But you can put it on your phone and
if you're going out to eat at night,

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.900
you can type in the
restaurant you're going to.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.050
And you can view the
last few inspections.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.360
And the inspections in
Florida are extremely detailed

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.220
and meticulously drawn
up in terms of --

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.510
they assign a numerical quality.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.940
For instance, they have
to count up the roaches

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.520
and the mouse droppings
and all this stuff.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.780
So this is -- and by the
way, there is actually --

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.530
this has always mystified me,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.550
because I did a little
bit of research.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.670
The restaurant inspectors
in Florida,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.340
they have separate categories for
dead roaches and live roaches.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:53.250
Now, speaking as a diner, I
don't care if they're moving

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.220
or if they're not moving.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.290
If they're in the key lime
custard, I'm not eating it.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.120
It's just that simple.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.630
But so, this is what I had
Yancy doing all the first novel.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.700
And I felt bad at the end
of "Bad Monkey" in a way

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.850
because he hadn't gotten his
detective badge back yet.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.150
He worked hard.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.850
He saw the big crime, and he
still couldn't get his badge back.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.340
And so I thought I've got to give
him another shot in "Razor Girl."

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.130
And so he's involved.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.450
He's sort of the main -- because
he's swept up in this tornado

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.280
of a personality, the
woman who's driving the car

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.580
in the opening scene.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.980
It all sort of bounces
around after that.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.640
The guy she hits -- she hits the
wrong guy in the opening scene.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:41.670
She's been hired to run into
a car and distract the driver,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.830
which would be very distracting
to come on that scene.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.390
But she has -- there were
two identical rental cars.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.690
And she hit the wrong one.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.030
And the guy she hits is a
Hollywood talent manager who's come

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.450
from California to babysit his
star client, who's promoting --

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.570 position:56%
who's in Key West, Florida promoting
a reality show that he's doing.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.860
And this reality show is sort of a
next generation of "Duck Dynasty,"

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.430
if you can even wrap
your head around that.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.010
And it's called "Bayou Brethren."

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.310
[ Laughter ]

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.940
Yean. "Bayou Brethren."

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.960
And the star is a guy
named Buck Nance.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.650
And he's gone to Key West to do
a little promotion for his show.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.100
Now, he's not really a
redneck because we get,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.180
especially in the South,
we're a little sensitive.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.510
But rednecks exist everywhere.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.810
Every state of the union --

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.430
they have them in Hawaii
you can find rednecks.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.980
But we sort of get the burden of
sort of the redneck stereotype.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.560
And Hollywood reinforces
this person.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.390
And so they decided
-- they do this show.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:47.090 position:56%
They can't -- these guys, Buck and
his brothers are not from Louisiana.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.370
They're not chicken
farmers from Louisiana.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.160
They were a bad accordion
band in Wisconsin.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.670 position:56%
But they had the beard and the look.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.960
And they said, "Do you want to
have your own reality show?"

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.260
And they said, "Sure."

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.800
So they brought in coaches,
you know, redneck coaches,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.480
to sort of teach them how to
run an ATV and shoot a shotgun

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.930
and do whatever Hollywood perceives
rednecks are supposed to be doing.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.080
You know, get the wine
out of the house.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.700
Just beer and the heavy
stuff, the Jack Daniels.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.000
You know, the whole thing.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.310
And now it's a big hit show.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.650
And Buck has gone to Key West.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.650
And the guy, his babysitter,
his manager,

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.030
is not there because he's
gotten in this car accident.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.600
So Buck is left alone in a bar
on the corner of Duvall Street,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.580
I think, and Simonton,
somewhere down in that area.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.560
And so he gets up and he starts
doing his redneck shtick,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.580
which has evolved over the years
into some political commentary

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.500
and religious commentary

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.300
that he feels now qualified
to share with his fans.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.330
Key West, he finds out, he
got some very bad intelligence

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.630
about Key West.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.750
It's not a place where
you tell the kind

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.530
of jokes that Buck likes to tell.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.140
He's appalled by the diversity
that he finds in Key West, Florida.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.850
Because he figures it's the South,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.750
and he's gone as far
south as you can go.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:12.720 position:56%
Yet, there's a rainbow coalition of
people who now want to strangle him.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.910
And he's running through the
streets of Key West, frantically.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.130
I'm trying to lead back to where
Yancy fits in in all of this.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.430
He's running.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.480
And he figures he's identifiable
because he's got this beard.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.480
And so he's afraid for his life.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.650
He runs into an open doorway.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.990
It turns out to be the
kitchen of a restaurant.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.440
And nobody's in the kitchen, but
there's a pair of herb scissors,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.000
those little herb scissors,
sitting there.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.360
And grabs it and begins
hacking furiously

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.630
at his own face, cutting
his beard off.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.010
And it all falls into this vat
of quinoa that is right there.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.450
[ Laughter ]

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:55.250
Yeah. So, Buck finishes
his beard cutting and races

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.780
out into the night and disappears.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.050
And finding him becomes
sort of the mystery.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.460
But in the meantime, the owners of
the restaurant see what's happened.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.810
And then Yancy, who's the main
restaurant inspector is at home,

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.930
minding his own business,
smoking a joint,

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.150
not doing -- and the phone rings.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.260
And it's like a code red.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.560
You've got to get to this --

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.780
you're not going to believe
what's happened to the quinoa.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.080
You've got to get over here.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.370
So, Yancy is then drawn
into the mystery.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:23.280
And from there it rambles on.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.570
I do want to say, I
always try to come up --

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.450
a lot of the stuff in
these novels, obviously,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.360
I just poach from the headlines
or from real life in Florida.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.170
And I try to ratchet
it up a notch or two.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.610
And even more than that.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.910
And you want it to endure.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.610
If you're writing satire
you would like it to endure

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.750
at least a generation, you know,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.140
before it actually
comes true in real life.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.340
So, I had invented Buck Nance
and his whole redneck world.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.300
And in the book he comes face to
face with a real, honest to God,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.930
south Florida redneck who emulates,
worships him, from the show.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.690
And he's looking, he's sort
of looking at his own mirror,

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.630
into sort of the hateful
persona of someone he's created

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.320
by the things he said on his show.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.100
And there's a moment
of revelation there.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.780
And I wrote all this before the
current election cycle started.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.450
I mean, I was done -- I mean, I
was done probably in December,

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.410
maybe January with the
manuscript, I'm guessing.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.130
And, you know, put it to bed.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.430
Off it goes.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.820
And then I turn on the Republican
National Convention in July,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.970
out of Cleveland, Ohio
in the year 2016.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.010
One of the kickoff speakers
is a "Duck Dynasty" dude.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.310
[ Laughter ]

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.670
I'm totally pissed off
because I never dreamed

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.970
of having this character

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.390
that I invented address a
national political convention.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.760
[ Laughter ]

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.730
Of, you know, all the crazy
stuff I have him doing,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.660
my editor in New York would
have said, "What are you doing?

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.960
That'll never happen.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.260
That's nuts.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.000
You can't, you know,
that's slapstick.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.960
That's not satire."

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.410
But that's where we are.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.330
So, that's where we've evolved.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:07.520
And now, as I said, we're --
you know, you look to Florida,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.390 position:56%
which is really truly -- the way
I've always looked at it, I was born

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.110
and raised down there, is if
something's going to go wrong

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.600
in the United States of America,

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.120
it's going to go wrong
in Florida first.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.770
All of us in Florida feel this way.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:24.060
We know. We understand that we
are on the cutting-edge of sort

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.000
of sleaze and depravity
and dysfunction.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.600
And we're proud of it.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.900
We're all in it together.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.200
We get this.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.950
We know. We cope.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.220
The humor is what gets us
through the whole thing.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.620
There's a scene in the book --

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:43.820
I wanted to give Yancy a
kind of a special adversary

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.850
in his day job on the roach patrol.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:51.030
Because it gets old counting the
roach wings and rat droppings.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.660
But there was a real
-- when I was living

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.140
down in the Keys there would
be stories in the paper.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.190
They'd have these sightings
of an animal, a creature.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.880
An exotic creature that had been
brought into the keys and let go.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.280
And it was called a giant
Gambian pouched rat.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.070
And for a writer like
me, it was music to my --

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:14.150
I mean, it was, this was where
I get my literary inspiration.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.860
Not just a regular pouched rat,
but a giant Gambian pouched rat

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.010
that was brought in from
Senegal and Morocco and Gambia.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.300
And there have been sightings
all throughout the Keys.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.600
So I started doing some research

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.580
because I thought this is something
Yancy ought to come face to face

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.850
with in his travels is a
giant Gambian pouched rat.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:35.200
And I made the mistake --
don't do this now, please --

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.950
but I made the mistake of
Googling giant Gambian pouched rat.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.050
It's the largest species
of rat in the world.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:46.050
It grows to about 9 pounds, okay?

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.850 position:56%
And at some point in the '70s
somebody thought it would be a great

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.900
idea to start importing
them into the United States.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:57.830
Because the American -- what the
American pet trade needed was a rat

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.760
that you needed to put on
a leash, it was so big.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.760
And that people would
buy for their kids.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.700
A rat they had to walk like a dog.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.450
Shockingly, it didn't catch on.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.680 position:56%
And so, there were lots of people --

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.240
the Feds stepped in and
actually stopped the importation

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.510
of this gigantic rat.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:23.590 position:56%
And there was a fellow down in the
lower Keys had optimistically bought

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.240
a whole bunch of giant
Gambian pouched rats.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.170
And bred them and had
them all there.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.470
And then the word comes down
you can't sell them anymore.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.770
It's over.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:37.590
And so he did exactly what all
the python owners in Florida do

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.110
when the pets get too big,
is he just opened the cage

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.410
and he said, "Beat it, guys.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.710
Hit the bricks."

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.010
And he let them all go.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.330
And they've tried to
get rid of them.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.690
There are not a lot of them.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.350
There's not a galloping
infestation of these things.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.800
I don't want to give
the wrong impression.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.420
But for the purposes of
literary fiction like mine,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.720
I didn't need a lot of them.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.020
I just needed a couple.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.280
I need a couple big-ass rats.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.360
That's all I needed.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.120
So, there's a scene -- and I think
I handled it pretty tastefully --

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:16.260
where Yancy is summoned to
this restaurant at night.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.160
And the owners have --
the place is vacated.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.810
All the diners, all the
customers have run away

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.290
because they've seen this
creature run through.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.590
This is a restaurant in Key West.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.620
They've seen this creature
running through the dining room.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.160
The screaming and yelling,
they've run.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.330
And of course, it's Key West, so
the owner is saying, "Wait, wait.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.630
It's not what you think it is.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.710
It's just one of Hemingway's cats.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.800
They just got in the back door."

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.650
You know, the Hemingway has all
these 8-toed cats, you know?

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.030
And so nobody bought it.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.000
It's already on Yelp and
TripAdvisor that there's, you know,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.720
a rat the size of a
golden retriever running

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.700
through this frickin' restaurant.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.000
So the owner's in a panic.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.300
They call Yancy.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.600
He shows up.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.160
And all he's got handy for
a weapon is a pitchfork.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.110
And the reason he's
got a pitchfork is --

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.880
and when you leave and you're
in the privacy, some safe place

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.710
and you Google and
you hit Google Images

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.360
of giant Gambian pouched rats,
one of the images that will pop

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.020
onto your screen and horrify you --
and I'm not going to give it away.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.760
There's three elements
to the photograph

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.060
that you're going to be looking at.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.500
There's going to be a man.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.800
There's going to be a giant rat.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.490 position:56%
And there's going to be a pitchfork.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.760
And I'll just leave it at that.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.290
So, anyway, so Yancy's
got a pitchfork.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.010
He goes into the restaurant.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.310
It's dark.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.610
It's a nice, very elegant
restaurant.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.930
And there is a giant
Gambian pouched rat.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.120
And a pursuit ensues.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.260
And the rat, at one point, leaps
from this beautiful mahogany bar,

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.990
leaps in the air, and
dangles very briefly

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.740
from the framed Michelin award

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.120
that the restaurant has won the
previous year for gourmet dining.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.940
And so, that's when I
say tastefully handled.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.850
Because this is how it's
done if you're going to deal

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.950
with giant rats in a book.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.490
And then the rat gets
away and it goes on.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.190
And there's a lot of other really
disturbing stuff in the novel.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.780
This is all kind of physical.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.010
I mean, it's all kind
of psychotherapy for me.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.320
Florida is a constant
fountain of, you know, now --

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.360
I have to say something about
zika mosquitos while we're here.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:24.840
And we have this governor from
Mars who won't allow anyone

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.220
to use the word "climate change"

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.810
or "global warming"
or anything like that.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.160
Anyway, if you've been
watching the news,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.030
and then we're going
to take some questions.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.080
His very first press conference
about the zika mosquitoes,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.920
this neighborhood called
Wynwood in Miami, if you know it.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.430
My granddaughter goes to school

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.840
in the neighborhood, so
I'm familiar with it.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.640
Anyway, that's the first
outbreak is Wynwood.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.510
But he holds a press conference
with a big map behind him.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.640
And this is all about
the tourism, by the way.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.510
This is all about not
scaring tourists away,

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.680
which is what I've been
trying to do for 30 years.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.040
And failed miserably.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.690
But anyway, there's Governor Scott.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.930
And behind him is this graphic.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.370
And the zone is all colored
in, the mosquito zone.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.720
The zika zone.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.030
And I'm looking at
him on the television.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.110
And I noticed that it's
perfectly boundaried

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.070
by here's a highway,
like 54th street.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.140
And it's all -- so
Dixie Highway, whatever.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.860
That's where the mosquitos are.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.160
Please don't worry.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.460
It's all under control.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:26.180
Because, after all, mosquitos
would never cross a highway.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.480
What have they got?

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.220
The National Guard
with like fly swatters?

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.310 position:56%
They're mosquitoes, for God's sakes.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.980
They go wherever they want to.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.010
But it was just the
perfect Florida moment

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.800
where he's saying,
"Don't worry folks.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.480
This is the only place they're at.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.020
And we've got them all cornered.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.190
All six billion of
the little things."

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.730
And the other thing that was great
is they have mosquito trappers

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.030
in Florida.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.480
Mosquito -- that's
like a job in Florida.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.590
Mosquito trapper.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.860
And I always thought that whenever
they were trapping mosquitoes all

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.600
they did was put some big, sweaty
guy out, take his shirt off

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.830
and lay him out there
for about 15 minutes

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.990
and you've got all the
mosquitoes you could possibly.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.940
But no, they've got
little tiny traps.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.240
And they're collecting them.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.020 position:56%
And he said they tested -- tested --

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.900
over 150,000 mosquitoes,
which is nonsense.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.120
I mean, but can you see, you
know, with the -- anyway.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.570
It's so comical.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.830
That's for another
book at another time.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.130
It'll be there.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.240
But anyway, I'm going to take as
many questions as they let me.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.910
And then somebody's going
to bring a hook out.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.530
So we can talk about
whatever you want to.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.090
This book, or any of the
nonsense that's going on.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.180
I know the rat story, this
is what usually works.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.740
The rat story sends them
running for the back

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.120
of the -- I don't blame you.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.510
They're going to go look
up the rat right now.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:45.130
[ Laughter ]

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.430
I can repeat the question
if they don't want to --

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.410
if they don't want to do
the Steve Harvey thing.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.610
I can do that.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.910
You're just numb, aren't you?

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.560
Here comes some timid -- uh oh.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.880
&gt;&gt; Hello. I was wondering
how your guitar is going?

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.180
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: My guitar playing?

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.780
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Oh, you've
gone right into the -- yeah.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.080
No, I haven't touched
a guitar in 10 years.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.130
I used to play with, occasionally,
with Dave Barry's band.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.640
Where Stephen King also played.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.500
And back -- the band that
I used to call Authors

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.110
who Own Musical Instruments.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.270
But I was a terrible guitarist.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.830
In fact, when I performed --

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.680
the Rock Bottom Remainders
was Dave's band when I was

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.900
with them a few times, the few
times that I was with them.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.830
I actually had my guitar teacher
come on stage and stand next to me

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.410
and play and shout out the chords.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.690
Because I couldn't tell what the
hell anyone else was playing.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.200
That's a true story.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.500
Dave thought it was pathetic.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.800
It was pathetic.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.610
But I was [inaudible] I
was going to get up there.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.460
Yes. Hi.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.460
&gt;&gt; Hi. So your books have
wonderfully absurd themes.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.760
And I adore this.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.060
But one of my favorite
things about them is

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.340
that you have the most
creative insults I've ever read.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.710
And I am very curious
about your thought process

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.340
as you come up with some of those.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.970
Very entertaining turns of phrase.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.480
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: They're
not something we want

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.860
to repeat, necessarily.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.600
But yeah. Oh, you mean
some of the profanity?

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.800
Or just the general insult.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.550
&gt;&gt; There were a couple of terms
that were used to describe people

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.190
that were extremely creative.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.530
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: There's
one term that I've used.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.230
And most of the people
here are grownups,

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.530
so I'm going to say it anyway.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.830
What are they going do to me?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.130
I've already got the microphone.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:25.060
That has been embraced
widely, and I don't know why.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.570
It was a term -- I referred to
somebody as a shit weasel one time.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.870
&gt;&gt; That was one of the [inaudible].

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.170
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: That
came, actually,

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:35.840
out of my mouth while I was
driving on I-95 in south Florida.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.670
And it came out of my mouth
while my young son was

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.620
in the car at the time, I believe.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.930 position:56%
And he was so enthusiastic about it.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:49.210
And he felt that I
had achieved something

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.700
that should be shared with readers.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.510
But that's the kind of --
it's just out of my own head.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.200
I don't have any -- it's
nothing literary about this.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.210
It's just, I'm obviously
not a well person.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.880
And these things happen.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.270
I scream and yell a little bit.

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.230
And then sometimes
I write them down.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.600
But thank you for asking.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.900
Yes.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.720
&gt;&gt; Right. Skink.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.290
Was he patterned after a
particular governor of Florida?

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.590
All of them?

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.410
And have ever met a governor of
Florida and referred to Skink?

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.710
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Yeah.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.010
I mean, he wasn't --
Skink was this old,

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.540
and he's been in a
bunch of my novels.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.520
And he at one time had
been a Vietnam War hero.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.820
Come home.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.120
Persuaded to run for governor.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.530
He gets to Tallahassee, discovers
he's like the only honest human

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.220
in the entire area code of
that part of the panhandle.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.800
He goes crazy one day,
rips off his clothes,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.650
runs into the woods
and lives on road kill.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.610
All seemed like a normal
reaction to Tallahassee.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.670
If you've ever been
there, and I can tell you.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.750
But he wasn't modeled --
to answer your question,

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.860
he wasn't modeled on
any real governor.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.290
But I know of a couple former
governors who would tell people --

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.320
and I met a couple of them -- but
who would tell people that they --

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.820
that I modeled Skink on
them, which was so bizarre.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.480
I mean, they were so detached
from reality, these guys.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.080
No. It was one of those
characters you invent

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.790
because you wish there
had been someone like him.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.420
Florida would be better
off if there were.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.680
And there is to this day people
who print up bumper stickers

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.220
down there saying "Reelect Skink."

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.760
And they send me pictures of it.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.060
So that's pretty cool.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.760
&gt;&gt; And I think you've
answered this question.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.620
Could you have set your books, say,
like Indiana or some other state?

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.070
It's got to be Florida.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.270
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: They certainly
have weirdness in every state.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.990
I do get the correspondence.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.410
But I don't think they have -- I
refer to Florida as this great,

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.430
wonderful fountain of sleaze.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.520
And I also because I was
born and raised there,

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.430
I don't know that I would
bring the same perspective,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.080
or the same anger to it.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.990
Because that's basically
where humor comes from is --

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:55.310
the best humor comes from
being pissed off in a deep part

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.290
of yourself about what's happening.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.590
Outrage. Injustice.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.890
All that stuff.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.310
I don't know if I feel
that way about any place

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.610
that I felt about Florida.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.060
But thanks for the question.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.660
And I love your books

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.960
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Thanks.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.260
Thank you so much.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.560
Yes, ma'am.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.860
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what
is the favorite book

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.160
that you've read and why?

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.460
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Oh, I
mean, I get asked this.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.510
I can't think of a single
favorite book that I've read.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.430
I think that -- as books
that influenced me a lot.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.120 position:56%
I've told -- it was a very -- one of
the many, but a there was a writer,

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.150
we had a great writer in north
Florida, name was Harry Crews.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.080
And he was out of his mind crazy.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.440
And he taught at the
University of Florida.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.890
And he wrote several
highly acclaimed novels.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.180
But one of which didn't get a lot
of attention was called "Car."

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:42.150 position:56%
And it was about a guy who eats and
entire Ford Maverick at a dealership

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.370
in Jacksonville from
bumper to bumper.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.190
They cube up with blowtorches.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.840
And it's a promotion,
you know, to sell cars.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.610
And they've got the guy on
stage on a commode, basically,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.490
for the whole length of
the -- it's phenomenal.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.770
It's one of the funniest
books I ever read in my life.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.600
And I thought: he got
this published.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.220
He actually got this published.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.520
There's hope.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.820
There's hope for me.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.120
But Harry Crews.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.420
He was great.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.230
And then I think Joseph Heller
had a big influence on me.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.120
"Catch-22" certainly did.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.460
Because satire is a tough thing.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.580
It really -- you're
walking this tight rope.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.880
You want the suspense.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.790
You want a story.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.590
You want characters
people care about.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.230
You also have to have them
laughing on every page.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:32.290
So, if you're off by a single
beat or a measure or a rhythm,

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.500
if that makes sense, in your
sentences or in a paragraph

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.570
or in a scene that you're
writing, it's not funny.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.160
And readers know right
away when it's not funny.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.070
So you agonize over that stuff.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.040
Dialog becomes torture

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.210
because you're not doing it
just to advance the plot.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:52.400 position:56%
You've got your own little seditious
agenda as a writer of satire

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.070
that you're trying to
sustain throughout it.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.340
So, yeah. I mean, it's -- you know,
there were not a lot of people

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.640
who do it is what I'm saying.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.190
So, it's not like you
look around for a model.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.850
And there's certainly not
a lot of people writing

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.430
about giant Gambian pouched rats.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:10.990
So, I pretty much carve out
territory just for myself.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.030
Just for my own sick little world.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.330
Yes. Hi.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.720
&gt;&gt; I've read all of
your young adult books.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.940
And I was wondering if there's
a certain event in your life

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.720
that inspired your love of nature.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.020
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: That's
a good question.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.090
The young adult books, yeah,
they all kind of have that theme.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:29.900
Well, the first one I
did, I can tell you,

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.780 position:56%
was "Hoot," I did several years ago.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.110
And that was like just like a
page out of my own childhood.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.260
It was about this story of
these little burrowing owls.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.800
They live in the ground.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.100
They burrow underground.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.600
And I had them when I was a kid.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.320
There was a bunch of them
that lived near my house

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.990
where my mom and dad lived.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:51.000
And one day a bunch of
bulldozers showed up.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.660
They were going to -- they were
going to put up a condominium.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.960
This is classic Florida.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.070
A condominium in Florida
called Hawaiian Gardens.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.130
[ Laughter ]

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.510
And the signs were everywhere.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:06.830
And they had an actress, your
great grandmother might remember.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.130
Her name was Eve Arden.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.830
And she endorsed it.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.370
What was she doing there, anyway?

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.670
I don't know.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:13.970
But they were selling
off the condos.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.690
And they're getting ready
to clear all this land.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.230
And my friends and I --
and we were about your age.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.720
Every day we'd ride our bike
past the owls and they'd all be

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.030
out on their little burrows.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.570 position:56%
And their babies would be out there.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:27.380
And we say, well they'd never do
anything with those owls there.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.730
They'd never hurt those owls.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:32.370
And they buried them alive.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:39.170 position:56%
Even at your age, I was highly upset
by that, that that could happen.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.570
It was so wrong.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.230
And so -- I mean, I
was pretty young.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.060
But all around me concrete
was filling

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.630
in these place that I cared about.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.060
I lived out on the
edge of the Everglades.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.220
And so yeah, so that
experience stayed with me.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.620
But when I decided to write this
book, when they asked me to do

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.620
"Hoot" I decided that
since it's my book,

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.400 position:56%
it's going to have a happier ending.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.180
And that's the great selfish thing

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.390
about writing is that
they're my books.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.350
And they're going to
turn out the way I want.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.630
And something really terrible is
going to happen to the bad guys.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.930
Really bad.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.940
And I spend a lot of time
thinking up how to get rid of them.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.050
And I feel really good when I do.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.130
But thank you for asking.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.930
Thank you.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:29.040
[ Applause ]

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.970
&gt;&gt; One of my friends on the
Internet has described Florida

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.900
as being the only place
where you have to drive

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.510
to north to get to the south.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.900
I'm wondering if you'd
care to elaborate on that.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.200
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: It's true.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.990
I mean, Florida -- people have
often said it could be three

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.290
separate states.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.770
South Florida would be,
because of the Caribbean

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.020
and South American
influence, would be one state.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.820
The central part, because
of Orlando and Disney

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.150
and sort of the I-4 corridor.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.260
And then the panhandle, which
is really just southern Alabama

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.980
and Mississippi and Georgia.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.460
And it's very three
distinct demographics.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.440
If you know, if you're going

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.540
to hold a Donald Trump rally
would be much more well attended

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.490
in Pensacola than it would be, for
instance, in Key West, Florida.

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:20.530
Or at least it would be a more
tranquil event in Pensacola.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.780
Yes, it's a very interesting place
to be a journalist and a novelist

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.200
because it's so different,
so diverse.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.760 position:56%
We have 20 million people there now.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.300 position:56%
We surpassed New York in population.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.080
Now, about half of those
people came from New York.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.820
But, and our governor's
very proud of how crowded

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.710
and congested we are right now.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.070
He wants us to be number one.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.330
So, anyway.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.460
Yeah. I mean, it's just
-- it's just a great --

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.740
I mean, it's a great
trove if you're a writer.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:56.470 position:56%
It's such an incredibly different --
you can in two hours literally feel

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:00.350
like you've, you know, you're in
a whole other part of the world.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.350
And you might well be.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.650
Yes. Thanks.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:04.950
Hi.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.150
&gt;&gt; I had the joy of
discovering your writings from

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.450
"Naked Came the Manatee."

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.800
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Oh, God.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.010
Oh God. Every -- who
put you up to this?

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.310
All right.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.610
&gt;&gt; It's the honest truth.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.240
I'm just curious how you
became part of that project.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.830
And what was it like to write
characters in a plot line

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.090
and then turn it over and not have
any control over how it came out?

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.050
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: This
was a book that a

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:29.120
"Herald" editor name Tom
Schoder thought of doing

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.000
where we have 13 different
writers write a chapter

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.830
and then throw it all
together as a novel.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.480
Nobody knew what anyone
else was doing.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.320
But Dave Barry was smart enough
to take the first chapter.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.470
And then I was stupid enough
to take the last chapter

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.310
where I was actually supposed
to read the other 12 chapters

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.930
and try to make sense out of it.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.230
I'll just tell you briefly.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:54.100
When I got the chapters, they had
literally three different severed

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.980
heads of Fidel Castro.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.280
Not just one.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.690
I had to explain three
different dead Castros.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.700
It was a cluster, okay?

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.870
Let me just leave that.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:09.360
It was what in Florida we would
call a goat wedding, okay?

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.560
And Elmore Leonard,
God rest his soul.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.860
One of my heroes.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.160
He had chapter 12.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.460
I had chapter 13.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.760
And I got nothing from Leonard.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.060
And I'm on deadline.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.450
We were serializing it
in the newspaper first.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:21.750
And I'm on deadline to write.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.050
I don't know what he's writing.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.350
I call him up.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.650
I said, "You've got
to send me something.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.950
I've got to start to writing."

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.250
He goes, "Oh, God.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.550
I forgot about this.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.850
All right.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.150
I'll get to it."

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.450
And like a week later I get a
phone call saying, "Okay, Carl.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.750
Here's the deal.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.050
I left you two dead bodies.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.350
They don't have a name.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.650
They could be anybody you want.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:39.950
Two dead bodies."

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.270
And I said, "Dutch, I need
like six dead bodies."

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.420
I said, "If you had read what
I just got through reading,

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.900
you would know how many dead bodies
I need to get out of this plot."

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.430
But he left me the two.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.700
And then I just did my best.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.410
But that's -- so anyway.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.710
Flash forward.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.600
Me, Dave Barry and
Elmore Leonard are

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.800
on the Today Show sitting
on the couch.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.270
They've somehow decided
to make this a book.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.420
And we've mysteriously agreed
to go out and promote it.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.720
We're sitting there.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.020
I think it was Katie Couric.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.800
And she says, "This looks"
-- she's holding up the book.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.460
She goes, "This looks
like so much fun.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.350
Would any of you ever entertain
any thoughts of doing it again?"

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:19.860
Unprompted, unrehearsed, all three
of us looked at her and go, "No!"

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.520
Boom. That's a true story.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.730
&gt;&gt; Sir, in any of your
books, is there a character

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.500
that you would dislike
or hate the most?

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.740
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Who's
the most hated character?

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.810
Boy, there was a book I
did called "Sick Puppy."

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.260
And it was about a lobbyist.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.230
I know you guys don't know
anything about that here.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.530
&gt;&gt; I read that.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.830
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Yeah.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.130
And you did read it?

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.430
How old were you when you read it?

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.300
Where is your mom and
dad, by the way?

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.670
Hold on a second.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.050
How old were you when
you read that book?

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.350
&gt;&gt; About 14.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.650
It was eighth grade.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:54.950
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Okay.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:56.250
All right.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.550
Anyway, you read the book.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.850
That's good.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.150
The guy's name was Palmer Stoat.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.450
You remember.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.750
And he was, in my mind,
the world's worst --

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.160
embodied the worst of the worst
of the lobbyists that I knew

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.960
and had written about
and covered in Florida.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.310
And I thought this guy is the most,

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:16.330
maybe the most despicable
human I'd ever thought of.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:20.050
And I -- but then after the book
comes out, I had lobbyists --

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.860
I [inaudible] to them sometimes.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.500
And they loved the book.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.800
They loved the book.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.100
It's the damnedest thing.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.570
And they would say, "You
really nailed that guy."

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.790
And they thought -- they always
thought it was their competition I

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.090
was writing.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.390
They never saw themselves in it.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.690
But he was pretty bad.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.420
And something really bad
happened to him at the end.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.350
I won't give it away, but I
didn't like him at all, very much.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.970
Each book has somebody that I
really don't like very much.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.940
And I can't help myself.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.490
But referring to Elmore
Leonard again.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.560
And he always used to
talk to writers groups.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.790
And then he would always tell
them, and we always know it's true.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.880
The bad guys are much more fun
to write than the good guys are.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.540
You can have much more
fun with them.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.320
I mean, your own personal code.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.980
Your own -- everything
goes out the window.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.920
And you can just go nuts
and have fun with them.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.300
And then dispense with them
as you see fit at the end.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.600
So, that's another secret.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.160
But thank you for mentioning that.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.740
Thanks. Hi.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.860
&gt;&gt; Just a point of information.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:21.790
There's a place in New Jersey where
there is a mosquito administration.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.090
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: [Laughs] Yeah!

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.390
&gt;&gt; I kid you not.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:25.690
Every time we go to
Cape May we pass this.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.800
And we say, "Jeez, I wonder how
they're administering them."

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: In Florida it's
the Mosquito Control Districts are a

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.510
political entity.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.310 position:56%
You actually have to go out and vote

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:42.340
for your Mosquito Control District
Commissioners, based on what?

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.510
What qualifies you, I don't know.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.290
How much Benadryl you've
got in the house?

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.590
I don't know.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.460
But it's that -- and in the Keys,
traditionally, it was where --

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.940
now, I'm saying traditionally --
it was where the deadbeat relatives

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.610
of politicians who couldn't get
work anywhere else would get

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.160
on a Mosquito Control District.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.460
And they got a big salary.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.150
And they were in charge
of calling the planes.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.340
You know, we've carpet bombed
pesticides in the Keys.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.640
I mean literally.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.940
You can't believe.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.400
And they're flying under 500 feet,
dropping chemicals on your head.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.500
All to kill this little
tiny bug because it is kind

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.470
of bad for tourism, you see.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.770
So, but anyway.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.450
In Florida, it's an
actual elected position.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.970
But it's, you know, it's great.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.170
&gt;&gt; We just have been
travelling and keeping track

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.980
of insane names of places as well.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.140
You know, so we'll joke around
and say, "This is my husband

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.360
from Cucumber, West
Virginia" or whatever.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.400
But my favorite, my favorite
YA book of yours is "Flush."

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.050
Because I think what's really
exceptionally nice about it is

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.970
that the kids tell the dad, well,
we understand why you did it.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.270
But you did it wrong.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.420
And then they proceed
to do it right.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.720
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Yeah.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.020
Well that's what --
you know, I spent.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.320
&gt;&gt; It's a fantastic book.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.620
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Yeah, I
mean, thank you so much.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.440
But the think I was worried
about with the kid's books was

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.630
that -- first of all the danger.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.460 position:56%
You never want to write down to
kids, because they're always smarter

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.010
and sharper than a
lot of the grown-ups.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.580
&gt;&gt; Which is why it's a good thing
inheriting all our problems.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.880
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Exactly.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.610
They're going to be running the
planet, which is a good deal.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:23.150
But you want them to -- the way
they get the books is the humor is

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.860
basically the same
in the kid's books.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.570
It's just got the same irreverent
smart-ass hopeless attitude

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.870
in those books as I do.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.570
But I realize that they
love it when you make fun --

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.080
kids love to read books where
you're making fun of the grown-ups.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.370
And then I realized that's what
I've been doing for 40 years

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:42.260
in journalism in Florida
is making fun of grown-ups.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.200
It was just a logical transition.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.260
And they seem to dig it.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.550
&gt;&gt; We saw a great interview with
you on "60 Minutes" or "20/20."

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:54.810
I forget. And one of my favorite
quotes from you is that if you want

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.240
to change people, and
you rationalize --

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.880
I mean, you talk rationally
with them,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.240
they just harden their positions.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.350
And if you make them look
really stupid, they do change.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.650
Because they're embarrassed.

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.070
I thought that was wonderful.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.370
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: They get it.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.320
You get their attention --
humor is a very effective way,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.020
at least in the newspaper
business and in novels.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.130
But in the columns as well, humor
is an incredibly effective way.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.360 position:56%
You can get up on a soap box and
scream all you want at a politician.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.530
But when you start
making fun of let's say,

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:32.390
the size of somebody's
fingers, for example, you know?

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.050
Then they react in a way.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:37.790
But they -- they get it.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:42.390
You know, the object I think,
when you have a target,

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.430
and satire always has a target.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.560
And the columns I write
have a target.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.650
And I've always said from the very
beginning, you want as many people

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.200
to think, "Oh, that's
what I've been thinking.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.130
That's what I really -- I'm glad
someone else feels the way I do."

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.840
And that's the one good
part of the column.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.700
And the other is you're really --

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.860
you really want to ruin the day of
the person you're writing about.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.980
You really want to -- you
want to wreck their breakfast.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.730
You want them choking
on their Cheerios.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.030
You want them to say, "Oh, my God.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.580
They're making fun
of me in the paper."

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.110
And then you want them to face
their kids when their kids say,

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.410
"Did you really vote for that?

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:14.710
Did you really do that?

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.010
Did you really take that money?

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.870
Did you really sell out to big
oil or big sugar, whatever it is?"

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.820
Let them tell their own family that
that's what they do for a living.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.120
That's the job.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.420
And they ought to be ashamed.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.200
They out to be sick to their
stomachs, some of them.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.440
And I love it when I hear
that I ruined their day.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.890
It makes mine.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.190
Yes, hi.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.290
&gt;&gt; Are there any headlines
today that you'd like to turn

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.760
into stories in the future?

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.790
&gt;&gt; Carl Hiaasen: Oh, God.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:40.090
Oh, today?

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.390
Naw. Nothing's going on.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.560
This is a dull year, today.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.860
No, I mean, we've got -- look it.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.050 position:56%
We've got a guy running for
president who basically, apparently,

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:51.360
had hair implants from
an orangutan's armpit.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:57.460
And he has a chance of winning
in a state, by the way, Florida.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.930
One of the most diverse
states there is.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.540
And it's pretty close
down there now.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.800
I mean, this is just
better you could --

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.320
and Tom Wolfe couldn't
have invented.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.560
This is "Bonfire of the
Vanities" on Viagra.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.800
That's what we're -- that's
what we're witnessing right now

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.440
in this country.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.080
And then it's not much
better on the other side.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.050
But, no. The headlines in
Florida, I'll give you one quickly.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:26.130
A guy drives through a Wendy's
to buy -- Wendy's drive-through.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:29.560
And he decides it would be a
great idea to put an alligator

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.860
in the drive through thing

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.660
so that the poor clerk who's
giving him the Wendy's,

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.480
now there's a live alligator
loose in the Wendy's.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.780
I just love that.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.580
I mean, that will not happen --
it doesn't' happen in Nebraska.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.060
It doesn't happen in Minnesota.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.260
It doesn't even happen
in California.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.780
And the guy just is, "Oh, dude.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.590
I was just trying to have some fun.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:49.240
I guess it wasn't too
good an idea, you know?"

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.810
I mean, this live alligator
running around the Wendy's.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.780
Those are cinematic sort of scenes

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.150
that you'd hope would
be in a book one day.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.450
All right.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:00.030
Listen, you all have been
wonderful and very brave

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.800
for sitting through this.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.520
Now go Google the pouched rats.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.820
I'll see you.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.490
[ Applause ]

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:11.350
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
