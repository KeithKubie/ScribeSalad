00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.629
 
there's a fascinating fascinating line

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
there's a fascinating fascinating line
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.150
there's a fascinating fascinating line
of research recently trying to explain

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
of research recently trying to explain
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.259
of research recently trying to explain
why people see ghosts and it's a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
why people see ghosts and it's a
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.580
why people see ghosts and it's a
phenomenon that people have talked about

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
phenomenon that people have talked about
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.470
phenomenon that people have talked about
for a long time that someone will

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
for a long time that someone will
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.029
for a long time that someone will
suddenly feel as if there's this

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
suddenly feel as if there's this
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.010
suddenly feel as if there's this
presence of another person that's near

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
presence of another person that's near
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.279
presence of another person that's near
bought and it turns out that you can

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
bought and it turns out that you can
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.650
bought and it turns out that you can
actually artificially induce that sense

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
actually artificially induce that sense
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.779
actually artificially induce that sense
of another presence that that's nearby

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
of another presence that that's nearby
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.580
of another presence that that's nearby
and you can do it

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
and you can do it
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.490
and you can do it
by using the sense that we have of our

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
by using the sense that we have of our
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010
by using the sense that we have of our
own presence so as I'm sitting here now

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
own presence so as I'm sitting here now
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.410
own presence so as I'm sitting here now
I have a fairly strong sense that I am

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
I have a fairly strong sense that I am
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450
I have a fairly strong sense that I am
sitting here now that there's this

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
sitting here now that there's this
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520
sitting here now that there's this
person who's me who's sitting here and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
person who's me who's sitting here and
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380
person who's me who's sitting here and
part of that is because of my

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
part of that is because of my
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500
part of that is because of my
kinesthetic appreciation of the way that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
kinesthetic appreciation of the way that
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360
kinesthetic appreciation of the way that
my own body works the fact that when I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
my own body works the fact that when I
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.569
my own body works the fact that when I
tried to do something my body follows so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
tried to do something my body follows so
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.130
tried to do something my body follows so
what they did in this experiment was to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
what they did in this experiment was to
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.470
what they did in this experiment was to
set up a situation where when I'm say

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
set up a situation where when I'm say
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.069
set up a situation where when I'm say
touching moving a stick I feel a stick

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
touching moving a stick I feel a stick
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.579
touching moving a stick I feel a stick
behind me touching my back so even

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
behind me touching my back so even
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320
behind me touching my back so even
though I couldn't actually be bringing

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
though I couldn't actually be bringing
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450
though I couldn't actually be bringing
about that movement it's highly

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
about that movement it's highly
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160
about that movement it's highly
correlated with my own movements the way

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
correlated with my own movements the way
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.170
correlated with my own movements the way
that my hand waving is correlated with

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
that my hand waving is correlated with
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330
that my hand waving is correlated with
my intending to wave my hand so here it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
my intending to wave my hand so here it
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.210
my intending to wave my hand so here it
is I'm intending to intentionally moving

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
is I'm intending to intentionally moving
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.980
is I'm intending to intentionally moving
the stick and I'm feeling the stick

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
the stick and I'm feeling the stick
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630
the stick and I'm feeling the stick
moving in exactly the same way on my

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
moving in exactly the same way on my
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760
moving in exactly the same way on my
back it turns out that when you do that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
back it turns out that when you do that
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310
back it turns out that when you do that
people report even though they know it's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
people report even though they know it's
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990
people report even though they know it's
not true they report that there's this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
not true they report that there's this
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609
not true they report that there's this
other person that's somewhere out there

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
other person that's somewhere out there
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.830
other person that's somewhere out there
there's a presence that's there that's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
there's a presence that's there that's
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050
there's a presence that's there that's
responsible for what's happening to them

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
responsible for what's happening to them
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.569
responsible for what's happening to them
and when you look at people who report

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
and when you look at people who report
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.569
and when you look at people who report
this feeling of presence it's a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
this feeling of presence it's a
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460
this feeling of presence it's a
characteristic of certain kinds of brain

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
characteristic of certain kinds of brain
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.399
characteristic of certain kinds of brain
damage which affect this kind of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
damage which affect this kind of
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.050
damage which affect this kind of
kinesthetic sense we have of our own

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
kinesthetic sense we have of our own
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.569
kinesthetic sense we have of our own
bodies so the sense that I have that I'm

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
bodies so the sense that I have that I'm
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.190
bodies so the sense that I have that I'm
here inside of me not over there that's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
here inside of me not over there that's
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.319
here inside of me not over there that's
generated by particular brain areas and

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
generated by particular brain areas and
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910
generated by particular brain areas and
with damage to those brain areas that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
with damage to those brain areas that
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.980
with damage to those brain areas that
that system gets sort of messed up one

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
that system gets sort of messed up one
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.780
that system gets sort of messed up one
of the results is that you think that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
of the results is that you think that
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.359
of the results is that you think that
there's another person there now I think

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
there's another person there now I think
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.359
there's another person there now I think
part of what makes that whole story you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
part of what makes that whole story you
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.499
part of what makes that whole story you
know you might think this is the kind of

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
know you might think this is the kind of
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.109
know you might think this is the kind of
encouraging you know scooby-doo sort of

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
encouraging you know scooby-doo sort of
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600
encouraging you know scooby-doo sort of
story right so oh it looked like there

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
story right so oh it looked like there
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.230
story right so oh it looked like there
was a ghost but no no

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240
was a ghost but no no
 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.570
was a ghost but no no
we really found out that the ghost was

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580
we really found out that the ghost was
 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.120
we really found out that the ghost was
just this illusion of our own

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
just this illusion of our own
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.760
just this illusion of our own
kinesthetic body but even though that

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770
kinesthetic body but even though that
 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.410
kinesthetic body but even though that
seems kind of comforting I think there's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420
seems kind of comforting I think there's
 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.300
seems kind of comforting I think there's
actually something even spookier that's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
actually something even spookier that's
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.130
actually something even spookier that's
the result of that and the thing that's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140
the result of that and the thing that's
 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.920
the result of that and the thing that's
even spookier is what about that feeling

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930
even spookier is what about that feeling
 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.350
even spookier is what about that feeling
I have about me what about that feeling

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
I have about me what about that feeling
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.930
I have about me what about that feeling
that I have that I'm here existing in my

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940
that I have that I'm here existing in my
 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.330
that I have that I'm here existing in my
body what these experiments suggest is

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
body what these experiments suggest is
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.250
body what these experiments suggest is
that's just as much of an illusion as

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
that's just as much of an illusion as
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.650
that's just as much of an illusion as
the ghost so the ghost in the machine

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660
the ghost so the ghost in the machine
 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.020
the ghost so the ghost in the machine
the ghost that's me that's just as much

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
the ghost that's me that's just as much
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.090
the ghost that's me that's just as much
an illusion that my brain is generating

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100
an illusion that my brain is generating
 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.930
an illusion that my brain is generating
as the ghost that's out there that's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
as the ghost that's out there that's
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.570
as the ghost that's out there that's
that's causing that that feeling on my

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
that's causing that that feeling on my
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.310
that's causing that that feeling on my
back or the ghost that's out there

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320
back or the ghost that's out there
 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.080
back or the ghost that's out there
that's the result of the little glitch

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
that's the result of the little glitch
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.680
that's the result of the little glitch
in my kinesthetic processing so even

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
in my kinesthetic processing so even
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.850
in my kinesthetic processing so even
though I think this is kind of an

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860
though I think this is kind of an
 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.410
though I think this is kind of an
encouraging thought for Halloween that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420
encouraging thought for Halloween that
 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.850
encouraging thought for Halloween that
all those ghosts are really just

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860
all those ghosts are really just
 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.220
all those ghosts are really just
illusions of your mind there's there's a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
illusions of your mind there's there's a
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470
illusions of your mind there's there's a
bit of a catch like in all good ghost

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480
bit of a catch like in all good ghost
 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.870
bit of a catch like in all good ghost
stories kind of turn of the screw that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880
stories kind of turn of the screw that
 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.060
stories kind of turn of the screw that
says yeah well that might be true about

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070
says yeah well that might be true about
 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.400
says yeah well that might be true about
those ghosts but that might be true

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410
those ghosts but that might be true
 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.200
those ghosts but that might be true
about that ghost that's my own sense of

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210
about that ghost that's my own sense of
 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.559
about that ghost that's my own sense of
self to

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569
 
 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.629
 
you
