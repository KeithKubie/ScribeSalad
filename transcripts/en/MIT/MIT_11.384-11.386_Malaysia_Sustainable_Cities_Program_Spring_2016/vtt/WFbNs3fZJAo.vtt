00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.770
SHRADDHA PANDEY: Sustainability,
energy efficiency,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.410
and green development.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.610
These are fundamental
to the modern cities

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.090
of today and tomorrow.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.950
Hi.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.610
I'm Shraddha Pandey,
and in this video

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.600
I will be discussing about the
role of green building rating

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.440
systems in city
sustainability, by analyzing

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.730
the impact of green
building index, as a system,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.270
on the future of green
buildings in Malaysia.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.070
Let us start by understanding
what green buildings are,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.470
and why rating
systems are important.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.120
Infrastructure is indispensable
to the growth and development

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.550
of a society.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.940
And key components
of it are buildings.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.110
Buildings use energy for
lighting, space, heating,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.340
or cooling, ventilation,
air conditioning,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.640
and other electronic and
electrical appliances.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.510
Collectively buildings
can consume around

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.130
40% of the total energy
around the world,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.780
including energy usage
during construction,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.720
as well less in their
operational phase.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.040
Efficient energy use, and
a conducive environment

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.470
in and around the buildings
is critical to city

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.080
sustainability.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.760
So what is a green building?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.900
How is a green building, or
an energy efficient building,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.750
different from a
conventional one?

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.710
A green building is a building
whose construction and lifetime

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.070
of operation assure the
healthiest possible environment

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.860
by making the most efficient
and least disruptive

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.360
use of land, water,
energy, and resources.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.930
Some of the features that
define a green building

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.510
include climate responsive
nature of its architecture,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.740
passive techniques for heating,
cooling, ventilation and day

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.510
lighting, use of renewable
sources of energy,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.020
efficient and environment
friendly practices

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.210
during construction
and post occupancy,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.990
use of [INAUDIBLE] materials,
and occupant health, safety,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.180
and comfort.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.610
An efficiently
designed green building

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.210
can save up to 30% to
60% energy as compared

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.830
to that by a conventional
building which

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.510
is not environment sensitive.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.050
LESLIE NORFORD: are an
important part of that,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.040
particularly in developing
countries where they use maybe

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.460
a third to 40% of
national energy resources,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.250
and a significantly higher
percentage of electricity,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.340
over 70% in the US.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.695
Lighting is a major
energy consumer

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.220
in commercial buildings.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.510
Another major energy
consumer, particularly

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.200
in tropical areas, where large
numbers of the world's people

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.390
live, is cooling.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.990
Shading for windows, more
efficient cooling systems,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.990
and use of what's called natural
ventilation at times of year

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.520
when outdoor conditions permit.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.830
SHRADDHA PANDEY:
However, if we hope

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.945
to align the benefits
of green buildings

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:47.350
with the sustainability
of a city

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.990
and optimize energy use
by buildings globally,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.990
every designer
and developer will

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.840
need to be aware and
work towards creating

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.850
energy efficient buildings.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.950
Only then shall
[INAUDIBLE] energy saving.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.050
And that is where the
green integrating systems

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.660
play a very important role.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.830
They can be used as a tool
to encourage and enforce

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.710
the building of
green structures.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.640
These may be either in form
of certifications or mandate

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.815
records.

00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:21.190
LESLIE NORFORD:
Now, we might ask

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.550
how the countries
and governments,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.580
nonprofit agencies, promote the
development of green buildings.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.910
And two big elements of that are
standards and rating systems.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.790
And rating systems have
increasingly shown their value

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.930
in many countries
by calling attention

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:56.390
to the value of green buildings,
and giving building owners,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.360
building operators clear,
easy to understand targets

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.300
for construction features
and for operation

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.630
of their buildings.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.770
They're not perfect.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.260
They tend not to be
overly quantitative.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.990
And one can get a
good rating, maybe

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.020
in some cases for aspects of the
building that don't necessarily

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.980
save energy but are
important environmentally.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.290
But their popularity
is hugely important.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.340
This works well at
city level, and larger.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.390
People can see that neighboring
buildings are part of this.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.040
Work in one country can
help, the development work,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.060
can help make it
easier for neighboring

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.069
countries with similar
climates to do the same.

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.110
SHRADDHA PANDEY: There
are various rating systems

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.350
developed and being followed
in different countries

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.420
around the world.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.660
While designing green buildings,
the site, surroundings,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.390
climate, resources, and
building function all

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.020
play a crucial role.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.460
And thus, every
rating system needs

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.820
to be contextual and unique in
its response to the location,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.450
climate, and resource
availability of the area

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.430
that it has been designed for.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.070
Green Building Index
Malaysia, launched in 2009,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.140
is a green building
rating system

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.190
developed by Malaysian
Institute of Architects

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.520
and the Association of
Consulting Engineers Malaysia.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.470
It is a comprehensive
rating system

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.560
for evaluating the environmental
design and performance

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.170
of buildings on six main
criterion under seven

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.610
different categories.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.780
VON KOK LEONG: GBI
is just another tool

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.970
to actually help
to spread awareness

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.730
throughout the country, which
is why we also so formed

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.730
the Malaysia Green Building
Confederation, or MGBC, whose

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.195
role is to actually spread
awareness of sustainability

00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:54.570
throughout the
whole country, not

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.200
just to designers, but to other
stakeholder organizations.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.350
So we worked together with MGBC
in promoting other areas apart

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.810
from accreditation.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.500
And we consider that
moving towards green

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.729
is a natural step for
designers to know.

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.270
THIRUKUMARAN
JALLENDRAN: The industry

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.010
is responding in the
manner it should.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.830
So I'm quite hopeful that
again in the last five years

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.060
we've gone from
0 green buildings

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.220
to about 627 green buildings.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.650
So that's an indication of
where the market's right now.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.470
So I'm quite encouraged
with this development.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.150
And they see that through
GBI, through a green building

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.890
certification, there's value
added to their development,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.210
to their projects.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.390
The projects are performing
environmentally better

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.140
than projects which
are not GBI certified.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.730
That is one.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.110
Secondly, they also
see the benefits

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.150
through operational savings.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.370
So they use less energy.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.940
They use less water,
less utilities.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.580
They produce less waste.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.320
GBI boasts to have
successfully achieved

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.170
100 million square feet
of green rated built up

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.990
area in the past five
years in Malaysia.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.510
As imperative it is to
have a system in place,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.050
it is equally vital to
comprehend the approach

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.430
and response of the building
developers and designers

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.080
towards it to ensure
that we achieve

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.320
our aim of having more
sustainable green buildings

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.570
in the future.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.100
GBI takes a holistic approach
and covers many aspects

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.400
that facilitate the design and
construction of an environment

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.990
friendly building, grading
them on a 100 point system.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.140
To assess the impact
of GBI as a system,

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.520
the criterion on which
the buildings are rated

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.700
was sorted into two broad
categories, short term impact,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.050
and long term impact.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.970
The categorization depends
on whether the criterion

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.090
helps keeps the building green
for its expected lifetime.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.820
Long term impact
criterion are mostly

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.220
part of the physical
structure and design

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.910
of the building itself.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.250
And their energy benefits can
be gained year after year.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.570
For example, if skylights are
incorporated in the building

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.670
envelope as a passive
design feature

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.170
to optimize the use of daylight.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.260
Or if advanced energy
performance measures,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.530
and innovative
design initiatives

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.400
are included at the conception
and construction phase,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.910
their benefits last
for a lifetime.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.670
However, other measures,
like worker side amenities,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.180
or construction waste
management are also important.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.920
But these are examples of
short term impact criterion,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.060
as they do not ensure the
effective energy efficiency

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.280
and environmental gain
repeatedly in the coming years.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.110
GBI has rated around
300 buildings since 2009

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.530
in Malaysia.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.310
The study was conducted
for the existing GBI

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.830
non-residential new
construction code.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.490
It was identified that
out of a total 100,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.720
57 points account for long
term impact criterion,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.260
and 43 for short term
impact criterion.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.470
In the past years,
GBI has certified

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.910
112 buildings in
the NRNC category

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.130
under the four classifications.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.190
Out of these almost
50% of the buildings

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.820
have applied for and
received green certification

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.090
under the rated classification,
which requires only 50 points,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.850
suggesting that the
majority of buildings

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.790
aim for and receive this
basic level of certification.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.910
And it may be important to
note that these buildings can

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.520
acquire 84% of their points
from the short term impact

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.810
criterion.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.640
It is evident from
the data from GBI

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.410
that these building tend to
acquire points from short term

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.390
impact criterion
more, suggesting

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.510
that most of the
buildings rated green

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.920
would not be very different
from the conventional ones

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.010
during their lifespan.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.380
So the buildings
may be called green,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.040
but in reality might not
have the expected impact

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.730
on energy use optimization
in Malaysian cities.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.640
Also identified
were the criterion

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.870
which seemed to be most
achievable and non achievable

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.660
by the buildings.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.530
Less than 20% of
the rated buildings

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.470
could achieve few of the major
criterion in the long term

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.290
impact category.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.510
It is interesting
to see that these

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.150
account for almost 25 points
in the 100 point system.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.650
And the points achieved by more
than 80% of the rated buildings

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.890
have a substantial share of the
short term impact criterion.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.600
However, from the examples
of platinum, gold, and silver

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.530
rated buildings,
we see that it is

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.430
possible to achieve better
efficiency within the GBI

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.860
framework.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.220
To encourage and enforce
that on a larger scale

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.920
a few improvisations
can be made.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.950
Following are suggestions
specific to GBI existing NRNC

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:10.830
code.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.540
Malaysian standard MS
1525 is the Malaysian code

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.580
of practice for energy
efficiency and use

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.090
of renewable energy for
non-residential buildings.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.140
Compliance to it should be
introduced as a prerequisite

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.120
for a GBI rating.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.980
Among the points
achieved by buildings,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.190
the percentage requirement
for long term criterion

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.300
should be specified, making
sure that the buildings achieve

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.355
a balance of both.

00:12:38.355 --> 00:12:42.910
A minimum number of long term
criterion points required

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.600
should be fixed to apply for
silver, gold, and platinum

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.520
certification.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.380
A few of the
identified criterion

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.840
are vital for human health,
comfort, and environment

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.520
protection, therefore
should be made mandatory

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.950
to apply for GBI certification.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.860
The weightage of
long-term impact criterion

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.680
can be increased.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.840
This will reinforce
their importance,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.200
and higher efforts would be put
by developers to achieve them.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.280
The number of points allotted
for innovation criterion

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.950
should be increased.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.240
This encourage designers
to be creative and make

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.460
proper analysis of the
behavior of the designs

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.590
and specifications.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.200
Innovation should be
encouraged in design,

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.010
rather than just being
limited to technology,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.390
by equally dividing innovation
points among building design

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.490
features and technology
incorporation.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.360
Learning the lessons from
the examples of environment

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.760
sensitive buildings in Malaysia,
and looking at their climate

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.070
responsive architectural
design and solutions

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.840
can be one of the most
effective ways of doing this.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.050
These buildings have been built
for the Malaysian climate,

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.660
with features like solar buffer
effect, solar shading devices,

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.919
day lighting, terraced
gardens, and orientation

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:05.710
driven ventilation.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.540
These are a few of the
celebrated environment

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.820
sensitive buildings in Malaysia.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.100
Encouraging architects
to apply these features

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.730
under innovative
design criterion, which

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.770
promote the use of climate
responsive architecture,

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.990
these suggestions may help bring
about substantial benefits,

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.330
and create more green buildings,
having higher efficiency

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.440
through the green building
index in Malaysia.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.630
And GBI can become a guiding
tool for buildings in Malaysia

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.090
to sustain their energy
efficient character

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.990
throughout their lifespan.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.160
In the next 50 years
our energy demands

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.340
globally will be doubled.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.013
Hence, energy saving has become
the need of the [? Earth. ?]

00:14:51.013 --> 00:14:54.640
Green building rating systems
are the way towards a greener,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.650
more comfortable, and more
efficient future of our

00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.950
build environment.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.780
By developing more
effective rating systems

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.090
we can ensure the quality
of our build environment,

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.870
and hence, shape a
sustainable future

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.100
for our cities of tomorrow.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.140
Our future is our
responsibility.
