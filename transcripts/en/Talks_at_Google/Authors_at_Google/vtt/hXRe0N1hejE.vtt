00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
&gt;&gt; I'd like to welcome Chris McDougall to
Google today.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.120
Chris is a former war correspondent for the
Associated Press, and now a contributing editor

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.930
for Men's Health.
He's a three time National Magazine Award

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.510
finalist.
He's written for Esquire, New York Times Magazine,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.750
Outside Men's Journal, and the New York Magazine.
And you may have seen him recently on the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.080
Daily Show, speaking about his book, "Born
to Run," which he's speaking about again today

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.130
for us.
I hope some of you got copies.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.760
The book is a chronicle of the tribe of the
Tarahumara, who live in Chihuahua, Mexico,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.750
and their extraordinary running ability, as
well as the politics surrounding running in

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.999
this particular tribe.
And I'm very excited to welcome Chris to speak

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:44.999
with us today.
Come on up.

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:45.999
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:54.329
Chris McDougall: Hi. Thanks a lot for having
me in today.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.039
You know, it's weird.
I've been spending five months now, talking

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.139
about what should be the simplest thing on
Earth.

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:02.789
You know, just moving one leg, moving the
other leg, and going that direction.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.970
And yet, it has been really remarkable how
complicated this topic is.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.210
I don't know if any of you saw that raging
debate yesterday online on the New York Times

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.580
website.
There was a posting about whether running

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.380
in bare feet is good for you.
And out of the shadows, all the barefoot runners

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.890
came roaring out saying like, "Why the hell
are shoes the default position?" You know?

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.539
"Why isn't the question, Are running in shoes
good for you?"

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.520
You know, "Why is it this notion that shoes
are somehow better than bare feet?"

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.719
So, I'll get into that whole controversy in
a little bit, because it's kind of intriguing.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.579
But, first, I'd like to tell you a little
bit about how this whole thing began.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.609
Well, let me read for you a little bit.
Have a lot of you already read the book?

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.100
No? Good. Excellent.
I've gone to some places where I try and pull

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.960
a little surprise out of the book, and people
are sort of nodding along.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.520
They've already been there, so. Okay.
[reading] It all began with a simple question

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.080
that no one could answer.
It was a five-word puzzle that led me to a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.450
photo of a very fast man in a very short skirt.
And from there, it only got stranger.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.920
Soon, I was dealing with a murder, drug guerrillas,
and a one-armed man with a cream cheese cup

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.060
strapped to his head.
I met a beautiful, blond forest ranger who

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.470
slipped out of her clothes and found salvation
by running naked in the Idaho forests, and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.700
a young surfer babe in pigtails, who ran straight
toward her death in a desert.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.360
A talented young runner would die.
Two others would barely escape with their

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.010
lives.
I kept looking, and I stumbled across the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.819
barefoot Batman, naked guy, the Kalahari bushmen,
the toenail amputee, a cult devoted to distance

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.180
running and sex parts, the wild man of the
Blue Ridge Mountains, and ultimately, to the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.620
ancient tribe of the Tarahumara, and their
shadowy disciple Caballo Blanco.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.819
In the end, I got my answer, but only after
I found myself in the middle of the greatest

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.120
race the world would never see -- the ultimate
fighting competition of foot races, an underground

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.140
showdown, pitting some of the best ultra distance
runners of our time against the best ultra

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.301
runners of all time, in the 50-mile race on
hidden trails only Tarahumara feet had ever

00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:18.799
touched.
[talking] And it all because, in January of

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.849
2001, I asked my doctor this, "How come my
foot hurts?"

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.840
That was the starting point. I was not a runner
at all.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.342
I was just a guy who was trying to work off,
you know, fat lunches every couple of days

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:34.540
by running two or three miles and that was
it.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.469
But, after a few months, I was constantly
getting hurt.

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:42.190
You know, I had Achilles' pain and arch pain
and heel pain and hamstring pulled and lower

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.980
back pain.
And you know, I wasn't even attempting marathons.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.790
I was doing two or three miles every couple
days.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.180
The breaking point was, one day I went out
for a little 3-mile jog on a snow-covered

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.040
road on a dirt, farm trail in the middle of
Amish farm country, technically the most forgiving

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.730
surface you can run along on planet Earth.
After two miles, this blinding pain shot up

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.530
my foot.
I went to see another sports medicine doctor,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.969
who said, "What do you expect, you know?
Running is bad for humans. The impact is bad

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.420
for you. You keep this up"
-- particularly me, because at that point,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.140
I was like 240 pounds -- he says, "You keep
this up, and you have to get a new set of

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.920
knees and a new set of hips."
So that was it. I gave up running and never

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.660
planned to run again.
And the reason why is because of this pervasive

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.530
attitude that exists in the world -- and so
pervasive that it's the kind of thing you

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.630
hear all the time from the most respected
voices in the running world.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.030
I mean, let me just read you a quote.
This was a couple weeks ago from, you know,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.880
the editor of Runners World Magazine -- the
guy who you assume not only knows about running,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.550
but would want to sort of promote it and make
more people do it.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.080
And this is what he said on NPR -- he said,
"The concern I have is, a lot of people hear

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.670
about these new shoes and read about and maybe
hear about this book called, 'Born to Run,'

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.220
and feel like, 'Oh, I could just throw away
my running shoes and I'll just start tomorrow,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.630
and I'll become a barefoot runner.' If a lot
of runners, or all the runners out there in

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.310
America, did that tomorrow, the vast majority
of them would get hurt very quickly and have

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.810
to stop running for a very long time."
And the reason why you would get hurt very

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.320
quickly and have to stop running for a long
time he said was because "the vast majority

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.700
of people are not blessed in that way.
They've got some biomechanical inefficiencies."

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.470
Okay, biomechanical inefficiencies.
Now, a guy named Dr. Maharam -- who is the

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.360
medical consultant for the New York City Marathon,
and who's billed as the premier running position

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.410
in the country -- says the same thing.
He said, if everyone tried to run in their

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.080
bare feet, 95 percent of them would end up
in his office with injuries, because they

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.740
are not 'biomechanically perfect'.
Now, you hear this, and you think, "Okay,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.030
well. If I were to prevent any organism from
performing any function, I will threaten it

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.430
with pain. You know. Pain is a great dissuader."
So what they're telling you is, unless you

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.310
are 'biomechanically perfect', running is
fraught with danger.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.840
It's this risky thing like trying to remove
your own appendix.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.130
"Don't try it at home."
And if you do, you better have the best possible

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.431
equipment.
Now, that phrase, I've now heard over and

00:06:18.431 --> 00:06:20.800
over again for years.
And I was hearing it back when I was going

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.410
to see sports medicine doctor.
They would look at me and say, "Well, you're

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.000
not biomechanically perfect.
You need orthotics, you need cortisone shots.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.400
You need some $150 shoes, which you have to
throw away in three months.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.400
You get new $150 shoes."
But then, you know, you start to think about

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.130
this, "Well, wait a minute.
What does 'biomechanically efficient' mean?"

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.670
You hear that word and you think it means
'biologically efficient,' or 'biologically

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.570
perfect.'
Well, biomechanical is not biological.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.970
Biomechanical just means you do it right,
period. You know?

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.700
If you drop a kid in a pool and that kid starts
to sink, you don't say, "I'm sorry.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.270
You're not biomechanically efficient.
You're fucked, you know?" [laughter]

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.280
No. You pull the kid out.
You give a few compressions, you know?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.360
And you teach him how to swim.
That's what's been lacking from this whole

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.360
question about running.
Nobody ever tells you how to do this damn

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.970
thing.
What they tell you to do is buy something.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.190
And we got into the situation today where,
you know, you're told over and over again,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.930
"Just buy something." as opposed to "Just
learn something."

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.130
And that was the situation I found myself
in.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.610
I was constantly hurt.
You know, and I didn't particularly care about

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.040
running.
But I had this feeling.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.850
It was kind of instinct inside.
I just wanted to have that liberty, that freedom

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.100
to run, that everybody else seemed to have.
That I remember having as a kid too.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:41.060
You never see a five-year-old doing hot yoga
or putting on shoes, or doing a stretch or

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.760
any kind of warm up.
A five-year-old wants to go, a five-year-old

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.690
is gone -- at a sprint, all the time.
You never met a five-year-old on earth who

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.880
says they hate running or they're tapering
or they're in training, you know? [laughter]

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.910
Five-year-olds are just ready to fly all the
time.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.280
It's somewhere in that transit, there's sort
of an arc, where "Love running, Love running,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.090
Love running -- Hate running, Hate running,
Hate running" for the rest of your life.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:12.580
And that's where I became intrigued by is,
Where is that little tipping-over point between

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:18.190
enjoying it naturally to taking it on as a
task to somehow giving up on it?

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.270
And I found my answer, initially, when I was
down in Mexico researching a story for the

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:29.150
New York Times magazine.
And I think sort of testament to the impact

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.470
of the photo I was about to see that the second
I saw that photo, I immediately forgot about

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.079
the assignment I was on.
And that assignment was to find this like,

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:43.209
gorgeous, voluptuous, Mexican pop star, who
was secretly running her own fugitive brainwashing

00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:46.440
sex cult.
That's what I was looking for, but yet, I

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.639
see this picture of this old man in a bathrobe
and sandals, running down this trail in these

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:55.220
thin, little sandals.
And according to the caption, this guy had

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.250
just run a hundred miles through the Rocky
Mountains and beaten hundreds of top, elite

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.060
American ultra runners.
Fifty-five years old, running a hundred miles,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.410
in sandals, beating the best in the world.
And I look at this picture thinking, "Now,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.259
what's that dude doing that I'm not doing?
How come I'm told that 26-miles is the ultimate

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:19.050
challenge, you know, 'You go beyond 26, you
could die like Pheidippides."

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.649
This guy just did a hundred miles in sandals,
and he's 55 years old.

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:27.350
He was twice my age, running four times the
distance in the thinnest shoes imaginable.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:36.389
That was my first introduction to the Tarahumara.
I made a lot of mistakes along the way trying

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:41.470
to understand what they're all about.
And I wish I had originally spoken to a guy

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:50.279
named doctor Joe Vigil, who is a distant running
coach in Colorado, who -- he's a strange guy,

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:54.829
because even late in his life, as the most
successful running coach of all time, I think

00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:59.459
he's plagued by this roaring sense of vulnerability
 -- that somebody's always going to pull something

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:05.019
out that he can never be prepared for.
So Vigil does stuff like turn up at the Leadville

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:08.821
Trail 100, which is a freaky mountain race,
in the middle of nowhere in the middle of

00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:11.180
the night.
And there he is, 70 years old, like huddle

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.329
in the woods with a little cup of coffee waiting
to watch these guys run by.

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:20.610
He was there in 1994, because, long before
I'd heard of the Tarahumara Indians, he'd

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.870
heard about them.
And nobody else on the planet could care less

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:31.040
about freaky guys in bathrobes and sandals,
or even less about freakier guys who remove

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.160
their own toenails and run these 100-mile
races.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.350
They remove their toenails, because they -- I
don't know if you saw the Time story yesterday

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.420
about ultra runners keep jamming their toes
against the front of their shoes, so they

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.290
will have their toenails surgically removed
and then burnt off with acid.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.990
So yeah, just remove some deadweight and move
on.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.580
So there was Vigil.
Vigil turned out in 1994, because it was one

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.600
of the few times that the Tarahumara Indians
had ever left their homes in the bottom of

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.600
the Copper Canyons of Mexico to come out and
compete.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:08.740
And this is what he saw.
And this is what intrigued him so much. [pause]

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:18.399
[reading] Over the previous years, Coach Vigil
had become convinced that the next leap forward

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:24.560
in human endurance would come from a dimension
he dreaded getting into -- character.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.700
Not the character that other coaches were
always rah, rah, rah-ing about.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:33.519
Vigil wasn't talking about grit or hunger
or the "size of the fight in the dog".

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:39.430
In fact, he meant the exact opposite.
Vigil's notion of character wasn't toughness.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:45.240
It was compassion, kindness, love. That's
right, 'love'.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.980
Now, Vigil had figured out the body.
So now, he was moving on to the brain.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.430
Specifically, he wanted to know, How do you
make anybody actually want to do any of this

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.449
stuff?
How do you make someone actually want to run?

00:11:57.449 --> 00:12:02.370
And that was the real secret of the Tarahumara.
They've never forgotten what it felt like

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.779
to love running.
They remember that running was mankind's first

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:12.509
fine art -- our original act of inspired creation.
Way before we were scratching pictures on

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:16.889
caves or beating rhythms on hollowed trees,
we were perfecting the art of combining our

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:22.410
breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion
over wild terrain.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.660
And when our ancestors finally did make their
first cave paintings, what were the first

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.910
designs?
A downward slash, lightning bolts through

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.019
the bottom and the middle -- Behold, the running
man.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.350
Distance running was revered, because it was
indispensable.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.170
It was the way we survived and thrived and
spread across the planet.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:46.230
You ran to eat and to avoid being eaten.
You ran to find a mate and to impress her,

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.389
and with her, you ran off to start a new life
together.

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:52.999
You had to love running or you wouldn't live
to love anything else.

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:57.930
And like everything else we love -- everything
we sentimentally call our 'passions' and 'desires'

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:04.110
 -- it's really an encoded ancestral necessity.
We were born to run.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.329
We were born because we run.
We're all running people, as the Tarahumara

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:16.270
have never forgotten. [pause]
[reading] So there he was, Joe Vigil, an old

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.980
man alone in the woods, and he suddenly felt
a burst of immortality.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.730
He was on to something, something huge.
It wasn't just how to run; it was how to live.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.779
The essence of who we are as a species and
what we're meant to be.

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:33.240
Vigil had read Carl Lumholtz, the ancient
Norwegian explorer.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.350
And, at that moment, Lumholtz's words revealed
their hidden treasure.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:43.300
So that's what he meant when he called the
Tarahumara "The founders and makers of the

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.999
history of mankind."
Perhaps all of our troubles -- all the violence

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:51.619
and obesity and illness, all the depression
and greed we can't overcome -- began when

00:13:51.619 --> 00:13:55.709
we stopped living as a running people.
If you deny your nature, it will erupt in

00:13:55.709 --> 00:14:04.399
some other, uglier way.
[talking] What Vigil was on to was this really

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:09.930
strange correlation between sports and social
living.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:16.430
The Tarahumara are remarkable for three things.
Number one, when the Conquistadors arrived

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.850
in Mexico, back in the 1600s, you basically
had two choices: You either fight back or

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.779
haul ass.
The Mayans and the Aztecs fought back, which

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:27.630
is why you see very few Mayans and Aztecs
anymore.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.829
The Tarahumara just turned around and took
off.

00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:35.839
They disappeared down into this vast, spider-webbing
network of canyons -- one of the most inaccessible

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:39.430
places on the planet.
And they've essentially been there ever since

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.740
 -- unchanged -- living the same way they
have for tens of thousands of years.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:49.459
So essentially, you can look at them as this
born-again Smithsonian exhibit.

00:14:49.459 --> 00:14:53.690
Nothing has changed since the Stone Age for
the Tarahumara.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.889
That's thing number one.
Number two, their running ability has been

00:14:56.889 --> 00:15:01.769
fabled throughout history.
Periodically, people would come across the

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:07.110
Tarahumara hundreds of miles from the canyons.
These guys would tear off on 300 and 400-mile

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.819
runs -- not just for a purpose, you know,
like the Navahos used to have a whole system

00:15:11.819 --> 00:15:14.959
of messengers.
The Tarahumara essentially did it for fun.

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:19.119
Their recreational games were these super-long,
endurance contests.

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:22.300
You know, we won a marathon?
They'll run ten marathons back to back to

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.059
back, for fun, as a game.
That's number two.

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:29.990
Number three -- and this is where Vigil was
really intrigued.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:38.410
The Tarahumara are free from crime, violence,
warfare, heart disease, high cholesterol,

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:44.110
diabetes, clinical depression, high blood
pressure, domestic abuse.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:49.380
Everything that we in the western world are
spending billions trying to eradicate -- things

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.780
people are winning Nobel prizes for -- these
dudes sussed out thousands of years ago, and

00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:00.200
have never had a problem ever since.
So you can see this as some kind of quirky,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.329
indigenous, kind of eugenic society where
everything is beautiful.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:08.040
Or, you can be like Vigil and say, "These
things aren't coincidences."

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.949
If you have two outliers in one community,
there's a cause and effect there; it's not

00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:14.569
a coincidence.
The people who run the most, and people who

00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:19.009
are the healthiest -- not just physically,
but psychologically and socially -- have got

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:23.779
some kind of ancient wisdom going on.
That's what he wanted to find out.

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:27.459
Unfortunately, he was 70 years old and on
the verge of having triple bypass.

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:32.720
So that was it for Vigil's possibility of
going down into the canyons.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.579
Luckily, I was much younger and dumber than
he was at the time.

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:40.819
So I thought I could just fly on down there,
get some quotes, get the hell out, have my

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:44.559
article, and be done with it.
What I didn't realize is, these Copper Canyons

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:49.139
 -- you know, it's -- the way you remain a
reclusive tribe is by, number one, being a

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:53.790
place that's really hard to get to, and number
two, not answering any questions when strangers

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.420
show up.
I found myself down at the bottom of the canyons,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:05.610
and I actually had the luck to locate a hidden
home of a guy named Arnulfo Quimare, one of

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:10.250
the greatest, living, Tarahumara runners.
His home is so concealed that, if you were

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.380
standing on it right now, you would not realize
it's there.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:18.180
It is totally blended into the landscape.
I actually got there, found this hidden home.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.730
Arnulfo happened to be there -- wasn't off
on a 400-mile run.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.000
He happened to be right there.
It was two o'clock in the afternoon.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.630
We sat down. I looked him in the eye.
I started to ask my question, and for the

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.430
next four hours, he said absolutely nothing
 -- just stared at me, and then his eyes would

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:38.980
just sort of drift off like, you know, maybe
heard something, but kind of wished he hadn't.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.780
And this went on and on and on for hours.
He just wouldn't talk.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.950
And finally, the guy who was guiding said,
"Let's get out of here."

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.030
So, we got up, and we sort of retreated.
And there's nowhere else to go.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.220
So we went deeper into the canyons, and we
found this little Tarahumara schoolhouse.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.010
And there's a schoolteacher there, who's half-Mexican,
half-Tarahumara -- one of the few guys from

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.530
the tribe who'd ever actually left and gone
to the outside world.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.690
And he gave us a place to stay for the night
and a little bowl of beans.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.360
And he tried to console me by saying, "Well,
what do you expect, you know?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.950
They're not going to talk to you.
These guys -- they are so private that you'd

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.510
have to be down here for years.
You'd have to be down here about as long as

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.780
the White Horse before they're going to talk."
I'm sort of eating my beans going, "Okay,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.640
yeah. I see your point. Wait -- what White
Horse?"

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.890
And he tells me this story about some mysterious
guy who had appeared down the canyons 15 years

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:37.360
ago -- just came running on into the settlement,
essentially naked, pair of sandals, pair of

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.850
shorts, and got a cup of water and a little
bit of food, and then disappeared again, off

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.890
into the canyons.
And he would periodically reappear.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.800
And over the months and the years, he'd become
friendly with the Tarahumara.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.430
And bit by bit, they had sort of absorbed
him into the tribe, and looked at him as kind

00:18:52.430 --> 00:19:00.530
of like this sort of freaky, you know, foreign,
ghostly half-cousin.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:05.380
All they knew about this guy was, he wasn't
from down there, and he had been there for

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.610
long enough where he actually had absorbed
the same secrets of the Tarahumara I was trying

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.320
to figure out.
So they said, "You go find the White Horse,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.781
and you'll find your answers."
Sounded really good at the time, you know,

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:20.290
until you step back and you look up at these
vast canyons and realize there's one dude

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.630
out there somewhere and even they didn't know
where he was, and they'd known him for 15

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.200
years.
Defying all odds -- and I sort of get into

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.340
this in detail in the book how it actually
turned out, but I actually located this guy.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.660
And he is just as reclusive as the Tarahumara,
except for one thing.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.230
At that point, he realized that the thing
he was there to discover, was on the verge

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.890
of being extinguished.
You know, the Tarahumara only number about

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:49.310
40,000 today.
Of that 40,000, only a small minority still

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.820
practice the ancient running traditions.
And what this guy -- the White Horse, Caballo

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.230
Blanco -- realized was that, in his lifetime,
that candle could be extinguished.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:04.590
That secret -- that synergy between the way
the body operates and the way society operates

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:09.060
that Vigil wanted to find out could be gone
in our lifetime.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.920
So this guy, the White Horse, had this plan.
What he wanted to do was find people like

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.740
him.
Now, think about that right there too.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.440
You know, a guy who lives by himself in the
bottom of the canyon wants to find other people

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.910
like him out there in the world, bring them
down to the canyons, and set up a 50-mile

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:33.230
race between this sort of elite group of specially
sort of karmically-screened, American runners

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.360
and the Tarahumara.
Again, seems like a good idea until you realize,

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.820
"I just met one of these guys.
This dude wouldn't even talk to me, let alone

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.060
hike 30-miles through the canyons for a 50-mile
race."

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.900
But that was his plan.
And I really wanted to be a part of it, despite

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.360
the obstacles that -- There's no way in hell
you can have this race; No way racers were

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.510
going to show up; and There's no way I could
do it.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:03.960
I couldn't run a mile, let alone 50-miles.
But I became really intrigued by something

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.630
I learned from the White Horse.
In the time I'd met him, he was in his 50's.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:16.290
But the time he came down to the canyons,
he was almost a bizarrely like _____ for me.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.650
He was the same age I was at that moment.
He was the same height. He was the same shoe

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.170
size.
And he had the same running injuries.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.090
And what he was telling me was, when he went
down to the canyons, he was in his like, late

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:31.900
30's, early 40's -- and had busted up ankles
and feet, had always wanted to run, but had

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.190
given it up.
And then, within a few months, he was running

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.260
like wild fire.
And he actually took me out for a little jog,

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.320
just to show me what he meant.
And the kind of running he did was unlike

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.210
any kind of running I'd ever seen in my life.
I don't know if you've ever been out here

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.650
for like, the New York City Marathon, and
you watch 50,000 people go by, and it's like

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.700
50,000 different running styles, you know?
Everyone's sort of grimacing, pushing along.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.440
And the only thing they have in common is,
they're all miserable.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.840
[laughter] But I watched this dude, Caballo,
and this guy is in his 50's.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.850
And we went up this steep trail.
And he went up -- it looked like he was running

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.010
downhill instead of uphill.
It was like smoke going up into the air, just

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.410
[chuu chuu chuu chuu] this slid on up the
hill.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.490
And it looked exactly like some of the Tarahumara
children I'd seen the day before.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:24.340
Here's a guy in his 50's, running like five-year-olds,
not just with the same joyfulness and elasticity,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.440
but with the same exact style.
And, again, I'm just used to being told, "You

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.690
run the way you run."
You know, there's no right or wrong way.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.540
You just run the way you run.
Some of you pronate, some of you supinate,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.000
heel to toe.
Doesn't matter what the hell you do.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.180
You just run the way you run, and you buy
the right shoe.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.690
I'm watching this dude, who basically is not
even in shoes.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:47.450
He's in this crappy, old pair of sandals.
And somehow, coincidentally or not, his running

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:52.140
biomechanics -- the way he is running -- looks
identical to a five-year-old I'd seen the

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.220
day before.
And I sort of think, "There's something here,

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.570
you know?
Maybe there actually is a right way to do

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.790
this thing.
And maybe that's the first step toward unlocking

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.980
the secret of the Tarahumara."
It's the simplest thing of all.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.930
You learn how to do it right, and everything
else falls in place.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.500
So that became my ambition.
I wanted to come back to the States, spend

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:16.430
nine months training for this race to see
if I could learn how to run like a Tarahumara,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:22.420
and turn myself into kind of like a 21st century
Caballo Blanco, and go back for that race.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.870
And see if, just by learning the motion -- you
know, there's the theory of psychology that

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.731
if you want to be happy, the first step is
just to 'act happy', you know?

00:23:29.731 --> 00:23:35.230
Just smile a lot, and then you actually become
happy by mimicking the behavior of someone

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.290
who is happy.
That's what I wanted to do.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.850
If I could mimic the behavior of the Tarahumara,
maybe I could get the rest of the benefits.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.690
So things are kind of cool, except for one
thing.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.340
Nine months later, I actually -- through this
whole process I described -- had actually

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.590
learned how to run like a Tarahumara.
I was ready to go back down to the canyons,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.490
but I was still missing two things.
Number one was, no other racers.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.660
It was just basically me, this old dude, and
maybe or maybe not a bunch of Indians -- still

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.310
to be determined.
There were no racers.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:07.510
And secondly, you know, I still had not gotten
the spirit of the thing. You know?

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:12.120
I'd done the motions and the behavior, but
I still didn't quite get what the cause and

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.260
effect was.
And then, I made this phone call to this girl

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.670
named Jenn Shelton.
I was researching an article about ultra runners

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:24.550
for Runners World Magazine.
And I called up Jenn Shelton, because she

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:30.990
is one of the few runners who is in her 20's,
and is still doing these long races.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.390
I may have lost my page here so I may not
be able to do it. [pause]

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:46.370
What was intriguing to me about Jenn was that
her first race that she ever ran in her life

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:52.070
wasn't a 5K -- wasn't a 10K, wasn't a marathon
 -- it was a 50-mile race, a trail race.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:56.920
She went out there in a pair of surf baggies
and a cotton sweatshirt and broke the course

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.330
record.
She was 19 years old at the time.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:04.600
So I call her up on the phone to find out
why she was wasting her time as a teenager

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.050
running these races on Saturday nights.
So I said to her, "So why not marathons? Don't

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:14.870
you think you could qualify for the Olympics?"
She goes, "Dude, seriously. The qualifying

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:21.350
standard is 248. Anybody can do that."
Jenn could run a sub-three-hour marathon while

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:27.000
wearing a string bikini and chugging a beer
at mile 23, and she would, just five days

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.330
after running a 50-mile trail race in the
Blue Ridge Mountains.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:34.001
Yeah, but then what?
I hate all this hype about the marathon. Where's

00:25:34.001 --> 00:25:37.720
the mystery?
I know this girl who's training for the trials,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.833
and she's got every single workout planned
for like, the next three years.

00:25:40.833 --> 00:25:44.270
She's doing speed work on the track like every
day.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.990
I couldn't take it man.
I was supposed to run with her once at six

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:51.480
in the morning, and I called her up at two
a.m. to tell her I was shit-faced on margaritas

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:57.020
and probably not going to make it.
Jenn didn't have a coach or training program.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.410
She didn't even own a watch.
She just rolled out of bed every morning,

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:05.020
downed the veggie burger, and ran as far and
as fast as she felt like -- which usually

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.680
turned out to be about 20-miles.
So she says to me, "You know, I never really

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.740
discussed this with anyone, because it sounds
pretty pretentious, but I started running

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.600
ultras to become a better person."
I thought, "Man, if you could run a hundred

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.660
miles, you'd be in this zen state.
You'd be the fucking Buddha bringing peace

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.350
and a smile to the world."
In my case, it didn't work.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.240
I'm the same old punk-ass as ever, but there's
always a hope that it would turn you into

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.370
the person you want to be -- a better, more
peaceful person.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.610
She kept going on.
"You know, when I'm out on a long run, the

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.340
only thing at life that matters is finishing
the run.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.590
For once my brain isn't going blah, blah,
blah.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.150
Everything quiets down.
And the only thing going on is pure flow.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.530
It's just me and the movement and the motion.
That's what I love.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.360
Just being a barbarian, running through the
woods.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.410
You know, listening to Jenn was like communing
with the ghost of Caballo Blanco.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:04.490
So, I said to her, "You know, it's weird how
much you sound like this guy I met in Mexico.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:08.610
I'm heading down there in a few weeks for
this race he's putting on with the Tarahumara."

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.630
"No way!"
"And I think Scott Jurek" -- you know, the

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.150
greatest ultra-distance runner in the world,
I think there's a chance he may be there too."

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:20.240
"You're shitting me!" the budding Buddha exclaimed.
"Really? Can me and my friend go? Oh shit,

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.270
we got midterms. Hang on. I'm going to have
to pull a fast one on them. Give me till tomorrow."

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.580
And the next morning, as promised, I got this
message from Jenn.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.570
"My mom thinks you're a serial killer who's
going to murder us in the desert."

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.570
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.690
Chris McDougall: "It's totally worth the risk.
So where do we meet you guys?"

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:45.160
So that was it. That became the genesis.
A couple days later, against all odds, I suddenly

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:52.600
found myself in El Paso, Texas, with Jenn,
who gave herself a black eye; Billy Bonehead

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.710
Barnett, who passed out in my bathtub; a guy
named Barefoot Ted, who trained by running

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.100
barefoot in the streets of Burbank pulling
his wife and daughter in a rickshaw; guy named

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.731
Scott Jurek, who actually is a legitimate
runner, a 7-time winner of the Western States

00:28:06.731 --> 00:28:12.370
100, course record holder for the Badwater
ultra marathon Death Valley, and myself.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:19.460
And we ended up heading down for this race
with the Tarahumara and Caballo Blanco.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.590
Every step of the way I assumed was going
to be the last step, especially when -- on

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:29.450
his first day as a guide -- Caballo lost two
out of the six people that were part of his

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.920
group.
But eventually, he actually pulled off this

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.920
race.
And it was beyond anything I could have expected.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:40.861
Rather than it being one of these head-to-head,
drudge matchs where, you know, each runner

00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:46.080
blazes off for glory, it ended up becoming
like one of these old time, guitar-picker

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.241
battles, you know, where people sort of swap
chords back and forth and sort of learn from

00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:56.570
each other and then, gradually things build
and build and build until they're both competing

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.670
with the same song, with the same techniques
back and forth -- that's what it became.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:06.950
Rather than "Americans vs. Indians", it became
two groups learning from each other, and then,

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.080
once they had adopted each other's techniques,
then going at it.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:15.410
And by the time I got back, I felt like I
was on to something much deeper and broader

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.890
and more complex than I ever imagined.
It was not about a sport.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:25.050
It was really about a way of life -- about
how this human animal has developed and what

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.140
it's meant to be.
And I'm always left with this analogy about,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.501
you know -- you take an animal and you stick
it in a zoo and look what happens, you know?

00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:38.050
That animal becomes kind of antisocial and
grumpy and lethargic and sexually dysfunctional

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:43.220
and has eating disorders and essentially -- I
don't want to point any fingers, but -- like

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.780
us, you know?
Then you take that animal out, and you put

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.930
it back into its natural setting -- where
it's designed to do all these mechanisms are

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.030
meant for -- and suddenly, it's a whole different
creature, you know?

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:59.340
Much less aggressive, much less cannibalistic,
not competing against its species, but with

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.590
its species. Much calmer.
And that's what I think we found ourselves

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.330
today, you know?
We forget that we are, you know, all this

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.430
great digital stuff around us, but we're basically
animals.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:16.100
And if that animal gets an opportunity to
use its body the way it was intended, things

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.830
fall into place.
When we lose that opportunity, then we start

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.300
to have problems.
And we can dismiss the Tarahumara as being

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:30.270
this kind of quirky, funky, ancient, indigenous
tribe that has nothing to do with us.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:34.380
Or, we can look at them and say, you know,
"Let's be humble and realize that there are

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.700
some serious transferable skills that we need
to look for, or else we're going to continue

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.590
to suffer the consequences that we see all
around us today."

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.930
So thanks a lot guys.
I hope that was worthwhile.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.090
And if you have any questions, fire away.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.090
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.090
Chris McDougall: Yeah.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.090
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:57.610
Chris McDougall: He's telling me how handsome
I am.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:04.400
&gt;&gt; Could you use the mic to for questions?
It's right over there.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.360
Chris McDougall: I'm doing fine without you.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.360
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.590
Chris McDougall: You're talking about my good
looks and _______

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:20.490
Q I was saying I got a chance to read the
book and found it wonderful as a historian,

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.490
as a running inspiration, as a runner who's
marvelous in that respect.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:26.950
One of the parts of the book is quite sad
is that, any observation of the Tarahumara

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:32.410
is going to impact on them.
And I was interested to know, What's happened

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.060
to them since the book's come out?
And the attention that may have been drawn

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.690
to them as a result of the book?

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.990
Chris McDougall: Yeah, that's a great question.
And it's exactly the question that Caballo

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:48.060
wrestled with for a long time before he decided
to launch this race.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.190
You know, the Tarahumara have voluntarily
lived in seclusion.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:54.600
That's the way they wanted it.
And so, to have some arrogant outsider show

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.560
up and say, "Here's what you need is this
race."

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.870
Caballo always said, "They don't need anything.
They're doing fine on their own."

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:06.130
He offered to them; they accepted.
If they weren't interested, they would not

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.970
turn up for the race.
Caballo's thinking is, "Look, they're backs

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.930
are against the wall.
The Mexican government keeps pushing roads

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.810
in here.
The drug cartels are dominating the region.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:21.050
It's a great place to grow drugs, because
you can't get helicopters or SUVs down there,

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:26.260
so drug enforcement can't get down there.
You can grab the Tarahumara and dragoon them

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.680
into carrying drugs out of the canyon.
Six bodies a week were turning up in the canyon

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.370
being tossed off the edges of the cliffs.
So Caballo's thought was, "Look, yeah. This

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.690
is a gamble. This is a risk.
But, it's an appreciable risk, because the

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:47.640
payoff could be this validation of the Tarahumara
as the custodians of this lost art.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.650
That maybe he could turn into sort of this
U.N. sort of cultural buffer zone around them,

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:59.350
where their techniques will be appreciated,
and that area will be sealed off and left

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:04.070
for them to run in.
So, it's definitely a gamble, and he recognizes

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.550
that.
And he's not convinced he's doing the right

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:11.030
thing, but he hopes so.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.731
Q Thank you.

00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:14.731
Chris McDougall: Sure thing.

00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:15.731
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:33:15.731 --> 00:33:18.110
Q You mentioned a unique style of running.
Can you describe it, or show it to us?

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.110
Chris McDougall: Oh. The way they run?

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.110
Q Yeah.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:22.320
Chris McDougall: Yeah. And I'll tell you,
if you had a five-year-old here, he could

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:28.230
show you a lot better than I can.
It's bizarre how complicated we make the simple

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.080
thing.
You know, when you think about all the animals

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.880
on Earth.
There's only two that wear shoes -- us, and

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.110
the ones we hold down and nail it to their
feet.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.370
Nobody else wears shoes.
No other animal wears shoes, and yet, they

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.570
seem to do just fine.
Kids could give a crap what's on their feet,

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:47.710
and they do just fine.
The way you run naturally is to run just like

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:51.290
any kid does.
Or put it this way, if you take your shoes

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:55.460
off right now and you go outside on the sidewalk,
you will learn how to run efficiently really

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.620
fast.
Because any movement you do that hurts, you

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.790
won't do twice.
And I can demonstrate if you want, but it's

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.880
a real simple thing.
Basically, instead of using your heel -- Why

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.290
on earth would you ever land on your heel?
If I jump off this thing on to the ground,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:15.690
the last thing I want to land on is my bony
heel with my legs straight.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.799
Running is essentially jumping. It's a series
of controlled jumps.

00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:22.190
So when you jump, you know, you want to land
on the balls of your feet and bend your knees

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:26.159
for shock absorption. Real simple.
You can't bend your knees if your leg's in

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.879
front of you.
You can't bend it if your heel's like this.

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:33.980
That's painful. This is not painful.
So natural running technique is, essentially,

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.279
to land on the ball of your foot, touch your
heel down, and lift the foot behind like that.

00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:41.919
It's all you're essentially doing is falling
forward through space -- kind of like you're

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:46.869
like, belly-flopping into a pool or skydiving.
And, as you fall, you put a foot in front

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:50.009
of you as you come around -- and that's it.
It's so simple.

00:34:50.009 --> 00:34:55.519
I can get everybody outside and, in ten minutes,
teach it to you and you can, you know, you'll

00:34:55.519 --> 00:34:59.319
have it mastered.
Does that help?

00:34:59.319 --> 00:35:00.579
Q Yep.

00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:06.730
Q Hi. Thank you.
I apologize if you answered these questions

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.512
already, but I was wondering -- I've been
trying qi running lately, and my calfs are

00:35:10.512 --> 00:35:11.512
burning, so I was wondering if you had any
suggestions there.

00:35:11.512 --> 00:35:15.109
And then, two was, Do you have any mantras,
because I've been trying effortless, but I

00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:17.589
wanted to hear what you think about.

00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:20.300
Chris McDougall: Yeah. There's a couple good
ones.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.880
The thing about the burning calfs is, take
a day off.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.721
You know, if you go to the gym today and tomorrow
you're sore, take a day off.

00:35:27.721 --> 00:35:32.410
I think the thing with running is, people
are expecting pain -- they're expecting it

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.029
to hurt -- and, at the first sign of pain,
they assume that's an injury.

00:35:36.029 --> 00:35:37.930
That's not an injury; that's just muscular
soreness.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:43.309
So yeah qi is really good.
So is pose, evolution -- all these running

00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:46.489
methods which are teaching to run the ball
of your foot are fine.

00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:49.960
Just be patient with it.
I think -- the best advice I got was from

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.819
a guy named Barefoot Ken Bob, who said, "The
best way to learn is to let your feet tell

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:57.490
you."
The problem with trying to learn how to run

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.569
with your shoes on is, you're not getting
any feedback.

00:36:00.569 --> 00:36:02.071
So when you do something wrong, you're not
sure.

00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:04.720
You're constantly trying to sort of second
guess what your body is doing.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.329
When you're in your bare feet like, you know
instantly that's right or wrong.

00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:10.710
So I would say -- Are you using shoes to -- ?

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.710
Q Yes. [laughing]

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.839
Chris McDougall: Take them off. Honestly,
take them off.

00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:19.150
I was very slow -- I had to break a toe and
couldn't get my feet into shoes before I learned

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.000
that lesson.
And then, when I tried to run with that broken

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.170
toe, I had to go barefoot.
The difference is unbelievable -- the amount

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:30.359
of feedback you get.
If your posture is a little bit off in shoes,

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:33.309
you don't notice it.
In your feet, it hurts. So you just change.

00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:36.299
You become much more erect.
Your feet's down underneath your hips.

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:39.829
So, number one, I would definitely go barefoot
to practice.

00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:46.299
Number two, again, something else Barefoot
Ken Bob said is that, "When in doubt, relax."

00:36:46.299 --> 00:36:49.470
If your stiffness or soreness, you are tense
somewhere.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:54.099
Just sag into it, relax, breathe out.
Your body should feel light and weightless.

00:36:54.099 --> 00:36:58.430
I mean, kids love the feeling of weightlessness.
And if you ever want to see if a motion is

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:02.460
biomechanically efficient, figure out whether
a kid or a boxer does it. You know?

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.849
You watch boxers, how they move -- light and
loose, bouncing, right?

00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:08.750
Same with kids.
Kids love to be on trampolines and swings

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.420
and things like that.
They like to feel weightless, and your running

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.670
should feel the same way.
So, when in doubt, relax.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:19.349
Caballo's thing was "easy, light, smooth,
and fast."

00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:23.069
Focus on 'easy' first, because if that's all
you get, that ain't so bad.

00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:27.849
Then work on 'light', then 'smooth', and when
you have all those three things, then worry

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:30.099
about 'fast'.
Most people do the opposite.

00:37:30.099 --> 00:37:34.990
They go with 'fast' first, and then try to
make it easy. He says, "Reverse that."

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.190
So good luck.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.390
Q Any mantra?

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:42.519
Chris McDougall: You know, pretty much not.
Those things, "When in doubt, relax."

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:47.349
"Easy, light, smooth and fast."
But, I just find running -- yeah, I just do

00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:50.849
it, you know?
I just sort of see what's out there and have

00:37:50.849 --> 00:37:52.759
a good time.
Sure, thanks.

00:37:52.759 --> 00:37:55.490
Q Hi. I thought your book was excellent.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.490
Chris McDougall: Thanks.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:00.509
Q It was very inspiring as a runner.
In the book, you speak a lot about the Running

00:38:00.509 --> 00:38:03.559
Man Theory, about why we run -- or why we
originally ran.

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:07.410
Could you just elaborate on that maybe a little
bit for people that haven't read the book?

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.680
Chris McDougall: Yeah. I was debating whether
to get into that in this talk too, but it

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:17.940
can sort of octopus out in so many directions.
But it's essentially this.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:23.599
The idea of the Running Man Theory is that,
you know, running is not something we just

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:28.809
sort of picked up like we developed bungee
jumping or triathlons or cycling.

00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:31.650
Running is actually what we are genetically
designed to do.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.970
It is our number one, dominant characteristic
as an animal.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:40.839
And it's based on a couple of mysteries in
human history which have never been solved.

00:38:40.839 --> 00:38:44.210
Number one is this one too.
Two million years ago, the human brain exploded

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.710
in size, you know.
Australopithecus had this tiny, little, peanut

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.839
brain.
And suddenly, we get these big old, melon

00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:53.680
heads about two million years ago.
You can only support a brain of that size

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:59.609
if that organism has a regular source of dense
caloric energy.

00:38:59.609 --> 00:39:04.900
Essentially, homo erectus was eating dead
animals, having animal protein -- scientific

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.259
fact.
Two million years ago, we're eating dead animals.

00:39:07.259 --> 00:39:11.660
The only problem is, the first weapon only
appeared 200,000 years ago.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.480
So somehow, you've got a gap with about two
million years -- somehow we're getting food

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.839
with no weapons to kill the animals.
We're obviously not using our like, little

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:20.549
sissy weapons, because we've got nothing,
you know?

00:39:20.549 --> 00:39:22.940
We got no claws, no fangs, no strength, no
speed.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:28.369
I mean, Usain Bolt is the fastest human in
history, and a squirrel can outrun Usain Bolt.

00:39:28.369 --> 00:39:34.569
[laughter] So how are we getting these dead
animals with no weapons?

00:39:34.569 --> 00:39:39.380
The Running Man Theory is, we were essentially
running animals to death -- that, what made

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:44.109
human life viable two million years ago -- and
for a long time -- was the fact that we had

00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:47.200
these unique characteristics as long distance
runners.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:53.470
We were hunting pack animals.
Most animals vent heat by respiration -- they

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.990
breathe it out.
We vent heat predominantly by perspiration.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.209
Which means that, if you're running against
a horse, at about ten miles, that horse has

00:40:00.209 --> 00:40:01.400
a choice.
It's either going to breathe or it's going

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.740
to cool off, but it ain't doing both.
We can.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.049
There's a lot of other sort of physiological
components of this.

00:40:09.049 --> 00:40:17.940
What I find most intriguing about the Running
Man Theory is that the way we do this is not

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.140
an individual.
You don't go up by yourself and run an animal

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.180
to death.
It had to be a pack.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.921
The pack has to hunt together.
It's the only way it's going to work, which

00:40:25.921 --> 00:40:30.869
means old people, young people, men and women.
And what you find is that, if that theory

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:37.350
is true, it essentially gives you a culture
much like the Tarahumara.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:42.150
The hunting pack theory to be accurate, that
means that old people can run as well as young

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.200
people.
And that's actually born out by marathon finishing

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.529
times.
People who are in their 60's are still running

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:51.339
the same speed they were running back when
they were 19, 20 years old.

00:40:51.339 --> 00:40:56.650
You don't lose your top-end speed in endurance
contests for 45 years, unlike any other physical

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:59.089
activity.
You get into long distances, you know -- women

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:03.660
as sprinters, you guys suck; you're the worst.
There's not a fast woman sprinter ever.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:07.349
There are high school kids today that can
beat the fastest woman of all time.

00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:13.190
Even as milers, you guys are worse than mediocre.
The fastest woman miler did a 4:15.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:17.680
Again, I could throw a rock and hit a high
school boy somewhere in New York who can run

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.329
faster than 4:15.
But, you get to 50-miles or a hundred miles,

00:41:21.329 --> 00:41:25.560
and suddenly, it's anybody's game.
The top female ultra marathoners can beat

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:34.289
any guy on the planet in a head-to-head contest.
Emily Baer, back in 2008, was in the Hard

00:41:34.289 --> 00:41:39.220
Rock 100, one of the toughest 100-mile races.
She finished in the top ten while stopping

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:44.339
to breast-feed her baby at the aid stations.
[laughter] So she beat basically 500 of the

00:41:44.339 --> 00:41:49.070
best, male, ultra runners on planet Earth,
while breast-feeding her kid on a super-hard

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.569
100-mile course.
So you have all these little bits of circumstantial

00:41:52.569 --> 00:41:55.690
evidence out there.
The fact that, as distances get longer, women

00:41:55.690 --> 00:42:01.569
get stronger, that old guys never lose their
top-end speed, that we vent this heat, that

00:42:01.569 --> 00:42:08.499
we have all this elastic recoil in our legs.
All those things add up to a picture of humans

00:42:08.499 --> 00:42:12.099
as being designed to be basically like a pack
of dogs, you know?

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:16.499
When you live like that pack of dogs, you
can't be greedy, you can't be covetous, you

00:42:16.499 --> 00:42:20.849
can't hold grudges and be pissed off at the
other guy, because you've got to function

00:42:20.849 --> 00:42:24.450
as a pack.
Essentially, that left us with what the Tarahumara

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.830
still are today.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:27.830
Q Thanks.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.460
Chris McDougall: Sure thing.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.599
Q Hi. I have two questions, actually.
One is, Are there any similarities between

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:39.890
the Tarahumara and other tribes known for
running, like the Kenyans are very famous

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.720
runners and others.
Have you studied them?

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.990
And are there similarities?

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:48.030
Chris McDougall: Yeah. What's kind of cool
about this Running Man Theory is that -- it

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:52.279
was both cool and vexing at the same time
 -- when these anthropologists at Utah and

00:42:52.279 --> 00:42:56.410
Harvard developed this theory that humans
ran animals to death.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.970
You know, anything is great in theory.
I can have a theory that "if you flap your

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.509
arms, you're going to fly," but you got to
find someone who can actually do it, or else

00:43:02.509 --> 00:43:07.730
the theory ain't worth a damn.
So if humans are physiologically capable in

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.849
theory of running an animal to death, there
should be some human out there somewhere on

00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:14.480
planet Earth that can do it.
And they actually found them in the Kalahari

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.440
bushmen -- to this day still do the same thing.
They still run animals to death.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:23.611
And you find tales throughout all -- basically
every indigenous culture on the planet -- the

00:43:23.611 --> 00:43:27.329
aborigines, the Hopi Indians, the Navahos,
the Seris.

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:30.740
Around the planet, there are all tales of
people who ran animals to death.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.609
To this day, Hopi and Navaho still have long
running rituals and traditions.

00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:42.549
So, yeah, there are sort of markers throughout
the planet of people who still practice the

00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:43.900
same things.
You mentioned that the Kenyans there -- one

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.710
thing I should be sure to distinguish.
A lot of times people say to me, "Yeah. Listen,

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:51.460
if these guys are such hot shit, how come
they're not winning the Olympic marathon?"

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:57.819
You know, Kenyans have become specialists
at a really artificial form of running.

00:43:57.819 --> 00:44:02.150
We've taken an endurance event -- the marathon
 -- we've basically turned it into a sprint.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:06.301
They have -- same way Jamaicans are very good
at sprinting, and guys from Lake Placid are

00:44:06.301 --> 00:44:13.319
very good at bobsledding -- Kenyans have taken
certain natural and geographical advantages

00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:19.720
and made themselves specialists in a real,
artificial form of competition.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:25.160
So if you took a bunch of Tarahumara and dropped
them off in the Rift Valley among the Nandi,

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.760
you know, would they run as fast as the Kenyans?
Probably, if they cared to.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.670
But, the Kenyans are really essentially no
different than anybody else.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.799
Physiologically, they're the same.
They're just better, and they work harder

00:44:35.799 --> 00:44:38.930
at doing what we could all do.
Another question, Bill?

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:42.400
Q Yeah, so. I've been experimenting with barefoot
running.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.369
And actually, I feel it's like much more fun
than normal running, because you get a lot

00:44:46.369 --> 00:44:49.579
of sensation in your feet.
But sometimes like, all the sidewalks in my

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:53.970
neighborhood are like this super-bumpy like
kind of gravelly sidewalk, and it's actually

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.019
very painful.
So I find that like, I can't even really run

00:44:57.019 --> 00:44:59.660
in my neighborhood.
If you are running barefoot, like what do

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:04.029
you do when you encounter surfaces like that?

00:45:04.029 --> 00:45:06.930
Chris McDougall: Yeah, I mean you can buy
these things too.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:08.109
Have you seen these things?

00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:09.749
Q Yeah, that's what I have actually.

00:45:09.749 --> 00:45:11.549
Chris McDougall: And these are too painful
for you?

00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:15.420
Q No, no. It's fine with that. I was just
wondering if there's a way to go fully barefoot.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.740
Chris McDougall: Yeah. I mean, I do.
Where I live out in the _____ of Pennsylvania,

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:23.940
it's all paved, asphalt farm roads.
What I do sometimes, if I'm heading off somewhere

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.880
where I don't know what kind of road's ahead,
I'll just jam a pair of these in the back

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:33.440
of my shorts, and so I'll run in my bare feet,
you hit something painful, jam these on, keep

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.279
running, and take them off again.
And think about it too, it's not a question

00:45:35.279 --> 00:45:40.170
of, you know, "shoes vs. bare feet".
It's a question of what your shoes are doing

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:43.339
to your feet.
And, you know, protection is fine up until

00:45:43.339 --> 00:45:47.319
the point where the protection starts to dominate
and control what your foot's doing.

00:45:47.319 --> 00:45:52.420
But some kind of minimal protection of your
feet, you know, Ice Age cavemen were wearing

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.390
their own handcrafted shoes.
So I think that's fine.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:01.199
My beef is with these like, big, supportive,
motion control -- just the fact 'motion control'

00:46:01.199 --> 00:46:05.569
 -- if you hear that word, stay the hell away.
That's my beef with those kind of shoes.

00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:06.569
Q Thanks.

00:46:06.569 --> 00:46:07.569
Chris McDougall: Sure thing. Anybody else?
Yep.

00:46:07.569 --> 00:46:11.609
Q I just like to say thanks for writing the
book.

00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:17.519
I read it back in June, and at that point,
I was on the verge of quitting running, because

00:46:17.519 --> 00:46:23.089
I've had so many chronic injuries.
Since I read that, I went and found a pose

00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:26.299
coach.
Last several months I've been training -- completely

00:46:26.299 --> 00:46:29.039
transformed -- miraculously, all of those
chronic injuries have just disappeared.

00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:32.220
Actually, I've been training with Lee Saxby,
who I think you know, in London.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.559
Chris McDougall: Oh yeah. So you have been
training with Lee Saxby?

00:46:36.559 --> 00:46:39.720
Q Yeah. Actually I have been training sessions
with Lee just last weekend.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.960
Chris McDougall: Oh, good. He's fabulous.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.200
Q Straight away. I think the same thing happened
to you?

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.460
He sort of video-ed me 30 seconds, knew what
the problem was.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.059
Chris McDougall: Mind if I interrupt you and
tell this story?

00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:54.170
Do you mind if I interrupt you and tell them
this story?

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.170
Q Oh, no. No. Please go ahead.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.290
Chris McDougall: Hang on. The one time I've
gotten injured in the past couple of years

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.329
was the time I went back to wearing shoes.
I thought, "Okay, now I run like Caballo,

00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:07.930
I am technologically perfect. I am invulnerable."
I put on a pair of shoes, because we've got

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.319
a lot of snow in Pennsylvania.
And a couple weeks later, I've got this big,

00:47:11.319 --> 00:47:14.362
blinding heel pain.
What in the hell's going on, because I'm on

00:47:14.362 --> 00:47:18.579
the verge of publishing this book about how
you can run injury-free forever -- friggin'

00:47:18.579 --> 00:47:21.400
injured. [laughter]
And I went back to the usual routine, went

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.619
back to the sports medicine doctors and the
podiatrists and they told me the same old

00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:29.150
bullshit that does not work, you know?
"Roll your foot on the golf ball, stretch

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:35.440
the calf, wear an ice plant."
I mean, it's bizarre to me that plantar fasciitis

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.130
is as prevalent -- it's like chlamydia, and
nobody can get rid of this thing.

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:42.559
And these guys just keep dishing out the same
old stuff.

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:46.630
It does not work.
I happened to be in London -- to actually

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.690
go to a seminar -- and someone told me, "Yeah,
you should go see this guy, Lee Saxby. He's

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.839
a running coach."
I'm like, "You understand? I'm perfect. I'm

00:47:52.839 --> 00:47:55.260
the perfect runner.
I've got no problem with my technique. It's

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.759
something else."
I go to see this dude, and he's a smart-ass

00:47:58.759 --> 00:48:01.920
Brit. [laughter]
And he's like, "Let me see your run."

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.329
And I'm like, "All right, fine."
So I run down the sidewalk.

00:48:04.329 --> 00:48:08.920
He videotaped me for like, literally, 30 seconds.
I run from like here to there and back.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.589
He snapped shut the viewfinder, and he's like,
"Okay, you're cured. Problem solved."

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:16.049
I've had this problem now for six months.
I've tried everything.

00:48:16.049 --> 00:48:19.230
So I go, "All right, what is it?"
He's like, "Describe to me the way you run."

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.819
So I described, you know, the perfect Tarahumara
running technique.

00:48:21.819 --> 00:48:25.430
And he's like, "Yeah, look at this."
And he shows me the video.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.599
I'm doing the exact opposite of what I think
I'm doing.

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:32.089
You know, I think I'm leaning forward, with
my feet under my hips, on the ball of my foot.

00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:36.009
Instead, I'm way back here.
My body weight is over my heels, not over

00:48:36.009 --> 00:48:40.009
my hips.
I'm leveraging my body over my ankles like

00:48:40.009 --> 00:48:42.289
that.
And I'm not landing on my forefoot; I'm landing

00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:44.150
on my heel.
But I couldn't sense it.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:47.569
To me, it felt like forefoot is actually banging
on my heel.

00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:53.220
This dude -- hand before God -- you know,
I know it sounded some bizarre, evangelistic,

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.950
'demons be gone' baloney -- this dude cured
me in and out.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.150
I walked out the door, and the heel pain was
gone.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:04.509
It has never come back.
So this is the guy we're talking about -- this

00:49:04.509 --> 00:49:05.509
guy, Lee Saxby.

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:06.660
Q I had the same kind of thing.
I've been training with a pose coach for four

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.700
months now, but I had this problem with calf
pain, and Lee did the exact same thing.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.109
He did it with me in 30 seconds.
That I was bending at the hip, not at the

00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:19.809
ankles.
Anyway, but that was my question.

00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:26.200
So, it's fair to say that I'm very bought
into this idea of us being evolved to run

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:33.740
and to do it in a natural way.
I'm testing the Paleo Diet and these kinds

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.900
of things.
There's one thing that sort of concerns me

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:42.849
about sort of ultra running and ultra distance
events, anything that would be considered

00:49:42.849 --> 00:49:46.769
ultra.
I've read a few things from some -- the guy

00:49:46.769 --> 00:49:54.190
that says evolutionary fitness, primal blueprints.
Some of these guys are also -- have these

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.720
similar ideas that we should train in the
way that [inaudible]

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.720
Chris McDougall: Is that Archivanie?

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.220
Q Yeah, I think that was the guy. I think
he recently posted an article.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.700
I thought it was questionable, but I wanted
to see what you thought -- that marathon running

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.779
is bad for you.
And he cited a few things.

00:50:08.779 --> 00:50:15.200
A couple things that concern me -- it's damaging
to the liver, it's damaging to the kidneys.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:21.890
So the question is, you know, At what point
are we doing things that are artificial like,

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:24.829
you know, running a marathon is not something
that we were evolved for.

00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:30.160
That's highly unlikely scenario in a hunter-gatherer.
You know, you wouldn't just run flat out for

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:36.400
26-miles or whatever it was.
So have you any ideas as to, What is a good

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:42.750
way to tackle ultra events, you know?
Is it to do with intensity?

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:48.940
Is it to do with the distance, you know?
And do you have any thoughts about it's potentially

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:49.940
damaging beyond your mechanics [undecipherable]?

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:56.930
Chris McDougall: Yeah, it's a great question.
I mean, I think I'm not actually a big fan

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:02.599
of big, urban marathons, for that reason.
Because it really creates like, this 'moral

00:51:02.599 --> 00:51:06.470
obligation' to do more than you may want to
 -- or are ready for.

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:10.200
I mean, nowadays, if you start to run, you
make the mistake of telling anybody that you're

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.880
running, the first question out of their mouth
is going to be, "Have you run a marathon?

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:16.514
When are you going to run a marathon?
How fast can you run a marathon?" You know?

00:51:16.514 --> 00:51:21.739
And if you tell them you did a 4-hour marathon
as opposed to 3:59.59 like -- one's great

00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:25.809
and one sucks.
Who gives a shit? Who cares?

00:51:25.809 --> 00:51:30.680
This emphasis on doing this arbitrary distance
in this arbitrary amount of time -- I think

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:36.550
it forces people beyond their capabilities.
I mean, if you're learning how to swim, you

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.640
know?
They don't put you in a pool and show you

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.660
doggie-paddle and go, "Have you swum English
Channel?

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.819
When are you going to swim English Channel?
How fast can you swim the English Channel?"

00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:46.060
You learn how to swim gradually.
It's fun first.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.670
You go off the sliding board and off the diving
board.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:52.829
You play Marco Polo.
And I wish people would learn how to run the

00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:58.260
way they learn how to swim.
One thing about distance running is -- and

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.150
I made this distinction between the way the
Tarahumara run and the way the Kenyans run

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.369
marathons.
You know, we are endurance animals.

00:52:04.369 --> 00:52:08.999
We are not fast. And yet, we emphasize speed
all the time, you know?

00:52:08.999 --> 00:52:11.999
A hundred yard dash, and How fast can you
do a marathon?

00:52:11.999 --> 00:52:17.970
We're not fast. Our strength is not running
like the animals we're trying to kill, you

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:19.430
know?
If you make an animal -- if you try to make

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.150
that animal run as fast as it can, as long
as it can until it dies -- if we do the same

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.210
thing, we'd have two corpses out there on
this event.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:31.650
What we're really good at is, surge and recover,
surge and recover -- go hard and back off

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.660
again.
It's funny, there's a guy named Jeff Galloway,

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:39.499
who came up with this form of running marathons,
where you basically run ten minutes, and walk

00:52:39.499 --> 00:52:42.079
a minute -- run ten, walk one.
This guy gets blistered all the time.

00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:45.319
People are, "Agh, that's not running."
That's exactly what running is supposed to

00:52:45.319 --> 00:52:49.369
be, surge and recover.
So this whole question of whether marathons

00:52:49.369 --> 00:52:54.319
are damaging.
You know, I think the anthropological evidence

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:58.549
is pretty strong that we evolved -- I mean,
for instance, to run an antelope to death

00:52:58.549 --> 00:53:01.299
 -- you know how long that takes?
Two to five hours.

00:53:01.299 --> 00:53:08.769
I mean, it's bizarre how the heat frustration
time for big game exactly correlates to the

00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:13.470
finishing times for marathon.
So, if you look down from, you know, Mars

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:17.049
on November first, and you see like tens of
thousands of people running through Queens,

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:19.229
I mean, it would look like some bizarre animal
panic.

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:25.039
Yet, somehow we feel this atavistic desire
to gather in large groups and run for two

00:53:25.039 --> 00:53:29.819
to five hours.
So, my speculation -- it's not fact; it's

00:53:29.819 --> 00:53:32.420
speculation -- is that, this is what we're
designed to do.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:36.880
So, it's good for us.
But, through training and acclimation, and

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.809
not just by, you know, moral obligation.

00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:48.789
Q But if you do it right and recover properly,
then there's no reason to -- those people

00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:52.319
maybe go to marathons without training [inaudible]

00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:56.309
Chris McDougall: Yeah. I mean, I like the
way -- I like the whole culture of ultra running.

00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:59.589
Even though people are running a hundred miles,
it's so much more relaxed.

00:53:59.589 --> 00:54:02.210
Nobody gives a crap how fast you run a hundred
miles.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.579
They can't believe you did it. [laughter]
So, you know?

00:54:05.579 --> 00:54:09.019
And the thing about ultras too, is again,
it's really kind of cool to the whole hunting

00:54:09.019 --> 00:54:11.239
pack thing.
You can't run an ultra by yourself.

00:54:11.239 --> 00:54:13.599
You need to have support there.
You need to have a pacer.

00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:17.609
You need to have friends waiting to give you
like M &amp; M's at the 15-mile mark.

00:54:17.609 --> 00:54:22.519
There's something very comforting and social
and group-oriented and non-competitive about

00:54:22.519 --> 00:54:25.999
ultras as opposed to marathons, which are
all about like -- [deet] [deet] [deet] [deet],

00:54:25.999 --> 00:54:28.990
you know, and like just sprint and pass the
other guy at the finish line, so.

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:34.380
Again, I think Barefoot Ken Bob's advice is
the best, "when in doubt, relax" -- and you'll

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.510
be fine.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:36.630
Q [inaudible]

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:39.460
Chris McDougall: Sure. Thank you.

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:44.809
Q Thanks for coming today.
So, you know, you've talked a lot about technique.

00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:47.299
And this is very important.
I've done Pose myself.

00:54:47.299 --> 00:54:53.660
I realize, you know -- video analysis, working
with a coach -- it's pretty critical to really

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:57.309
making the shift away from being a heel-striker
to running naturally.

00:54:57.309 --> 00:55:03.650
Do you support any one program to do this?
Do you suggest, you know, a certain path that

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:06.359
people go on to relearn how to run?

00:55:06.359 --> 00:55:07.529
Chris McDougall: Absolutely, buy this book,
number one.

00:55:07.529 --> 00:55:13.420
Step one. [laughter] -- in quantity.
No, I'm sorry, do you want to finish your

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.420
question?

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:16.170
Q Pose. Any other programs that are out there
that people do?

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.510
Any of the certifications or seminars that
happen?

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:23.119
Do you have any that you can recommend that
people do?

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:27.400
Because, I think it sounds great that, you
know, this is a new way to run, but there

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:32.569
is a significant amount of work that has to
be done for people really to relearn how to

00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:34.779
get off of, you know, running on their heels.

00:55:34.779 --> 00:55:36.729
Chris McDougall: Yeah, it's true.
There's a significant amount of work to be

00:55:36.729 --> 00:55:42.049
done, but it's unbelievable how quickly you
can do it.

00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:44.974
Are you guys familiar with the Pose method
that he's referring to?

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:50.009
The Pose method was invented by a guy named
Dr. Nicholas Romanov, who was originally part

00:55:50.009 --> 00:55:55.660
of the Soviet Olympic sports training system.
And he was trying to answer the same questions

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.430
like, You know, we've got every eye here.
We tell them to go faster or do this or that,

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:00.989
but we never actually tell them how they're
supposed to run.

00:56:00.989 --> 00:56:05.059
And so, he started studying the physiology
and the biomechanics of runners.

00:56:05.059 --> 00:56:10.900
And what he found was that, all runners -- no
matter what the distance -- the fastest guys

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.769
are always in the same pose at a certain point.
Like, you can freeze-frame Jesse Owens or

00:56:15.769 --> 00:56:19.710
Usain Bolt or Frank Schroeder -- any runner,
any distance, throughout history -- and at

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:24.190
some point, they're going to have that leg
bent with the foot directly underneath the

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.700
hips and leaning forward, letting gravity
pull them forward.

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.680
This guy named Arthur Lydiard, the great New
Zealand coach, talked about pushers vs. pullers.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:36.950
And he could watch the start of a race -- hundreds
of guys in a cross-country race and he can

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:39.890
go, "That guy ain't going to win. That guy
ain't going to win. That guy might win."

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:43.390
And the reason why was, he was looking for
'pushers' vs. 'pullers'.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:48.089
Pushers are pushing off with muscular strength.
Pullers were just pulling their foot up as

00:56:48.089 --> 00:56:53.210
they fell forward through space.
So Romanov -- back in early 80's, maybe even

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:55.839
earlier -- developed this running method called
the 'pose method'.

00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:59.720
And it's so stinking simple, you can't believe
it.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.819
I actually spent two days with Romanov down
in Florida.

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:07.729
Spent one whole day, where he's explaining
all the physiology and the history and the

00:57:07.729 --> 00:57:09.069
antecedents.
And then, he took me outside to actually teach

00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:14.219
me the method, and it was like half an hour.
I mean, no other activity -- you know, you

00:57:14.219 --> 00:57:16.630
try and learn how to play tennis or to fence,
it takes weeks.

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:21.359
This dude, in 30 minutes, can radically transform
your running style.

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:27.890
But what I find is that pose, qi, evolution
running -- they're all essentially, I believe,

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:31.059
the same thing.
The difficulty with those methods, though,

00:57:31.059 --> 00:57:36.220
is -- and I really wish I had listened to
Barefoot Ken Bob, all these barefoot dudes.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:39.730
You know, you kind of disregard them, because
they call themselves 'barefoot' something?

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:41.710
[laughter]
Do you ever see Ken Bob, you know?

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:45.089
The guy looks like a troll.
He's got this beard, and he's crazy-looking.

00:57:45.089 --> 00:57:50.789
But what these dudes said was, You need to
remove the obstacle for the feedback.

00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:54.839
You've got to take the shoes off, so.
I tried to learn qi and pose.

00:57:54.839 --> 00:58:01.029
What I had to do is, constantly mentally remind
myself of all the stuff I was doing.

00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:04.099
It was kind of this constant checklist of
body angles and stuff.

00:58:04.099 --> 00:58:06.069
But if you take your shoes off, you get that
instantly.

00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:10.380
So, if I were doing it all over again, I would
take the shoes off first, and then pick up

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:13.190
any one of them.
Even CrossFit. Have any of you guys do CrossFit?

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:15.849
Q Yeah, that's what I do.

00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:19.141
Chris McDougall: Yeah, I was going to tell
you.

00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:22.130
You can kick my ass. I'm sure you can.

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.259
Q I went to a CrossFit CFE, CrossFit endurance
seminar last weekend, actually.

00:58:23.259 --> 00:58:25.109
Chris McDougall: Those guys actually have
the best "before and after" videos I've ever

00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:28.869
seen online for running.
You watch the 'before' and then 'after' and

00:58:28.869 --> 00:58:33.819
the transformation that these CrossFit coaches
do with runners is unbelievable.

00:58:33.819 --> 00:58:34.819
Q Yeah.

00:58:34.819 --> 00:58:37.759
Chris McDougall: Yeah, I think any one of
these styles, but the one difference I would

00:58:37.759 --> 00:58:40.329
make is, go bare.

00:58:40.329 --> 00:58:41.329
Q [inaudible]

00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:42.329
Chris McDougall: Sure. Thanks.

00:58:42.329 --> 00:58:43.751
&gt;&gt; So, we're right at time, but thank you.

00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:45.279
Chris McDougall: You got one person there?

00:58:45.279 --> 00:58:47.911
Q Sorry. I'll be really quick.
Thank you so much for coming today.

00:58:47.911 --> 00:58:48.911
Chris McDougall: Yeah, thank you.

00:58:48.911 --> 00:58:52.809
Q Very appreciative of having you.
I haven't read your book, but I was mesmerized

00:58:52.809 --> 00:58:56.069
and very inspired by your speech today.
You're an eloquent presenter, so thank you.

00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:57.069
Chris McDougall: Oh thanks.

00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:59.349
Q I just did my first half marathon last weekend
in Indianapolis.

00:58:59.349 --> 00:59:00.349
Chris McDougall: Great, great.

00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:03.000
Q And there was one guy running barefoot,
and he got all the attention, because everyone's

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.529
like -- and he even told me, he was like,
"Take off your shoes."

00:59:05.529 --> 00:59:07.489
I'm like, "Are you crazy, dude? Like, what
are you talking about?"

00:59:07.489 --> 00:59:13.079
But, I'm just curious about how advertisers
 -- like a Nike -- is reacting to all this

00:59:13.079 --> 00:59:14.750
publicity.
I work in advertising, so I'm just kind of

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:16.039
curious about -- like, when Supersize Me came
out, obviously McDonald's took a huge loss

00:59:16.039 --> 00:59:17.829
in revenue and cut, so I was just kind of
curious, have they'd approached you in Lancaster?

00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:23.349
Yay, I have family from there.
But, like kind of what it's been, in terms

00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:28.989
of all the publicity like kind of where it's
been at.

00:59:28.989 --> 00:59:32.109
Chris McDougall: Well, let me ask you, "What
would you do if you're facing this kind of

00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:36.401
crisis or this scandal as an advertiser/marketing
person? What would you do?"

00:59:36.401 --> 00:59:38.210
Q [laughing] If I was Nike?

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:39.210
Chris McDougall: Yeah.

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:42.400
Q I'd be hurting right now.
I don't know. I'd probably -- I might approach

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.400
you.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400
&gt;&gt; [voices]

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:49.809
Chris McDougall: Yeah, you'd design something
else and try and capitalize on it, right?

00:59:49.809 --> 00:59:53.900
What they've essentially done is, they've
gone turtle and gone silent.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:58.309
And I think it's really scandalous.
And I keep waiting also too for, you know,

00:59:58.309 --> 01:00:01.109
"C'mon, journalistic watchdogs. Wake the fuck
up."

01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:04.200
And, "You guys keep repeating the same shit
over and over again."

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:11.589
I mean -- not to be too profane and antagonistic.
I'm half-Sicilian, I can't help it, but -- yesterday,

01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:16.499
there's an article in the New York Times,
"Is running barefoot good for you?"

01:00:16.499 --> 01:00:19.529
I thought, "Wait, why isn't this story, 'Is
running in shoes good for you?'"

01:00:19.529 --> 01:00:22.119
Where is the scientific evidence that these
things do anything?

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:26.779
There's never, ever been an experiment or
a study which indicates that running shoes

01:00:26.779 --> 01:00:30.952
do anything to prevent injuries.
And yet, the default position is somehow,

01:00:30.952 --> 01:00:34.729
"These are good, and bare feet are bad."
So, what are the major shoe manufacturers

01:00:34.729 --> 01:00:36.239
doing?
They're basically keeping their mouth shut.

01:00:36.239 --> 01:00:39.049
They've gotten nothing.
There's no science on their side.

01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:42.690
So essentially, they're going to keep quiet,
wait for this to blow over, and just hope

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:47.200
that people just keep sleepwalking, you know?
Again, I'm not really faulting the shoe companies,

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.880
you know?
They want to sell garbage, they can sell garbage.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.549
It's up to people, who are supposed to be
more discriminating, to examine this stuff

01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:58.489
and broadcast it.
I mean, I read you these quotes from the editor

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:01.809
of Runners World, you know?
Why isn't this dude owning this thing?

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:07.609
Well, you know, you might suggest that, "because
his magazine sells a lot of running shoes."

01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:09.529
So their response today has been absolute
silence.

01:01:09.529 --> 01:01:12.519
I've not seen a single quote from anybody
about anything responding to this thing yet.

01:01:12.519 --> 01:01:13.519
Q Interesting. Thank you.

01:01:13.519 --> 01:01:16.059
Chris McDougall: Yeah, thanks a lot.

01:01:16.059 --> 01:01:18.369
Q [inaudible]

01:01:18.369 --> 01:01:22.950
Chris McDougall: No. I mean, there's still
shoes.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:27.589
You know, barefoot is barefoot, and there's
been sort of a confusion about terminology.

01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:31.320
No one's really quite sure.
I saw someone refer to it as 'natural running'

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.549
the other day.
I thought, "That's probably the best term

01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:36.930
I've heard."
Bill Rogers, you know, the great American

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:41.819
marathoner -- guy actually owns running shoe
stores -- he said, you know, "The shoe that

01:01:41.819 --> 01:01:45.849
allows your foot to act as if it's barefoot,
that's the shoe you want."

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:51.359
And that's essentially what it's all about.
Protection is always better than no protection,

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:55.180
but not to the point where the protection
starts to take over and the give orders.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.339
Kind of like, you know, the Terminator, the
cyborgs have become self-aware?

01:01:58.339 --> 01:02:02.059
You don't want the shoes to become self-aware.
You want your foot to give the orders, and

01:02:02.059 --> 01:02:04.329
not the shoe.
So, I mean, this one's good.

01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:07.380
I mean, there are plenty of shoes out there.
What I like about this one is the fact that,

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.799
everywhere your foot goes, this thing goes
too.

01:02:09.799 --> 01:02:14.279
It's never sort of left behind.
That's it?

01:02:14.279 --> 01:02:15.279
Cool. Hey guys, thank you.
Thanks.

01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:15.280
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
