[ Joanne Narrating ]
I didn’t plan to end up in the food business.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.600
I started, right after graduation,
working for a consulting firm.

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.233
I left the consulting firm
and got a job at a restaurant...

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.767
and then I fell in love with it.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:17.000
So I came back to Boston
and opened a bakery.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.000
Now I own four bakeries and a restaurant.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.900
When I got to Harvard as a freshman–

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:26.333
I’d always been kind of a math geek
in high school...

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.167
so, to me, it seemed natural
to kind of fall into math.

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.533
I realized there were so many other things
that I didn’t even know existed...

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.500
that I could possibly be interested in.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:39.533
I think Harvard spends a lot of time
trying to make sure that all of its offerings...

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.233
are really enticing
and well put together.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.467
When I first started, there was a whole world
that kind of opened up.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.867
It’s like going to a buffet where there’s
all the best desserts in the world.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.733
You just don’t know where to start.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.967
Would imagine everybody who goes
just takes a moment...

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:57.467
says, “Wow. I thought I was gonna be ‘X’...

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.533
but now I could potentially
be ‘Y’ or ‘Z’”...

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.167
which is the fun part.

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:04.800
My name is Joanne Chang.
I graduated in ’91, and I lived in Leverett House.
