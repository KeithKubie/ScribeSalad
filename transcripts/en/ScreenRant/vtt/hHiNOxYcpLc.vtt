00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.460
These days, you'd be a fool to leave a movie
theatre before the credits finish rolling

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.080
at the end of any given movie.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
Why?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.560
Well, because there's every chance that you'd
be missing out on one or more additional scenes

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.271
that could appear in or after said credits.Although
such scenes have existed for many years, these

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.200
days they are commonplace - and they can be
very important.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.399
They can include fun Easter eggs, hint at
things to come in the future of a franchise,

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.349
unravel mysteries from within the movie you
just watched, or simply extend the story of

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.350
the same movie.For a variety of reasons, certain
scenes of this nature have been extremely

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.180
prevalent in the history of movie-making.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.129
This video will take a look at some great
examples.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.960
Here are the ten movies with game changing
post credit scenes scenes.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.530
Iron Man
As far as comic book movies are concerned,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.739
there was no bigger game-changer than Iron
Man in terms of its post-credits scene.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.559
After Robert Downey, Jr.'s Tony Stark had
revealed himself to the world as the tituar

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.390
armoured hero, the credits rolled before Samuel
L. Jackson's Nick Fury turned up in Stark's

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.560
house to talk to him about the Avenger Initiative.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.260
That was back in 2008 and the Marvel Cinematic
Universe is still going strong.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.660
It was Iron Man's post-credit scene that triggered
the expansion of the entire franchise and

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.840
let audiences know that there was a hell of
a lot more to expect from the MCU - such as

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.040
the assembling of the Avengers.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
The Avengers
When it comes to "wow" moments in credits

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.100
scenes, none were more prevalent than the
one fans were given in the middle of the credits

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.100
of The Avengers.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.090
The main villain of the movie was Tom Hiddleston's
Loki.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.890
He had been aided by Alexis Denisof's mysterious
"The Other" and the Chitauri army, but there

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.610
had been hints about a more powerful being
commanding them.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.020
In the mid-credits scene of The Avengers,
that being was revealed to be none other than

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.310
the Mad Titan Thanos.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.530
It was at that moment that fans of the MCU
were made aware that he would be the big-bad

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.340
of the franchise - and that things were going
to get crazy as a result.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.170
Thanos has since appeared in Guardians of
the Galaxy and in the mid-credits scene of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.890
Avengers: Age of Ultron - but he'll truly
make his presence felt in the upcoming Avengers:

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
Infinity War movies.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.700
Of course, there was also a scene after the
credits, in which the Avengers were seen eating

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.510
shawarma - a fun and unusual reference to
a line Tony Stark had spoken earlier in the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.870
movie.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.370
Captain America: Civil War
The single biggest movie event in the Marvel

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.769
Cinematic Universe to date has been Captain
America: Civil War.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.540
The movie saw two factions of comic book heroes
fighting each other on the big screen for

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.859
the first time and was a huge success both
critically and commercially.

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.450
Of course, that meant the credits scenes had
to be great - and both of the certainly delivered.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.340
Both Black Panther and Spider-Man were introduced
in Civil War and the two credits scenes led

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.450
into their upcoming solo movies.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.849
Audiences were given a first glimpse of the
spectacular fictional country of Wakanda,

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.019
while Tom Holland's Peter Parker was shown
at home playing with a high-tech Spider-gadget,

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.319
suggesting that Spider-Man will be utilising
Stark-tech in the franchise going forward

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.849
- an exciting prospect indeed.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.439
Napoleon Dynamite
The post-credits sequence of the brilliantly

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.739
funny and quirky Napoleon Dynamite is a full
five minute scene that concludes a sub-plot

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.989
from the movie itself - the marriage of Napoleon's
brother Kip and LaFawnduh, played by Aaron

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.030
Ruell and Shondrella Avery respectively.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.680
The scene shows the pair exchanging nuptial
vows in an outdoor ceremony in Preston, Idaho.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.670
Jon Heder's Napoleon arrives late, riding
a horse, claiming that it is a "wild honeymoon

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.840
stallion" that he has tamed himself.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.120
Kip then flicks LaFawnduh's garter as a "keepsake"
towards Napoleon, Rico, and Pedro, before

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.489
he and LaFawnduh ride off across the fields.

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.099
Finding Nemo
Disney and Pixar love to include Easter eggs

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.269
and references to their other properties in
their movies, but 2003's Finding Nemo had

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.480
a cool little Easter egg of that nature after
the credits rolled.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.799
Just after the "special thanks" section started
scrolling on to the screen, none other than

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.749
Mike from Monsters, Inc. swam across the screen
and gave a look towards the camera whilst

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.379
wearing a diving mask and snorkel.

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.120
The idea of Disney and Pixar's characters
inhabiting the same universe often excites

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.489
fans, so this particular scene really made
a lot of said fans smile.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.650
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
The most recent of the Pirates of the Caribbean

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.310
movies - 2011's Pirates of the Caribbean:
On Stranger Tides - ended with a post-credits

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.160
scene that doesn't bode well for the franchise's
lead character, Johnny Depp's Captain Jack

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.160
Sparrow.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.889
The scene shows Angelica - played by PenÃ©lope
Cruz - on the island Sparrow had left her

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:20.889
stranded on.

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.810
As she sits solemnly by the shore, a voodoo
doll of Sparrow is washed up on the beach.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.919
She picks it up and smirks in a way that suggested
her intentions with the doll could land her

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.150
former lover in a spot of trouble.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.901
We will have waited an unprecedented six years,
when 2017's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:42.250
Men Tell No Tales is released, by the time
we find out if that was indeed the case.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.009
Fast Five
At the start of the previous movie in the

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.390
franchise - 2009's Fast &amp; Furious - everyone
was led to believe that Letty, the character

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.379
played by Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel's
Dom's former girlfriend, had been murdered.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:57.509
However, after the credits rolled in 2011's
Fast Five, a major reveal regarding the character

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.509
occurred.

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.729
Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs is given a file concerning
the hijack of a military convoy in Berlin,

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.580
in which he discovers a recent photo of Letty,
revealing that she was actually still alive.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.740
She then went on to reappear in the franchise
in 2013's Fast &amp; Furious 6.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.780
House on Haunted Hill
House on Haunted Hill was a pretty terrible

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.729
movie, but it made a pretty bold move with
its post-credits scene.

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.350
A lot of horror movies end on a relatively
happy note, with the characters who died going

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.430
unmentioned and the surviving characters having
defeated whatever evil was afoot.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.240
House on Haunted Hill, however, opted to show
two of the deceased main characters being

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.759
tortured in the afterlife.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.699
The post-credits scene showed Geoffrey Rush's
Steven H. Price and Famke Janssen's Evelyn

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.759
Stockard-Price having terrible things done
to them by the ghostly former patients of

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.080
the mental asylum that the movie was set in.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.220
This dismal, glum and, frankly, depressing
ending probably contributed towards the absolutely

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.229
horrendous reviews received by the movie.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.810
Ferris Bueller's Day Off
The iconic 80's movie Ferris Bueller's Day

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.720
Off saw the titular character - played by
Matthew Broderick - breaking the fourth wall

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.509
on a number of occasions.

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.080
Most notably, this occurred at the beginning
and the end of the movie - and the post-credits

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.870
scene was the best example of it.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.539
After the credits had rolled, Ferris emerged
from his bedroom wearing his dressing gown,

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.750
expressed surprise that the audience were
still in attendance, and told them to go home

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:24.840
twice, before returning to his room.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.270
Deadpool
In a hilarious throwback to another entry

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.819
on this list, 2016's awesome Deadpool movie
had a post-credits scene that paid homage

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.610
to Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.169
Ryan Reynolds' Merc With a Mouth emerged from
the very same bedroom that Ferris Bueller

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.389
did in his own post-credits scene - wearing
the exact same dressing gown, no less.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.419
Addressing the audience directly, Deadpool
initially tells them that they don't have

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.409
the money to tease any future movies - referencing
Samuel L. Jackson's Iron Man cameo in the

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.740
process - before returning to mention the
fact that Cable would be appearing in the

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.740
Deadpool sequel.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.740
We simply can't wait for that!

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.450
Thanks for watching our list of ten movies
