we proceed forward I think the best way

we proceed forward I think the best way
is to define natural selection and

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120
is to define natural selection and
 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.170
is to define natural selection and
sexual selection as distinct mechanisms

creates the forces that allows the top
to spin and stand on its own in one

place or one direction or another so

what that means is as species form they

what that means is as species form they
 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.350
what that means is as species form they
tend to evolve new and different
