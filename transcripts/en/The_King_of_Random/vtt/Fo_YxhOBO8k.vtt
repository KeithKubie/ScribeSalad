00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.539
wuz up guys

00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.139
I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.139
Wargaming has approached us about a sponsorship

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.819
opportunity to try out their awesome game World of Tanks and with that a chance to do a

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.000
Really cool build that goes along with the game here on the poopnch

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.969
We've got a powerful

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.538
RC car and a paintball gun and we are going to see what we can do to combine these two our goal for the day

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.829
Is to build a drivable fireable paintball gun that's decorated to look like a tank?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.280
We'll try and get two of these tanks up and running and then we'll pit them against each other in a remote-controlled paintball battle

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.880
We've got our car, and we've got our gun. Let's see what it takes to match these two together first off

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.680
We're not going to need the decorative shell that's on top of this RC car. We'll take that off

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.259
The basic idea is we will mount our paintball gun onto the body of the car.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.710
And then we will build a decorative tank body around the whole thing however

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.800
I think before we get around to mounting the gun onto the car body

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.640
We have to be sure that we've figured out a way to fire the gun remotely

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.530
I have here a small servo

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.250
Which I can connect on to the remote-control car, that should be able to be activated by the remote control and at that point

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.080
It would make something spin on here

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.089
so I need to hook this up to the gun in such a way that when this wheel spins it pulls the trigger on the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.700
Gun before I attach the servo to the gun I need to be sure that it can be activated by the electronics in the car

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.990
Here we have the inside of the receiver for this remote-control car

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.150
This is what takes in signals from the controller

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.040
It makes the car do what you want this set of wires right here is actually something that controls the onboard

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.400
audio system

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.799
System this car will play

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.549
Driving noises as you drive. It around however. We don't need that right now so we can take this out and plug our servo in

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.759
Within the battery

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.679
All right now. We should at this point be able to turn this switch and have our servo move

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.740
Yep

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.269
That's moving so now we know we do have movement out of this thing

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.159
We can control it with the remote control

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.879
So we should be able to hook that up to pull the trigger on our paintball gun

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.799
I think the best bet for where to mount this servo is going to be inside the grip of the paintball gun so we'll remove

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.508
The side panels to the grip and see if there's a space where we can get this to stay inside Oh

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.080
Beautiful, okay, I think that's gonna work

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.459
I think we can just put a same screw that held the grip on back into the same

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.869
hole where it came from but use it to attach the servo to the gun as well and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.140
Because it should be pressed up against the body of the gun when it's pulling against the trigger the resistance you just push it straight

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.160
Into the body of the gun and hold it in place that's fantastic well. Let's attach that screw and see if that's gonna work. Oh

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.940
My gosh. It's perfect. It's the perfect spot look at that that is attached that is sturdy

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.149
It's kind of right in between the two sides of the handle well

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.609
I couldn't have had that work out better if I'd planned it

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.429
We have this circle piece which we might be able to get to work

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.069
but the servo came with some other accessories including this arm so we can take this circle piece off and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.519
Replace it with this and I think that might give us a little bit better leverage

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.489
Because it's a little farther away from our pivot point

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.479
So parallel to the trigger

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.810
I'm just gonna plug this back into the car for a second

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.280
We can see what kind of range of motion you actually get out of our circuit over here. Oh?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.510
That should be plenty

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.579
So our arm will start right here

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760
when we hit this switch

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.750
moves to there

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.639
and then back

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.109
beautiful

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.289
Well, I think I like that so let's secure this arm back down on to the servo

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.700
I've just got a piece of steel wire and we're gonna see what happens if we wrap one end of it around the trigger and

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.599
Then wrap another one through one of these holes in our servo arm

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.719
rock this back

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.090
Hey it fired. Oh

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.859
And now it slipped off the trigger again

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.689
So we definitely need to find a way to make it attach more securely to our trigger and of course

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.849
It's very loosely wrapped around the servo arm as well but proof of concept. This is working

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.309
I think the best way to get our wire to stay permanently

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.469
Attached to the trigger will be to cut a small notch into one side of it this trigger is made of aluminum and it's at

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.280
a bit of a weird angle

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.869
So we'll bust out the dremel and just cut a small notch into one side and that should make it so when the wires wrapped

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.179
Around it it can't slide off and farther on it'll hold a piece of wire from slipping quite nicely

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.929
All right now. Let's fit the wire into the notch that we cut

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.890
All right here we go

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.650
Ha that seems to be working great now

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.200
We know we can use our radio controller to fire off the gun we need to find a way to mount this to the body

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.879
Of the car, there's a couple of pieces that I want to move out of the way as well this right

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.120
Here is the line that lets you connect your compressed air tank onto your gun

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.080
But it's not in a very convenient spot for us, so I'm gonna try and move that out of the way

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.439
And then we might use an extension hose instead of this piece

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.900
Our paper gun is now stripped down

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.650
So there's this little hardware on there as possible and some of its going to need to be put back

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.169
But I think we should be able to mount the gun

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.580
Right here on the car. There is a threaded hole in the bottom of the handle

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.139
And I think we can probably use that as a mounting point to attach it to the back of our car

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.160
But that's not going to be enough support. We're definitely going to need more

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.740
Something holding this gun in place

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.950
So I think what we'll try doing is building a frame that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.929
Connects to these points on the front and back of the car that normally hold the body of the car in place

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.060
I've got these two bars of aluminum

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.790
And I'm thinking I might be able to cut them down and drill some holes

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.650
To make them attach to the frame of the car with the same pins that usually hold the body on

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.299
Alright now let's see if these pieces will fit onto our frame

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.120
There we go

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.940
I

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.940
Think that'll work pretty well

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.840
nice and attached

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.840
strong enough lightweight

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.810
excellent now we can find a

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.199
Way to add a little bit more support. I'm thinking we'll want a support right under the trigger guard and

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.280
Then probably something that holds onto the barrel as well that should give us

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.689
Three different points of support, and I think that'll secure it to the car nicely

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:34.609
Excellent it'll give pretty good support right there now the piece that's gonna support the barrel

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.169
I'm really gonna want it to wrap all the way around so it gives side support and up and down support

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:45.949
So I'm gonna try and make a sort of horseshoe shaped piece and then attach a couple of support posts onto that horseshoe shape

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.990
Excellent let's make one more of those

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:26.709
Right there one right there same idea on the other side there

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.390
Excellent

00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.119
All right our frame to support our paintball gun is basically finished all we need to do is

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:06.929
Attach the back of the handle onto the frame of the RC car I have a machine screw and a nut that will fit down

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.820
Through the bottom of the handle and then I'll drill a small hole into this part of the frame on the car

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.820
And I'll secure it to that

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:31.889
All right at this point we should have a drivable car

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:37.049
With a paintball gun mounted onto it you can see the action back here when I hit the switch

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:44.249
Slams forward once this is attached to some compressed air and we have our hopper full of paintballs on

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320
This thing should be ready to go

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.709
It's not exactly fully automatic firing speeds, but this is supposed to be a tank

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:57.899
And I don't think most tanks have rapid-fire don't quote me on that. I'm not tank engineer

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.620
We removed the normal hardware for connecting our compressed air tank on to our gun that came out down here and attached to the bottom

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.170
of the handle

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.039
Since that's not there we have an extension hose that we're gonna use

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.870
Instead using this will let us put our air tank pretty much wherever we want instead of it having to be

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:15.389
mounted in just one particular spot I

00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:22.619
Think I want our compressed air tank to sort of ride on this back bumper section

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.229
and then I'll try and add a little access door into the full cosmetic tank so I can take that out and

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:35.309
Refill it when it's running low. I have way more hose than is necessary, so I'm just gonna wrap this around the gun

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.599
And that still reaches back here quite easily good

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:45.149
That's where we wanted to come this is our tank of compressed air that attaches to this thing right here

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:47.909
And so I'll have it rest somewhere on

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.169
The back of the vehicle, so let's attach this and see how it goes

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.810
All right, that is open

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.060
So we should now be feeding air

00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:04.259
Into the paintball gun which means if I fire it it should actually fire and now that has pressure it should reset itself

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.469
drivable paintball test here goes

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
See if we can drive it up

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.840
You can drive it back

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.020
And most importantly we can fire it

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.820
That was a great test the car drives. Well it shoots. Well and as soon as we have this hopper attached to it

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.080
We'll be able to shoot shot after shot. Everything is working great. It's driving

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.229
Well, so now all we need to do is make this look like a tank

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.630
I

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:55.189
have these evie a foam floor mats some contact cement and some razor blades and that's basically all I'm going to use to build the

00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:00.859
Body of this tank I have some thinner sheets of evie a foam that are basically the same thing as the floor mats except well

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.770
Thinner and these won't be part of the main body of the build

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.479
But I will use some of this for detail work once. I have the general shape of the tank laid out now

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.890
This is the kind of thing that I wish I could show you an easy way to know how to build a tank out of

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.799
foam
But really there's a lot of eyeballing it guesswork

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.360
Making up measurements on the spot and a little bit of just hoping things are gonna work out

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.790
I have built several things out of this foam before so I have a good idea of how to cut it and glue it to

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.499
Make it into the shape that I want but for the most part. It's really just kind of watch what I do

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.580
I also have my computer on the workbench with me because I have an image of the tank

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.990
I'm trying to build up on my desktop

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.570
And I'm gonna be referencing that as I build the tank

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.700
While we're watching the montage of me building this tank let's talk about the sponsor that provided this opportunity

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.679
World of Tanks is a free online game that throws players into epic tank battles across

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:54.859
Incredible battlefields the game is set in the mid 20th century and gives players access to an impressive roster over

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.919
450 authentic tanks, there are over a hundred fifty million players worldwide, and they're waiting for you to join

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.510
This isn't just a game driving tanks around and blowing stuff up. There are a lot of great game

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.650
Elements to it your tank will evolve your tank can be upgraded and modified to enhance his performance

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.190
You can work as a team you take part in joint operations

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.030
You can engage in head-to-head duels that feel like any other co-op shooting game

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:23.660
There are regular updates bringing new content of the game and weekly special events to keep players engaged with evolving experiences

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.850
The tanks are true-to-life models and take their vehicle characteristics

00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:33.119
From the authentic tanks of the time period for people trying out the game for the first time we recommend trying the Ru

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:39.000
Is-3 tank a close-range brawler that puts you in the middle of the action the first 300 new users to sign up with the code

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:39.910

Gold and a free premium tank click the link in the description below and use your code to get started now

00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:52.739
There you go the body of the tank is built this thing is entirely made out of craft foam and glue I use a contact

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:58.289
cement and I also used a hot glue gun for some of the detail work both of them have their different uses and

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.269
I think I'm pretty happy with how this thing is turned out. It's fairly lightweight as you can see and

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.689
So far I have hit it with a heat gun

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.730
That seals all the foam up so it will take paint much better than the first layer will be a layer of

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.069
Plasti Dip which is a sort of rubberized coating then I'll hit it with primer and then I'll start with the main color

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.079
After the main color is all applied

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:23.938
I'm gonna go in add a little bit of detail work to get the sort of grungy look that we have in the photo

00:14:23.939 --> 00:14:26.489
I'll use a dark brown to give it a little bit of a dirty look

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.939
And then I'll use a little bit of silver to make it look like the paint has been worn away

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:32.308
And we can see the bare metal underneath in some spots

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.339
BAM

00:14:38.339 --> 00:14:41.578
our tank is built our tank is painted our tank is mounted on a

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.979
remote-control car with a paintball gun inside, and it seems to me that there's only one thing that it needs a

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:54.750
Second tank for it to fight against we've got two of these bad boys and in our next video

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.659
We're gonna be taking these two out and pitting them against each other

00:14:57.759 --> 00:15:03.568
We'll see which one ends up taking more damage and just how much a paintball will do to this floor mat foam that they're built

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:07.709
