um<00:08:18.020><c> but</c><00:08:18.350><c> that's</c><00:08:18.440><c> another</c><00:08:18.710><c> story</c><00:08:19.120><c> so</c><00:08:20.120><c> um</c><00:08:20.750><c> I</c>

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
um but that's another story so um I
 

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.700 align:start position:0%
um but that's another story so um I
guess<00:08:22.520><c> it's</c><00:08:22.790><c> sort</c><00:08:23.000><c> of</c><00:08:23.030><c> like</c><00:08:23.180><c> a</c><00:08:23.680><c> Venn</c><00:08:24.680><c> diagram</c>

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:24.710 align:start position:0%

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:57.270 align:start position:0%
guess that's also kind of why it takes
 

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.460 align:start position:0%

for another thing
 

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
for another thing
so<00:21:09.190><c> I</c><00:21:09.220><c> guess</c><00:21:09.520><c> three</c><00:21:09.850><c> cumulatively</c><00:21:10.510><c> is</c><00:21:11.380><c> if</c><00:21:11.740><c> you</c>

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:11.890 align:start position:0%
so I guess three cumulatively is if you
 

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.670 align:start position:0%
so I guess three cumulatively is if you
you<00:21:12.100><c> combined</c><00:21:12.490><c> them</c><00:21:12.670><c> uh</c><00:21:13.050><c> the</c><00:21:14.050><c> documentary</c>

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
you combined them uh the documentary
 

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.580 align:start position:0%
you combined them uh the documentary
room<00:21:14.830><c> for</c><00:21:15.040><c> those</c><00:21:15.160><c> who</c><00:21:15.310><c> don't</c><00:21:15.490><c> know</c><00:21:15.670><c> is</c><00:21:16.030><c> about</c>
