00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:37.333
What is this? I'm impressed.
Good morning. I'm not Don Sadoway,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.600
as you can tell. He's at a
conference. I'm not sure,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.400
I think it's in Halifax. What the
heck can you have in Halifax?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.200
Education, OK. A couple of
announcements,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.000
the obvious, the first test is
Wednesday.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.600
Maybe not so obvious,
but it's posted on the website.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.200
There will be a review session for
those of you who care to come given

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.800
by myself in 26-100 tomorrow night
starting at 7 pm going until the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.400
last question is answered.
That's why the infinity. Please

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.000
don't show up at 10:30 or 11:00 and
start asking questions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:27.590
I just flew in from Beijing.
For those of you who don't realize

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.190
it, it's now about 12:00 in the
evening tomorrow in Beijing.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.790
Yeah, so anyway, I'll probably fall
asleep by about 10:30.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.390
Anyway, OK, one little thing about
the quiz. Professor Sadoway always

00:01:44.390 --> 00:02:02.380
gives some admonitions about how to
take these quizzes.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:54.120
And, one thing I'd like to add to it,
and that is, and I told this to my

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.240
recitation sections that when you do
these quizzes,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.370
in spite of the fact that it might
be trivial in some cases,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.490
make sure you carry the units
through. If you've got a problem

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.620
that has units associated with it,
do the exercise of carrying the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.740
units through because,
guess what? If the units are

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.870
supposed to come out in meters per
second and you get seconds per meter,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:38.873
what do you figure the chances of
that problem being right are?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Zero, all right?
If the units come out in meters per

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
second, you will quickly discover
that the problems in 3.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
91 are just not that complicated.
And so, even by units analysis, if

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the units come out right,
you've got a good shot that unless

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you've really,
really messed up,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that the answer is going to be right.
The second thing is ballpark it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That is to say, guess the answer
ahead of time,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
strip all the decimal places off.
Just go with powers of ten, and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:58.940
then see what the answer should be.
And, you will be within 25 or 30%

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.820
every time. And,
that's a good thing to know because

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.700
if you come out with an answer
that's somewhere near the diameter

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.580
of the universe and it's supposed to
be the diameter of an atom,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.460
then you will know that you probably
made a mistake.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.350
So, those are two pieces of advice.
OK, last day, you talked about the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.230
Born-Haber cycle,
and octet stability via electron

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.110
transfer. The Born-Haber cycle was
designed to allow us to calculate

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:45.420
the energetics of, in particular,
the ionic bond.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:34.440
And, the thing we need to remember,
there are a couple things at least.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.880
And that is that the lattice energy
as is depicted by the Madelung

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.330
constant is dominant.
And, the Madelung constant,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.770
what does it represent? It's a
geometric factor that's unique for

00:03:47.770 --> 00:04:06.906
each crystal structure.
So that's something you go and look

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.500
up. So, you go and look that up,
and those are the key things. And

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.500
as a result of that,
the achieving of octet stability via

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
electron transfer tumbled to the
idea of an ionic bond where one atom

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.500
donates an electron completely to
the other atom,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.500
sort of like servanthood.
One donates yourself completely to

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.500
another.
OK, so that's where we are.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
But we've got a few problems.
OK, sodium chloride works.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.500
Magnesium chloride works.
Magnesium oxide works. All of

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.500
these from the group one and two
through the group five and six

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.500
elements, but what about elements,
what about molecules like hydrogen,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500
or nitrogen, or maybe oxygen? Or we
could keep on going:

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:52.380
chlorine, right?
We know these are stable.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.150
And, if we wanted to try to fit,
say, hydrogen, into this scheme that

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.920
we have, we have to do what?
We'd have to figure out a way to

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.690
achieve octet stability by electron
transfer. Well,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.460
we've got to hydrogen atoms here.
And, what would have to happen?

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.230
Well, we would have to have one of
these hydrogen atoms go to an H plus,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:34.193
plus an electron, right?
**H --&gt; H+ + e-**

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:28.250
So, now we have a hydrogen ion here.
But, at the same time, another

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:45.133
hydrogen would have to do that.
**H + e- --&gt; H-** And, clearly,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:42.750
we can't do both. This one here is
what? Hydrogen with an added

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:58.300
electron. That's isoelectronic
with helium.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:58.250
This thing here,
this is just a naked proton.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:14.266
So, it doesn't work. It doesn't
work. So, we need to find another

00:05:46.500 --> 00:06:14.750
scheme, and that solution was
provided for us by G.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:30.633
N. Lewis. And, he asked the
question, what if we could share --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:31.540
-- electrons? And by now,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.630
I mean the valence electrons.
What if we could share electrons?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.720
Well, let's look at hydrogen see
what would happen.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.810
Well, we know that hydrogen is 1s,
right? So, if we take another

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.900
hydrogen, we stick it over here,
1s, we know we have an electron here.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:07:11.200
And, let's say the X denotes the
other electron from this hydrogen.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:07:02.530
And now, we form a bond.
And what do we have? Well,

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.070
this is isoelectronic with helium,
right, and so is this, isoelectronic

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:13.610
with helium. And so,
each hydrogen has access to each

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.150
electron, and now we have a
satisfied system.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.690
And we can do the same thing with,
well, we're going to do it with

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.220
nitrogen in a minute,
but this is a case where we have two

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:47.140
atoms sharing electrons.
And, in general, what we

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:30.000
have is sharing to --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:56.720
-- sharing to achieve electron,
oh, octet stability. Let's look at

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.450
nitrogen to see if it applies there
as well. Well,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:10.180
we know nitrogen has what?
Nitrogen is 1s2, 2s2, 2p3,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.900
so, we've got five electrons here in
the valence shell.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:23.630
If we take nitrogen,
we've got N2, and we've got one,

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:39.860
two, three, four, five.
One, two, three,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
four, five, one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
seven, eight, right, one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
seven, eight. Here we go. We've
got two cases where each one of

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
those things now is isoelectric with
neon. And, we have achieved octet

00:08:34.000 --> 00:09:02.750
stability in the same way.
So, Lewis called this,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:14.250
what did he call it? He called a
cooperative use of

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:26.766
valence electrons.
Right, so you take the co here,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and we take the valence here, and
out of that comes covalent.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And, let's be a little, now we need
to put a little terminology here.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This region in here contained the
bonding domains.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Right, and the non-bonding electrons
are non-bonding domains.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And this structure that I've

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
depicted here using the X's and O's
is called the Lewis structure.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:29.070
Right, it's called the Lewis

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.230
structure. And,
let's see, this is actually from

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.380
Lewis' notes. Now,
remember, this is 1902.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.530
So, there wasn't a whole lot going
on. There was a lot of physics

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.690
going on, but we didn't know a whole
lot about atomic structure back in

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.840
those days. But,
you can see, this is right out of

00:10:49.840 --> 00:11:09.680
his notebook, and you can see he's
arranged the atoms by row.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:58.150
And, he's trying to figure out,
see, lithium has one. Beryllium,

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.300
magnesium have two. Boron, aluminum
have three. And,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.460
he's trying to figure out how to
arrange these things.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.610
This is right out of his notebook.
And, look up at the top here. He's

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.760
got a bit of a mistake.
He's trying to make helium octet

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.920
stable. He's trying to put eight
electrons around helium,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.420
and it isn't working.
But look down here.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.280
He's got a box within a box.
This is 1902. This is reminiscent

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.140
of what? The shell structure which
people hadn't even thought of.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.990
So, this is in his notes. He
didn't publish these notes.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.850
And, he didn't publish anything
related to the Lewis structure until

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.710
about 1912 or 1913.
But, you can see that he was

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:52.570
thinking about this structure for
all along. Whoops, let's

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.830
see if I can get this.
OK, now, this is a more formal look

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.490
at that structure.
And you can see what he's done.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.160
I don't know what the dates say,
1916, excuse me, and you can see

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.830
what he's done.
He's taken the elements,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.490
and he's arranged them. And he's
stripped off all of the non-valence

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.160
electrons. And,
all he's done is leave the valence

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.820
electrons associated.
So, you can see the alkali metals

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.490
here: lithium,
one electron, and then beryllium,

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.160
magnesium, two electrons, all the
way over here to neon and argon

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:45.886
where you have stability.
There is fluorine and chlorine where

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.500
you have seven electrons.
So, that's his gift to us: the

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.500
Lewis structure,
and the idea that you could share

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.500
electrons and form a covalent bond.
Now, we need to go a little bit

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.500
further to put some more meat on
this thing because we haven't

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:56.150
quantified it.
We've got the concept,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:02.460
but we haven't quantified it yet.
But, let's take a look and see

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:08.760
about water. These are so-called
homo-polar molecules.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.070
The atoms are the same in each one.
And, let's try one with two

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:21.380
different atoms.
Let's take a look at water.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:27.690
We know that hydrogen is 1s1,
and oxygen is 1s2, 2s2, 2p4, so,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:44.180
there's six electrons in the valence
shell.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:38.570
And, let's try oxygen.
Well, oxygen, we'll put a hydrogen

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:43.140
here, hydrogen here,
and one, two, three, four.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.710
We've got to put six electrons
around it. So, let's put

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:53.090
one here, and one here.
We've got an electron from each of

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:59.270
the hydrogens.
So, let's put that here,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:05.450
and that's there. And that works.
So now we have what? We have two,

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:11.630
well, let me draw this is as a
square. We have two bonding domains.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:17.810
And, we have two non-bonding
domains. Now, we know that there's

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:35.886
more structure to this molecule.
Water is a very unique molecule.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:29.400
It's one of the only compounds,
there's only I think three, where

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.800
the density actually goes down when
it freezes. Think about that.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:53.733
Think of anything else with the
density goes down when it freezes,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.600
and think about where we would be if
that wasn't the case.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.000
Ponds would freeze from the bottom
up. That would be a bummer.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:56.810
All the fish would freeze in the
wintertime. Water has some pretty

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:02.630
unique properties,
which we'll deal with a little bit

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:08.450
later. But, it all relates to the
bonding, all relates to the bonding.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:14.270
And now, Lewis actually listed some
rules. And, what we want to do is

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:20.090
go by example here.
And these, by the way,

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:25.720
are called Lewis structures.
All right, and so,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.180
he came up with a set of rules.
And, let's take an example, and see

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:36.630
how these apply.
And as an example,

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:42.080
let's take sulfuryl chloride,
SO2, make it a little complicated,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.540
Cl2, right, so don't worry about
these compounds.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:16:06.613
And, we'll tell you all you need to
know except for how to draw them.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:57.150
And, it says, OK,
center the element with the lowest

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:01.300
average valence electron energy.
Well, if you look, sulfur is less

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.460
than chlorine,
which is less than oxygen.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.610
So, sulfur has the lowest average
valence electron energy.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.760
So, that says, put the sulfur in
the center. So,

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.920
put the sulfur in the center.
Then it says, count all the valence

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.580
electrons. Well, sulfur has six.
That's 3s2, 3p4.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:30.740
Oxygen, two times oxygen,
that's 12 because sulfur is 2s2,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:37.910
2p4, and chlorine, there's two of
those. That gives us 14,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:45.080
and that's 3s2, 3p5, and so we've
got to come up with,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:52.240
we have 32 electrons that we have to
use. OK, then it says draw a single

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:59.410
bond from each surrounding atom to
the central atom,

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:05.420
and subtract two valence electrons.
OK, and let's just put chlorine here,

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.280
chlorine here,
oxygen here, oxygen here.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.140
So, two, four, six, eight,
minus eight, that gives us 24.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:33.813
So, we have 24 electrons that we
have to come up with.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:24.570
And then it says,
OK, distribute the remaining

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:29.140
electrons in pairs so that each atom
has eight. Place the non-bonding

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.710
pairs on peripheral atoms first,
which the higher average valence

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.280
electron energy.
All right, well,

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.850
oxygen has the highest valence
electron energy.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.420
So, let's go and put the one,
two, three, four, five, six here.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:18:05.906
Let's do one, two, three, four,
five, six here.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:58.590
And, OK, and let's put the atoms
around. Now we'll do the chlorines.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:05.190
Chlorines have seven. So, one, two,
three, four, five,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:11.790
six, seven, right? One,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:18.390
seven. OK, so now we've got,
taken an electron from that sulfur,

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:35.380
put it here, an electron from that
sulfur, put it here.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:30.090
So, how many have we got in the
sulfur? We've got one,

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:35.180
two, three, four, five, six,
seven. Well, son of a gun, one,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.270
two, three, four, five, six, sulfur,
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:45.360
We've got six.
We've used all the electrons.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.450
But what do we have here? Well,
this chlorine has taken one electron

00:18:50.450 --> 00:19:07.900
from the sulfur.
But, the oxygen has taken two

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
electrons from the sulfur.
This is a kind of a special,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
and you might expect that. Oxygen
has the highest average valence

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
electron energy.
So, it's going to want to scarf,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and take these electrons. This is
called a dative bond.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
It's what it's called when an atom
takes both electrons in the bond.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:35.710
So, what do we have?
We have one, two, we have four

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:45.420
bonding domains.
And, how many non-bonding?

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:55.140
Well, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:12.713
ten, 11, 12. 12 non-bonding domains.
OK, so this is looking pretty good.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:20:06.890
We now have octet stability. We've
got each. Each one has an inert

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:11.490
electronic structure.
But, a few things to note.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.090
We know that because the sulfur and
the chlorine in the oxygen have

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:20.690
different average valence electron
energies, they'll have different

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:26.140
electron affinities.
So, this bond is going to be a

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:32.420
little bit different than this bond.
We have to account for that in some

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.710
way because we know that they don't
have identical average valence

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:55.353
electron energies. OK,
let's start over here.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:55.450
OK, let's try another one.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:02.360
Let's try something like four,
which is what? Methane. What do we

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:09.270
know about methane?
Well, we know it's stable.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:16.170
But, we also know that it's
symmetric. Right,

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:23.080
it's symmetric. We know that it's
non-polar. All right,

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:39.160
so those are the things that we know
about it.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000
We also know that carbon is 1s2,
2s2, 2p2, and we know what hydrogen

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000
is. And so, if we look at our box
notation, we've got three states in

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000
the p orbital.
We've got one in the s orbital.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000
If we apply the Hund rule, we've
got up arrow, down arrow, right?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:22:07.420
But, there is something else that we
know. We somehow have to take

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.850
hydrogen, attach it to carbon,
and we have to make it symmetric,

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:18.280
and we have to make it nonpolar.
And yet, we know that the shape of

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.920
the s orbital is spherical.
The shape of the p orbital is,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.780
however, not spherical. It's
asymmetric. And,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.640
moreover, they are at right angles
to one another that we've learned.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.490
So, somehow we have to figure out a
way to take orbitals that are

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.350
non-symmetric,
and convert them into orbitals that

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:42.210
are symmetric.
Now, what does that mean?

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.070
If it's symmetric, that means that
each bond has exactly

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.660
the same energy.
Same bond, symmetric bonds means

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.990
equal energy, which means equal
links. If we can do that,

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:01.330
we'll end up with a symmetric
nonpolar molecule.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.660
Well, this stumped people for
awhile until another fellow came

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.990
along: Linus Pauling.
He's famous for a lot of things,

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:17.330
one of which is covalent bonding.
And, he said, well, let

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:24.770
me take a look at this.
What if I were able to mix the

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:34.330
orbitals? All right,
what if I were able to mix these

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:43.880
orbitals and produce what he called
hybrid bonds? And,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:53.440
how would he do that?
Well, this is where the thinking

00:23:53.440 --> 00:24:07.680
comes in. He says let's just makes
the 2s and 2p orbitals.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:24:08.250
And, I know I need to come up with
four symmetric equi-length bonds,

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:26.266
and let's just see, let's draw the
structure here.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:24:18.750
And, if I take and I mix the 2s and
the 2p's, and by the Hund rule,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:36.366
if I can come up with four, what
have I got?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:30.440
I've got two states here,
three states here, two here,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.880
I need four, and if I can come up
with these bonds,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:43.330
four, by the Hund rule I'd fill them
like this. And there I have it.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:49.770
I have four bonds that are of equal
energy, and he called

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:55.410
this an sp3 hybrid.
And now, I can't do the drawing

00:24:55.410 --> 00:25:00.240
justice. But let's take a look at
how we do this.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.080
The graph to the left,
this is the s orbital, symmetric.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.910
These are the p orbitals. And,
these are what?

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:14.740
These are the probability densities,
right? Our friend Schršdinger told

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.580
us that if you solve for the wave
function, this is what the

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.450
probability densities look like.
If I now hybridize these,

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:29.360
if I take these and I make four
symmetric, now,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.270
these are just the sp3 orbitals.
The hydrogen's not on there yet.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:39.170
Notice, the orbital looks kind of
funny. It's got a big lobe and a

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:44.080
little lobe. And,
they are sort of backed into it.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:26:03.493
So, this forms a tetrahedron, which
forms the sp3 hybrid orbitals.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:55.590
Now, the hydrogen,
on the other hand, the hydrogen has

00:25:55.590 --> 00:26:02.190
symmetric s orbitals,
and now if we take, and this is just

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:08.790
another way to look at it,
you take these sp3 hybridized

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:15.390
orbitals, and you add a hydrogen to
each one. And now,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:32.913
what do you have? You have a
symmetric molecule, and let's see.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:45.450
You have a molecule where we put the

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:52.360
carbon in the center,
and we go up like this,

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:59.270
like this, and out the back.
And now you have a tetrahedron with

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:06.170
equal length bonds.
And, it's going to be symmetric.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:13.080
Now, will it be polar or nonpolar?
We are getting a little ahead of

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:29.693
ourselves. What makes something
polar versus nonpolar?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:24.830
Well, if this bond has completely
identically equal sharing of

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:29.660
electrons, then this bond will be
nonpolar. However,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:34.490
we're going to see that that's not
the case for hydrogen and carbon.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:39.330
This bond will be nonpolar. So,
that means we've got one,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:44.160
two, three, four nonpolar bonds in
here. And yet,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:28:01.853
the molecule is symmetric and
nonpolar.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:53.250
What's going on?
Well, what's going on is the carbon

00:27:53.250 --> 00:28:12.000
is at the exact center of the
tetrahedron. So,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:28:01.750
the nonpolar bonds cancel each other
out. The two sources of charge

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:21.166
cancel each other out.
And, you get a nonpolar molecule.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:10.250
OK, so that's what Pauling did.
But, he did a little bit better.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:30.466
Lewis, by the way, didn't get the
Nobel prize. But Pauling did get a

00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:18.750
Nobel prize. So,
you say to yourself,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:37.766
well, Lewis is the guy that came up
with the idea.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:27.940
Why didn't he get the Nobel prize?
Well, he came up with the theory.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.880
But he didn't reduce it to something
quantitative. Pauling did that.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.820
And so, let's go back and take a
look at the energetics again.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.760
Let's take another look at the
energetics. Now,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.700
last day, we looked at the
energetics of the ionic bond,

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.640
right? And we wrote something that
looks, the energy is equal to minus

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.580
the Madelung constant times
Avogadro's number,

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.520
q1 q2 over 4 pi epsilon zero R zero.
**E =

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.550
-M*NAv*q1*q2/(4*pi*epsilon0*R0)**
And, we knew that if we know the

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:12.660
crystal structure we can get the
Madelung constant,

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.770
not a problem. And,
what we need to do is to get this.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:22.880
Well, how do we get that? Well, if
we just take, for example,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:41.760
MgO, and let's try Mg, magnesium
chloride just as an example.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
We put the magnesium 2 plus here,
and then we put the oxygen here, O 2

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
minus, and we know that this gives
us our R zero,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
right? So, we can go and measure
that. We haven't said much about

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
how to measure it,
but you can measure it.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
If we wanted to get the chlorine,
we could just put the chlorine over

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
here, and we'd measure
another radius there.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:30:05.330
And, we could easily calculate the
energies. Well,

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:12.660
with covalent bonding,
it's not so simple. It's not so

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:28.720
simple, and so let's see how,
let's take an example.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And let's take an example,
HF, hydrofluoric acid, all right?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Well, if we wanted to draw that, we
have HF, whoops --

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.200
It looks something like that.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:42.600
But let's say we wanted to
calculate the energy.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:31:01.666
Now, Pauling was trying to figure
out how to do this.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:51.400
And he said, well, what if I were
to take, and just somehow add up

00:30:51.400 --> 00:31:11.266
bonds, the energies of bonds,
or derive this energy from energies

00:30:35.800 --> 00:31:01.420
that I do know?
And so, let's take HH,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:08.280
the HH bond. More particularly,
the HH bond, right, and let's ask

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:15.140
what the energy of that is.
Well, we can look that up, and

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:31.946
that's table in your text,
by the way, B14 in your text.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:29.270
And, we can come up with a number of
435 kilojoules per mole.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:36.540
Well, if we want to get HF,
let's see what the FF bond is.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:43.810
Well, you go look in your table and
you come up with 160 kJ per mole.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:51.080
So, if I had to guess, what would
you guess the bond energy would be

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:58.360
in HF? Well, 435,
160, take 435, add it to 160,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:05.110
divide by two.
Maybe that would be a guess.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:11.330
Or, I could come up with some other
scheme. But, you would kind of

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:17.550
guess that it would be somewhere in
between. It would be somewhere in

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:23.770
between. Well,
what's the actual value?

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:41.006
Well, the HF bond energy is
actually 569 kJ per mole.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:33.690
So, we have a problem.
The problem is we can't add these

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.380
two together. There's no way that
we can get from here,

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.070
to here, to here without knowing a
little bit more information.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.760
And, we get that information by
going back to the definition.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.460
What's the definition of the
covalent bond?

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.150
Sharing of electrons.
Well, they don't have to share

00:32:52.150 --> 00:33:10.633
equally, do they?
And, if they don't share equally,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
then the individual bonds might have
different energies.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And so, that's exactly what Pauling
proposed, right?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:02.000
And he actually proposed sharing --

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
-- unequal sharing of electrons.
And, he needed to get quantitative.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And, he defined a term called the
electronegativity.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:44.540
And, in your text,

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:53.630
it's E sub N. But,
in most chemistry texts,

00:33:53.630 --> 00:34:02.720
it's also chi. That's the more
common term. And,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:11.810
it represents the ability of an atom
to attract electrons in a bond,

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:20.900
all right? The ability of an atom
to attract electrons,

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:34.266
and in particular, in a covalent
bond.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:35.230
All right, and he came up with a
scheme, and this is how he ranked

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:40.460
things. And, you can see a parallel.
If you take a look at the last day,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:45.690
or the day before, you will see that
we talked about average valence

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:50.920
electron energy.
There is a striking parallel here

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:56.150
in that the group one elements have
a tendency to want to give up

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:01.380
electrons, whereas the fluorine,
chlorine, bromine, have a tendency

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:06.280
to attract electrons.
And so, this is a schematic of the

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.850
electronegativity scale.
Now, Pauling originally assumed

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:15.420
that fluorine was the most
electronegative element.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:35.240
So, he assumed, he referenced or
normalized everything to fluorine.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:24.280
Since that time,
we've been able to actually measure

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.570
these bond strengths by PES,
photoelectron spectroscopy. And,

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:32.850
when you do that, it turns out that
fluorine doesn't come out to exactly

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:37.140
four. And, this is a figure out of
your text. And,

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.420
you can see that fluorine,
instead of four, it's about 4.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.710
9. But, it's as you would expect.
The most electronegative elements,

00:35:45.710 --> 00:36:05.820
fluorine, chlorine, oxygen, are over
here. The highest one is neon.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:54.610
But the lowest one is way down here,
cesium. I mean, you would expect

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:59.220
that the group one,
absent hydrogen, would be the ones

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.840
that would have the least.
Now, remember, the formation of the

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.460
ionic bonds was from group one and
group two, and over here with group

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.070
six and seven.
So, those are the ones that most

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.690
likely form ionic bonds.
OK, not only did he propose it.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:35.746
He quantified it.
And, he did something even

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:22.000
better. Let's see --

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:49.420
He defined something called,
how much time do we have, partial

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:56.850
charge. Now, this is what got him
the Nobel prize.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:04.280
And, he defined partial charge,
I'll give you the formula: G sub x,

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:15.693
this is in your text, N sub x --

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
-- in an XY bond, right?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:34.660
Chi sub x plus chi sub y,
right, where G sub X is the group

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:47.330
number. N sub X is the number of
non-bonding electrons.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:57.793
And, B sub X is the number of
bonding electrons.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
OK, now let's take this and look at
what we get if we try HF.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000
All right, we know this is what it
comes out to. This is H.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
We've got one "x" here. We know
that this is going to be,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
by measurement, this is going to be
plus and this is going to be minus.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:29.810
It's going to be a dipole.
This is plus; this is minus.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:35.630
And, we know that chi of the
fluorine is 4.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:41.450
9, and chi of the hydrogen is equal
to 2.30. OK, well,

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:47.270
if we plug that in, let me just do
one of them, just do the fluorine.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:53.090
And, by the way, if you do this for
the hydrogen, it ought

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:59.750
to come out the same.
That's equal to seven minus six

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:07.250
minus two times 4.
9, or 4.19 plus 2.3.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:14.750
And, that gives you a number for
the fluorine, minus 0.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:22.250
9. Now, if you do the same for the
hydrogen, you'll come up

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:29.220
with the same number.
But, it will be plus,

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:35.660
all right? But, it will be plus.
And, so, what that tells us is HF

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:42.110
is polar. So,
we did that. And,

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:48.550
now let's go back to,
whoops, I'm running out of space.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:40:05.500
Let's go back to methane and see
what happens there.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:40:13.330
Let's go back to methane.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:29.593
Well, the chi of the carbon is
equal to 2.54.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:28.180
The chi of the hydrogen,
again, is what, 2.3. And,

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:36.360
so what this tells us, since these
aren't equal, that tells us that the

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:44.540
carbon-hydrogen bond is polar.
And so, if we go and we draw this

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:52.720
again, if this is the carbon here,
hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen,

00:40:52.720 --> 00:41:00.900
hydrogen like this,
then this is going to be a little

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:08.750
bit plus.
And this end is going to be negative.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:16.250
So, we know from our calculation
that we can do over here,

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:23.090
that this bond is polar.
This bond is polar,

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:29.270
but again, as I alluded to earlier,
because the carbon is centered in

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:35.450
the tetrahedron,
because of the sp3 hybridization,

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:41.630
the molecule itself is symmetric and
nonpolar. OK,

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:47.810
and for this, he got a Nobel in,
I think, 1954. OK, now one last

00:41:47.810 --> 00:42:05.553
thing that he did is that he said,
OK, what's going on here?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:57.600
Well, on the one hand,
we have ionic bonding where we have

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.200
complete sharing.
On the other hand,

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.800
if we have a perfect covalence bond,
we have identical equal sharing.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.400
But we know that just by this
calculation, that we don't have

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:27.400
equal sharing.
So, somewhere in between,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:15.600
the bonds are, we have a range of
bonds between ionic on the one hand,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.190
and perfectly covalent on the other
hand. But, there's a whole

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:23.660
range in between.
So, what's going on there?

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.990
Well, Pauling also suggested that
for that case,

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:34.330
that the bonds are partially ionic
and partially covalent.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:39.660
And, he came up with a relationship
to calculate the percent ionic

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:56.986
character. And, I'll
just give it to you.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:43:03.620
This is a squared,

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:08.870
give you a percent.
All right, so this is a

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:14.120
relationship. And so,
you can see where chi comes in here.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.370
And, this is the difference in
electronegativity between the two

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:24.720
elements, all right?
Let's see how much time.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:30.180
OK, he also, let me see,
he also, lastly, to close us out,

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:35.630
he also developed an analytical
expression for the energy of that

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:41.080
covalent bond,
which is really what we want.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.540
All right, so the type of bond
energies that we can go and look up

00:43:46.540 --> 00:44:05.013
in tables are individual atom bonds,
H-H, F-F, and the like.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:56.660
But he said the energy of an X-Y
bond is going to be equal

00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:09.586
to the square root.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:44:12.600
Right, so the X-X bond and the Y-Y
bond, we can look up those energies,

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:20.190
plus 96.3, delta chi squared, and
kilojoules per mole.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:28.400
Where does the 96.3 come from?
Well, it's a conversion factor.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:37.200
So, this gives you the energy of
the bond. Now,

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:45.990
if we plug in the numbers,
we plug in the numbers for HF.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:54.790
What do we get? Well, we get
square root of 435 times 160 plus 96.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:45:03.590
times chi H minus chi carbon,
whoops, squared, and you get this

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:16.713
number here is 2.3.
This is 4.19. You get the E of the

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:22.690
HF is equal to 608.
OK, now, where is my other one?

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:28.090
Somewhere here, 569 over here,
kilojoules per mole,

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:33.490
and by his formula he gets 608,
which isn't bad, which really isn't

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:38.890
bad at all. OK,
so what we've gone through today is

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:44.290
we've introduced covalent bonding,
and we've figured out a way to

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:49.130
quantify it.
Not only did we figure out a way to

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:53.390
describe how we quantify it,
but we've also quantified how we

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:57.660
tell the difference between covalent
and ionic, and percent ionic

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.930
character. So,
those are the key things to remember

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:06.190
for today. But hold on a minute.
What have we got? We've got a few

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:10.460
minutes here. I'm just going to
give you an example of sp3

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.730
hybridization.
There's a scientist,

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:34.393
Thomas Midgley, and Professor
Sadoway calls him sp3 Midgley.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:23.920
He developed a whole lot of
compounds based on sp3 hybridization.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.840
And, this one here,
some of you might recognize,

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.760
is dichlorodifluoromethane. It's
also known as a CFC.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.690
And, this is the shape.
It's SP3 hybridized. Now,

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:43.610
it's not going to be symmetric is it,
because there's two fluorines and

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:48.530
two chlorines.
So, it's a nonsymmetric molecule.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:53.180
But, what is so unusual about this?
Well, up until probably ten years

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:57.560
ago, this was the primary propellant
in just about every kind of spray

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.930
thing that we had,
hairspray, everything.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:06.300
It's called freon. It's also used
in air conditioners.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.680
What was neat about it is before
that time, the predominant species

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.050
to use for air conditioning or
refrigeration was ammonia.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:19.430
And, not too many people, actually,
if you talk to your grandmother or

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:23.810
grandfather, there were some
refrigerators that were actually

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:28.120
made that used ammonia.
But, when they sprung a leak,

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.370
you had a problem. And so, by and
large, until this freon was invented

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:36.620
by Midgley, there wasn't a good gas
that had the right properties to be

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.870
used for a refrigerant.
And so, this was good as a

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:45.120
refrigerant. But,
something else can happen with these

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.370
things. And, I think you hear about
this in the news a lot.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:53.620
If you get some of these in the
upper atmosphere,

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.870
a photon, an ultraviolet photon,
has the energy capable of breaking

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:01.750
this bond.
When it breaks this bond,

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.250
that chlorine atom, a free chlorine
atom comes down and reacts,

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.750
this is ozone, with the ozone in the
upper atmosphere.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:12.250
And you end up with the destruction
of the ozone layer.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.750
And, this is what you hear a lot
about in the news,

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:19.250
Kyoto, and all this kind of thing
about destruction of

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:23.630
the ozone layer.
Well, Mario Molina,

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:28.900
who was a faculty member here at MIT,
won a Nobel prize for describing

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:34.180
this process. He wasn't here at MIT
when he won the prize,

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:39.450
but here's the actual paper.
Now, you think you can make a

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:44.720
mistake on your exam,
take a look at this up here at tell

00:48:44.720 --> 00:49:01.773
me what that all is.
I have no idea.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.500
That's exactly the actual paper.
It actually should be chlorine

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:39.000
catalyzed shouldn't it?
But, who cares, he got the Nobel

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.500
prize. And, I'm sure he's not
worried about it at all.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:48.000
OK, good luck on your tests,
and remember the review session if

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
you care.
