00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Hello.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.790
I'm Nance Groce.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.470
I'm a folklorist at the American
Folklife Center here at the Library

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.710
of Congress and I'd like to welcome
you to our latest presentation

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.770
in an ongoing Benjamin
A Botkin Lecture Series.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.080
The Botkin series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.740
of leading scholars in the
disciplines of folklore,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.530
ethnomusicology, oral history

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.450
and cultural heritage while
enhancing the collections here

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.570
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600
For this center and the Library,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.020
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.200
of our acquisitions activities.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.920
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.360
of the permanent collections
here at this center.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.150
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcast

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.720
on the Library's website where
they'll be available for viewing

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570
to internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.940
So if you haven't already done
so, now would be an excellent time

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.840
to shut off any electronic devices
that you are carrying with you.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.090
Today, I'm delighted to
welcome Samuel Torjman Thomas,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
a performer in ethnomusicologist
who holds degrees

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.850 position:56%
from the Berkley College of Music
in Jazz Composition and Performance,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.320
a Master's from CUNY/Brooklyn
College

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.450
and who recently finished
a PhD in Ethnomusicology

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.310 position:56%
and the City University of New York.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.710
Samuel is currently teaching at
CUNY's John Jay and Hunter Colleges

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.640
and he's really a multifaceted
person.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.880
He's a performer, he's a woodwind
specialist and he plays sax, ney,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.860
clarinet, flute and
I'm sure other things.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.160
You're a percussionist.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.590
You're a composer and
also a vocalist.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.370
As an ethnomusicologist,
his research focuses

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.520 position:56%
on North African musical traditions,
Arab music, Jewish music,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.900
and also jazz, rock and
American popular music.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.900
Thomas is a founder and leader of
Asefa, I'm pronouncing it right,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.480
Asefa, a New York based ensemble
devoted to contemporary approaches

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.740
to composition, improvisation
and fusion drawn from Sephardic,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.220
North African and jazz traditions.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.540
He's also the Executive Director
of JATM, the Jewish Awareness

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.480 position:56%
Through Music, an applied
ethnomusicology organization focused

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.200
on cultural exchange through music.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.520
And I understand some of your
ancestors came from Morocco, Sam,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.660
so as most of you here
know Morocco has one

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.590
of the world's most
complex musical soundscapes.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.740
Moroccan music has always had
a fascination for him and here

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.530
at the Library of Congress

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.920
at the American Folklife
Center we also have--

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.650
are particularly proud to have
some very important collections

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.830
of Moroccan music including
the fieldwork recordings

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.820
of Paul Bowles and
Henrietta Yurchenco.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.980
So, we get forms of an important
facet of our collection here

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.280
at the American Folklife Center.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.710
I just want to take a
moment to thank the Library

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.460
of Congress' Hebrew Language
Table and especially Gail Shirazi

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.290
for co-sponsoring today's
Botkin lecture as well

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.880
as acknowledging the
cooperation and support

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.070
of the Washington Jewish Music
Festival, which is in the midst

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.100
of its 17th Annual
Jewish Music Festival.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.100
And I believe the performers you'll
see here today will be performing

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.770
this evening.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.680
I'd also like to welcome, I'm not
sure he's here yet, Mr. Fouad Arif

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.970
who is with, the Head of the
Moroccan official news agency,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.230
Maghreb Arabe Press and also
Charles Jahant, who will be coming,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.680
who will be honoring
us with their presence.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.830
Today, Dr. Thomas will be
speaking on the musical soundscapes

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.090
of Morocco from Africa to America.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.510
Please join me in making
him welcome.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.310
[ Applause ]

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.270
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: Thank you Nancy,
thank you Gail and the Library.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.710
And welcome.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.010
Good afternoon ladies and
gentlemen how are you?

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.310
Good, excellent.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.790
So I'm intending with this lecture
to give a bit of a whirlwind tour

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.900
of Morocco in terms of its
background and its foundations

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.200
and especially in the idea
of how the circulation

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.000
of musical expression has gone
beyond the borders of Morocco

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.930
and especially here in America.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.540
My research, which we'll get
to a little bit more as well,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.750 position:56%
deals most specifically with the
Moroccan Jewish community in America

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.900
but beyond that of course with the
Moroccan community in general --

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.080
both my research work and as a
performer encapsulates much more.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.430
So we'll touch on that as well.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.060
And, of course, I would be remiss

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.520
if I didn't mention these really
interesting-looking instruments

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.910
up here and the need to share those
with you at some point as well.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.940
And then if you like what you hear
and there will be more tonight here

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.710
in DC, which you can come and
experience an entire concert,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.600
so with no further ado:
"The Musical Soundscapes

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.410
of Morocco from Africa to America."

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.170
First of all, one of the most
important points that I would make

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:47.400
about Morocco and its history
is the inherent diversity

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.150
in the country itself.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.430
How many of you have
been to Morocco?

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.960
OK. So, you know, you know
what I'm talking about already.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.300
But for everybody to be on the
same page let us do a little bit

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.260
of a background here that
the inherent diversity

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.930
of Morocco is certainly one
of the most valuable elements

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.580
of Moroccan society and perhaps
one of the most promising elements

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.330
for humanity in general, if I
may wax a little bit polemical

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.630
for a moment.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.570
But the diversity there in
terms of ethnic diversity,

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.250
there are several languages
that are spoken in Morocco,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.070
the Amazigh dialect of the
popularly known Berber community,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.900 position:56%
which is the native North
Africans; there's Arabic, of course,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.000
and that being a Maghrebi or
North African dialect that Arabic:

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.460
there's Hebrew; and, of course,
there's French and there's Spanish.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.280
So there's quite a lot of
linguistic diversity going

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.220
on in Morocco itself.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.520
And, of course, with all

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.480
of that linguistic diversity
comes also a diversity in religion

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.120
and even in racial background.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.380
So as I mentioned before already
we have the North African Native

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.140
community, but we have
the Arabic community

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.910
which is the Arab communities
been there already for several,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.950
several centuries since the
early expansion of Islam

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.280
across North Africa to the West.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.970
And then the Jewish community dates
back 2000 years, the destruction

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.370
of the Second Temple
in Jerusalem, well,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.250
destruction of the First Temple
actually began the Jewish Diaspora

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.600
as we know it, but by the Second
Temple certainly Jews are traveling

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.310 position:56%
further afield and ending up in many
different parts of the Roman world

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.960
and Morocco itself was
part of that constellation.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.510
So, that is really
very deeply inherent.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:06.220 position:56%
We also have the Sub-Saharan African
community, the Gnaoua community

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.820
in Morocco brought across
the Saharan Arab slave trade

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:18.290
and certainly infusing a large West
African presence in the county.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.800
What we'll get to, we'll get to
a little bit more in a moment.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.350
So, just a couple photos to
kind of represent this idea.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:34.970
This is a Quran, picture of
a Quran written in Morocco.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:43.420
This is a collection of Torah
scrolls in the Aron or the cabinet

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:49.020
of a Moroccan synagogue and
they are uniquely Moroccan

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.480
and that they are standing
up in these kind

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.780
of very ornate round
encasings with scarves

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.290
on them and things like that.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.630
And then we have here the Hamsa,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:08.390 position:56%
which is a very prominent symbol
throughout the Middle Eastern world.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:13.370
But, and if you notice, the
writing on it is actually Amazigh,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.250
which is the Berber dialect.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:20.110
So, we have this kind
of juxtaposition

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:25.300
of this diversity just
everywhere in Moroccan society.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.230
Certainly, we must
also take into account

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.030
that there's regional
diversity in Morocco.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.860
Certainly there are
villages and there are cities

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.860
and there are coastal
areas and inland areas.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:46.520 position:56%
So, you know, that has an effect too
on the culture of Morocco overall.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.340
And topographically, too, we
have quite a diversity going on.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.560
We have several mountain ranges--
some of you have probably traveled

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.010
through the Atlas perhaps even
the Rift Mountains in the north.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.850
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.300
&gt;&gt;Samuel Thomas: Yup, and we
have the valley areas and we have

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.570
of course the edge
of the Sahara Desert.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.740
All of these different
zones juxtaposition

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.990
in one relatively small land area.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:20.670
So, this is kind of
at a fundamental core

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.720
of Moroccan diversity, I would say.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:31.230 position:56%
To move on, you can see over here
the reason I've included this map is

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:37.690 position:56%
to talk a bit about Morocco as a
conduit point between East and West,

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:43.780
because Moroccan history--
and this is I point

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.480
out to the population flows.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.030
Moroccan history being on the
cusp of North Africa there,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:58.420
on the farthest western side, has
seen people traveling through it

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.370 position:56%
as kind of a nexus point and I think
that's very fundamental as well

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.580
to Moroccan culture--

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:11.090
to the development of Moroccan
culture over the centuries.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.110
The notion of Morocco as isolated

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.770
from the Iberian Peninsula
is relatively recent.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:28.860 position:56%
Morocco would-- The flows between
people across the Iberian Peninsula,

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.500
I mean, across the
Strait of Gibraltar

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.930
into the Iberian Peninsula is
very common in earlier centuries.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:41.110
In fact, if anybody is up
on Andalus history, right,

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:48.330
the founding of the Andalusian
Caliphate in Cordoba was

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:54.800 position:56%
with the help of Berber mercenary
armies, Amazigh armies from Morocco.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:04.320
In fact, Gibraltar is titled after
the general who led these armies,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.810
Tariq ibn Ziyad, and that's why
it's called Jabal Tariq the Mount

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.750
of Tariq, Gibraltar.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.900
Furthermore, as we continue

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.950
into later centuries we certainly
have empires actually being

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.050
expressed centered in Morocco
and expressed across the Strait

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:32.470 position:56%
of Gibraltar, the Al Mourabitoun and
the Al Muwahhidun are both centered

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.100
in Morocco, but expressing
their power northward.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.710
So, point being that this is kind
of a nexus point and has been

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.390
for a long time for a lot of
diversity to travel through.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.160
And, of course, with that is going

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.770
to come a diversity in
cultural expressions.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:03.400
So to turn now to the diversity
in my area of interest with--

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.020 position:56%
in terms of musical expression would
be the Moroccan musical cultures,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.320
right?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:16.490 position:56%
So, what do I mean by Arab, Amazigh,
Andalusi, Gnaoua musical cultures?

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.920 position:56%
So, included in this would be, well,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.700 position:56%
with the Arab musical cultures would
be the kinds of things developed

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.470
in the classical style
of music centered

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:35.080
around Arabic composition both in
terms of the poetry and in terms

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.810
of the music itself;
systems of music.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.800
So, this would be developing
in Abbasid,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.040
Baghdad finding its way westward
and be developing in Andalus

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.750
and finding its way southward.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:55.510
To this very day the Arab classical
music tradition in Morocco,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:05.330
al-Ala al-Andalusia, is
markedly different from the

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.120
"Arab classical styles"
that are in Algeria

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.640
and Tunisia further to the east.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.700
The Ottoman Empire stopped
at the doorstep of Morocco.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.580
So, the patrimony

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:24.590 position:56%
of the Andalusian-Moroccan classical
music sphere has been kept more

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.990
intact in Morocco.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.410
So, this is expressed in the
modes, the musical modes,

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.410
in the rhythmic modes,
certainly in the song texts

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.610
and in the melodies themselves.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.290
So, that I would-- I classify
there under the Arab styles.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.230
Amazigh styles would be the
again the native communities

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.860
that primarily centered outside
the cities in the villages

00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:01.160
or in the smaller towns and there
you have different instruments,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.830
different approaches
to melody making,

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.390
certainly different
languages, different texts,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.900
and even some different-- entirely
different performance contexts.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.860
And there is some overlap there

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.660
which without getting too technical
I don't think this lecture is

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.540
to be super, super technical so
I'm not going to get into the taqs

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.560
and the dooms in terms
of the rhythmic cycles,

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.870
but you can see a lot
of that happen.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:35.330
So, the Andalusi, as I remark
before, this connection

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.580
to Andalusian music and
the patrimony of that

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.830
and then the Gnaoua music as well
which is this Sub-Saharan music

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.560
that is been present in
Morocco now for centuries.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.400
Anybody here had been to
Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakech?

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.610
Yes. So did you have
a chance to dance

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.060
with any Gnaoua musicians there?

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:01.330
They usually like to get
you involved, you know.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.630
Huh?

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.930
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.230
&gt;&gt;Samuel Those: Yes you will.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.530
OK, good. You will.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.830
Excellent.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.480
And after this, you know, you'll
be ready to jump right in, good.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.820 position:56%
So, in terms of musical systems, and
this where I will get a little bit,

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.250
I guess, technical for
us a bit, is the rhythm,

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.060
melody and language elements.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:27.420
Rhythmically speaking,
Moroccan music pretty much

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:33.170
across the board does share
these foundations and kind

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:40.000
of a 12-ish beat rhythmic
cycle and some breakup of this

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.240
and we hear this in
the Gnaoua music,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.200 position:56%
we hear it in the Amazigh community,
and in the Arab music cycles.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:54.130
How it is expressed in terms
of degrees of sophistication

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:59.420
or different variations
and stuff like that depends

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.640
on the music and the community.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:08.480
But the rhythm for the most part
is quite driving, quite cyclical

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.770
and quite-- what's the
word I'm looking for here--

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.810
infectious I think, yeah.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.240
So, if you find yourself
looking for a groove

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.170
and finding yourself
tapping along then

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.330
that I think is just about right.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.820
So, definitely aim for that.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:37.100
In terms of melody-making, there
are different modes for melody.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.100
So we have, you know, in the West,

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.990
in Western classical styles
we have modes typically based

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:55.640 position:56%
around-welcome-- and typically
based around like a harmonic system.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.620
So, for instance, you know,
the Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.390
So we have this and then we have
another mode built upon that

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.640
but it's all harmonically
driven, right?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.250
Whereas, in Moroccan music
it's all melodically driven,

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.550
so that the melody takes absolute
precedence there really is no

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:24.840
harmony per se to play chords
behind it or something like that.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.750
It's really about knowing
the melodies.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.830
Now the melodies do come
out of certain modes

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.700
like a Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do
kind of thing,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.750
but you could have two modes
that have the exact same notes

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.430
but different notes
are emphasized, right?

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:45.150
So, you could emphasize
Do-RE-Mi-Fa-So, that's one,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:51.370
or it could be
Do-Re-Mi-FA-So-Fa-Mi-Re-Do.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.010
And that's a different setup.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:59.920
So how the notes are emphasized
makes big difference in terms

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.690
of the system, the
systemizing of the melody.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.760
Then, in terms of melody-making
the--

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.920 position:56%
it's all melodically driven music so
that the melodies can be repetitive

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.420
and then changing to another melody
quite making a stark contrast

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.520
or the melodies can be more
complex in the classical tradition.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.470
And the way that musicians
are really trained are

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.120
to really learn these melodies
internally to the degree

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.080
that you can begin to play
around these melodies.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.780 position:56%
And what happens out of that is very
different from the Western context.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.640
So, I mean, I'm putting this in
relief to the Western context

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.300
but the Western classical style
where the harmony is driving a lot

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.540
of this and you have a
harmonic motion or, you know,

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.200
like the sonata form for instance
where you have a change of pitch

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.090 position:56%
in fact at another point in the
movement is all harmonically driven.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.090 position:56%
In this music being that it's all
melodically driven there are moments

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.390
of harmony.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.490
So the question is, well, what
are these moments of harmony

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.350
and how are they determined, right?

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.170
If they're not determined
in advance,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.470
then how are they determined?

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.530
They are determined
in a heterophonic way.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.540
So, for those of you that may
not be familiar with that term,

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:23.110
heterophony is when you have a
classroom of kids trying to sing

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.460
"Mary Had a Little
Lamb" together, OK?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.100
Or, if we all try to
sing, I don't know,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.990
"Stars Spangled Banner"
together, right now,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.260
I think we would experience
some heterophony.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.560 position:56%
And that just means that we end up--
we all know the melody but we end

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.270
up sort of expressing it timewise
a little different and we end

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.280
up getting these variations
that happen and so, you know,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.290
you move on to the next note at a
different time than you do and out

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.740
of that creates harmony of course.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.730
And that harmony then becomes
like an emergent quality rather

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.860
than a predetermined quality.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.170
So, listening to Moroccan
music and understanding it

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.800
that way I think is
a very important key.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.040
So that is the melodic approach.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.590
Language systems.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:17.470
Well, there are certainly styles

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:24.740
where the language is the higher
level composition in terms

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.260
of the poetry and the expression
of ideas of religious significance

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.380
such as, you know, texts
taken directly from the Quran

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:43.290
or in Hebrew the poets often
would be incorporating segments

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.240
from the Torah or from
the Tanakh and weaving

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.650
that together with other ideas.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:56.500
So, that's kind of like I
would say a high register.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:03.820
Then you have a more colloquial
style language expression

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.680
that is typically in Arabic
and then you have, of course,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.730
songs in Amazigh, as
I mentioned before.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.950 position:56%
You have songs that are even mixing.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:21.650 position:56%
And one important category to point
out would be the Judeo-Español songs

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.630
that are a unique dialect
in Morocco.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.380
So the Jews that were
part of the Expulsion,

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.360
the migration from the Expulsion
of Spain in 1492, many of which,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.050
of course, settled in Morocco
because of its proximity to Iberia,

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:46.860
to Spain, were bringing a
version of Spanish, right?

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:52.330
And that version of Spanish
would be mixed with Hebrew words

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.730
and as it would get into
Morocco it would be even mixed

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.740 position:56%
with Hebrew words and even sometimes
Arabic words and you would have

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.930
out of this then a unique dialect
that would develop over centuries

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:10.250
in contradistinction, let's
say, from that which developed

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:16.480
by the Sephardic Jews in
Turkey, or in Amsterdam.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.570
So that is part of
the language, too.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.010
And, well, I won't have time to
play you all the stuff I'd love

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:29.730
to play you today, but there are
some really interesting pieces

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.460
that combined, you know, this
diversity within the music

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.840
that you can really hear.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:41.350
The melodic stuff I'm talking about
mixed with the language of Haketia

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.220
which is the Judeo-Español dialect.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:52.230
So, in sum, what I'm getting
to is that Morocco's diversity,

00:23:52.230 --> 00:24:00.360
its inherent diversity in its
topography, in its ethnicity,

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:08.320
in its languages, in its musical
styles is forming a soundscape,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.450
OK, a Moroccan soundscape.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.500
So what do I mean by this?

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:18.010
Well, you know, we certainly
operate within a soundscape, right?

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:23.350
We were walking around Washington,
DC or New York City in my case and,

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.620
you know, there are sounds, there
are sounds going on there's a beat

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.590
to the city kind of, you know?

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:41.630 position:56%
And I think that's an important part
of our feelings as human beings.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.000 position:56%
When we're in this particular
soundscape it's part of constructing

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.630
who we are, much like of
course the language, I mean,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.980
this is an ethnomusicologist
rendition here very much.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.510
So, if I'm, you know, tooling
around Washington, DC--

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.530
well, let's go a little
further south

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.650
into Richmond or something, right?

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.180
Obviously my dialect of English
is going to be colored by that

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.830
which I hear around me, and so
much is the same case with music,

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.510
which is around us and
is coming into our ears

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.270
and is becoming part of us.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:18.230
So, in this particular case, in
the Moroccan setting we're talking

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:22.510
about a soundscape that is
extremely rich and diverse.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:30.510
And one in which there are clearly
are no walls, but lots of moments

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.430
of blending and crossover
between communities.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:44.360 position:56%
So, if we can take ourselves for a
moment and imagine the unseen world,

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.410
which of course is the
world of sound, right,

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.170
it's unseen, it's just around us.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:57.640
If we can take ourselves out of
the seen world, which includes,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.770
you know, judging a book by its
cover, knowing who's different

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.930
from one another, knowing
the political stuff,

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:09.880
knowing all these kinds of
distinctions and rather envision

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.600
that there is this entire sphere of
human experience that's happening

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.920
without borders and
without any sort of control

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.500
over any ability to
even control, right?

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:26.240
Because you cannot box up
what is in that soundscape.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:36.840
Then it becomes a field, if you
will, of contact of shared humanity

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.630 position:56%
of intercultural relations that then
forms something that's even greater

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:47.610
and emergent once again from
these different parts, right?

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.420
So the sum being greater-- or the
whole being greater than the sum

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.550
of the parts kind of idea.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:59.140
So that Moroccan soundscape
is sort of where I'm--

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.920
what I'm aiming at here and
then that Moroccan soundscape

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.660
as a reference point
or as an inspiration

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.870
for taking it into
the global sphere.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:20.540
So let me share with you now
a little bit of recordings

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.730
from some of my favorites.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:27.070
First is Amina Alaoui.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:32.360
This is "Melhun," which
is a style sung in Arabic

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.830
that is including some
classical elements

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:43.160
but it's also very much a music
of the lay people in the city

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.340
and expressing a kind of intensity
of diversity that one would expect

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.510
in a cosmopolitan kind of center.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:28:21.530
[ Music ]

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.560
[Background Music] The fact that
you have a woman singing, right,

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.510
and leading this is a very
significant part of this.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:57.340
[ Music ]

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:04.670
I'm just going to see if this
might sound a little better.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.600
If you don't mind,
bear with me a second.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.900
Let's see.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.200
[ Music ]

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.860
Let me just put this.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.530
This composer, Salim
Halali, band leader, is--

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:28.240
had a club in Casablanca for
many years called Le Coq d'Or,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.880
"The Golden--

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.180
&gt;&gt; Audience member: Rooster.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.480
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: -- Rooster".

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.780
Thank you.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:42.760
And, so he's a Jewish leader but he
sings almost exclusively in Arabic

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:48.340
and this style would
be the cha'abi style.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.970
OK. OK, this may-- oh, let's see.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.400
[ Music ]

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.200
[Background Music] Sorry.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:22.560
[ Music ]

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.510
And he's active in the
1950s and '60s primarily.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:32.810
[ Music ]

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:37.740
He himself is of Amazigh
background and that's significant

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.510
because of Amazigh
Jewish background.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:49.510
[ Music ]

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.640
I was saying that he's actually
of Amazigh Jewish background,

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.920
which is often not thought about,
but again it's another example

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.960
of the intensity of this
diversity in Morocco that Amazigh

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.760
or the Berber community
has Jews and Muslims.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.470
So, he's definitely
representative of that.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:16.610
This is a bit of Gnaoua music.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.480
And now what we'll
check out here is --

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.820
now we're going to start
to see the projection

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.840
of Moroccan musical culture
into the global sphere.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:33.610
And this is certainly something
that is aided by modern technology

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.470
from recordings being
circulated throughout the world,

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:43.010
certainly the internet now
makes, you know, makes me be able

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:48.320
to visit a village in Morocco
while sitting in my bedroom--

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:54.790
YouTube and listening to some
music, which is quite cool.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.390
But that circulation
technology certainly the advent

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.020
of modern travel technology
and communication technology

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.640
in general is creating an entire--

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:11.760
another realm for experiencing
Moroccan music as oppose

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.500
to maybe taking one individual
coming from another place

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.110
and introducing something
into another place,

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:25.680
there's much more robust
opportunity for sharing.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.330
And this, as I've already
made the point,

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.960
is inherent to Moroccan
culture anyway this kind

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.540
of cross-intercultural confluence
going on in this nexus point,

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.250
so it's quite natural:
but let's take a listen

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.900
to some Gnaoua music from Morocco.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:33:23.280
[ Music ]

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:30.270
[Background Music] And now for
Hassan Hakmoun, who is a performer

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.010
in New York City, and
you can hear the tabla,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.510
the Indian tabla mixed in here.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.040
[ Music ]

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.510 position:56%
Lots of reverb effects and things
like that from electronic recording.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:34:12.870
[ Music ]

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.470
[Background Music] This
is some Amazigh music,

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:19.070
traditional Amazigh music.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:26.290
This is Mohammed Rouicha in the
Atlas Mountains, "Awa Awa Zin",

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:33.510
playing a lotar, a string
instrument with a skin resonator.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:42.070
[ Music ]

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:47.010
And this is a Bendir drum,
a frame drum with snares,

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:53.360
very typical Moroccan drum,
also relative of the Pandero,

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.510
Bendir-- Pandero in Spain.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:15.190
[ Music ]

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.620
Call-and-response elements
there in this music quite a lot.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:25.710
Now this is a modern version,
this is Cheb i Sabbah, a remixer,

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.350
taking much of that same stuff

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:31.510
and now projecting this
into European context.

examples of this happening.

I'm going to invite up some
musicians now to join me and share

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:11.270
with you something from the
Arab-Andalusia tradition.

The piece that we're going to
listen to is, it's called a "Tushia"

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.130
and it is a kind of
a foundational piece

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.430
that sets the mode of the music.

so we don't blind anybody, OK?

is Eric Platz on the percussion,

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.380
John Murchison on the bass, and
Eylem Basaldi on the violin.

Let me have you move away because
they're going to turn that on again.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.700
So the idea of the
Moroccan Diaspora,

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.510
certainly Diaspora is a concept
we're all familiar with and coming

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.420
from the Jewish experience,
the notion of a spread

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.570
from an individual-- from
a particular homeland,

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.590 position:56%
having an orientation to that
homeland and in the case of the Jews

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:55.120
with the 2000-year-old
Diaspora the notion of an exile

00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:00.700
or a schism causing
this spread to occur.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.470
There has been a lot of
discussion in Diaspora studies

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:09.170
over the last couple decades
of extending that term now

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.740
in a more modern period
with globalization

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:20.200
and such transnationalism, what
have you, and that still scholars

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.360
of Diaspora studies agree
that there is some connection

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:30.260
over a large expense fostered,
these connections fostered

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.000
by cultural expressions
and in this case music.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.010 position:56%
So, the American context of Moroccan
musical life certainly include a

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.570
connection to this
Moroccan Diaspora,

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:48.780
which loosely would
include France and Canada

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:54.480
as two other particularly strong
nodes of Moroccan life, and Israel,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.770
which has a large Moroccan
population.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:06.890
So, the American context in New
York and in LA and even here

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.170
in the Washington DC
area certainly contribute

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:15.990
to this diasporic constellation,
as I like to think of it.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:22.720 position:56%
Now, my work is focused mostly on
the Moroccan Jews in Brooklyn, well,

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.910
around the world but, you know,

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:30.170 position:56%
when you're doing a PhD dissertation
you have to pick a spot [laughs].

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.770
So I focused primarily here.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:40.400 position:56%
And in this community, the community
itself has roots from the 1950s.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.660
As you see in this picture here
on the right, there were groups

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:50.940
of young men brought from Morocco
to study in Jewish seminaries

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:55.950
in Brooklyn, a couple
waves of young boys

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.450
who later would become
communal leaders

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:03.870
in the Brooklyn Middle Eastern
Sephardic Jewish community.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:07.340
So this is many-- this is them
coming fresh off the boat here

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.820
to Israel-- I'm sorry, to America.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:18.020
Here is a Moroccan synagogue in
Brooklyn, kind of the flagship,

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.420 position:56%
I would say, Moroccan synagogue, the
synagogue where the representative

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:26.760
from the Moroccan consulate
comes every Yom Kippur

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:31.350
to receive a blessing for the
king of Morocco from the Rabbi.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:39.160 position:56%
And so the Rabbi invites him in and
opens the arc with the Torah scrolls

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.320
and gives a blessing to the
king of Morocco from Brooklyn.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.520
So that notion-- yeah,
of connection.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.980
And meanwhile I should point out,

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.300
that while this picture really
doesn't do a justice there is

00:43:53.300 --> 00:44:01.430
so much hand carving-- hand
carved work all around the ceiling

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:06.380
that was provided by the previous
king, Hassan II, sending artisans,

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.810
a team of artisans from
Morocco to actually do this

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:16.670
for the Moroccan Jewish
community in Brooklyn.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.320
This is the Rabbi of the
synagogue, Gad Bouskila,

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:26.540
and he is also the prayer leader
and does a lot of the chanting

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.420
of the sacred text as well.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.930
Again, Jewish approaches in this
particular case to reiterating

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:41.820
that Moroccan soundscape idea,
so let me just play you a bit.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.850
What I want to play you now is
actually a recording that I made

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.020
in the field in Morocco in
Shifshawan which is a town

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.850
in the north, which I had
the pleasure of visiting.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:45:01.350
And I was woken up at, oh,
maybe 4 o'clock in the morning,

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:06.450
by the sound of this
muezzin chanting.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:11.820
And the way Shifshawan is built,
it's quite hilly and there's,

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.790
you know, some differences there
and so right out the backside

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.590
of my first floor window of
the Riyadh that I was staying

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:26.250
in was the minaret speaker
from the mosque, so.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.280
But, you know, it really brought,
it really drove home this idea

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.800
of the soundscapes, right?

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.130
And I was thinking to myself and
certainly in my professional work

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:39.100
as a musician I'm thinking about
this idea of the soundscapes

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:43.530
of Morocco and generating
some connection to that,

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.930
even in a new way by new
composition and such like that.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:52.770
So, we're going to hear now
this soundscape in action, OK,

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:56.920
just imagine its 4 o'clock
in the morning, all right?

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.280
And then we'll follow that up

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:06.350
with hearing some sacred
text cantillation in Hebrew.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:11.100
And I want you to just notice the
similarities, the musical modes,

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.370
the-- just the way
things are expressed

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:19.100 position:56%
and that can drive home some of this
notion of that soundscape is just--

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:24.510
it's something that
belongs to everybody.

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:47.040
[ Music ]

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:52.510
And you can hear in the distance
another one happening as well.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:47:25.170
[ Music ]

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.510
And this is in Hebrew.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:51.820
[ Music ]

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.350
So then we have the
Arabic and the Hebrew.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:59.670
This cantillation bit that I
played you is actually a rendition

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:04.470
of different markings of
cantillations, you know,

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:09.840
of the Torah, so it wasn't actually
verses from the Torah per se,

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.220
but that would be exactly
how it would sound

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:18.410
than as applied to the Torah text.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:23.310
So, another way of
constructing a Jewish iteration

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:31.130 position:56%
of this Moroccan soundscape and
keeping it alive in this Diaspora is

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:35.310
through these contrafacta
techniques which is very popular

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:40.530
in the Jewish community: one is
Trakib and the other is non-Trakib.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:47.080
Tarkib is a practice where the
actual Arabic is reinvented

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:53.870 position:56%
in the Hebrew and there's an attempt
by the poet to match the phonetics

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:58.830
of the Arabic and the
syllables a well.

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:02.980
So for instance, there's a famous
[foreign language] text called

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.280
[foreign language].

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.140
All right, [foreign language], in
Hebrew becomes [foreign language].

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.990
So, that is very, very similar.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:10.290
That's Tarkib.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.890
Non-Tarkib is I will just
take the actual melody

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:19.680
and simply graph the
Hebrew text on it.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:27.130
This is definitely common way of
bringing in the Moroccan sound

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:32.550
into the prayer services
in a Moroccan synagogue

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:36.640
by the cantor literally taking
something that would be common

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.320
and well known and just
applying whatever liturgical text

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.880
at that particular moment.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.970
So, what I'd like to-- I'm going
to invite the musicians back up,--

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:08.950
-- play for you here just a moment
this "El Adon" and "Qum Tara,"

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:12.960
"El Adon" being the Hebrew;
"Qum Tara" being the Arabic.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:24.040

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.710 position:56%
[Background Music] This is a cantor.

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.510
This is a field recording
of mine as well.

[ Applause ]

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:39.940 position:56%
I'll play just a couple more bits of
this kind of idea, and let you open

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.970
that cap up there for me.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:51.400
So, here again is my cantor
friend whose name is Hiram Dehan

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.200
[assumed spelling].

00:54:53.200 --> 00:55:45.060
[ Music ]

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:49.510
Now the Arabic, with an ensemble.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:56:12.040
[ Music ]

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:19.400 position:56%
So, we're hearing it there I'm
going to play you a little bit more.

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:25.800
This is an Arabic rendition of
a piece called "Ana Maly Fiash"

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.280
which is performed by one
of the ensembles I lead

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.570 position:56%
which is ensemble performing tonight

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.330
which is the New York
Andalus ensemble and this is

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:42.510
"Ana Maly Fiash," which is a Arabic
text drawing text from the Quran.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:55.040

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.510
[Background Music] That's her.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:58:01.050
[ Music ]

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:11.510 position:56%
And now we'll hear the same melody,
slower, but used for the liturgical.

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:29.040
[ Music ]

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.590
[Background Music] And in this
case it's important to recognize

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:35.630
that the soundscape is
actually reiterated here

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:39.510
in a cappella version
in the synagogue.

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:52.160
[ Music ]

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:59.280
So, these are examples of
these-- oops, let me just move on.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.010
This is from-- I have a
few more minutes, yeah?

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:03.560
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.240
OK, OK good.

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.760
Let me-- I'm getting
to the wrap up here.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:13.040
So this is a recording, a
field recording, as well,

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.860
of a piece of music
called "Ashira Na."

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:25.130
and this is going to-- is
used to celebrate Rabbi,

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:31.130
a Rabbi in Moroccan history
named Yaakov Abuhatzeira.

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:35.480
And we'll hear this is at a home
in Brooklyn, sung a cappella

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:39.510
and then we're going to
perform a little bit of it.

00:59:39.510 --> 01:02:31.510
[ Music ]

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:41.840
[ Applause ]

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:48.260
And in sum, I would turn to the
Hebrew Table here and say that,

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.110
and I understand some
of you must exit at 1 --

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:56.340
so I'm going to just let
them leave for one second.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.890
In sum this is what I
kind of I'm coming to:

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:03.820
which is that with
this Diaspora identity

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.090
which is not uniquely only
Jewish, but it's certainly

01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:11.680
in the Jewish context is
another Jewish Diaspora,

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.860
one that is not the Jewish
Diaspora, but it's simply another.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.720
So I called this the "Layered
Diaspora Consciousness"

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:24.230
as being formulated by these
different musical expressions

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:26.520
and so I'll just read this:

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:31.880 position:56%
An additional Jewish ethnic identity
becomes truly diasporic only

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.970
when a robust consciousness
of another homeland,

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:38.350
in addition to ancient Israel,
as well as a sense of belonging

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:40.390
to another transnation in addition

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:43.530
to the transnational Jewish
community, are maintained

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.030
through cultural expressions
of the community.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:49.200
Moroccan Jews in America
rely upon musical expressions

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.720
in the synagogue life
to construct dimensions

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.830
of what I call a Layered
Diaspora Consciousness.

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.800
Connoting the complex juxtaposition

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.770
of multiple Jewish diasporic
ethnic identities informing,

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:05.180
a Layered Diaspora Consciousness is
a term used to describe how members

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.530
of the American Moroccan
Jewish community use forms

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:13.350
of musical expression to reproduce,
reinterpret, and transmit traits

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.700
from three overlapping

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.650
yet distinctive diasporic
ethnic identities: Jewish,

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:22.100
Shephardi (Spanish),
and Maroka'i, Moroccan.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:26.100
I envision this Layered Diaspora
Consciousness as an amalgamation

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.000
of different diasporic
ethnic identities

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.490
and these layers should not be
seen as hierarchical or nesting,

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:36.040
but rather they are
interacting rather than competing

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:41.070
with one another, a co-mingling
of Diaspora identities.

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:45.520
As a dynamic cultural expression,
music has a privileged role

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.700
in affecting this Layered
Diaspora Consciousness.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.610
Music is a dynamic medium
that engages with the past

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:54.650
and present simultaneously,

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:57.480
and is used to convey
communal narrative histories

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.130
and negotiate communal
boundaries and cultural influences.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:04.360
Musical expression has a
specialized role in the life

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.720
of the Moroccan American
Jewish community.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.580
It is the preferred medium for
performing liturgical rites,

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:14.210
recitation of sacred texts, and
para-liturgies used in the home

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.790
and the synagogue, as well

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:20.050
as a fundamental element
in celebratory events.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.510
And with that I say thank you.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:26.300
[ Applause ]

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:32.490
And I think I have some
time for a few questions.

01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:45.670
I do have time for a few
questions if anybody has.

01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:48.950
Or, remarks.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:50.250
Yes?

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.550
&gt;&gt;Female audience member:
I was wondering

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:54.820 position:56%
if you are applying all these things

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.680
in the Christian community,
in the Church?

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.870
Are there similar kinds or
differences in Moroccan music,

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:04.330
to the extent that the
Church was a factor?

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:05.630
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: The--

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:08.390
Are you referring to Christian
communities in Morocco?

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:09.690
&gt;&gt; Female audience
member: Yeah, yeah.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:10.990
Morocco.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.290
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: Well,

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:13.590
the Christian community
is very, very small.

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:16.020 position:56%
So, primarily isolated to some of
the Spanish provinces but, you know,

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:18.290
again, that soundscapes
idea is absolutely--

01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.610
we could use the Coptic community
in Egypt as another example

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.960
or the Christian communities
of Iraq and the idea

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.260
of incorporating those sounds.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.560
It's part of the sound
sphere for sure.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.860
Yeah. Yes Sir?

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: The Spanish
or Iberian context you mentioned:

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:31.490
did that include Portugal
as well or strictly Spanish?

01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:34.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt;Samuel Thomas: Oh I would, I would
include Portugal as well, for sure,

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:38.020
especially in terms of the
historically when we're speaking

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.430
about Andalus or Andalusia
then we are talking

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:47.290
about the whole Southern
breadth of the Iberian Peninsula.

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:48.590
Yes ma'am?

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.890
&gt;&gt; Female audience member:

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:53.660
How if that all has the
French language be integrated

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:58.370
in more traditional
religious business in Morocco?

01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:00.900
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: Well, not so much
the-- well the language, French,

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:05.090
is definitely a preferred language
within the Jewish community

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:10.170 position:56%
and I would say that the-- certainly
some songs that have been composed

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:16.080 position:56%
in French, songs by such composers
like Enrico Macias, who is Algerian,

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.070
but he is borrowing nevertheless--

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:22.250
even Salim Halali wrote
a couple songs in French

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:25.930
but they are still borrowing and
they're really putting the French

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:28.430
into a Moroccan musical context.

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:33.790 position:56%
And so then when the language is
changed to Hebrew it's really sounds

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:39.090
like a Moroccan musical song
as oppose to a French song

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:42.570
and certainly French languages
used in liturgy, so...

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:50.930
&gt;&gt; Female audience member: What
would you say is the prognosis

01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:53.640
of continuing, you know,

01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:03.370
the American Moroccan
Jewish musical tradition?

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:10.670
I mean, so I grew up
around here, I learned some

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:14.260
of the [inaudible]
Congregation, there are fewer

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:22.100
and fewer young people going and,
you know, learning Sephardic songs.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:26.970
Most Jewish schools in American
follow an Ashkenazi a tradition.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:32.310
What have you seen in
your studies of, you know,

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:36.000
longevity of this traditions?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.750
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: Well, that's a
great question and it's a question

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.310
that certainly brings
to light a challenge.

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:47.600 position:56%
You know the American Jewish context
is often associated as one of bagels

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.480
and lox and that is
not the whole story

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.290
of the American Jewish community.

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:56.170
Certainly the American
Jewish community

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:58.530
and its foundations is Sephardic.

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:04.850
And in fact, you know, George
Washington, his understanding

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:10.490
of Jewish life would not have
included bagels and lox at all.

01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:14.990
He would have certainly understood
it from the Sephardic perspective.

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:19.890
I do think that in this-- the
Moroccan Diaspora kind of idea

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:23.880
where there is such flows between
Morocco and Diaspora communities,

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:29.040
there are a lot of French
Moroccans Jews going back-and-forth

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.340
to Morocco.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.810
There are certainly some
folks recently went from here

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:36.570
and there are people going
back-and-forth and that--

01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:40.490
and the fact that there are
Moroccans-- not just Jewish--

01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:46.360
living within communities
and engaging with Jews here.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.940
I think the prognosis is that
the resources are there and the--

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.820
like I said before,
the ability to travel

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:56.960
and for communication
technologies and stuff are there.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.260
What isn't there enough yet and --

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.660
is a consciousness that
needs to be developed.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.570
I think, you know,
some of that has to do

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:05.590
with impulses towards
dissimilation when immigrating,

01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:08.040
certainly second generation ideas.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.850
And so I think that's where a
lot of the work needs to happen.

01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:14.300 position:56%
And if you do not just to say, like,
"let's learn some Sephardic songs,"

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:20.200
but more importantly to
learn what is really inherent

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.160
in Moroccan culture; that
informs Moroccan identity outside

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.400
of Morocco; and also
inherent in the relationship

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.250
between Morocco and America.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:34.720
One that I think is special
and it's formed from early on.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.020
Yes sir?

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:37.320
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: To
the extent that you know,

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.760
is there any part of
musical evolution that end

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:49.220
up in the United States from
people who were enslaved African

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:56.010 position:56%
or Black people, whatever : enslaved
[by] Barbary pirates, et cetera,

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:59.870
because in the 17th century -has
anyone read anything about that?

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:03.230
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: If you mean
from Morocco itself, you know,

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:07.550 position:56%
there is not much of a slave trade
from Morocco into the Western world,

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:10.990
you know, it's all really
happening in Sub-Saharan--

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:13.200
West Africa and southward.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.880
&gt;&gt; What I mean, I was Williamsburg

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.100
and they had a whole
tradition-they talked

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:25.430
about Moroccan Muslim slaves
ending up in Virginia so I don't--

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.360
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: Yeah, I mean
that certainly-- and not that...

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.310
to answer your question,
no I don't know

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:33.770
if any research has been
focused on that yet.

01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:35.070
Yeah.

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:36.370
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Can you
do one more question?

01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:37.670
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: One more?

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:38.970
Sir Charles?

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:40.690
&gt;&gt; Sir Charles Jahant: You have
in front of you a beautiful lady

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:49.930
in green, who can sing every song
in every tone you can imagine.

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:51.440
She happened to be my cousin.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.740
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: OK [laughs].

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:56.760
Excellent.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.220
So is there a question there?

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:04.370
Just a statement of fact, OK, so
let me take one last question.

01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:05.670
Yes sir?

01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.630
&gt;&gt; Male audience member: When
the Jewish people begin--

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:16.610
the younger Jewish people began
to arrive roughly in the 1950s--

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:22.920
what language did they
speak to each other?

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.980
And-- I guess two parts
to this question --

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.430
have they maintained that language?

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:33.900
And what has happened to the
Moroccans who moved to Israel?

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:40.330
Have they maintained the
languages that they were speaking

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:42.450
to each other in Morocco?

01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:47.560
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: And I want to
expand the notion of language

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.510
to include musical expression.

01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:53.270
Language is just, you know, one
version of cultural expression.

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:55.500
And first of all, the flows
of Moroccan immigrants

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.050
to America have continued
over decades.

01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:03.460
This particular beginning or
inception of the community

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.640
in Brooklyn was a specifically
isolated kind of event in context,

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:12.810
but in the '70s-- '60s and '70s
there are more folks coming

01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:14.110
to America.

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:17.210
Now, the community at least in
America is really includes a lot

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:21.940
of Moroccans directly from
Morocco; Moroccans from Israel;

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:26.300
and Moroccans from France, so
they're kind of intermingling.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:33.010
So in terms of languages, well, if
you ever visit a Moroccan synagogue

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:38.100
on a Saturday morning, you could
hear a French coming in this ear,

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:42.300
and Arabic maybe in this ear and
Hebrew in this ear and English

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:49.610
in this ear, you know, you
don't have enough ears to listen

01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:53.590
to all the languages
that are spinning about.

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:57.230
So, I do think in terms
of keeping language

01:13:57.230 --> 01:14:01.840
or keeping musical traditions
alive, the different kinds

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:07.270
of expressions are happening within
the community, which of course,

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:09.240
is centered around
the synagogue life

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.200
and therefore the liturgy reiterate
so much of this and the other kind

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.880
of para-liturgical traditions,
whether it'd be songs

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.140
at a wedding even or a
circumcision ceremony

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:22.090
or Haylula celebration are these
kinds of areas allow for this

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.050
to be continued and sort of
encoded over generations.

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:25.350
Yeah.

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:26.650
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Thank you.

01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:27.950
I want to thank Dr. Thomas
and the musicians for coming.

01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:29.250
[ Applause ]

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.550
&gt;&gt; Samuel Thomas: Thank you.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.850
Thank you, Nancy.

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:34.350

of the Library of Congress.
