00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.790
Vsauce! Kevin here. Kidsbeer is a soft drink
in Japan marketed toward children and designed

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.790
to look like beer. It's lager-colored, foams
like beer but tastes like cola and the slogan

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.099
states "Even kids cannot stand life unless
they have a drink"&nbsp;

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.480
If you need to drink a cigarette after that
there's liquid smoking. A Dutch relax drink

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.179
as opposed to an energy drink that claims
to give the drinker a similar feeling to having

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.579
just smoked. But it doesn't actually contain
any nicotine.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.760
India has a soft drink made with cow urine.
The Hindu Nationalist movement, concerned

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.579
with the effects of American-owned cola drinks
on their youth created the cow urine soft

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.359
drink not only to lessen foreign influence
but because they believe cow urine helps purify

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.559
those on the bottom rungs of the Hindu caste
system.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.429
Kumis is a central Asian drink traditionally
made with fermented horse milk. Unfermented

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:03.309
mare's milk isn't imbibed because it's a strong
laxative with 40% more lactose than cow's

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.200
milk and kumis is actually in its own category
of alcoholic drinks because it's not made

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.220
from fruit or grain.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.000
Mamma Mia Pizza Beer is beer made from pizza.
During the beer-making process Margarita pizza

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.780
is put into the mash and steeped like a tea
bag - then the pizza spices are washed off

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.149
with hot water and filtered into a brew pot.
And according to reviews - it really tastes

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.540
like pizza.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.090
Which would pair nicely with Water Salad - a
drink made by Coca Cola and sold in Japan

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.299
that is salad-flavored water - a beverage
that led Pepsi to respond with Ice Cucumber.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.700
Bilk combines beer with milk. The Japanese
drink was created as a way to use up surplus

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.909
milk that was previously being thrown away.
A third of the low-malt beer is milk and they

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.399
claim that it has a fruity taste.&nbsp;

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.430
Snake wine is made by infusing whole snakes
in grain alcohol or rice wine. Found in China

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.979
and southeast Asia the belief is that the
essence and venom of the snakes dissolve in

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.650
the liquor to promote vitality. Other animals
infused in alcohol for purported health benefits

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.330
that range from improved eyesight to curing
the common cold include geckos, baby mice,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.010
and sea horses.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.239
China also has Magical Penis Wine and three-penis
liquor. Which uses three different types of

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.910
animal penises to supposedly boost the virility
of its drinker.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.930
Yes.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.930
And as always - thanks for watching!
