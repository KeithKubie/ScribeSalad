00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.580
There are eleven major muscle groups of the body and I'm just going to go through them really quickly

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.960
I'm not going to talk too much about the names of the muscles,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.300
but I want you to get a sense for where they're located on the body.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.820
So:  the arm, the leg, and the core.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.160
And I'll write that over here.  So...

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.000
The eleven groups:  there are three...

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.660
actually, four in the arm, three in the leg, and four in the core.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.360
And just being familiar with where these muscles are

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.980
is actually really, really helpful and powerful,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.080
because when you go to the gym or you're working out somewhere else,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.320
it's important to stretch these muscle groups out.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.560
It's important to also focus on each one and try to figure out which one is weak or strong

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.340
and develop whichever one is imbalanced

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.720
--that's if the left and the right side are not equal in their strength.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.740
So, it's important to be aware of where they are located and we're going to go through that really quickly right now.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.820
So, let's do the arm first.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.480
You have first the forearm.  You can see that one the best from the front.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.740
And above that you have the biceps,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.440
that's about right there.  This is your biceps.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.300
And behind the biceps --actually on the other side-- is the triceps.  That's right there.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.060
And above both the biceps and the triceps is the shoulder.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.380
And actually, I'm going to draw that right there.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.300
You actually see it from the front and the back.  I'm just going to draw it right there, just for simplicity.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.640
So those are the four arm muscles and now let's just jump down to the leg

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.040
and put in the quads.  This is your quadriceps.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.700
And this is actually called the quadriceps because that's just four different muscles working together.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.040
And below the quads, or actually on the other side of the quads, rather,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.980
is your hamstring.  And right here is your hamstring.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.940
And I want to get a special kind of shout-out to the hamstring because

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.600
it does a lot of work and a lot of people forget to stretch it out;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.900
and you can often get in a lot of pain for not having a good, stretched-out hamstring.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.640
Below it is the calf.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
There's the calf...

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.700
and the calf is actually

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.100
sitting on the opposite side of the bones in the lower leg --the tibia and the fibula--

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.200
which is why it's so bony on the front part of your lower leg,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.120
but on the back it's very meaty and "muscle-y."

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.180
So you have three leg muscles there.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.120
Now lets put in the core muscles.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.240
So you have, let's do the front first.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.300
So right here is where people talk about getting a six-pack --your abs.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.580
That's an important muscle group.  It helps you do sit-ups.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.320
And above it is your chest, so right here is your chest.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.920
And...there are two in the front...

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.320
and, similarly, there are two in the back.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.900
And so the back ones --let me do in yellow--

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.060
are your trapezius.  And trapezius I think  comes down like a diamond, almost...

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.740
kind of like that.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.940
And it helps with the neck and upper back.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.440
And then, almost like you have wings in a way,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.480
you have two other muscles --or actually, another muscle with two sides on it--

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.560
called latissimus dorsi.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560
It's actually kind of a large, spread-out muscle --and I'm not drawing all of it--

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.800
but basically it kind of spreads all the way to your back

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.980
and it is

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.060
the major muscle of your back.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.360
So when people say, you know, "I threw out my back."

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.820
Often times, if it's the lower back, they're talking about their latissimus dorsi.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.500
And that means that we have now our four core muscles showing up here as well.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.720
So counting them out we've got our eleven muscle groups.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.960
And so just to, again, go over it very quickly.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.340
We've got one shoulder, biceps, forearm, and triceps.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.580
In our leg we have our quad, our hamstring, and our calf.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.500
And then in the core of our body we have our abs,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.420
our chest, our upper back --which would be the trapezius--

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.360
and the lower back --which is the latissimus dorsi--and there are eleven groups.
