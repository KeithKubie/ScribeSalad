00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:07.370
It’s easy to feel like you’re an even
mix of your parents, but that’s not always

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.370
the case.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.700
So, who should you be blaming over those traits
you don’t like?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.530
What did you inherit from Mom and what came
from Dad?

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.530
Colour-blind?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.090
If you’re a male, you can thank your mother.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.929
Red-green colour blindness is an X-linked
disorder that affects nearly 6% of the male

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.890
population worldwide, but only 0.4% of females.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.849
This is because males only inherit one X chromosome,
which is from their mother, and that’s where

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.570
red-green colorblindness comes from.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.700
If you’re a female, you have to get a the
X-variant from both parents.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.930
So that 0.4% can blame dad as well!

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.930
Balding?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.080
A big component comes from the X-chromosome
here too, so you likely inherited this from

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.080
your mom.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.370
However, a study involving 52,000 people found
that genes on other chromosomes can affect

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.810
this condition, on top of environmental factors
such as age, stress, and diet - so mom isn’t

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.320
entirely to blame!

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.250
Research has also found that the shape of
the end of your nose, the area above and below

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.520
the lips, cheekbones and the inner corner
of the eye are highly influenced by genetics.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.440
And interestingly, the more they resemble
your father as a child, the healthier you’re

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.590
likely to be.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.590
Why?

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.400
Scientists believe that a father-child resemblance
causes fathers to spend more time engaging

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300
in positive parenting, which ultimately contributes
to healthier kids.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.940
Now, even though you get half of your 46 chromosomes
from mom and the other from dad, a study involving

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.460
genetically diverse mice found that for 60%
of genes the paternal copy was more active

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.159
than the maternal copy.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.690
This phenomenon is known as allelic imbalance.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.670
The same study also noted that the brains
of these particular mice more closely resembled

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.030
that of their dad than their mom.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.360
However, in humans we actually see the opposite.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.800
Our brains are more similar to our mother,
which is particularly true for daughters.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.060
Interestingly, the similar brain regions are
actually associated with depressive conditions,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.780
suggesting that mood disorders may pass from
mother to daughter.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.570
Biologists used to believe that all DNA came
from the nucleus, but we now know that the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.670
mitochondria (AKA the powerhouse of the cell)
also kicks in some protein coding genes.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.480
And this mitochondrial DNA is specifically
inherited from your mom because your dad’s

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.150
degraded immediately after fertilization.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.029
Considering how important mitochondrial DNA
is in the cell, there is a stronger maternal

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.029
link.

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.329
Mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been associated
with Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.310
- which more likely came from your mom.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.540
Maternal inheritance gave rise to the idea
of a “Mitochondrial Eve”, a woman who

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.930
lived between 180,000 to 580,000 years ago
from which all human mitochondrial DNA is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.930
rooted.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.359
At the end of the day, it may seem like a
lot of traits actually come from your mom,

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.239
or at least, from the X chromosome - and that’s
generally true, genetically.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.269
The Y-chromosome is very small, and doesn’t
contain as many genes; and both females and

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.640
males contain X-chromosomes, which carry more
genes.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.659
But as we continue to research more about
ourselves at the genetic level, the division

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.150
between what you got from mom vs. dad may
become even more pronounced.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.590
this episode.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.790
Whether you want to know about your chances
of balding, back hair, your taste sense or

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.180
where your ancestors came from, 23andMe’s
kit will get you started.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.370
We both took it, and I found out the GREAT
news that I’m more prone to having a little

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.340
upper back hair, which until recently I thought
was FALSE, but as I’ve aged Greg told me

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.189
is actually TRUE!!

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.920
What I thought was cool is that you can find
out how certain factors affect your weight.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.939
Like for me fast food is likely to have the
biggest impact on my weight followed by exercise.
