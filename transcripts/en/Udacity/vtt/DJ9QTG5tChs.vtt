00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.330
Try solving this quadratic equation for the values of r that make it true.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.669
Remember, you'll need to set this equation equal to 0 before you can use this

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.196
quadratic formula. Notice too, that instead of having the variable x, we have

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:16.088
the variable r. That's okay though, because it isn't the variable that makes

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:20.630
something quadratic. It's the square on the variable. So try rearranging this

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.670
equation, and then, write your final solutions here. Good luck.
