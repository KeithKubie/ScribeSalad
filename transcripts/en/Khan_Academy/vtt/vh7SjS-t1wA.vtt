00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.170
- [Instructor] In the previous
video, we began our study

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.880
of ABC Watch Factory and
we tried to understand

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.850
the economics of the
business based on some data

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.290
that we had already collected on our costs

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.870
and how much output we could produce

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.930
based on how many labor units we had.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.930
And then from that, we calculated things,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.590
like the marginal product of labor,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.030
the marginal cost, the
average variable cost,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.870
the average fixed cost,
and the average total cost.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.470
What we're going to do in this video

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.760
is take this information,
especially total output

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.570
and all of these things
that we just calculated,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.160
so that we can better appreciate

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.880
how these various calculations

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
and the curves that we can
get from the calculations

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.640
are interrelated, so let me scroll over

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.110
a little bit so we have some space

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.310
and then let me set up a
little coordinate plane here.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.040
And so what we have on our vertical axis,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.140
this is our cost, and then down here,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.063
in our horizontal axis this is our output.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.460
So, first let's just hand graph it,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.300
and I encourage you to go
through the exercise yourself.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.990
It's one thing to watch me do it,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.940
but when you actually graph something

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.080
you digest the numbers that much better.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.450
And so, let's start with marginal cost.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.350
And I'm going to do it
in this blue-green color.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.010
So let's see, when our total output is 25,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.810
our marginal cost is 267.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.810
So, when our out put is 25,
267 would be right about there.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.130
And we're just trying to get,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.260
be able to visualize what's going on.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.970
And then, when our total output is 45,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.970
our marginal cost is $150.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.930
So 45 is here and then 150

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.723
is right about there.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.520
And then when our total output is 58,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.700
our marginal cost is 231.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.890
So 58 is right about there,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.263
and then it's gonna be 231,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.260
so it's about, right about there.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.610
And then, when our total output is 65,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.010
our marginal cost is 429,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.170
so the 65 is right over there

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.800
and then 429 will get us right about,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.290
right about there, so you see

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.240
our marginal cost is going up a lot now,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.690
it might be a little bit lower than that,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.310
so it's gonna be right over there.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.020
And then last but not least,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.710
when our total output is 70,
our marginal cost is $600.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.180
So at 70 we get to 600
and I'm eyeballing it,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.410
that's not exact graph paper,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.760
but this gives you a sense

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.390
of what the marginal
cost curve looks like.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.860
And here we've kinda graphed it based on

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.130
where we are in terms of output.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.900
So, that's our marginal,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.380
marginal cost curve.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.220
So I'll just label that marginal cost.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.360
And now let's see how
that relates to the curves

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.530
for average variable cost
and average total cost.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.820
So average variable cost
I'll do in this orange color.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.340
So, at an output of 25,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.550
our average variable cost is $240.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.080
So 25, we are going to be

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.603
at $240,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.483
which is right about, right about there.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200
And then when we are at 45 units,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.700
our average variable cost is 200.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.330
So at 45, units our average variable cost

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.320
is right over there.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.890
And then at, we did that one.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.560
And then at 58 units, it's $207.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.450
58 units, it is 207,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.010
so it's going to be right about there.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.630
And then at, we did this one.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.175
And at 65 units, it's 231.

00:03:56.175 --> 00:04:00.570
65 is, and then we get to 231

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.240
which is right maybe about there.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.380
And then, this we did this one,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.700
and then at 70 units, we're at 257.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.290
So 70 units, 257 looks
something like this.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.168
Now, before I actually
draw into this scurve,

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.470
connect the dots, so let's just think

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.020
about how the average variable cost

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.150
relates to the marginal cost.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.520
When the marginal cost is less than

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.710
the average variable cost,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.410
well that means that as
we produce more and more,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.770
our average variable cost should go down,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.460
and we see that happening
in this early stage.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.040
I won't go into all the details

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.360
on what's happening
exactly right over there,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.830
but that early stage, as we see that

00:04:44.057 --> 00:04:46.290
while our marginal cost is less

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.470
than our average variable cost,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.010
our average variable
cost is trending down.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.843
And that makes sense.

00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:55.330
Every incremental unit
is a little big cheaper

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.600
to produce, so it brings down the average.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.250
But as soon as the marginal curve

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.263
crosses the average variable cost

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:05.270
and the marginal cost,
every incremental unit

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.690
is now more than the average,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.270
well that should bring up the average.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.220
And so then the average variable cost

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.080
should start sloping up.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.790
So, it's good to realize,
one is a rule of thumb

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.770
but even more important to realize why,

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.930
that where the marginal cost curve

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.540
and the average variable
cost curve intersect,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.850
that that's going to be the point

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.270
at which the average variable cost

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.010
goes from trending down to trending up.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.190
If you viewed as this very wide U shape,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.570
that would be the bottom of the U.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.350
And we can do the same thing thing

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.890
with average total costs.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.320
Now, they're going to
cross a little bit later

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.470
because the average total costs are higher

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.210
because they're factoring
in the fixed costs as well,

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.370
but you can imagine that
while your marginal costs

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.560
are lower than your average total costs,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.690
every incremental unit
is going to bring down

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.640
the average total cost, but as soon as

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.220
the marginal cost crosses
the average total cost,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.210
it's gonna start bringing up the average.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.870
And we can see that by trying to graph

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.690
average total cost, and I'll
do that in this yellow color.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.730
So, at 25 units, we're at 440.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.830
25 units, we're at 440 that makes sense

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.823
'cause we have all that fixed cost

00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:18.330
that we're spreading along
amongst not that many units.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.090
And then at 45 units, we're at 311.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.090
45 and we get to 311, might
be right around there.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.330
Then at 58 units, we're at 293.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.467
58 units, we are at 293,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.640
which is right about there.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.250
And then at 65 units, we're at 308.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.643
65 units, we are at 308.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.570
And then at 70 units, we're at 329.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.370
70 units, we are at 329,

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.770
so it maybe something like this.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.190
And so this is our average total cost.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.780
And just as you can imagine,
while your marginal costs,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.740
every incremental unit, the cost of that,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.560
is less than your average total cost,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.480
it'll bring down, when you
do that incremental output,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.830
it will bring down your
average total costs

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.520
until the point that they cross

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.080
and then, now, after you,
after these two curves cross,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.430
now every incremental unit is bringing up

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.170
the average cost, 'cause it's
costing more than the average.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.920
And so, once again, where
these two curves intersect,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.580
if you view the average total cost curve

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.960
where there's this big wide U,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.460
it would represent the bottom of the U.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.310
Now, the last thing that we didn't graph,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.240
and this is maybe the most intuitive,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.220
is the average fixed cost.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.100
And this is just going to asymptote down.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.460
At 25 units, we're at 200.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.610
25 units, we are at 200.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.963
At 45 units, we are at 111.

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:51.987
45, 111, it's maybe right over there.

00:07:55.414 --> 00:07:57.735
At 58 units we're at 86.

00:07:57.735 --> 00:07:58.818
58 units, 86.

00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:02.586
At 65 units, we're at 77.

00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:04.726
65 units, 77.

00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:09.730
And then at 70 units, we're at 71.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:10.990
And so you can see that that

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.620
just gets lower and lower and lower

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.980
over, as you produce more and more output

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.950
because you're able to
spread those fixed costs

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.610
amongst more and more output,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.870
so that makes sense that
the average fixed costs

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.270
just trends downward like
this the entire time.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.370
But the big take-aways here is

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.360
not just to understand the rule of thumb

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.030
that where the marginal cost curve

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.690
intersects the average variable cost

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.080
or the average total cost,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.510
that that's the, you could
view it as the minimum point

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.720
of the average total cost

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.340
or the average variable cost curves,

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.933
but to understand why that is happening.
