00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.439
Hey it's me Destin and welcome 
back to smarter every day!

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.440
I have a problem, there is a specific water phenomenon

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.740
that I see happening all around me

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.680
but I have no idea how it works

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.710
I've been trying to figure it out for

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.599
years, in fact i put a video on this

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.389
channel in 2011, asking people to help me

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.470
figure it out!

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.940
there's something interesting happening

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.890
here I don't understand it it looks like

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.990
water droplets are standing on water

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.650
droplets. It looks like water is

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.720
hydrophobic it looks like when a bead of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.090
water skates across the hot griddle it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.010
creates a layer of water vapor underneath it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.540
only that's not what it is

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.840
If you have any information please let me know

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.590
I'd appreciate it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.570
you've seen this right? If you watch the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.280
world with a critical eye like I do

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.649
you'll see this everywhere for example

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.180
if you've ever allowed yourself to watch

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.129
a drip coffeemaker when the conditions

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.870
are just right you'll notice that coffee

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.539
beads up on top of coffee

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.520
what does it do that sometimes when you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.989
turn the shower head on the water will

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.550
blast to the other side of the tub

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.930
instead of making the bottom of the tub

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.629
wet these pearls of water will dance on

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.010
top of the water that's already in the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.960
bottom of the tub. Don't let this weird you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.220
out it's just water and food coloring

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.990
but the interesting thing is if you get

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.820
the stream in just the right location

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.320
and interacts with a porcelain and the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.850
water that's in the toilet and just the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.979
right fashion you'll get these little drops

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.020
that bead up. I don't understand what the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.610
conditions required to make it happen

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.500
are, but I get really excited about it and I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560
want to understand.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.140
Seriously one time we landed an Apache helicopter on the pad

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.159
at work, and the environmental control system

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.540
was leaking condensate down onto the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.640
asphalt, and the beads were happening there

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.890
that was the moment I realized i have to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.720
know why this is happening. In order to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.100
figure it out we're going to Science Garage

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.079
to see my friend Don Pettit who

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.210
has out-of-this-world experience in the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.100
area of surface chemistry

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.840
let's go get Smarter Every Day.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.980
its water dancing on water, but we're gonna do it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.909
here on earth, and then in space, that OK?

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.880
Yeah, and we're going to water down this one!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940
Yeah, and we're going to water down this one!
[laughs] that's bad.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.100
if you know who Don Pettit is you understand why I came to him

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.540
it's rare to find a person that not only

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.640
understands how to capture beautiful photos

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.220
but also understands the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.630
fundamental science behind each image

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.070
seriously who else do you know that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.290
collects books on surface chemistry and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.090
wedding phenomena you own these

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.170
references?

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630
Yeah.
Really?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.860
Well I mean when you're into this kind of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.300
stuff you need it, right?

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.950
Anyways scientists all over the world

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.990
have created elaborate setups in their

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.790
labs to try to observe these dancing

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.230
drops and they've got some really great

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.630
data but I knew if I got the right type

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.030
of camera in Don's hands

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.400
and just turned him loose

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.250
we would not only get the data but

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.810
we would do it beautifully

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.940
it's a Phantom v2511 which is a very very

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.720
fast camera and its really loud but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.030
we're gonna turn on the science here

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.010
and give it a go

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.600
after only about an hour of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.980
working through the lenses and lighting

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.540
with Don, he quickly came up with a setup

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.090
to observe a beautiful single drop of

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.060
water landing on, bouncing, and then

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.500
coalescing into a larger pool of water

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.840
alright so we have a drop balancing on a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.550
still surface of water and you'll notice

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.290
that it isn't coalescing.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.620
Coalescence is when you have two pieces of water that

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.000
touch and then merge to become one piece.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.220
Now you notice there's this delay time

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.750
where the drop is sitting there before

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.060
coalescence that's called the 'Residence Time'

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.350
tand scientists have a pretty good

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.360
understanding of what's going on here.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.160
As a drop touches the surface scientists

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.800
believe there's air trapped in-between

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.440
as the drop rests that air starts to

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.860
seep out of that gap and then

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.260
coalescence occurs.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.180
The National Institute of Health did this really cool

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.080
study where they verified the air gap theory

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.740
by reducing the air pressure

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.890
around coalescing water drops and as

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.690
you'd expect the lower the air pressure

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.489
to lower the residence time which is

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.660
really cool

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.190
anyway you can plainly see on the video

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.140
that Don captured that as the drop comes

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.209
to a rest it starts to slowly bob up and

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.040
down and then it's like a little water bridge

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.840
is built in that air gap and then

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.940
coalescence occurs so this is my

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.620
question in the phenomenon I'm seeing

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.989
I'm seeing a steady state bouncing of a

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.579
drop which means there's impacts

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.440
happening over and over

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.209
why is that not punching through that

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.799
air gap and causing coalescence to

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.140
happen easier? In order to understand this

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.640
we actually have to look at that impact

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.960
which means this is about to get awesome

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.370
this is a device that's been shipped to me

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.130
from another youtube channel

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.480
Ben at NightHawkInLight and he has

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.210
drops of water that he puts on water

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.880
which is sitting in a speaker so we're

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.490
about to basically recreate the setup

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.800
that Ben did. So full disclosure you've

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.010
done this in space right?
I have!

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.600
But we're going to use this high-speed

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.780
camera to understand the phenomenon here

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.820
on earth and then you're going to teach

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.470
me about what you discovered in space

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.390
right?
Yeah we're gonna, we're gonna start

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.090
on earth and end up in space

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.460
[phone ringing]

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.840
Hello?
Hey Ben it's Destin, how are you 
Yeah and this is Don

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.230
we're in science garage here having fun

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.010
Awesome, Don it's cool to hear from you

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.500
what frequency and amplitude

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.760
worked out best for you?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.410
worked out best for you.
[Beep]

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.510
if we were to turn that speaker off right now they

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.270
would go away right?
Well let's see.
Okay

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.880
See? They're there but they coalesce very quickly

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.760
So, okay keep doing that don't

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.650
change anything we'll change one variable

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.460
OK.
That's me turning on the vibration of

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.880
the speaker. So what I think is

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.490
happening is; the water is trying to

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.710
settle and go down and press against the surface

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.310
Uh-huh that's right.
But because it's

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.110
being pushed back up due to that

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.470
vibration it, it adds energy back into

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.830
the system and then pushes it away

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.740
And I'm saying that that process keeps the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.020
small air gap between the drop, it helps maintain that

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.800
You can sit here and postulate things
till you're blue in the face,

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.080
until you make an observation to see

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.800
what that fundamental physics is, then

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.600
you can back out what's going on and

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.910
high-speed of what's going on with that

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.150
drop it would do a lot to help answer these questions

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.620
this is quickly becoming

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.710
one of the most awesome setups I've ever

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.120
been a part of, would y'agree?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.070
Yeah this is just totally awesome.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.450
But you've been to space!

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.580
Allright, here we are

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.600
the moment of truth after years of waiting

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.430
we finally have everything we

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.770
need in order to make

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.870
an actual observation. Here we go.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.920
and there it is

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.819
did you see it? When i first saw this

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.860
footage it stood out to me like a sore

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.530
thumb instead of crashing into the drop

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.120
like I anticipated it's almost like

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.340
those peaks and valleys make some type

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.199
of moving catcher's mitt that gently

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.150
catches the drop and lets it down gently

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.069
without breaking that air layer

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.780
now i want to zoom in and see if we can

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.020
see that wave catch the drop

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.669
there it is it's pretty clear what's

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.560
going on here think about it this way if

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.330
somebody threw you a water balloon would

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.039
you rush your hand up and try to meet it

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.780
really quickly and risk bursting that

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.060
surface tension? No, you would try to

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.979
match the velocity of the balloon with

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:11.539
your hands so you could decrease the

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.240
collisional kinetic energy in fact

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.099
there's an equation for how to calculate

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:17.870
collisional kinetic energy and that's

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.430
what factors into whether or not the

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.620
drop survives if the velocity of the

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.569
liquid and the small drop are about the

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:26.120
same then that factor goes to 0 and the

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.710
collisional kinetic energy quickly

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.440
decreases to zero now that we understand

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.479
this we can infer that timing is a huge

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.069
factor here and there's probably a bunch

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:35.659
of drops that just don't survive because

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:37.219
they hit the wave wrong

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.770
in fact that's exactly what we see in

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.719
the high-speed. One more thing to think

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:42.800
about is the fact that gravity is

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.779
constantly pulling the drops back down

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:47.150
to that vibrating surface which means it

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.190
always has to find the soft spot to land

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.320
the larger the drop, the greater the

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.570
gravitational force pushing down on it.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.130
But what if you did this somewhere where

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.500
there was no weight on the drop?

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.980
Oh, then it bounces off

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.520
I've got the video.
Can we see it?

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520
Yeah!

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.080
I discovered this phenomenon for myself

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.490
occurring naturally in the woods of

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.640
alabama in 2011, the same year that

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.540
Don Pettit launched to the international

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.270
space station where he accidentally

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.340
recreated the phenomenon in a really

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.350
remarkable way. He performed a very

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.360
similar water speaker experiment, except

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.830
in weightlessness the water forms a

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.870
sphere. Just to make it interesting Don

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.760
put an air bubble on the inside of that

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.890
water sphere and then he played tones

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.570
through the speaker just to see what

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.950
would happen

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.250
[Don]... and the air bubble is attached
to the speaker cone, and so is

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.830
the water and i'm at 60 Hertz i'm going

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.320
to start increasing the amplitude, here we go

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.320
Wow. So we're getting a series of

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.710
standing nodes on the interface of the

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.390
air bubble with the water. I'm going to

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.770
put a square wave in

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.720
OK... triangle wave

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.480
So Don played with different frequencies, amplitudes,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.100
he played different types of music like rock

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.100
and roll, and then he played the cello

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.480
Don said whenever he played cello music specifically,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.900
little drops would break off

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.920
on the inside of the sphere

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.940
and start bouncing around on the inside.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.110
A Cello!?

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.500
There's something about the Cello!

[Music: Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 - Prelude]

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.990
This video sets my brain. on. fire.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.370
We've learned two main mechanisms for

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.690
coalescence we have the weight of the

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.310
drop that squishes that air boundary and

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.210
makes it go

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.650
we have no weight, so we're left with

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.450
collisional kinetic energy every

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.710
collision that results in the

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.570
coalescence, everything is right there

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.390
and you can just directly see what's happening

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.250
the sidewall that's vibrating? It makes

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.930
the small drops go faster than the big

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.640
drops, because there's lower mass but

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.680
it's the same amount of excitation energy

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.140
i really liked this video

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.940
it's beautiful on multiple levels and I
