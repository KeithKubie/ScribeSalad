00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.680
Once we're registered for Piazza we'll
typically access from the Piazza link

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.950
on the left side of T-square.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.360
We also highly recommend
bookmarking it separately so

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.050
you can go straight to Piazza
without bothering with T-square.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.250
Here, we find the Piazza
home screen on the left

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.490
is a list of topics in the class.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.820
Right now, the Class at
a Glance is on the right, but

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.910
as soon as we click on a topic,
the topic will appear on the right.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.370
Across the gray bar, near the top,
is a list of folders.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.479
We'll talk about those in a bit.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.470
Across the blue bar, at the very top,
are three tabs, Q &amp; A,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.085
Resources, and Statistics.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.650
Q&amp;A is where you'll
spend most of your time.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.790
It's where you access the forum.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.070
Resources may list some
course information,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.440
but in practice,
hardly any OMS classes use it.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.170
Statistics will show you some
student statistics on the course,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.010
as well as your own stats.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.120
In the top left,
you'll find a drop down box.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.840
You can use this to look
at a different course.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.880
Finally, the gear in the top right
will let you modify your profile and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.410
change your settings.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.590
Let's start with your profile.
