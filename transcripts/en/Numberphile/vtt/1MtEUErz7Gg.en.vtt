00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.380
Okay, so today I want to show you a fractal zero.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.020
Okay, so you may ask, you know, what is a zero?

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:15.060
Well, zero is something that solves this equation, a plus x equals a.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.540
But then you say, well, what is a? If we are talking about, say, the counting numbers,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.980
you know, so we say 1, 2, 3, and so on. If I am only allowed to use the counting numbers,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.680
then I, you know, x cannot be, there is no counting number that will solve this equation.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.620
So in the couning, the counting numbers do not have a zero.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:48.600
Well, the, the natural numbers do, right? So we put zero, and then we call these the natural numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.020
They do have a zero it's x equals zero. But this zero,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:02.740
okay, so in the natural numbers, if you were going to solve a different equation, for example, a plus x equals 0,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.880
in the natural numbers,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.629
then this only has one solution if a is zero, if a is not zero, then this has no solutions, right?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.810
So then how do you solve this? Well, you solve this by then,

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.349
you know, adding even more numbers, and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:28.340
then talk about what we call the integers. Dot dot dot, minus 3, minus 2, minus 1, 0, 1, 2,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.720
and so on. In this set, these two equations, you know, have solutions.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.460
So there is a zero, and, and you can always solve a plus x equals zero.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.860
Today, I will show you a different type of numbers, okay, that have this very special zero that looks like a fractal.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.180
Okay, and these new numbers that I will talk about, they are called sandpiles.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.080
So what is a sandpile?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.120
So this is a, you know, it's going to be a three by three grid, okay?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.180
And on this three by three grid I am going to put numbers that are

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.860
either 0, 1, 2 or 3.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.100
So in every one of these nine cells. I'm going to put either

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.480
a zero, a one, a two or a three, and that's going to be my sandpile. So these numbers represent

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.320
numbers of grains of sand that you put on one cell in this grid.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.460
And so these are my numbers, and then I need to tell you about, well,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.680
what's the addition. How am I going to add them? So, for example,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.200
120,

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.549
211, 013. Let's add. Let's say 213

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.280
101, 010

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.780
Ok, so I have it here two sandpiles.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.769
How do I add them? Well, I add them by adding every number in each cell.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.739
So here we have 1 plus 2, that's going to be 3, 2 plus 1 that's also 3,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.079
0 plus 3 is 3, 2 plus 1 is 3, 1 plus 0 is 1,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.520
1 plus 1 is 2, 0 plus 0 is 0, 1 plus 1 is 2, 3 plus 0 is 3.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.640
Okay? So that's, these are my new numbers, and how to add them. Now, I can run into trouble,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.300
yes, for example, if I change one of these numbers, for example,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.340
this 1 for a 2.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.800
Then I'm going to have 2 plus 2 which is 4 and I am not allowing 4. So how do I fix that problem?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.039
Okay, and so this is why these are called sandpiles.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.579
So there is some dynamic thing that happens in here.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.560
And so when I when an entry reaches 4, it is unstable, and it's going to topple and send

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.460
the grains of sand to their neighbors, okay?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.220
Brady: "Like a house of cards falling over."

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.660
Like a house of cards, that's right.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.859
So in here, because this 4 is in a corner, then it has two neighboring cells, okay?

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.949
And then two other, you know, imagine that this is sitting on top of a table,

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.660
and then, so it's going to send one grain of sand to

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.180
this 3, and then one grain of sand to this other 3. Okay, everything else remains the same.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.220
And then it's going to lose one grain of sand to this edge, and one grain of sand to this edge,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.720
and now it's going to have 0. Now this process created two new 4s,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.260
so then I have to repeat it again, because remember my rules is that the entries have to be between 0 and 3.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.950
And you do this process until you have no more 4s. And here as you see, we created one, yet one more 4,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.620
so we need to repeat this process, and that's the addition of the two sandpiles that we have at the beginning, okay?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.490
So then the question is, do we have a zero in this, in this set of sandpiles?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.539
And, well, it turns out that it's, you know, from the definition of, of this addition, the zero is,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.290
unsurprisingly,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:12.580
000, 000, 000. If I add anything to this,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.260
I am not going to do anything.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.800
Well, that was sort like a boring zero, and it is boring because if I want to solve an equation like

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.280
a plus x equals 0

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.220
where this is one, you know, every single thing is a sandpile, then this equation has no solutions.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.540
So if I put two sandpiles together, you know, if I have a sandpile a, and a sandpile x, and I put them together,

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.190
I will never be able to

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.699
topple everything until I get a zero. There is no

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.990
minus a sandpile. It doesn't exist.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.449
And, the reason, okay, so if we, if we put numbers into our sandpile,

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.100
so we say, a1, a2, a3 ... a8, a9,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.480
so we put nine numbers, you know,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.979
and this is like the result of some addition,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.170
then there will there will be topplings, okay, there will be topplings. But at the end of the day,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.250
You lose sand only if you are on the edge of this grid.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:22.569
But, however, every single time you are on an edge, sand gets sent to another neighboring cell.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.060
So, you will never be able to get rid of the entire sand, so there is no minus a sandpile.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.600
So, how do we fix that? In the natural numbers, okay, we fix that by making them bigger,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.409
into the integers. So we threw, essentially,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.010
all the negative numbers.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.509
And here we're going to do something different.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.069
We are actually going to shrink our set. So what is the set that we are considering?

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.200
We are considering every single sandpile

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.720
with this, so, our, the set that we're considering, let me call it M, and this set M is the set of all sandpiles.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.180
All sandpiles on the three by three grid.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.930
Yes, where a sandpile is

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.990
just a collection of nine numbers where every number is between 0, 1, 2 or 3, and in fact,

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.969
how many such sandpiles are there? We have nine cells,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.909
This cell can be a 0, a 1, a 2, or a 3, so it has four possibilities.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.380
This cell has also four possibilities. This cell has four possibilities as well.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.540
So a basic counting says that we have four to the nine

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:40.040
total sandpiles. And this number happens to be 262,144.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.980
So this is the set of all sandpiles. But now we're going to shrink it.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.260
Okay, so we are not going to consider all the sandpiles.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:55.210
We are just going to consider a smaller collection of them, and that smaller collection is the collection of sandpiles

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.279
that I can obtain by starting with the all 3s

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.360
Yes, the all 3s is the sandpile that has the most sand.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.140
Okay, and then I'm going to add whatever I want to add to it,

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.460
and when I'm done, you know, the resulting

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.100
sandpile is going to be in my new collection, okay?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.419
So the new collection, the smaller collections, is

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:26.289
all the sandpiles that I can obtain from the all 3s by adding extra sand, and then toppling.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:33.609
So, for example, if I add just one grain of sand in the center cell, then,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.980
well, I have everywhere 3s,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.360
except a 4 in here.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.440
Brady: "Oh, you're going to start some big toppling now."

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.580
Yes. Yes, so I start toppling.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:57.800
And so this 4 is going to send one grain of sand to each of its four neighbors. So 343, 404, 343.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.000
I have now four unstable vertices. I can topple them all simultaneously.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.520
So each of them is going to lose four grains of sand, so now they are going to be zeroes.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.990
They are going to send, each is going to send one grain of sand to the center.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.900
So now the center has four grains of sand again.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.820
And the corners will receive one grain of sand from one side and one grain of sand from the other,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.940
so now the corners have five.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.540
Okay. And we need to repeat this process.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:39.330
This 4 is going to send one grain of sand to each of its neighbors. Now it has zero. The corners are still 5.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.869
We topple the corners and we get,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.580
you know, they are going to lose four grains of sand, so each corner will have 1 at the end,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:59.020
and then this number is going to get one grain of sand from here, one grain of sand from these other 5s, so now they are going to be 3s.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.460
Brady: "So that is part of my new set."

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.780
This is part of my new set. Correct. Yes. So this new set, okay,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.500
has many many sandpiles, you know. The original set had 262,144.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.040
Our new set, so this set that I'm going to call S, which is the sandpiles

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.710
arising from the all 3s, it's much smaller. It's about a half,

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.879
it's half as big. It has more or less a hundred thousand.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.729
Now, one, we have one big problem here. And the big problem

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:43.470
is that the 000, 000, 000 is not in S.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.850
Because, you know, we start from max, we add sand to it,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:53.040
we are never going to get rid of all the sand. So this zero is not in our sub collection

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.890
So we lost our zero. We wanted to

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.829
find sort of the minus sandpile, and now we have even a bigger problem,

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:03.160
which is, we don't have a zero.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.160
However, let me show you just a couple. These computations, as you can see, they take a little bit of time.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.060
So let me show you just

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.520
a couple more computations, okay? So it turns out, okay, that

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.980
the all 2s is in S

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.360
Brady: "It is. You can get all 2s."

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.620
You can get the all 2s. So this all 2s is the all 3s

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:37.840
plus 131, 333, 131.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:48.380
And, also, let me show you another one that, another element that is in S. So this element 212,

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:56.280
101, 212 is also in S. So now I'm going to add these two new

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:06.280
sandpiles that are in S, okay? So I'm going to add the 222, 222, 222.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:14.640
So the all 2s plus this new element that we got, 212, 101, 212.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:26.100
If I add them, then I get 434, 323, 434.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.620
Yes, and I have 4s in the corners, so I'm going to topple them,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.340
And, so each of the 4s is going to lose four grains of sand, so now I'm going to have zeros in the corners,

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:46.480
and then this 3 is going to receive one grain of sand from this 4, another grain of sand from this other 4, so now they're

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.000
going to be 5s.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.520
5s, and I still have a 2 in the center.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.020
Okay, so now all the 5s

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:02.760
topple, and they are going to lose four grains of sand, so all the 5s are going to be now 1s.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:10.520
Okay, they are going to send, each 5 is going to send one grain of sand to the center. So now the center

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.400
cell has 2 plus 4

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.239
meaning 6 grains of sand, and then each of the corners is going to get

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.989
one grain of sand from each side, so now they are going to have 2s.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:29.010
And this 6 will topple. It's going to lose four grains of sand,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.359
and we get the all 2s back.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:40.290
This is something that is a little bit surprising, okay? So we have to sandpiles.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.869
We have the all 2s, and then we have this other sandpile,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.620
we put it on top of each other, and we get the all 2s back.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:53.070
So it's acting like a zero. And in fact, if we were to do this computation again on the all 3s,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.640
or on any other sandpile in S,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.660
we will get the same sandpile. So, the zero in our new set S,

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:08.489
our zero is this 212, 101, 212.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.820
Brady: "So that will have that effect on any other sandpile within S."

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.980
Correct. Correct.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.650
Brady: "It's like a magic sandpile!"

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:23.189
It's like a magic sandpile. And in fact, it can be used to separate these two sets, like the things that are in S,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.890
and the things that are not. If you add a sandpile that it doesn't come from the all 3s,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.980
okay, then you're not going to get the same sandpile after you add-

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.980
Brady: "It's like a test you can apply."

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.580
It's a test, yes, it's a test.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.580
Brady: "What happens if you add it to itself?"

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.300
Oh, that's a good question. So, what do you think that should happen?

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.460
Brady: "I think it should ... result in itself."

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.260
We can check that, yes?

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.000
So, to each cell, we could have just multiply every entry by two, but, okay,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.660
so let's do it, so 424, 202, 424.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.380
Again we have 4s in the corners,

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.249
they are going to topple, 0 in the center, and when the 4s topple,

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.519
you know, they are going to be going to 0,

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:18.450
they lose four grains of sand. The corners are going to receive two grains of sand each, and the center is going to

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.210
get one grain of sand from each of the 4s.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:29.720
I need to topple the center, and I get exactly 212, 101, 212.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:35.900
Yes, that's, you know, the addition of this element plus itself is equal to

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.660
212, 101, 212.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.340
Brady: "What do we call that special pile? I called it a magic pile, but what's its proper name?"

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.320
Well, we call it the identity sandpile.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.160
But, you know, it's also the zero of this set. So we indeed call it a zero.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:56.850
Let me show you yet one more beautiful property of this zero. Remember, at the beginning we had these equations,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.300
a plus x equals 0.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.900
Now our zero is this 212, 101, 212.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.600
It turns out that in S we can always solve these equations.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.480
So there is always a minus sandpile on S. We can always solve this equation.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:22.159
So this set S has, you know, it behaves sort of like the integers. They, it has a zero, but it also has

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:31.220
you know, these additive inverses, this minus sandpile. You know, if we start from the all 3s, right? So, what could I add

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.759
here to the all 3s to get to this

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.570
zero sandpile? So, is there such a thing as

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.520
minus a sandpile? Something that I add to the 3s to get to zero? Well, let's see. So if I add

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:53.620
333, 313, 333, I get the zero sandpile.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.020
Brady: "So in this very specific set we created, this is a negative sandpile."

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.340
That's right. This is minus the all 3s.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.680
This is what I add to the all 3s to get to the zero.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.460
Brady: "But, Luis, if I had something else there,"

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.160
So for example, like the all 2s,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.408
Brady: "yes, that wouldn't have a negative effect."

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:18.100
Correct. Correct. This minus sandpile is unique.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:26.780
For the all 2s, I have 232, 323, 232.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.540
This is also the zero sandpile.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:37.970
And, actually this works for any sandpile that comes from max, from the all 3s. I can always find

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:45.139
a minus sandpile. So this zero, it's, you know, it's it's very special. I told you about,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.930
you know, that at the beginning, I was going to talk about fractal zeroes. This doesn't look like a fractal.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.549
I mean, it's very pretty, but it doesn't look like a fractal. So let me now tell you about

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.060
fractals, okay? We can play the same game

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:06.560
that we have played on a three by three grid. We can play it on any grid. For example, on the two by two grid.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.530
And if we play it on a two by two grid, the identity

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:15.180
there is also an identity, and the identity is very simple. It's the all 2s.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.700
Brady: "Is that the identity for what set though, for the max set?"

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:26.340
Yes. We have a two by two grid, and we look at the sandpiles on the two by two grid that come from max.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.540
Max in this case is 33, 33.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:36.860
So this is the zero sandpile on a two by two grid. On a three by three grid, well,

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:44.840
it's, you know, the one we have computed, 212, 101, 212.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.280
Okay, we could do this on a three by three grid, on a four by four, or even on

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.880
rectangular grids, like, you know, five by ten, or something like this.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.340
So let me show you a few more zeros, okay?

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.180
So this is the three by three, what about a four by four? How does it look like?

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.220
2332, 3223,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.160
3223, 2332.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:21.040
They, we always have to have some symmetry, because, you know, we are, you know, the grid itself, you know,

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:25.519
it's very symmetric. So we can continue doing this. We can, let me show you, maybe

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.560
one more, or a few more? Let me show you the five by five.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:39.540
Okay. So, the five by five is a 23232, 32123,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:50.020
21012, 32123, 23232.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.520
So, they have some structure, okay?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:58.740
As you saw, they are symmetric, and we can, there is actually an algorithm to compute every single one of these.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.060
zeroes for any rectangular grid.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.940
So, but, this algorithm is,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:12.340
you know, not an algorithm, you know, for small cases it produces them very fast, but in very large grids,

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.740
it will take, you know, maybe a lifetime to compute this.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.870
But we can compute, let's say, for example, a 400 by 400, okay?

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:27.559
So, let me show you the picture. So this is the zero sandpile on a

00:20:28.169 --> 00:20:32.449
400 by 400 grid. And it's full of colors.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:40.250
So let me explain to you the colors. The black means zero grains of sand, the yellow means one grain of sand,

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.739
blue means two, and red means three. And as you can see in this picture, there is,

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:52.280
yes, a lot of symmetry, but then there is also this fractal structure that they have.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:59.020
And in fact, so this is something that is very interesting to people, you know, to try to describe

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.420
exactly what type of fractal structure do we have.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.480
Brady: "So if I had a one million by one million grid, I would find this somewhere within it?"

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.490
Correct. Correct. Yes.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:16.900
And, and, you know, so we know a few things about this, this type of fractals, but not a lot, okay?

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:23.140
So, roughly, you know, the, you know, so you may ask, for example, what is the density of this,

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:31.010
this picture? So how many grains of sand, you know, in average, are on a cell? And, well, you know, it has to be

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.760
less than three. It turns out that it has to be bigger than two, okay?

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.480
And it's more or less 2.1, okay?

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.860
It's close to the point, so it's really near 2. In fact, you know, we can you know generalize this.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.280
Say, we, I showed you how to do this with grids.

00:21:49.289 --> 00:21:55.158
But we can do this with other type of grids, like hexagonal grids, and triangular grids, and get different

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:01.099
zeroes, different sets. We could even play this game with an infinite grid.

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:07.459
And very interesting things happen when you play on infinite grids. Would you like to see? So what I'm going to show you is

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.270
an image created, created by Wesley Pegden,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:18.380
where you have an infinite grid, and then you put lots and lots of sand to one cell,

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:24.740
and then you topple and see what happens. So in this case, we're going to put two to the thirty

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.160
number of grains of sand in one cell, and then we're going to topple and see what happens.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.770
And the picture that we get is

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.900
this type of picture. It's also, you know, fractal.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.800
Blue is zero.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.780
This is played on an infinite grid. So when you topple you're going to reach your, there is going to be some perimeter, and,

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:52.109
and then after that you're not going to have grains of sand. So zero is blue, then a lighter blue is 1,

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.329
yellow is 2, and red is 3.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:59.400
It's very interesting that, you know, the picture that you get looks sort of like a circle.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.030
So this avalanche doesn't just send grains of sand everywhere,

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:10.499
but it sort of like preserves this circular structure. And we can even zoom in this picture and see what happens.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.380
So we can zoom in,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.520
and you see that there is this sort of fractal type structure.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.969
And, you know, things that, you know, only by looking very very close,

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:27.420
we see, you know, that very intricate things are happening, right? So we can play this with different types of grids.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.719
This is, you know, a triangular grid,

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.730
and this is, again, putting lots and lots of grains of sand in one cell,

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.349
and then toppling. And in here, you know we have

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:47.160
more neighbors per cell. So our max, you know, before we topple, we, you can put

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.649
larger piles of sand. So in here

00:23:49.649 --> 00:23:55.520
we can put all the way up to 5. And that is stable. So we have more colors, and then it produces this type of

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.420
also fractal looking picture.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:07.700
...point goes back to itself. So we know that this point is on the straight line, because it intersects the circle inversion
