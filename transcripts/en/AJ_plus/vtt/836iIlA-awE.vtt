00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.120
If you’d wanted to know what the future looked like before it arrived, all you

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.220
really had to do was look at the Jetsons.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.280
(Music) “Meet George Jetson.”

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.420
The television series described many things we now see in the 21st century

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.640
long before we’d even finished the 20th. The Jetsons predicted our present

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
technology and lifestyle. So, since they were so great at telling us what

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
today would look like what can this cartoon family teach us about future tech and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.580
how automation will alter our lives?

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.360
“You think. You think! Your machine is supposed to do the thinking, Jetson.”

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.680
“I have feelings, like everyone else.”

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.740
“The future is happening now. And the question is: When will it be distributed so everyone benefits from it?”

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.160
Hey, everyone. I’m Joel. This is AJ+. And this Sunday we’re looking into a colorful cartoon past

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.480
to better understand our automated future.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.520
And yes, we will talk about robots, jobs – and the dark side of automation.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.880
Flying cars. Moving walkways. Video conferencing. Computers. And robotic

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.890
maids. Those are all things the Jetsons had. When George, Jane, Judy and Elroy

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.229
premiered on ABC in 1962, all those things were unimaginable as part of a daily life.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.270
Future tech was color TV when the Jetsons began, because it wasn’t

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.039
wasn’t until the 1960s when color televisions began selling en masse. So the thought that

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.610
Rosie, the family’s robotic maid, would one day become a part of daily

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.909
daily life as an automatic vacuum cleaner may have been inconceivable then. But in 2018,

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.929
Rosie looks like this, and sounds like this.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.060
“You have 12 events scheduled.” The world is rushing to automate. 
Think grocery

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.590
store checkouts, self-driving cars and how shipping has evolved. In fact the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.729
the automated household of the Jetsons is only a decade away, according to tech entrepreneur

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.310
Vivek Wadhwa. “When I was young, it was my favorite TV series. I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.250
expect to have a robot like Rosie cleaning up after me. Rather than having

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.659
servants and maids and chauffeurs, we'll have robots serving us.”

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:20.939
So maybe your morning routine doesn’t look exactly like George Jetson’s – yet! But

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.890
it already has some similarities. And unlike the Jetsons’ total embrace of the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.819
technology around them, society in real life has been hesitant about some

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.349
technological advances. &nbsp;The trepidation may have something to do with hearing

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.519
forecasts like this from World Bank President Jim Yong Kim. “We estimate that

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.939
two-thirds of all jobs in developing economies will be

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.379
wiped out by automation.” Take a second to think of any and every job that makes up our economy.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.220
Well, 50% of those work activities are

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.510
technically able to be automated by current technologies. Even the Obama White House has

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.760
has said almost every driving job – that’s your taxi driver, the delivery

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.810
driver who delivers the food to your local grocery store and the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.439
long-haul truckers you see on the interstate – all of their jobs will be

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.870
be automated. “That’s f*cked up, yo! What the f*ck are they going to do if they

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.370
make everything autonomous?” Maybe hearing those statistics makes you want to panic.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.290
But AI and robotics expert Neil Jacobstein says you don’t have to and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.639
and shouldn’t get hysterical about the worst that can happen with automation. “If you

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:33.900
run your risk assessment by what's the worst that can happen, you would run a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.519
a risk assessment around many of the technologies that are already in the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.739
world today and can conclude that they should all be banned, including cars.”

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.699
Jacobstein says we haven’t banned vehicles just because they have the potential to

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:53.040
run down pedestrians. That’s a worst-case scenario. And he says that if we’d used it to

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.260
determine the future of cars, we would never have had them. So we have cars, and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.739
actually, we have much more than you may realize.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.900
Wadhwa says it’s important to recognize just how far automation and AI have

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.250
already come. “We have to understand the technology advances and accept the fact

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.239
fact that this is going to happen. Don't be in denial about it. Understand the fact that

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.750
every industry is going to be impacted.” And when he says AI and automation will

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.100
impact every single industry, he means it. It’s not just jobs

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.740
reliant upon physical labor that are at risk.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.610
Those are things you’ve probably already heard and thought about – like the truck

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.510
driver example we talked about earlier. You can also expect careers that require

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.620
a lot of intelligence to be disrupted, and here’s why.  “Because what artificial intelligence does,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.900
it analyzes data, information, and makes decisions.” “We're

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.590
going to see them augment humans in human roles. So there'll be machines plus humans

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.520
outperforming either humans or machines alone.” Whoa! Maybe this is why&nbsp;– in

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.350
a world filled with advanced technology – George Jetson’s only job is to push a

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.400
couple of buttons. “After all, I’m a darn good digital index operator.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.250
You gotta have it up here to know how to start these things and stop ’em.”

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:21.490
And according to Mr. Spacely, he didn’t even do that well.  [steam engine sound] “You dunderhead! You dolt!”

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:31.420
This means even George’s cushy job could be disrupted, too. “You’re fired!” I don't think that there is any limit to

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:38.170
what the systems can learn to do, eventually.”  Jacobstein says automation’s benefits won’t

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:46.570
come without turmoil – AKA serious growing pains. “The question is not whether AI and

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.430
robotics will create new jobs, because it's absolutely true that they will

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.220
create and do create new jobs the the
question is what's the ratio of new jobs. The question is: What's the

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.310
the ratio of new job creation to job displacement or destruction? And I think that ratio

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.560
could easily be unfavorable, at least in the short term.” To understand what this could

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.480
mean, let’s look at the medical industry. 
There are already digital doctors

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.380
that can look at your health, and digital tutors that can teach you. Wadhwa says

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.820
the ability to diagnose yourself and have AI advise you on maintaining your health

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.980
isn’t far away. In fact, Wadhwa says there we will be fewer doctors because of

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.229
this – and it may affect some of the most specialized positions first. If you’re

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.900
questioning what other jobs will be available in the automated age,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.240
realize we may already be doing them and just not getting compensated.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.039
“In the long term, we could create new jobs that are jobs we don't see today

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.810
or people don't get paid to do today. A lot of work that people do in volunteer

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.789
work could be paid. We are already doing many jobs in today's world that people

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:59.320
people would never call a job 200 years ago.” To prepare for this future,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.000
Wadhwa says the best way to deal with automation’s disruption is to look at the past.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.100
“Alright, take a deep breath.” [inhales] “Now exhale.” [exhales]

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.240
OK, but not that far in the past.
And in my interview, Wadhwa told me that

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.230
the case study to look at is the Great Depression. The crippling economic

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.370
downturn left about a quarter of the workforce jobless at one point.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.420
The federal government’s response is what’s known as the New Deal. It included public

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.400
works projects and financial reforms, all aimed at getting people back to work.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.660
So, much like the Great Depression, the disruption automation and AI

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.640
gives us a chance to reboot our lives. “We can rethink our society, rethink our

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.510
rethink our entire value system, and go back to what matters. This is the opportunity we

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.070
have now. All in the next 10, 15, 20 years.” While we’re thinking of all the changes

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.180
needed in the United States to deal with the result of automation, just know it’s

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.640
not a one-size-fits-all solution. What’s required in Nigeria, Australia or India

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.670
isn’t the same as the U.S. "Countries such as India and Bangladesh and Pakistan,

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.720
for example, there's infrastructure to be built. We can put all those people

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.530
to work in building new cities. Abandon the existing cities, which are polluted."

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.400
But there is one thing all nations will have to troubleshoot.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.770
“We really need to think ahead about what we're going to do to help people

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:31.620
maintain a high quality of lifestyle and be able to move forward with their lives. If we're going to rely on jobs

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:38.190
being the primary mechanism of wealth distribution, then we might easily see

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.290
see businesses cutting jobs and replacing those jobs with automation –

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.270
– both AI and robotics – and people losing jobs.” So yes, automation and AI will bring a lot of changes, a lot of which

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:53.880
which will be very uncomfortable. But does that mean it will all be bad for humanity? “It's not

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.610
all hopeless. You know, who says we have to work 40, 50, 60 hours a week? Why

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.460
are jobs so important? What if we only had to work 5 or 10 hours a week?

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.500
What if everyone now had everything they needed and the purpose of life, the goals

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.700
that we had, were to seek enlightenment?”
