00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.490
What happens when we want to
subtract a number that is negative?

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.600
So, for example,
if instead of subtracting 10 from 6,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.180
I wanted to subtract negative 10 from 6.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.270
This is a good place for me to use
parentheses to make the notation clear.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.140
Remember that we can think of
subtracting as adding the opposite.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.740
So, what is the opposite of negative 10?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.100
Enter your answer in the box.
