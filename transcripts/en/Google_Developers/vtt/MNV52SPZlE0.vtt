Hello, I'm Timothy
Jordan, and this

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:05.905
is your update about all
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.100
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.760
I have just a few
updates to share,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.060
so let's see how fast I
can get you back to work.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.580
Speaking of fast,
Android Studio 2.0

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.360
is the fastest way to build
high-quality performant

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.420
apps for the Android
platform, including

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.340
phones and tablets, Android
Auto, Android Wear, and Android

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.130
TV.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.810
If you are developing
for Android,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.360
you should be using
Android Studio 2.0.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.800
Check out the blog post for
the latest features and a link

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.030
to the latest stable release.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.010
In this week's Android
Developer story,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.570
WeVideo explains how relaunching
their app with Material Design

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.800
increased user
engagement by 100%.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.290
They also share how WeVideo
improved monetization

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.310
and installs using ratings
and reviews, store listing

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.070
experiments, and other
features on Google Play.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.390
Click the link for
the full video.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.270
Quickly understand your cloud
application's top or new errors

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.590
with Stackdriver
Error Reporting now

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.500
available in beta
for everyone to try.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.300
Zero set-up is needed for
App Engine applications,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.780
and it requires just a
few configuration steps

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.160
on other platforms.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.840
Stackdriver Error
Reporting counts, analyzes,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.990
and aggregates in real time the
crashes in your running cloud

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.310
services and notifies you
when there's something new.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.680
More details and screenshots
are in the linked post.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.570
We recently launched the Google
Maps SDK for iOS version 1.13.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.960
This release
includes the ability

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.385
to create advanced marker
animations, the ability

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:31.380
to set the frame
rate up to 60 frames

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.690
per second, further
custom styling

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.450
for the place auto
autocomplete widget, and more.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.040
Details and a link to
the SDK are on the post.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.520
OK, that was a super short
set of updates this week.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.960
So here's one more
thing just for fun.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.680
This is a post on the Google
Research blog from the Broad

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.760
Institute of MIT and
Harvard about how

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.800
their researchers and
software engineers

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.480
are collaborating closely
with the Google genomics

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.950
team on large-scale
genomic data analysis.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.520
They've already significantly
reduced the time and cost

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.950
for whole genome
processing and are helping

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.120
researchers think even bigger.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.729
Check it out.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.639
And that's it.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.200
With the time we
saved today, why

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.260
don't you share this video with
your friends and colleagues.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.000
Go on.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.060
They'll thank you for it.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.476
And don't forget to click all
the links in the description

00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:19.100
below.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.490
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next time.
