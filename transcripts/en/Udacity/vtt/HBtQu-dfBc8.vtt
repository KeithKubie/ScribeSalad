00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.860
Speaking from a culture that's very much more superstitious, and about,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.160
in this case, I feel like I hear a lot

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.360
of people in the younger generations who believe that's great.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.074
Now we can find out different things, whereas with the

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:20.493
older generations, I feel like we hear a lot of,

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.971
you should never play with that kind of stuff, you

00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:25.470
don't know what's going to happen. And even though it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.130
just in this case testing it leads to trying to

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.730
fix things, or trying to change things in order to stop.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.240
You know, you, you don't know where it's going to go, from here.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.352
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:41.860
&gt;&gt; For sure. Definitely we don't know.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.300
&gt;&gt; I that the public sort of understanding of this sort of genetic

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.616
information is sort of twofold. I think

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:50.314
one, there's sort of this science fictiony

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:54.503
sort of portrayal of of, this will be the end golice, this will be

00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:58.841
some of answers, like you will, you will find the outlet. Are you going to

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.969
develop Alzheimer's, not sort of the understanding

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.411
of probability. So I think there's a lot

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:07.109
of stock in this information that may not

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.438
have come to fruition yet, scientifically. I think

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:16.158
the other end of it, is there is a lot of mystery, and a lot of mysticism behind

00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:22.460
it, and a lot of you know, curiosity, and and just lack of understanding.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.650
&gt;&gt; Carol,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.760
you were going to say something too?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.280
&gt;&gt; I had seen an article written by a medical ethicist it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.850
just was very coincidental. And his

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.190
point of view is that people like us, should not have

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.290
access to genetic information, and this is up to the physicians.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.040
&gt;&gt; So people like us,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.170
[CROSSTALK]

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.840
is just the general public?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.938
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the general public. And I debated him on this issue

00:01:55.938 --> 00:02:01.640
and it, it I think

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.070
that in the medical community and in, and in probably in

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.540
education, where people are sitting in their ivory tower.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.689
They think that the general public shouldn't have access to this information,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.454
and I think that sells people short. Particularly

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:29.578
today, where in the age of the computer, age

00:02:29.578 --> 00:02:34.770
where everything is on Facebook and on Twitter.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.990
And, I mean it, it's open. People want to know. And I think that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.680
it's going to change radically.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.250
&gt;&gt; I think part of what Strong was saying

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.150
about, there's the two sides of it. People think, put

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.670
too much stock in it, or there's this strange

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.920
you know, misunderstanding or mysticism about it. Is the fact

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.680
that this kind of availability of information, is so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.785
new. I mean 23andMe just about eight years ago, cost

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:06.150
$1,000. And now it's under 100. And so it's

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.170
only now, that we're starting to, it's only now available,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.910
to the general public. And there's questions of,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.650
should the general public be allowed to have

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.510
this information. In the state of, where I'm

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.440
from, in Maryland, 23andMe is illegal. You cannot.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.030
&gt;&gt; It is illegal?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.904
&gt;&gt; You cannot, 23andMe will not ship to Maryland, or New York.

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:24.310
&gt;&gt; Really.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.910
&gt;&gt; Because the state has passed that

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.860
genetic information, can only come from a doctor.
