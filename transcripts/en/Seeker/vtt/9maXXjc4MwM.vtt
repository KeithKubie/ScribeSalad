00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.630
Julia…

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.120
Julia…

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.609
JULIA.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.100
WHAT!?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.840
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.280
Have you guys ever been on a train playing
on your phone and suddenly you’ve missed

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.470
your train stop?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.539
Or if you’re like me, your family thinks
you’ve suddenly gone deaf when you’ve

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.030
got your nose stuck in a book.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.769
This has become an actual recurring problem
in my life.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:24.769
But aha!

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.099
Science vindicates me!

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.169
Apparently focusing on something visual does
makes us kind of deaf.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.580
It happens to most of us.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.311
It’s called “inattentional deafness”
according to a study published in the journal

00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:37.960
Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.380
The researchers tested over 100 participants
and had them focus on tasks on a computer

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.340
screen and they played a noticeable tone.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.860
When the task demanded more attention, eight
out of ten participants failed to notice the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.860
tone.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.579
And this isn’t exactly news.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.100
Humans aren’t that good at paying attention
to lots of different things at the same time.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
We can focus, we just can’t pay attention.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.019
Researchers have known for years about “inattentional
blindness”, which like it sounds is when

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.740
you don’t see something happening because
you were focused on something else.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.620
The classic example is the “invisible gorilla
test”.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.610
Where you watch people pass a basket ball
back and forth and count how many times they

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.610
passed it.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.680
But in the middle of the video a person in
a gorilla suit walks in, beats their chest,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.979
and walks out.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.210
In one study of this video, 42% of people
didn’t notice the gorilla.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.520
At all because they were so focused on the
basketball.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.810
So what’s going on?

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.820
Well a recent study published in the Journal
of Neuroscience found our brains aren’t

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.640
as efficient as we’d like to think.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.430
In this small study, researchers hooked up
13 volunteers to a brain activity measuring

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.420
device called a MEG.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.280
This machine is used to measure how long it
takes for an “unusual sensory signal”

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.710
to get from your brain to your consciousness.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.990
Basically, how long it takes for you to recognize
something after you see or hear it.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.220
This typically takes 300msec, and is referred
to as a p3 reading .

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.770
In the study the volunteers were given a visually
demanding task, like matching things on a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.810
computer.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.509
While they were engrossed in their task, the
researchers played a tone.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.360
The scientists found that the volunteers were
so focused on matching things, their P3 response

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.560
was suppressed.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.129
Which means they didn’t consciously perceive
the sound.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.360
And another reading suggested that they didn’t
even hear it.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.830
The MEG also looked at activity in the superior
temporal sulcus and posterior middle temporal

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.430
gyrus, which are parts of our brain that usually
light up in response to hearing a sound.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.140
But since the volunteers were so focused on
the task, even this reading was weak.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.159
So really, when you’re focusing really hard
on something, your brain barely hears it and

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.440
it doesn’t even reach your consciousness.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.920
The researchers found that this is because
the senses of hearing and vision share a limited

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.300
neural resource.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.970
Simply put, your brain doesn’t have the
resources to consciously perceive multiple

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.599
things at the same time.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.019
So take that mom and dad!

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:36.220
I wasn’t ignoring you when I was reading,
I literally couldn’t hear you!
