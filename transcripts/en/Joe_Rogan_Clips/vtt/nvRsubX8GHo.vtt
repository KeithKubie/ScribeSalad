The Joe Rogan experience.
Russell,

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:05.850
why is it then when people start getting like super spiritual,

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.270
they start dressing like you.
You dress like a guru.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.190
We circulate a memo so it's now time to stop wearing shocks.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.480
Stop shaving and make eye contact for a bit too long.
Oh,

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.800
it uncomfortable archive.
Stary how long are you going to go with the beard?

7
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.000
I mean that's,
that's like you're,
you're full on like you're a Yogi.
No,

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.830
I mean he's gone beyond Jesus and into Moses and less a profits or test or a

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:36.360
navy seal.
You are in that range too.
Like he could be some wild man.
That's,

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.830
that's a mistake that would like if there was an assault course in front of us

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.010
that have the potential for me being a navy seal would start to break down.

12
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.844
I once went on a,

13
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.380
an assault course with some US marines in that place near San Diego.

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.910
I can't remember the name of that base and climbing up that rope using your leg

15
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.640
muscles.
It was not good value and enjoy it.

16
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.390
I like the camaraderie and I really like I as I've written about and talk about

17
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.180
quite a lot when I'm around very in very male environment,

18
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.030
I kind of really like it.
I really get off on it,

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.510
but I have to watch for myself not getting too excitable.

20
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.000
It's even in this environment.
As a matter of fact,

21
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.500
I have to clean myself a little bit.
Chilled out.
Why?
What do you mean?

22
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:21.570
What does it do to you?
Well,
I guess what it is is my early life,

23
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:25.500
I grew up mostly around my mum and dad have brothers and sisters and stuff like

24
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:25.681
that.

25
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:30.660
So my male role modeling occurred later in life and I think it probably relates

26
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.030
to this spiritual thing.
I think it meant that I was,

27
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:37.480
I'm very open to sort of spiritual experience,
meditative experiences.

28
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.370
I didn't have a lot of grounding physical experiences or bodily experience.

29
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:44.970
He's really till adolescents until sex and sexuality and as the first time I

30
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.790
really got into the body,
didn't do sports as a kid,
didn't have like main guy,

31
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:51.530
right?
This is what we do,
this how we shave.
This is how you treat people.

32
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.330
They say,
you know,
I didn't really get that kind of education.

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.520
So now still if I'm around like soldiers,
UFC fighters,
I go,
you know,
you know,

34
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:04.010
I'd be BJJ primarily as a result of these conference where there's not Colum

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.860
confrontation cows conversations.
That's a much nicer term.

36
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.540
So like there's a bit of me that's the guy gave excited about the analysis of
it.

37
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.710
It's not homo erotic because that doesn't happen to be the way that I roll out.

38
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.270
Just enjoy a little too much.

39
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.980
There's something about it fired up and it may be what's bad about it,

40
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.590
what's,
what's bad about getting fired up?

41
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.080
Nothing for me except like,
you know,
look my,
as you know,

42
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.610
my model for life is as sort of a 12 step model about watching my impulses.

43
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.520
My impulses of got me in a lot of trouble.
My impulse is to take drugs,

44
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:43.170
my impulses to sleep around my,
like my impulses to even eat food.

45
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.160
I've got sort of a tendency to get obsessive.
But you know,

46
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.160
you would probably argue that if you direct that energy correctly,

47
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:52.800
it can be kind of positive.
I think it can,

48
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.790
but I agree with you that it can get out of control and I have similar impulses,

49
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.060
I have similar problems and I just used

50
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 1>disciplined and hard work,
especially working out to try to mitigate it.</v>

51
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.560
<v 0>Well that's why I pick up from you is that your early encounters with martial</v>

52
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.800
arts of men that you've understood from a young age.

53
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:16.090
It seems to me physical discipline and I think that's a very important thing.

54
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:21.091
And I'm only learning that like now because I've had a real like you know,

55
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.490
drugs then fame there and,
and chaos.

56
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:28.750
And I said I've only just emerged from like the sort of the fog of that madness.

57
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.930
Okay.

58
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.900
<v 1>I love how you have emerged though cause it's very unique.
You've,
you,</v>

59
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:36.580
you've uniquely emerged authentically like you.
This is who you really are.

60
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.520
Like you're not putting on an act you found yourself,

61
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.280
which is like what everybody wants to do.
They want to find themselves.

62
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.630
I mean it never feels like a completed task right.
It.
Now.

63
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.060
Everyone's a work in progress forever.
That's right,
but you are,

64
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.061
you like you are very comfortably you and you've found what makes you you.

65
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.650
<v 0>That's a lovely compliment to get from you,
Joe.</v>

66
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.530
I appreciate that because what I think about is that you're a very different

67
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.520
type of person that made it things that in this world,
in these political times,

68
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.590
you and I would be supposed to,
I would say a take adversarial stance.

69
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.490
His on,
I'm Vegan now,
you love hunting,

70
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.730
but my personal philosophy is my morality and my spirituality is for me.

71
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.400
It's not something I'd go around inflicting on other people and telling them how

72
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.580
they should behave.
I'm Rick.
I know enough now to know people are different,

73
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:28.210
people had different experiences and I don't let those things get in the way of

74
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:29.680
how I evaluate other people

75
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.560
<v 1>for why we should all be more like that.
I really,
I really believe that.</v>

76
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.250
I mean there's so many people that I disagree with that I have fun conversations

77
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.140
with a,
I don't think there's anything wrong with that and,

78
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.970
and I don't think that impulse to to have antagonistic engagements with people

79
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:44.170
that you disagree with is correct.

80
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.420
<v 0>How else are we going to consolidate?
Yes.</v>

81
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.230
I feel like it's just like I'm only going to deal with people that see the world

82
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:53.400
roughly how I do.
How are we going to have a full new tribes,
new alliances,

83
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:54.121
new relationships,

84
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:57.480
new system to a time when evidentaly it feels to me at least Joe,

85
00:04:57.481 --> 00:04:59.210
like things are breaking down.
Yeah.

86
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.720
There's a law bit in this as Serby and confrontation and people don't want to

87
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:06.480
talk to you.
Yeah,
but I mean,
I don't know how real that is of actual people.

88
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:06.871
I'm talking,

89
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:11.010
I suppose about how the media landscape seems to present information.

90
00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.950
I don't know if that's true when you're,
you know,
when I'm around people,

91
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:15.660
I don't sense.
Oh Wow,

92
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:18.300
these guys are really tied up in Brexit or Trump or whatever.

93
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.300
It doesn't seem that relevant toward an airy people.

94
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.630
It seems to me that people are still operate in on a,

95
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.230
in a person or how are you today?
Are you okay?
You know,

96
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.010
people are willing to get on like that.
I mean,

97
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:33.060
how are we supposed to take these ideas on board?
It's almost too vast for us.

98
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.060
Right?
Geo political ideas that were asked to identify with

99
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.600
<v 1>Ryan and then your everyday life hardly ever affects you or affects you very</v>

100
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.320
little in comparison to things that you ignore because you're concentrating on

101
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:48.100
Brexit.
Are you concentrating on Trump or you're concentrating on whatever it is?

102
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.560
Yeah.
That wall build that wall,
whatever it is.
