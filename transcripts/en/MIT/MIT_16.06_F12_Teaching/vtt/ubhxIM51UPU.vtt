STEVEN HALL: So one of the
nice things about this approach

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.059
is that, first of all, the
students are always engaged.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.410
They're actively engaged
in their learning.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.860
They're not passively
listening to me

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.080
try to explain the important
features of a problem.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.610
By standing up and
working at the board,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.560
I can see what all
the students are doing

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.920
in the room at the same time.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.030
So I can tell from
across the room

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.580
if a group is having trouble.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.320
I can tell from the
middle of the room

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.800
if the entire class
is maybe lost.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.220
So it gives me a lot of options.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.270
I can go help students
who are having trouble.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.520
I can stop the class.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.420
I can lecture a little bit to
help with a broad misconception

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.470
that they may have.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.710
But more importantly, when
the students are standing,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.290
they're much more likely
to share the responsibility

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.370
for doing the problem.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.870
What I've found is that when
they're working at tables, even

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.960
if we ask them to work
together, the tendency

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.540
is to turn to the piece
of paper in front of them

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.330
and work alone.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.420
But by standing up,
sharing a blackboard,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.710
no one can monopolize.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.130
Anyone can step in
and do a problem.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.400
So in a conventional class,
the opportunities for feedback

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.132
are essentially, when you
grade the problem sets,

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:36.840
you have some inkling
of whether students

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.860
understand the material.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.250
But really, you learn
whether students

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.800
know the material at the quiz
at which point it's too late.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.360
The students have already scored
perhaps poorly on the quiz.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.890
But by then, you've moved
on to other material.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.490
So one of the nice things
about active learning

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.010
is that it provides feedback
at multiple times scales.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.510
So in a lecture, if you have
a concept quiz on material

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.202
that you've just
lectured, you might

00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:04.410
discover that the lecture
was completely ineffective.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.451
Or you might discover that
it was very effective,

00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.669
and you can move
on to new material.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.610
The same is true in recitation.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.410
Especially in the
recitations that I've

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.570
been doing in 16.06 where
we emphasize skills,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.990
you can see over the weeks
the progression of skills.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.340
Students get better and
better at a core skill

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.840
that they need later on.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.170
And in our case, it's things
like root locus and Bode plots.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.660
You can really see week to
week that they get much better

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600
at what they're doing.
