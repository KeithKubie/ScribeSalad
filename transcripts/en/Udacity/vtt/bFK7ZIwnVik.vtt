00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay--let's learn about another input type.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to change our main input

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
from type="password" to type="checkbox".

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And this, as you might imagine, will make a checkbox.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When we go to our form, I hit Reload,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and now we have a checkbox next to our Submit button.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When I check this checkbox--you know--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a checkbox is for toggling something on and off--I'm sure you've seen them before.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When I check this checkbox and hit Submit,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we see in our URL the "q" parameter equals "on".

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That means that the box was checked.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What happens--and you can try this yourself--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when I hit Submit, when the checkbox isn't checked?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Is it off, the parameter doesn't appear at all,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the parameter is blank

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or is it the string, "hunter2"?
