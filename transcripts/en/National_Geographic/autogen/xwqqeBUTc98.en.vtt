all hours of the day and went into the
 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.950

record that was really exciting because

highest canopy frogs that live in this
 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.530
highest canopy frogs that live in this
forest so the last place we would have

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540
forest so the last place we would have
 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.600
forest so the last place we would have
ever expected to look for a frog would

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610
ever expected to look for a frog would
 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.540
ever expected to look for a frog would
be under water let alone during the day

for a nocturnal species another possible
hypothesis was that we were already

hypothesis was that we were already
 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.370
hypothesis was that we were already
hearing xqc tikal and we said know it

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380
hearing xqc tikal and we said know it
 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.220
hearing xqc tikal and we said know it
but and we captured all the sounds we

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230
but and we captured all the sounds we
 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.320
but and we captured all the sounds we
could in our fieldwork and line them up

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330
could in our fieldwork and line them up
 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.710
could in our fieldwork and line them up
to do spectrographic analysis and from

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720
to do spectrographic analysis and from
 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.780
to do spectrographic analysis and from
what we can see they're not acoustically

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790
what we can see they're not acoustically
 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.820
what we can see they're not acoustically
distinct enough to indicate a different

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830
distinct enough to indicate a different
 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.750
distinct enough to indicate a different
species however there's one interesting

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760
species however there's one interesting
 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.240
species however there's one interesting
idea that still has a lot of possibility

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250
idea that still has a lot of possibility
 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.000
idea that still has a lot of possibility
to it and it's that these frogs are

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010
to it and it's that these frogs are
 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.070
to it and it's that these frogs are
singing through a different medium not

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080
singing through a different medium not
 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.820
singing through a different medium not
using the air they're using the water

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830
using the air they're using the water
 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.800
using the air they're using the water
this is really interesting because we

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810
this is really interesting because we
 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.740
this is really interesting because we
have rarely ever seen any frogs that

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750
have rarely ever seen any frogs that
 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.270
have rarely ever seen any frogs that
live in the trees staying in the water

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280
live in the trees staying in the water
 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.970
live in the trees staying in the water
except for this species if these frogs
