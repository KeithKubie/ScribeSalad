JASON SILVA: --was
this fascinating piece

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.790
in the news the other
day where they actually

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.750
found a cave painting
in an Indonesian island

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.670
that is up to 40,000 years old.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.640
It's the oldest cave painting
that's ever been found by man.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.040
Again 40,000 years,
I mean, just the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.490
thought that human
beings have been trying

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.980
to exteriorize their minds
and symbolically represent

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.040
themselves for 40,000 years,
that the human imagination was

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.430
pulsating 40,000
years ago, that there

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060
was enough agitation,
enough of a desire

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.280
to transfigurate the
contents from within

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.990
and translate them to
the spaces of without

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.940
to externalize ourselves to
project, to represent the urge

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.040
to represent.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.030
That symbolic capacity of man
has been here for 40,000 years.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.390
I just find that
absolutely mind boggling.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.510
It's one of those things
makes that you wonder-- like,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.980
where does come from?

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.450
What awoke it?

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.690
What-- it's just one
of those mysteries.
