00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.120
In 1993, concerned about the steady decline
of milk consumption over recent years, the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.340
newly created nonprofit California Milk Processor
Board approached the advertising agency of

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.980
Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, seeking fresh
ideas to get America excited about drinking

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.980
their product.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.580
The agency found the request quite a challenge,
since, in the words of Jeff Goodby: “We

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.710
have all tried it.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.070
Most of already own some..

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.210
. . Milk is not new.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.280
It is not improved . . . . There is very little
to say about it.”

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.449
And so, despite years of experience, the Mad
Men and Women of Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.479
were at a loss for where to start when, during
a focus group, one woman noted that: “The

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.390
only time I even think about milk is when
I run out of it,” which led Goodby to write

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.230
down the now famous line- “got milk?”

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.119
Still not convinced they had their winner,
some members of the firm were concerned that

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.640
not only was the phrase grammatically questionable,
its production hadn’t required much effort

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.240
on their part- it seemed too simplistic to
present back to the Milk Processor Board.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.890
Others thought that the campaign should instead
recognize that people almost always drink

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.530
milk with other foods, like cookies or cereal,
and wanted the ads to focus on “Milk and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.790
XYZ”

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.820
Ultimately however, perhaps recognizing that
brevity can be the soul of wit, they stuck

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.010
with the two-word question, with the minuscule
case set it in its now iconic typeface, and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.980
began telling stories of how much life can
suck when you run out of milk.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.300
Generally involving an individual caught in
the middle of eating something sticky or dry

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.940
when he realizes he’s out of milk, the commercials
typically ended with the distraught character

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.490
looking pathetic, and a narrator asking you
if you are sufficiently prepared to avoid

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.320
this type of calamity with the simple question:
“got milk?”

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.260
While many of the commercials are classic,
none is more well known than the first in

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.740
the series, which was directed by none other
than Michael Bay of Transformers, Bad Boys

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.500
and Armageddon fame.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.210
Sometimes called “Got Milk/Aaron Burr,”
for those not familiar, the television ad

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.340
opens with classical music playing while the
camera scans a large apartment, crammed full

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.840
with Alexander Hamilton memorabilia.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.980
As the song wraps up, the sole occupant of
the apartment finishes spreading peanut butter

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.640
on a slice of bread and takes an enormous
bite, just as the announcer says that the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.049
day’s $10,000 question is: “Who shot Alexander
Hamilton in that famous duel?”

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.629
Now several shots of Hamilton/Burr collectibles
are shown, revealing that the answer was not

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.739
only “Aaron Burr,” but that the peanut
butter-eating character knows this, as well.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.269
The phone rings, the announcer asks our character
the question and he answers, but, because

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.659
of the peanut butter gumming up his mouth,
his answer is unintelligible.

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.379
As his big chance slips away, the character
goes for a glass of milk to clear his palate,

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.760
only to realize the carton is empty.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.099
The announcer cuts the call having not heard
the correct answer, and as the screen fades

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.999
to black, the character, now broken-hearted,
continues to try to articulate the answer

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:07.669
to no avail, and then his apartment dramatically
explodes… (kidding) The commercial ends

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.669
with the familiar phrase on the screen, “got
milk?”

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.359
Wildly popular, Bay’s commercial won the
Silver Lion at Cannes, as well as the Grand

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.419
Prix Clio for commercial of the year.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.059
Within two years, the Milk Processor Education
Program (MilkPEP) was distributing it nationwide

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:27.730
and by the mid-1990s, more than 91% of American
adults were familiar with the “got milk?”

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.669
campaign (which eventually morphed into other
forms, such as with milk-mustachioed celebrities

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.579
in a variety of poses).

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.959
Despite the cleverness and popularity of the
entire campaign, milk consumption in the U.S.

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.680
has continued to decline somewhat.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.090
For reference, in 1975 Americans annually
used 274 pounds per person of liquid milk

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.790
(about 32 gallons), while in 2014, they were
only using 159 pounds per person per year

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.549
(about 18.5 gallons).

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.590
Seeking to stop the bleeding, in 2014, MilkPEP
dropped the got milk?

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.999
campaign and replaced it with one focusing
on milk’s rich nutritional content, and

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:05.419
in particular, protein, called Milk Life.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.870
As for Bay, before his big break into feature
films with 1995’s Bad Boys, he made a number

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.609
of other well-known commercials, as well as
music videos.

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:19.419
For instance, in addition to the award-winning
1993 “Got Milk/Aaron Burr” ad, Bay received

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.310
the Gold Lion at Cannes the same year for
the “Miller Lite/Lawyer Roundup” commercial.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.590
Other famous Bay commercials include Nike’s
“Michael Jordan vs. Charles Barkley” ad

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.389
and a couple of jean commercials – one for
Levi’s, the other for Bugle Boy.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.560
For his efforts here, Bay received the Commercial
Director of the Year award from the Directors

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.190
Guild of America in 1995.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.690
Among Bay’s well-known music videos are
Meatloaf’s “I Would Do Anything for Love

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.220
(But I Won’t Do That),” Wilson Philips’
“You Won’t See Me Cry,” and the Divinyls,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.560
“I Touch Myself.”
