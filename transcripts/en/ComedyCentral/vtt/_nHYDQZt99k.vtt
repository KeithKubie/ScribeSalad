00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.151
Mr. Joe Rogan,
everybody.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.287
Let him hear it.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.190
So I've done a lot of traveling
doing stand-up comedy,

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.858
and one of the weird things
about traveling is,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.459
sometimes you have to stay
in hotels,

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.627
most of the time,
all the time.

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.496
Forget what I said earlier.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.698
All the time.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.667
And most of the time,
it's uneventful,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.303
but I was in a hotel fire once,

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:10.804
and it's something
you never think about,

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.472
you hear about occasionally
on the news,

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.141
but when it happens,
it's a real freak out.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.809
It was in the middle
of the night.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.744
We'd gone to bed at about 2:00
in the morning,

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.680
and about 4:30,
and I hear...

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.748
[imitates alarm blaring]

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:24.484
I jump up,
and I grabbed the alarm clock,

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:27.721
and I--what button
do I have to push to stop this?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.723
[imitates alarm blaring]

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.792
I'm thinking, "I'm gonna wake up
every [bleep]ing person

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.493
"in this hotel.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.462
I can't believe how loud
I have this."

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.431
I mean,
it didn't make any sense.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.366
I'm delirious.
I don't know what's going on.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.735
I'm in that weird dream state,
and I hear,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.770
"Attention, a fire has been
detected in the building.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:45.672
"Please evacuate immediately.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.140
"Do not use the elevators.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:48.575
Take the stairs."

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:49.810
I don't even know
if this is real.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.512
It doesn't make sense.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:52.813
I don't know if it's
a recording.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.314
I don't know what's going on.

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:56.183
But then the guy keeps the mic
keyed open,

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.818
and you hear a woman
in the background going,

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:59.786
"We've got to get these
[bleep]ing people out of here."

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.455
[laughter]

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.723
And I'm in my underwear,
so I'm like,

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.258
"Okay, what do I need?

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.193
I need clothes,
my laptop."

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.061
I grab my shit,
and I'm thinking--

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.129
I'm on the 15th floor,
all right?

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.064
It's an old-ass hotel.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.766
We're in the Clift Hotel
in San Francisco.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.638
It's Joey Diaz, Tom Segura
and me, okay?

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.507
I don't know what room
they're in, but, you know,

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.543
I know we're all on
the same floor somewhere,

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.145
so I'm looking for them,
and it's a real mind [bleep].

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.181
I'm on the 15th floor.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:28.482
I'm like, "15 flights of stairs.
How long does that take?"

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.350
♪ Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da-da ♪

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:32.319
I'm going through it in my head.
How fast can I run?

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.088
I didn't think about the other
people in the [bleep]ing hotel.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.324
There is a river
of sleepy travelers

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.193
that I hit when I open my door.

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:42.729
I'm like, "Oh, no, you [bleep].

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:45.199
"You mother[bleep]
aren't urgent.

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:48.435
There's not urgency
in your movement."

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:51.605
There's a thin veil
of civilization that goes on

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.308
when you're in a real
natural emergency,

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.276
because it's a [bleep]ing
freak out.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.744
We get to the stairwell.

00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:00.080
San Francisco is an old city,

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:01.748
and they have these
really old hotels

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:04.218
that were designed
when people were tiny.

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.086
They didn't get any food.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.255
They were these little,
tiny people.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.258
So I'm not a big guy,
but I get into this stairwell,

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.260
and I'm like,
"This is [bleep]ing ridiculous."

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.596
And it's one of those things
that they don't do anymore,

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.065
where you can see
the whole way down.

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:20.067
So as you're going down,

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.703
you could see everybody
below you,

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.438
and they're looking up,

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:27.608
and it's this [bleep]ing river
of people,

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.476
and no one's going fast.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.378
And then I start realizing
that a lot of these

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.280
[bleep]ing people look like
they're sleepwalking.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.215
[laughter]

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.784
And then I start thinking
about Ambien,

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.286
because if you don't know,

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.623
39 million Americans
take sleeping pills

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:45.125
on a nightly basis,
okay?

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.394
And I never thought about that
until I had to deal with it.

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.162
Most of the time, I go, "Oh,
well, you need to go to sleep.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.298
Whatever.
I don't give a [bleep]."

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.700
But you do give a [bleep] when
you're in a [bleep]ing hotel,

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.803
and all of sudden,
everyone is sleepwalking.

00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:58.705
If you've never experienced
this before,

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.340
people who are on Ambien,

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:03.177
they just do shit
while they're sleeping,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.778
and they don't know
they did it.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.147
You can just wake them up
and push them,

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.217
and they just keep going
and figure out what to do.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.319
It's a very strange thing.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.488
I have a friend who takes it
every night.

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.725
He can't not take it,
but he needs sleep so badly

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.229
that he's willing to, like,
forget that he did shit.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.231
He made a [bleep]ing turkey.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.432
[laughter]

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.501
Okay?

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.136
This is not enough to get him
to quit doing Ambien.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.671
He got up in the middle
of the night,

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.739
decided he was making a turkey,
went downstairs,

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.776
preheated the oven,
drove to the supermarket,

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.745
bought a turkey, came home,
stuffed it,

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.081
made mashed potatoes
and gravy,

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.250
cooked it, ate it,
went to sleep,

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.152
got up,
and called the police.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:47.554
[laughter]

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:49.723
He goes, "Someone broke into
my house and made a turkey."

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.092
They're like,
"Do you take Ambien?"

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:54.228
"Yes,
but that's not the point."

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:56.196
No,
it's a [bleep]ing terrible drug.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.232
It's a weird thing.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.300
Taking sleeping pills
is a dangerous thing.

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.336
So I'm in this hotel

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.137
where you're entering
into the stairwell.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.273
Just this funnel
of [bleep]ing people,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.041
and some of them
were in slippers,

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:09.443
and some of them
were in bathrobes,

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.311
and everybody is [bleep]ing
walking really slow.

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:13.280
And we hit the stairwell,
and we start going,

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.148
and I see the smoke.

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:16.783
As you're looking down,
you're seeing smoke.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.452
It's, like,
maybe ten floors down,

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.188
like, maybe second, third floor,
and I'm like, "[bleep].

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.389
"Where is this fire?

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.057
"What if I [bleep]ing see fire?

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.526
What do I do if I see fire?"

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.661
You don't want to be
the first guy to freak out,

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.463
but you don't want to be the
last guy to freak out either.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.465
So there's that thing like,
"When go time is there,

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.100
you've got to be ready
for go time."

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.334
Nobody else is ready
for go time.

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.603
People start [bleep]ing
waking up on the stairs.

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:39.072
You could see them in the middle
of the stairway just going,

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.074
"What are we doing?
What are we..."

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:43.810
Waking up in the middle
of walking down the stairs

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.180
in [bleep]ing fire in a hotel.

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:48.148
And this guy, he goes,
"What's going on?"

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.483
The wife goes,
"We're in a hotel fire."

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.751
He goes,
"A hotel?

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.486
Why are we in a hotel?"

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.254
[laughter]

00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:56.089
These people are just walking
down the stairs

00:05:56.123 --> 00:05:57.824
waking up as their going,

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.260
and you could tell the real
old-school Ambien junkies,

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:03.130
'cause they're used to waking up
in the middle of doing shit.

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:05.098
And this one guy,
he grips the railing,

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:08.035
looks around,
and just keeps going.

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:09.203
[laughter]

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.737
You can tell.

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:12.172
He's like,
"Okay, we're doing this.

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:13.574
This is what we're doing."

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:15.609
So we're walking down
the stairway,

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:17.344
and I'm really starting
to panic, 'cause I'm, like,

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.112
everybody could move
a lot faster.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.514
And there's a space
between their head

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.082
and the stairway above,
and I'm like,

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.784
"If I could just get in
that space,

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.352
I can make some
[bleep]ing progress."

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.221
But you don't want to be
the first guy

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:28.355
to step on people's head,
so I'm like,

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.123
"Okay, keep it together.

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:31.225
Keep it together;
keep it together, 15 floors."

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:32.793
I have kids, okay?

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.795
I'm starting to [bleep]ing
really freak out.

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:36.763
And then one guy decides
to stop the line.

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:38.298
He grabs the rail,
and he goes,

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:40.067
"Do we even know
where we're going?"

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.203
And you see everyone
just sort of just rise up

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:45.339
behind this guy,
and everyone's thinking

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:48.542
just murderous,
chimpanzee thoughts.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.378
It's just the deep,
primal part of your brain

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.146
that wants to survive.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.548
And that was the guy
that I focused on

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.150
for the whole rest of the time
we came down the stairs,

00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:58.452
'cause I said,
"That's my guy.

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:00.320
The moment I see fire,

00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:02.122
I'm gonna punch through
that dude's asshole,

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.324
pull out his skeletal system,

00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:07.127
and wear him as a fire suit
to run to safety.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.029
That's my plan.

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.098
I'm like, "I am not
[bleep]ing burning to death

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.766
'cause I'm in a hotel
with a bunch of sleepy bitches."

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.568
And I'm also thinking
the whole time,

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.104
"How the [bleep] is Joey Diaz
getting in this staircase?"

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:19.206
That's part of what
I'm thinking.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:22.109
So, you know, I love my friend,
so I get outside,

00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:24.144
and I'm looking for Joey.

00:07:24.178 --> 00:07:26.113
We get outside.

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:29.516
It turns out
it wasn't really a fire.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.352
It turns out it was a bunch
of drunk assholes

00:07:32.386 --> 00:07:35.589
who just set off
the fire extinguisher,

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.059
which is really good
that nobody freaked out,

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:40.360
'cause the last thing is--

00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:41.728
you want to be outside
when they go,

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:43.430
"There was no real fire,"

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.432
while you're wearing
a dude's skin.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.134
[laughter]

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:49.203
And you're like,
"I'm such a dick.

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:53.106
I'm really sorry
about all this."

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.541
Right when they said
there's no fire,

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.510
everybody goes,
"Where's Joey? Where's Joey?"

00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:58.245
Joey Diaz comes around
the corner,

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:00.380
and he's holding a joint.

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:02.182
And I go,
"How did you get outside?"

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:04.318
He goes, "I took the elevator,
like a doctor."

00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:06.420
[laughter]

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:06.520
Thank you very much.
You guys have been awesome.
