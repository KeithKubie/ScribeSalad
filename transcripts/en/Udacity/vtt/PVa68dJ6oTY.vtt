00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.270
So we just calculated the allelic frequencies up

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.130
here for the dominant recessive alleles, but what

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.520
about the trait itself? How frequent is the

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.920
trait of lactose intolerance in our population? Well,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.690
about their homozygous dominant and our heterozygous condition,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.660
they're going to be lactase persistent. And our homozygous

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.060
recessive condition is going to be lactase non-persistent. This

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.620
is the group that's going to be lactose intolerant.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.708
So, if we calculate the frequency of lactase persistence in my

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:36.660
population, and we've got 500 plus 350 is 850 total people out

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.178
of 1,000. That's 0.85. Well, look at that! The frequency of the

00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:49.897
dominant allele is 0.675. The frequency of the dominant trait is 0.85.

00:00:49.897 --> 00:00:53.500
They're not the same. This is really

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.240
important, the allelic frequency and the trait frequency

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.620
don't have to match. Take this given

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.795
scenario right here. We have a population of

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.930
1000 people, remember that means we have

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.950
2000 alleles total. And when we calculate our

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.050
allelic frequency, we find that the dominant

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.015
allele for lactase persistence is prevalent at a

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:20.360
0.75 frequency. The recessive allele is prevalent at at 0.25 frequency.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.716
When we look at the actual trait frequency, lactase

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:29.946
persistence comes in at 1.0, 100%. But lactatse

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:35.165
nonpersistent. The tray to lactose intolerance is 0,

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:40.330
0%. Now, if these things are true, then I want you to enter a possible number

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.965
of people for each genotype here. Remember, you have

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:46.580
100 people to choose from, so whatever your numbers you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.575
put in these boxes, it should add up to a

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.290
1000. Based on the allelic and the trait frequencies that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.010
you see here, I want you to enter in any

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.070
possible number of people that could be each genotype. Go

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.400
ahead, give it a try. If you get stuck, try

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.420
checking out the forums to see if anyone has some

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.330
helpful advice.
