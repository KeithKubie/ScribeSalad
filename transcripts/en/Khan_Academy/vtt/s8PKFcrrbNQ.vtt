00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.110
Two videos ago, I told you that
when you're dealing with

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.280
an exponential function, that
when you increase x by a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.720
constant amount that the y
values will increase by a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.840
constant factor.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.580
When we increased x from
0 to 1, we increased y

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.300
by a factor of 1.5.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.650
We multiplied 1.5 times
120 to get 180.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.470
When we increased x by 1 again,
once again, y increased

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.610
by a factor of 1.5.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.320
We multiplied 1.5 times 180.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.540
What I want to do in this video
is to kind of quickly

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.980
show you just going from the
basic definition of an

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.070
exponential function, why
this is the case.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.300
Why this works for exponential
functions.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.140
So let's just start with a
general exponential, y is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.120
equal to A times r to the x.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.050
And let's look at some x
values and then their

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.350
corresponding y values.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.990
These are my x values, those
are my y values over there.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.100
Now let's say that x is equal
to, let me just pick an

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.850
arbitrary number.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.980
Let's say that x
is equal to b.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.170
I haven't used that
variable yet.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.030
And what's y going
to be equal to?

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.840
It's going to be equal to A
times r to the bth power.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.190
Now, let's increase x by 1.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.510
This would also work if you
increased x by really, just a

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.400
constant factor.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.470
But let's increase it by 1.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.380
So we're now going to look at
x is equal to b plus 1.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.240
Then y is going to be equal
to A times r to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.560
the b plus 1 power.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.780
Let's do it one more time.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.570
Let's increase x by 1.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.460
You get b plus 2.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.640
And now Ax-- sorry.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.460
Now y would be A times r
to the b plus 2 power.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.320
Now let's see what happens when
you take the ratio of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.270
each successive y terms that
correspond to the x terms when

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.060
you increase by a
constant factor.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.100
And notice, every time we
increased x by exactly 1.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.830
If this was 0, this
was 1, this is 2.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.360
If this is negative 5, this
would be negative 4, this be

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.759
negative 3.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.090
So let's see what happens
with our y.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.000
So over here, if we look at the
factor that y changed by,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.070
we could just divide Ar to the
b plus 1 by Ar to the b and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.220
what do we get?

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.460
Well you might already recognize
you could use

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.690
straight up exponent
rules right here.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.270
The A's cancel out and then this
is going to be equal to r

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.870
to the b plus 1 minus b.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.810
Same base.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.000
You're taking the quotient.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.830
You subtract exponents.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.200
So this is just going
to be equal to r.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.820
Let's see what happens when
we go from here to here.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.180
Once again, take the y value
when x is equal to b plus 2,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.940
so Ar to the b plus 2.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.590
Divide it by the previous
y value.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.450
Divide it by Ar to
the b plus 1.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:20.200
These cancel out and we're left
with r to the b plus 2

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.370
minus b plus 1, which is equal
to r to the b plus 2

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.540
minus b minus 1.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.580
These cancel out.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.790
2 minus 1.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.130
Once again, you're
just left with r.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.870
So hopefully that satisfies any
curiosity you might have

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.060
had of why you're able to use
that as the way to evaluate

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.830
whether this data
was exponential.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.050
Why we're able to just say,
hey, let's take this term

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.790
divided by the previous term
and see what number we get.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.140
This term divided by that term
and if we get the same number

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.760
every time, we're dealing with
an exponential function.
