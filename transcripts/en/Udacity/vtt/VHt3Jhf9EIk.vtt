00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.090
Now it's true, there really is no right or wrong

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.939
answer to this question. This is a real life decision

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.060
that you'd have to make as a director of clinical

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.040
operations. Now after speaking with the director of clinical operations that

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.010
we interviewed. She said that she would probably go with

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.830
the first answer. And she said that the reason is

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.220
because the information is incredibly valuable. And she could add

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.750
an early safety review to the very beginning of the study

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.270
so that as soon as they begin to

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.230
notice anything that might be significant or severe,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.250
they could get the person off the drug.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.080
However, she also mentioned that you could pick

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.320
the second answer and probably find a good

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.960
justification for that too. Which one did you

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.660
pick? Why don't you go to the forums and see what your class mates think too.
