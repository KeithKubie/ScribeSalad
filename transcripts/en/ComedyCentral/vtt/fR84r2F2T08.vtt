00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.804
No, don't, I'm not fancy,
I'm disgusting.

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:05.706
I went to the bathroom,
and then--

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:07.875
and then I was
going to the bathroom,

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.477
and then a condom
fell out of me.

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.314
Did you pee it
or poop it?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.983
I peed it.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.184
Why'd you immediately
go there?

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.352
I didn't poop
it, dude.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.520
Hey, it's 2014.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.154
Anal's on the menu.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.890
I can't even believe that,
like, I didn't notice it.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.825
I was, like, very present,
you know?

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.226
I don't know how
he didn't notice it.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.494
It happens
to everybody.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.830
Has it happened to you?
No.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.766
(sighs)
Everything I've done
has happened to you.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.201
Not yet is what
I meant to say.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.670
So what? You're a nasty
bitch, who cares?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.505
All right.
(sighs)
Let's go get high,

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.674
and then we can enjoy this
clams Filipino even more.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.343
Okay.
That's a good idea.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.513
Hi, would you mind
making sure

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.582
they don't
take those clams?

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:49.883
Thank you.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.721
You know, I know you're
in your head, but...

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.057
this birthday
is a maje improvement

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.525
from last year's.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.960
(inhales)
Yeah, well,
I shouldn't have tried

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.595
to throw myself
a surprise party.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.697
You should have tried.
It was a mistake.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.066
Hi.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.502
Want a hit?

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:12.940
Thanks for the food.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.709
It's amazingly
delicious.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:16.743
I don't prepare
the food.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.245
I just, uh,
clear the plates.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.214
Yeah, but... you know.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.284
You know what I've been
thinking about?

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.652
Every animal,

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.422
from every movie
we've loved as a kid,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:29.556
probably dead.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.592
Think about it.
Air Bud: dead.

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:34.228
All 101 Dalmatians
are probably dead.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:35.229
(shudders)

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.097
I guess Babe
from "Babe" is dead.

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.833
Ooh, we could have
eaten Babe tonight.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:40.968
Well, maybe not.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.402
Pigs live longer
than dogs.

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:44.471
I think they might live
longer than humans?

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.006
I think
that's turtles.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:49.343
Tramp, from
"Lady and the Tramp."

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.111
(laughing)

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:53.747
Tramp's a cartoon.

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:56.783
I know that.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:58.418
She was for real.
I know that it was a cartoon.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:00.654
Uh, I gotta go,
but thanks.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:01.822
No worries.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.390
Hey, and I know you
didn't make the food,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.324
but you will one day.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.395
Uh... thanks.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.798
You know, that Tramp was
my first sexual crush.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.669
He was hot. He was like
a spunky bad boy.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.605
You know who
was mine? Stimpy.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.807
Stimpy from
"Ren and Stimpy"?

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:23.177
Yeah, I feel like he has
a similar build to Lincoln.

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.112
Huh.
