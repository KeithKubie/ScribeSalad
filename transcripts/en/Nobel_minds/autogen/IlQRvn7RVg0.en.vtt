as far as science is concerned I don't

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
as far as science is concerned I don't
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080

think about the big questions at all I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
think about the big questions at all I
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.550
think about the big questions at all I
just think about the things that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
just think about the things that
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.760
just think about the things that
interests me and even if they're not

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
interests me and even if they're not
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.010
interests me and even if they're not
very exciting or don't appear very

very exciting or don't appear very
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.609
very exciting or don't appear very
exciting but interest me I followed them

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
exciting but interest me I followed them
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.070
exciting but interest me I followed them
through and in fact the discovery of c60

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
through and in fact the discovery of c60
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.550
through and in fact the discovery of c60
was such a problem it wasn't the most

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
was such a problem it wasn't the most
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.280
was such a problem it wasn't the most
exciting problem I could think of it was

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
exciting problem I could think of it was
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.580
exciting problem I could think of it was
interesting for me but it turned up this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
interesting for me but it turned up this
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.999
interesting for me but it turned up this
big surprise and so the lesson that I've

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
big surprise and so the lesson that I've
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.630
big surprise and so the lesson that I've
learned all through my life is that just

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
learned all through my life is that just
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910
learned all through my life is that just
look at things that interest you and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
look at things that interest you and
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.670
look at things that interest you and
just sometimes they may may turn out to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680
just sometimes they may may turn out to
 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.200
just sometimes they may may turn out to
be incredibly fascinating
