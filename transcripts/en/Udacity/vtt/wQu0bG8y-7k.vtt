00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.176
We can put all of our knowledge together about radicals, factors, variables and

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:09.300
even exponents to simplify something like this. Try simplifying each of these

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.600
cube roots and then see if you can subtract the radicals. Be sure that if you

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.655
pull out any factor, you multiply it by what's out in front. This one's pretty

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.750
tough so take your time on it and feel free to play around with the math. Good

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.623
luck.
