00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.400
From the director of--

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.920
Oh, God, not him again...

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.160
comes Will Smith’s biggest mistake since
turning down The Matrix.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160
After Earth.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.340
Prepare for Shyamalan's signature slow pace
and joyless tone,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.540
but now with 10x as much mumbo-jumbo.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.829
"I detected graviton vibrations in the hull."

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.829
"How"

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.730
"Graviton buildup could be a precursor to
mass expansion."

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.390
"Mass expansion is one in a million."

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.470
"The pull of our own graviton weight could
set the thing off."

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.880
Get ready for the story of a talented celebrity
Dad and his less talented bratty kid...

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.330
"I am dedicated, have studied, and consistently
display conduct becoming of a ranger, sir!"

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.640
who takes on a challenge he's not ready for.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.030
"And you think I'm a coward?!"

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.130
"You're wrong!"

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.780
Gee, wonder where they got that idea.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.210
Watch as Will Smith, one of the world’s
most charismatic actors, plays a man with

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.210
no charisma

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.030
"What do you think you should have done?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.299
Because really, that is all that matters."

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.030
named Cypher Raige.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.470
Haha, very funny guys, what’s his real name?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.520
“General Cypher Raige”

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.800
"Of the prime commander Cypher Raige”

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.640
“General Cypher Raige”

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.200
You’ve got to be kidding me.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.659
Watch as Cypher Raige and his son Kitai Raige?

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.240
Dramatize what it’s like to live in the
Smith household.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.630
"I'm going to my room."

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.110
"Are you asking me or telling me?"

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.650
"May I go to my room, sir?"

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.650
“DENIED!

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.650
SIT DOWN!”

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.220
But when father and son are forced to bond,
disaster strikes as they crash on a terrifying

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.680
version of after Earth...

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.900
"Warning: This planet has been declared unfit
for human habitation."

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.240
Full of non-threats like

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.400
Monkeys

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.490
Eagles

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.729
Whales

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.729
Bugs

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.030
Snakes

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.030
Foliage

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.060
And the cold

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.770
“Every thing on this planet has evolved
to kill humans."

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.400
Has it though?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.130
Because it kinda looks like before Earth to
me.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.409
So take a knee...

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.689
"Take a knee."

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.410
"Take a knee!"

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.410
"Take a knee, cadet!"

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.410
"Take a knee."

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.180
And watch a movie of Will Smith watching a
movie of Jaden Smith

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.099
"I will see everything you see”

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.099
in the most blatant example of Hollywood nepotism
since the 3rd generation of Wayan’s Brothers.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.090
“My suit turned black.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.659
I like it but I think it’s something bad."

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.700
You like it but you think it’s something
bad?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.579
"I like it but I think it’s something bad."

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.890
Did someone actually read this before they
made it a movie?

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.890
You know what?

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.129
I can’t do this.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.340
This movie is too dumb on too many levels.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.340
I mean...

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.340
Why does everything on Earth freeze at night?

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.370
Wouldn’t that kill all the greenery?

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.370
And the animals?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.549
Speaking of animals, why does that eagle adopt
Jaden as one of its young, then commit eagle

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.239
suicide to save him from the cold?

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.519
It hasn’t figured out how to live in the
cold over the last thousand years of being

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.739
an eagle?

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.739
Seriously?

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.260
We traveled all across the galaxy to stay
on EARTH?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260
And they didn’t even make earth COOL?

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Where are the buildings?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.260
The survivors?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Anything?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.199
God this movie is SO
stupid!

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.199
Look I gotta get out of here.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.199
It’s just not worth it.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.819
You guys don’t have to pay me for this one.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.290
Just call me next week for Walking Dead.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.049
“That sucked."

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.180
"That is correct."

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.559
Um...

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:31.550
I don't think he's coming back.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.980
What should I do?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:44.189
Just read this?
