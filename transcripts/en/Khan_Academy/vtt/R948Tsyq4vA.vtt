00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.740
Find the slope of the
line in the graph.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.020
And just as a bit of a review,
slope is just telling us how

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.490
steep a line is.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:19.850
And the best way to view it,
slope is equal to change in y

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.510
over change in x.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.080
And for a line, this will
always be constant.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.940
And sometimes you might see it
written like this: you might

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.590
see this triangle, that's a
capital delta, that means

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.730
change in, change in
y over change in x.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.560
That's just a fancy way
of saying change in y

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.740
over change in x.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.760
So let's see what this change
in y is for any change in x.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.010
So let's start at some point
that seems pretty reasonable

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.810
to read from this table right
here, from this graph.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.560
So let's see, we're starting
here-- let me do it in a more

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.160
vibrant color-- so let's
say we start at

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.520
that point right there.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.350
And we want to go to another
point that's pretty

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.379
straightforward to read,
so we can move to

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.450
that point right there.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.340
We could literally pick any
two points on this line.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.490
I'm just picking ones that are
nice integer coordinates, so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.610
it's easy to read.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.510
So what is the change in y and
what is the change in x?

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.540
So first let's look at
the change in x.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.750
So if we go from there
to there, what is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510
the change in x?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.660
My change in x is
equal to what?

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.340
Well, I can just count it out.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.480
I went 1 steps, 2
steps, 3 steps.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.620
My change in x is 3.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.400
And you could even see
it from the x values.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.060
If I go from negative 3
to 0, I went up by 3.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.105
So my change in x is 3.

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:48.200
So let me write this, change in
x, delta x is equal to 3.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.860
And what's my change in y?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.200
Well, my change in y, I'm going
from negative 3 up to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.580
negative 1, or you could
just say 1, 2.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.260
So my change in y, is
equal to positive 2.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.360
So let me write that down.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.710
Change in y is equal to 2.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.450
So what is my change in
y for a change in x?

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.560
Well, when my change in x was
3, my change in y is 2.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.870
So this is my slope.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.490
And one thing I want to do, I
want to show you that I could

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.910
have really picked any
two points here.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.670
Let's say I didn't pick-- let me
clear this out-- let's say

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.970
I didn't pick those two points,
let me pick some other

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.700
points, and I'll even go in
a different direction.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.510
I want to show you that you're
going to get the same answer.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.440
Let's say I've used this as my
starting point, and I want to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.300
go all the way over there.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.640
Well, let's think about the
change in y first. So the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.960
change in y, I'm going down
by how many units?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.490
1, 2, 3, 4 units, so my change
in y, in this example, is

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.000
negative 4.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.710
I went from 1 to negative
3, that's negative 4.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.400
That's my change in y.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.950
Change in y is equal
to negative 4.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.820
Now what is my change in x?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.320
Well I'm going from this point,
or from this x value,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.020
all the way-- let me do that in
a different color-- all the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.080
way back like this.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.880
So I'm going to the left, so
it's going to be a negative

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.060
change in x, and I went 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 units back.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.845
So my change in x is equal
to negative 6.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.470
And you can even see I started
it at x is equal to 3, and I

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.910
went all the way to x is
equal to negative 3.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.430
That's a change of negative 6.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.050
I went 6 to the left, or
a change of negative 6.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.270
So what is my change in
y over change in x?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.670
My change in y over change in x
is equal to negative 4 over

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.790
negative 6.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.370
The negatives cancel out
and what's 4 over 6?

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.380
Well, that's just 2 over 3.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.610
So it's the same value, you just
have to be consistent.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.200
If this is my start point,
I went down 4, and

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.930
then I went back 6.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.330
Negative 4 over negative 6.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.800
If I viewed this as my starting
point, I could say

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.040
that I went up 4, so it would
be a change in y would be 4,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.480
and then my change
in x would be 6.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.640
And either way, once again,
change in y over change in x

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.370
is going to be 4 over 6, 2/3.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.440
So no matter which point you
choose, as long as you kind of

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.570
think about it in a consistent
way, you're going to get the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.870
same value for slope.
