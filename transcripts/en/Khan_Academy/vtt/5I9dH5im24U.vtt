00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
 

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.460
In the last video, we talked
about how humans, over time,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.850
have gotten better and better
at getting more calories out

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.660
of a given unit of land.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.600
And one thing I do
want to emphasize,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.760
in the last video, these
numbers that I came up

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.650
with-- I picked these numbers
to make the math fairly simple--

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.280
and to give you
the general idea.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.220
I don't want you to
think that the most

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.980
that a square kilometer
can support today

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.200
is exactly 1,000 people.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.840
It depends, hugely, on
what the land is like.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.630
How much of the land you're
actually using for agriculture.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.170
What crops you're
planting, et cetera.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.530
How the people are living.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.230
How many calories they need.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.949
The whole point
of the last video

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.990
was just to give you a
framework that, wow, there

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.360
is this upper bound based on how
much productivity you actually

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.152
get from the land.

00:00:46.152 --> 00:00:48.360
Now, what we want to think
about in this video-- that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630
was-- the last video was
this axis right here,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.450
getting more and
more out of the land.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.520
What I want to think about in
this video is, how did humans,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.170
through different
technologies, how

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.040
did we get by doing less
and less of the labor

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.400
for getting those
calories out of the land?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.995
Obviously, you just don't have
land and thing spontaneously

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.120
grow-- well, I guess that
would happen in the wild.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.620
But if you're doing
agriculture, you

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.590
need to put some
energy into the land.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.390
You've got to work the land.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.800
And so what we have
over here in this chart,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.280
and this chart is
derived from information

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.450
from this book right over here.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.610
This is Energy and Society.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.490
And what we want
to think about here

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.450
is the different
ways that humans

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.850
have gone about to till soil.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.320
So we're not even going to
think about the total process

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.530
or the total energy required
to grow a certain crop.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.060
What we're just going
to focus is one step

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.030
of the agricultural process.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.930
And that is tilling the soil.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.220
And in case you're like
me and you have never

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.010
worked on a farm-- which,
that's one thing I would like

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.830
to change one day is actually
go through that process--

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.700
but tilling the soil is
kind of churning it up.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.840
So you get the nutrients
from the bottom layers

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.530
to the surface.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.890
You bury all of the remains
from the last harvest.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.740
You bury all of the
weeds so that they die.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.406
And you also get
air in the soil.

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:07.030
What it does is it
essentially prepares

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.880
the soil for the next
agricultural cycle.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.920
So it's a process
that humans have

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.649
been doing since antiquity.

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.190
And what I want to
do, in this video,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.220
is think about the
different ways to do it.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.929
And how much energy
is required to do it.

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.178
And we're going to think
about the energy in two ways.

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:24.150
How much of that energy
comes from humans?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.970
And how much of
that energy comes

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.350
from things other than humans?

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.680
So just as an example, when
we talk about human power,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.420
we're talking about
someone literally

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.270
hand-plowing this field.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.500
So this woman right
over here is literally--

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.690
she has this little cart that's
digging up the soil behind her.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.440
When we talk about
oxen power, we're

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.510
talking about the oxen
doing most of the work.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.620
They're the ones dragging
this plough which

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.320
is digging up all of the soil.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.210
And this gentleman has
to be there to supervise.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.890
But this still is
fairly intense labor

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.720
that this gentleman is
doing right over here.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.462
And then, when we
talk about tractors,

00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:02.170
we're talking about
a scenario like this.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.510
Where the tractor is doing most
of the work of actually digging

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.230
up, dragging this
plow behind it,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.510
and digging up all of the soil.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.744
And from this book
right over here,

00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:13.160
that's where we
got these numbers.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.951
I'll tell you which
numbers I got from them

00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.030
and which numbers I reasoned
through, because I wasn't fully

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.010
comfortable with the
numbers that they had.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.790
But these are their numbers.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.270
That, if you are human power,
to till one hectare of soil,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.910
it'll take 400 hours.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.960
Oxen power-- and this
should be a pair not a pari.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.570
That should be a pair
of oxen, 65 hours.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.910
A 6-horsepower
tractor, 25 hours.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.344
A 50-horsepower
tractor, four hours.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:40.760
And in case you
all are wondering,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.070
what is a hectare of soil, it
is literally a plot of land.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.834
A hectare of soil.

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:47.500
Let me write it.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.250
A hectare of land
is a plot of land

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.590
that is 100 meters
by 100 meters.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.190
And it's roughly equal to 2 1/2
acres, not exactly 2 1/2 acres.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.560
It's like 2.4.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.950
I think 2.47 something,
but roughly 2 1/2 acres.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.820
So we're just thinking about
how many hours to essentially

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.767
dig up all the soil for plot
of land 100 by 100 meters.

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.350
So what we have over
here, so clearly,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.829
human takes a lot longer.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.700
Oxen, they can do a
little bit faster.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.540
6-horsepower
tractor, even faster.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.040
A 50-horsepower tractor,
very powerful tractor,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.900
even faster than that.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.100
Now, this column right
over here is the amount

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.020
of energy required to
actually produce and maintain

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.590
the machinery used.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.430
So this is a very
unintuitive thing.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.170
Whenever you think about--
for example, whenever

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.790
you think about the
amount of energy

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.140
to plow this land over
here, you tend to think, OK.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.990
Well, this individual
is going to have

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.445
to expend a lot of her energy.

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:53.570
You don't think about the
amount of energy required

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.640
to actually maintain the tool.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.110
To one, build the tool that
she's using, in this case,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.940
a hand plow.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.650
And then, to maintain
that as she does it.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.410
And so this estimate-- and I
got these two from these fellows

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.440
right over here, or, actually,
one of them might be a gal.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.990
But it's about
6,000 kilocalories.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.210
And this is k.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.740
This is kilocalories
for lowercase c.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.220
And one thing I want
to emphasize here,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.060
one kcal is equal to, is the
same thing as one calorie

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.950
with a capital C, which
is the same thing as 1,000

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.820
calories with a lowercase c.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.180
And we talked about
this in the last video.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.240
But when people talk
about food calories,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.394
they're really talking about
a calorie with a capital C.

00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:41.560
Or you could say they're
talking about kilocalories.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.450
So your candy bar,
200 calories, they're

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.281
talking about this
right over here.

00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:47.780
In chemistry class, when you
talk about the amount of energy

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.520
to raise a gram of water
one degree Celsius,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.550
you're talking about
these calories here.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.150
So in all of these numbers in
this chart right over here,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.770
they are in either--
you can either

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.799
view as this unit, kcals,
kilocalories, or calories

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:02.340
with a capital C.
They're essentially

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.590
the same units that we
used in the last video.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.215
And these are the
same numbers that you

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:09.770
are used to from a dietary
calorie point of view.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.630
So for example, 6,000
calories, that's

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.780
about how much of a typical
male would expend in three days.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.830
So this is to maintain it over
the course of these 400 hours,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.890
in the case of the hand plow.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.130
And the total amount
of calories that

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.310
were needed to make
the plow divided

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.050
by the total number of hours.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.930
So whatever fraction of the
plow's life is being used here,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.520
you use that fraction
right over here

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.810
to put this 6,000 calories.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.410
But needless to say,
for at least the plow,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.980
for either the human
or the oxen scenario,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.965
this isn't a significant
amount of the total calories.

00:06:47.965 --> 00:06:49.590
So obviously, if
you're doing it either

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.570
with human or oxen power,
you're not using any gasoline.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.370
You're not using any petroleum.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.030
In all of these
scenarios, we're going

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.700
to assume that someone has
10 working hours in the day.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.920
And that right over
here, this is a measure

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.130
of how hard that
person's work is.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.250
And I estimated
these numbers here.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.340
They're slightly different than
what the original numbers were

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.490
in this book right over here.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.620
But we're saying, look.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.040
If you are actually walking
along using this hand plow,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.780
that is actually very,
very vigorous activity.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.580
So it is going to require
about 400 calories per hour

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.370
to do this type of activity.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.890
You do it over 10 hours.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.430
It's going to require
4,000 calories just

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.795
to do that over 10 hours.

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:34.795
And then, we're assuming
that there's some rest.

00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:36.750
That the rest of the day,
you're going to walk around.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.430
And maybe you're going to
cook dinner, eat breakfast.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.805
You're going to
sleep some of it.

00:07:39.805 --> 00:07:41.930
We're assuming that the
other 14 hours a day

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.270
are going to be at about
100 calories per hour.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.710
And so this is the total.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.820
If someone were to,
using this technique,

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.090
work for a total
of 10 hours, this

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.730
is how many calories they
would consume in the day.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.104
And you can see, this is
the most labor-intensive.

00:07:56.104 --> 00:07:57.770
So it looks like that
they would consume

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.880
the most calories per day.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.620
These two are the
least labor-intensive.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.578
You're sitting on a
tractor although that still

00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:06.270
requires more calories than
sleeping or watching TV,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.960
and so that's the number of
calories they would consume.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.460
Now, this right
over here-- and this

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.870
is the interesting
number, or one

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.850
of the really interesting
numbers-- based

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.540
on all of these
assumptions, this

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.330
is the total human
input in calories

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.180
to do this task, to till
this one hectare of soil.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.680
So over here, you're using
5,400 calories a day.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.103
If you're working
10 hours per day

00:08:28.103 --> 00:08:30.610
and it requires 400
total hours, you're

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.386
going to be working 40
days, 400 divided by 10.

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:38.470
40 days times 5,400
calories per day.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.190
It's going to take a human--
just the human part, not even

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.080
thinking about
the 6,000 calories

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.060
necessary to maintain and
make that plow-- the human

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.890
is going to spend to
216,000 calories to till,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.120
to plow that one
hectare of land.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.901
And if you add the other
6,000 in for the actual plow--

00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:59.900
and you could debate what
this number should be,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.210
but it's not a significant
number compared to this--

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.850
you get about 222,000
total calories.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.700
When you go to the
oxen situation,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.000
you're requiring fewer hours.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.790
And each hour, it requires
a little less calories.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.150
This is still labor-intensive,
but not as labor-intensive

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.440
as what this woman right
over here is doing.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.690
So on a daily basis, using
a little bit fewer calories.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.540
But since you're only
doing 6 1/2 days of this,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.840
65 hours divided by 10,
you've significantly reduced

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.830
the number of calories, the
total number of calories that

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.110
the human needs to
put into this task.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.140
Now, there still is
other energy being done.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.710
And now all of a sudden, the
oxen have gotten involved.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.780
And if you assume that each oxen
consumes about 20,000 calories

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.890
a day, and you have two of them.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.150
So 40,000 calories per
day just to feed the oxen.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.640
And you're going to do that for
6 1/2 days, 65 divided by 10,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.770
the oxen are going to consume
260,000 calories to do this

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.650
task.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.920
So the total energy input
here, now, has gone up.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.630
So this is an
interesting phenomenon

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.190
that is going on
right over here.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.370
What the human is
putting in, as we

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.760
get better and
better technology,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.190
goes down substantially.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.210
216,000 to 33,000, and
we'll see with the tractor

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.560
goes down even more.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.280
But the total energy, if you
include the amount of energy

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.930
that the oxen have to
put in, or if you include

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.110
the amount of energy
due to the gasoline that

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.110
has to be used for the tractor,
the total amount of energy

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.750
is going up to plow that field.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.624
But the human energy
goes down dramatically.

00:10:35.624 --> 00:10:37.540
Now, the last thing I
want to highlight here--

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.710
and these are where my numbers
depart a little bit, or fairly

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.680
significantly, from this
original study right over here,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.630
this original estimate--
is the machinery input

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.280
on the tractors.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.960
So if you look this up, and
you could Google search it,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.640
they have much
larger numbers here.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.806
But I did a little research.

00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:57.330
And it looks like, for
most petroleum-based,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.630
combustion-based engines
or vehicles, roughly 20%

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.270
of the total energy that's used
in fuel, 20% of that energy

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.900
is used to for the actual
production and maintenance

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.120
of that vehicle over its life.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.860
So what we did over
here is, we said, OK.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.850
For a 6-horsepower tractor--
I used their numbers--

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.040
where you're going to have
to use 25 hours to do it,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.070
it's going to use
this much petroleum,

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.170
assuming that it uses 23.5
liters of gas or petroleum

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.684
over 25 hours.

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.350
And then, I just took
20% of that number

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.080
for saying, well,
how much energy

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.460
had to be used to
maintain that vehicle

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.630
over that amount of time?

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.730
And if you think about what
fraction of this vehicle's life

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.490
that 25 hours
represents, that fraction

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.237
times the total amount of
energy required to produce that.

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:46.070
So remember, these
things are made of metal.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.890
They had to be made in furnaces.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.520
So just producing a vehicle
requires a lot of energy.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.180
And so this right
over here is 20%.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.470
And I just use
that rule of thumb

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.760
for most petroleum-based or
combustion-based vehicles.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.200
That 20% of the total
energy expenditure

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.950
over the course of
that vehicle's life

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.900
is roughly equal to
the amount of energy

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.660
used to produce that vehicle.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.170
But either way, you go
all the way over here.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.240
The human has to spend
less calories sitting

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.990
on the vehicle.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.170
So they spend less
calories per day.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.650
And then, the total human
input right over here,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.560
for the 6-horsepower tractor,
it's going to take them 2 1/2

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.550
days-- 25 hours at
10 hours a day--

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.200
is going to be 8,500 calories.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.300
But of course, you
have the petroleum used

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.640
and then some estimate
of the amount of energy

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.000
used to produce that tractor.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.480
And you're just taking the
fraction over that 25 hours.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.860
You're not taking
the entire life

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.420
of that 6-horsepower tractor.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.350
To produce a
6-horsepower tractor,

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.130
this number would be
much, much larger,

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.570
if you talked about the
total number of energy.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.600
We're just taking the
small fraction of its life

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.099
that we're using
it right over here.

00:12:54.099 --> 00:12:56.370
Same thing for the
50-horsepower tractor.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.750
But any way you look at
it, the human-- and this

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.230
is a really interesting thing.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.410
Humans, by going
from human power

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.530
all the way to a
50-horsepower tractor,

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.420
you're getting almost a
factor of 200 improvement,

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.310
in terms of how
little energy has

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.860
to be put in by the
human to till that land.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.900
But you actually get
a total increase,

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.030
if you factor in things like the
petroleum and then, definitely,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.700
the amount of energy to
actually produce that machine.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.150
So anyway, hopefully, you
found that interesting.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.820
I find this-- it's
something that you

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.050
don't think a lot about.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.030
How much energy input
has to be put in?

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.310
And oftentimes, we only think
about the human energy input.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.180
But we're not thinking about the
energy input from other things,

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.710
like oxen.
