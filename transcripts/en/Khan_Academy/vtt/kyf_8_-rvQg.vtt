00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.620
- My name is Olivia Abtahi.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.870
I'm 30 years old.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm a film director,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.510
and I make approximately $80,000 a year.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.940
I currently work at a video
production company here

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.680
in Colorado called Mightier.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.740
I do a range of things.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.990
Sometimes I'm directing.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.490
Sometimes I'm editing.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.730
Other times, I'm creating
storyboards or scripts

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.960
or just coming up with
concepts for clients,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.020
and then a lot of it is
just meeting with clients,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.290
talking to them, making
sure everything's on track

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.180
and that we're getting their vision right.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.900
Yeah, I think when you're
in a small business,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.510
you kind of have to wear a ton of hats.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.840
It's not one of those jobs
where everything is very siloed,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.110
and you have just one job,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.500
and that's what you have the focus on.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.850
I think I'm lucky in that I
get to touch a lot of things

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.780
at work because if I can
set up the storyboard

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.850
for success, that way when
I'm on set later, you know,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.740
I'm so grateful to be
Olivia of two months ago

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.080
where I set myself up for success,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.500
and then, you know, going
into post production, as well,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.120
making sure I'm slating in properly,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.050
so just being thorough in every stage,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.760
because there's a very good
chance I'll have to deal

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.890
with it later.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.430
I have had 10 internships,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.540
and I have been working in
this industry for 10 years,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990
and this is now my first full paying job

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.780
where I actually have benefits and I know

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.900
when my next paycheck is going to come in.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.580
I cannot even tell you
the amount of thankless,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.500
grubby jobs I have done
to get to where I am now,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.350
and I think it's important to remember

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.060
that whoever you're working for or,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.010
if you're just starting
out, the person whose maybe

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.240
in charge of your project,
has also paid those same dues.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020
The people who might be a little
higher up than you have had

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.520
a lot of experience doing these things,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
and it's important to
just learn from them,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.800
and instead of talking so much,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.280
just remember to listen
first and foremost.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.460
My long-term goals are to get signed

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160
with a larger production company

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.040
where I am just working
whenever I win a bid,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.870
and that would mean
probably working less hours,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.470
but the stakes are so much higher

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.610
because that's maybe my
only job for the month,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.380
and then my goal is to
have a job like that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.470
where I am may be working one

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.180
out of every four weeks a month,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.200
that lets me focus on my own projects.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.560
My ultimate plan is to take
all of these work opportunities

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.730
and positions to get
better at being a director

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.070
and alternately create
my first feature film.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.450
If you are interested in
being a film director,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.370
then my first piece of advice
is going to be to just shoot,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.840
just shoot your own movies.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.310
There is no reason why
you can't make a film

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.890
with the tools that you have.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.970
There are so many wonderful
films now being shot

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.380
on an iPhone,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.990
and if you have an
iPhone or a smart phone,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.090
that means you have what
it takes, equipment wise,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.250
to make a feature film.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.270
So grab your friends.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.490
You know, find a weekend,
and just make stuff happen

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.380
because you won't learn
as much about directing

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.670
from a book or from a website
as you will than just being

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.670
on a shoot and trying to
make your dream come true.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.690
I will say some of the pitfalls, though,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.340
are that it's hard to get validation.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.530
It's hard to get recognition

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.540
because there are so many
other filmmakers out there,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.830
and you really just have
to find your own voice.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.000
In the beginning, you might be
trying to copy other artists,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.520
and like, that's understandable

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.820
because you're trying to
figure out your style,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.780
but I would say find your voice.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.440
Find the movie that you want to watch,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.513
and make sure that you're
the one who makes it.
