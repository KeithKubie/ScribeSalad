00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.360
Bipin's bringing on what
is a model of a really amazing

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.970
application of atomic time.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.080
This is a model of the
global positioning system.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.290
It consists of 24 satellites
constantly orbiting the earth,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.090
such that wherever
you are on the earth,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.040
you have four
satellites above you.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.262
Now, each of these satellites
contains an atomic clock.

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:33.470
And they're all synchronised.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.950
So if you were to measure
the time signals given out

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.500
by the four satellites
that are nearest you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.220
and compare the time
taken for that signal

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.430
to reach you from
these four satellites,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.050
very much like in the story
of navigation of Harrison,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.100
you could use time to
actually measure and determine

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.129
your position on the Earth.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.650
And that's exactly what one
of these receivers does.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.370
It picks up the signal from
these atomic clocks orbiting

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.060
the earth in the satellites.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.261
Now Elliah
is up on the roof.

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:18.510
Can you hear me, Elliah

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.210
I can, Neil.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.710
Great.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.810
What have you got?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.790
Well, I've got a GPS
receiver here in my hands.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.706
And you can see on the
display it's telling me

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:26.820
my position at the moment.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
Is 51 degrees 30.571
minutes north of the equator

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.540
and 8 degrees 0.564
west of Greenwich.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.430
Can you show us how
many satellites?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.440
Yes, I've got other
screens on here, which

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.135
also show us where we are.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:45.010
You see it's got a map
of the world built-in.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
So it's telling us we're
somewhere near Westminster.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.410
And this screen tells
us we're picking up

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.040
signals from six satellites.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.380
Now, Elliah, can
you move across the roof?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.030
So we can actually
see the change.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.330
And this change is
going to be very small.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.800
But the change in the
readings on the receiver.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.550
Let's try that.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.980
Yes, Neil.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.354
I think you can
see quite clearly

00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:19.980
that the upper display is now
saying 0.579 degrees north.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.310
Before it was 0.570.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.490
So only that tiny movement
across the roof this

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.272
has picked up.

00:02:24.272 --> 00:02:25.230
Well, that's wonderful.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.230
Thank you very much,
Elliah. In fact,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.320
this positioning, this ability
to detect position on the Earth

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.234
has an enormous number
of applications.

00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:38.400
You may have seen some of
the applications discussed

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.480
for motorists.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.820
But also applications
for sight-disabled people

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.780
and even probably for some
more surprising customers.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.570
Sheep are big purchasers
of GPS systems.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.650
In fact, not the sheep
themselves, of course,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.410
but the farmer has
to look after them.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.550
Because imagine.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.120
We're up in the hills.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.265
It's raining.

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:11.570
Got lots of sheep.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.950
They're all over the place.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.630
You don't really want to be
out looking where they are.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.950
And your dog refuses to go.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.180
So just strap one of
these receivers to one

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.690
of the backs of the sheep.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.120
Sit at home.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.990
A cup of tea.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.830
And you monitor the
position of the sheep.
