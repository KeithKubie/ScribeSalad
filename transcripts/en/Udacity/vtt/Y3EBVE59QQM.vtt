00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's take a step back and see what you have learned so far.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And the way we're going to organize this is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that we're going to draw pictures of so-called complexity classes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And a complexity class is basically a collection of problems

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that can be solved under given constraints or resources.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So you take a bunch of problems,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you introduce a constraint

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
such as the one we have seen with NP

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where we said must be solvable in non-deterministic polynomial time,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then you sort problems.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Some problems will fall into the complexity class,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
other problems will basically just fall outside of the complexity class.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And of course you already know some complexity classes very well.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So let's do a little warm-up quiz here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So you already know the class P from the previous units.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I just want you to quickly fill in if the complexity class P

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is the class of all problems that can be solved in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
polynomial or exponential time

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
on a deterministic or non-deterministic RAM.
