00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.730
Now that you have some idea of the tools you have to work with, I want to go

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.190
back to the three main pillars of optimizing performance

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.660
that Colt mentioned, Network, Compute, and Render. Let's start

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.000
by taking a look at Network. The first

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.340
question we have to ask is, what aspects of

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.980
network usage should we be targeting for optimization? The

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.920
number of bytes transferred? How often we send requests?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460
The power consumption of the network stack, or

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.150
the maximum number of TCP connections we use.
