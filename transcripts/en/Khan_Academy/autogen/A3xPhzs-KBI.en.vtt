00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.470
 Let us solve some of the problems of complex variations, and these 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.450
 Variables are more than one group 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.060
 Restrictions 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.020
 You'll see what I'm talking about quickly 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.110
 If my first issue is -5 &lt; 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.300
 = x - 4 &lt;= 13 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.640
 If we have my group, the group is limited to x 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.426
 Which achieve these equations 

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:31.270
 x - 4 must be greater than or equal to -5 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.240
 And x - 4 must be less than or equal to 13 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.180
 So we can rewrite this composite variant as follows 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:49.040
 -5 &lt;= x - 4, and x 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.800
 - 4 &lt;= 13 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.990
 And then we can solve each one individually, then that 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.220
 We must remember that these "and" exist to think about 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.069
 Set the solution because it should be something that accomplishes these 

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.200
 Equation and equation 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.660
 So let's solve each other separately 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.430
 If these, we can add 4 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.680
 For both ends of equation 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 In the left side we have -5 + 4 = -1 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.120
 -1 &lt;= x, is not it? 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.850
 These 4 are deleted from here and we have x left 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.620
 On the right side 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.120
 If the left side, ie this part, simplifies to x 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.780
 &gt; = -1, or -1 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.280
 &lt;= x 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.580
 If we can also write it like this 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.110
 x&gt; = -1 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 Both are equal 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800
 I just reversed the sides 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.506
 Now let's do the other condition in green 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.910
 Let us add 4 to the ends of this equation 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.330
 In the left side, we have only x 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.380
 Then in the right hand we have 13+ 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.840
 14, ie 17 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.800
 If we get x &lt;= 17 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.970
 If our two conditions are x&gt; = 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.310
 -1 and x &lt;= 1 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.460
 If we can write it again 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.700
 Mixed vehicle if we want it 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.470
 We can say that the set solution, is that x should be less 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.950
 Of or equal to 17 and greater than or equal to 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.550
 -1 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.750
 You must check both of these conditions 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.676
 So how will this look on the setup line? 

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:46.250
 Let's put the line up here 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.590
 We assume that this is the 17th 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.090
 Perhaps this is 18 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.040
 We keep going 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.180
 Maybe this is 0 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.620
 I'm clearly jumping from the numbers in the middle 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.650
 Then we have -1 here, maybe this 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.920
 2 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.630
 If x&gt; = -1, so 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.610
 We will start from -1 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.000
 We will surround it with a circle because we have bigger than 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.680
 Or equal to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.440
 x is bigger than that, but it should be less 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.580
 Of or equal to 17 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.170
 If it can equal 17 or less than 17 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.650
 This is the solution set, it's all about 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.710
 I shaded it orange 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.850
 If you want to write it in a period format, it will 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.030
 X is between -1 and 17, and it can also be equal 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.120
 -1, so we put the arc, and 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.510
 Can be equal to 17 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.350
 If this is the period of these 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.330
 Differentiated composite 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.580
 Let's solve one another 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.980
 Let me put a good issue here 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.620
 Suppose we have -12 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.640
 I will change the matter a bit about 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.270
 Which I found here 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.230
 -12 &lt;- 5x &lt; 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.230
 = 7 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.950
 I want to solve a matter containing less than 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.630
 Less than or equal to 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.709
 The issue in the book I am browsing contains 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.600
 It's an equal sign here, but I want to remove it deliberately 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.500
 Because I want to make it clear to you when we have it 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.390
 Hybrid mode, ie when we have both symbols 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.310
 First, we can separate these into two normal variations 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.940
 We have these disparate here 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.530
 We know that -12 must be less than 2 - 5x 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.230
 That must be achieved, and - let me write it down 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.810
 In another color - these disparities also have to be achieved 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.740
 2 - 5x must be less than 7 and larger than 12, less 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.530
 Of or equal to 7 and greater than -12, if and 2 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.140
 - 5x must be less than or equal to 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.290
 So let's just solve this way we used to solve everything 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.050
 Let's put this 2 on the left side 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.730
 So let's subtract 2 from both ends of this equation 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.500
 If we subtract 2 from both ends of this equation, the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.560
 The left side becomes -14 &lt; 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.830
 - These are deleted - &lt;-5x 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.140
 Now let's divide both sides on -5 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.360
 Remember, when we multiply or divide on 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.140
 The negative number, it is reversed, is different 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.880
 If we divide both sides on -5, we will get 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.980
 -14 / -5, and we have x on the right side 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.140
 If we divide it by -5, this is reversed 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.920
 From the signal less than to the greater than 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.560
 The negative signals are deleted, and we get 14/5&gt; 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.580
 x, or x &lt;14/5, which is - what is this? 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.380
 This is 4/5 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.320
 x &lt;2 4/5 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.090
 You have written this incorrect fraction in a composite number 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.620
 Now let's deal with the other limitation 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.630
 Here in purple 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.210
 Let's subtract 2 from both ends of this equation 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.800
 As we did before 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.910
 In fact, you can deal with them together, but it will 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.770
 It is confusing 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.360
 In order to avoid unintended mistakes, I urge you to separate them 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.650
 in this way 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.300
 If we subtract 2 from both ends of the equation 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.680
 The left side becomes -5x 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.100
 On the right side, we have less than or equal to 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.620
 The right side becomes 7 - 2, which becomes 5 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.780
 Now, divide both sides on -5 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.370
 On the left side we get x 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.450
 In the right hand side, 5 -5 -5 = 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.600
 -1 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.440
 Since we divided the negative number, we will reflect 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.380
 Differentiated 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.310
 It will be less than or equal to, bigger 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.610
 Of or equal to 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.820
 If it becomes our constraint 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.510
 x &lt;2 4/5, and x&gt; 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.720
 = -1 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.600
 So we can write it like this 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.300
 x&gt; = -1, hence this 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.390
 The limit will be the least in period, and x 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.940
 &lt;2 4/5 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.590
 And note, it is not less than or equal to 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.510
 That's why I wanted to make it clear to you, that we have arcs 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.810
 Here it can not equal 2 4/5 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.580
 x must be less than 2 4/5 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.502
 Or we could write that way 

00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:37.010
 x should be less than 2 4/5, these are 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.540
 Differentiated, reverse sides, must be 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.670
 Greater than or equal to -1 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.210
 If these two sentences are equal 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.040
 And if you want to draw it on the line of preparation 

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.490
 It will look like this 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:08:00.410
 If we have -1, 2/4 here 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.850
 Clearly we have a set in the middle 

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.580
 Maybe, you know, zero is here 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.640
 Must be greater than or equal to -1, if possible 

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.100
 It equals -1 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.220
 It will be bigger than -1, but also 

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.700
 Must be less than 2 4/5 

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.780
 So we can not include 2 4/5 here 

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.100
 It can not equal 2 4/5, if it can only be less 

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.590
 Of, so we put a blank circle around 2 4/5 and then 

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.960
 We fill everything down, down to 

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.580
 -1, and include -1 because we have a lower signal than 

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.120
 Or equal to these 

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.820
 If the last two issues you resolved were "and" 

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.419
 We have to follow all of this video 

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.025
 Now let's solve an issue that contains "or" 

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.620
 Let's assume that I have these variants 

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:49.910
 Suppose I was given - let's assume that 4x - 1 

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:58.770
 &gt; = 7, or that is 9x / 2 

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.290
 &lt;3 

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.460
 If now when we say "or", and x that can achieve these 

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.400
 Is the x that achieves any of these equations 

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.250
 In the previous few presentations or in previous issues, we had 

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.770
 Find the x values ​​that make up each of these equations 

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.260
 This matter is a little simpler 

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.780
 They only have to check one of the two 

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.140
 Let 's find a set of solutions for both 

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.680
 These and then find their unity 

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.980
 Any compound, any things that are 

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.100
 Check any of them 

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.010
 If in these, any existing on the left, we can 

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.490
 We add 1 for both parties 

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.440
 We add 1 for both parties 

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.480
 The left side becomes 4x&gt; 

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.840
 = 7 + 1, ie 8 

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.120
 Divide both sides on 4 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.120
 We get x&gt; = 2 

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.790
 Or let us move on to these 

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.770
 Let us see, if we hit both ends of this equation with 2/9 

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.070
 What do we get? 

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.070
 If we hit both sides with 2/9, it is a positive number 

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.570
 So we do not have to do anything for these disparities 

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:06.760
 These are deleted, and we get x &lt;3 × 2/9 

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.610
 3/9 equals 1/3, if x must 

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.460
 Be less than 2/3 

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.280
 Or that x &lt;2/3 

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.840
 If this is a set solution 

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.240
 x&gt; = 2, or x &lt;2/3 

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.340
 this is interesting 

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.920
 Let me see the solution set on the setup line 

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.380
 If this is the setup line 

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:41.630
 Maybe this is the 0, this is the 1, this is 2, 3, maybe that is 

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.940
 -1 

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.910
 If x can be greater than or equal to 2 

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.960
 We can start - let me do this in a different color - 

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.320
 We can start from 2 here and it will be greater than or equal to 

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.690
 2, and thus include everything greater than or equal to 2 

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.530
 This is the condition here 

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.440
 Or that x can be less than 2/3 

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.120
 If 2/3 is almost here, is not it? 

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.680
 Those are 2/3 

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.850
 x can be less than 2/3 

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.150
 This is interesting 

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.490
 Because if we choose one of these numbers, you'll 

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.020
 Achieves this disparity 

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.840
 If we choose one of these numbers, you will achieve 

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.850
 Those disparate 

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.500
 If we have "and" here, you will not be here preparing 

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.420
 Check it out because it can not be both larger than 2 

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.630
 And less than 2/3 

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.020
 If the only way we get a set solution here is 

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.740
 Because there is "or" you can check one of these 

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.920
 The two 

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.480
 Anyway, I hope you found it fun
