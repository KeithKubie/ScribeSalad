00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.060
We can use this to now start
building response curves.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.610
So this was what we had in the last
slide, which basically had the log of

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.490
exposure, pixel values, and
these were the three different points.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.180
And we were able to trace them out
in equally, all three of them.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.930
Now assuming unit radiance for
each pixel,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.800
we basically can kind of start
making an interesting model here.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.850
So what we want to do now is take this
and start kind of figuring out how to

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.320
align them so
then they would have a uniform shape.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.590
So in essence what I took.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.610
The purple values and I want to be
able to shift the turquoise and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.240
the yellow to create a unique profile.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.000
And basically what that means is I'm
adjusting the radiances to open,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.810
to obtain a smooth response curve.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.350
So I take all three of them,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.730
I basically adjust them out a little bit
to create a nice, smooth response curve.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.880
Once I have this I have actually
gone far in trying to be able

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.710
to create an inverse G,
purely from there.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.530
Again, remember, G is basically
giving me this information.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.660
I want to be able to get intensity
values and come the other way.
