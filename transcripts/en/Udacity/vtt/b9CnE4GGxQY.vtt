The answer is x minus 1 times 3x plus 4. Recognizing that x minus 1 is a factor

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.795
that both of these terms had, definitely takes a little bit of outside the box

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:13.306
thinking. It is, however, in each term,multiplied by the other factors in the

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:17.578
term so it count a factor. Just to get your brain jogging for later on in the

00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:22.232
course, think about what would happen if you multiply all this out. You did this

00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:26.453
before of course, but just think about this answer and the connection with, what

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:29.018
this looks like when you distribute the terms.
