00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.860
The earliest known instances of fist fighting
as a type of sport date back to around 4000

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.830
– 3000 BC, but these historical fights don’t
resemble the boxing we know today.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.840
They seem to have leaned more toward the “anything
goes” method of unarmed fighting.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.349
The modern form of more regimented bouts didn’t
begin until the early 18th century.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.010
At this time, boxing matches had no mandated
boxing ring, no gloves, no referee, and no

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.710
scantily clad women announcing the next round.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.980
Spectators tended to crowd around the fighters
in a roughly circular ring, which may or may

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.829
not have been drawn out on the ground before
the match.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.640
In 1713, Sir Thomas Parkyns described a typical
match as including eye-gouging, choking, punching,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.120
head-butting and other such street fighting
tactics.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.789
This all changed when Jack Broughton developed
the first set of formalized rules for boxing

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.509
in 1743, with the goal of making boxing more
of a civilized competition.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.540
The impetus for these rules came, in part,
from Broughton’s defeat of George Stevenson,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.720
who suffered severe injuries and died a few
days after the pair’s fight.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.420
Saddened by the death of his competitor, Broughton
wrote the “Broughton Rules” to minimize

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.799
the harsher aspects of the sport, like forbidding
striking below the belt, not allowing hitting

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.350
a competitor when he was down and giving him
30 seconds to recover and continue the fight,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.180
lest he be declared the loser.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.950
While it has been suggested that Broughton
insisted on a squared off area to replace

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.829
the ring of spectators, adoption of the official
roped off square boxing ring didn’t appear

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.520
until about a century later.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.270
This particular innovation was designed to
protect the boxers from the fans who would

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.490
often get too close to the fight and occasionally
interfere in the old drawn circle rings.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.630
Broughton Rules loosely governed most boxing
matches for nearly a century before they were

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.380
replaced by the London Prize Ring Rules in
1838.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.720
Notable to the topic at hand, among these
new rules can be found the following:

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.479
That the ring shall be made on turf, and shall
be four-and-twenty feet square, formed of

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.959
eight stakes and ropes, the latter extending
in double lines, the uppermost line being

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.250
four feet from the ground, and the lower two
feet from the ground.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.319
That in the centre of the ring a mark be formed,
to be termed a scratch; and that at two opposite

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.590
corners, as may be selected, spaces be enclosed
by other marks sufficiently large for the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.090
reception of the seconds and bottle-holders,
to be entitled ‘the corners.’

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.730
Although by these rules the boxing ring was
no longer circular, the term ‘ring’ was

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.730
so ingrained in boxing vernacular that it
remained after the ring became square, sometimes

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.599
being referred to as the “squared circle.”

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.040
The London Rules were further improved upon
about three decades later by John Graham Chambers

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.530
with his proposal in 1867 of the “Marquess
of Queensberry Rules” (named in honor of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.849
boxing enthusiast John Douglas, the ninth
Marquess of Queensberry) from which modern

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.830
boxing rules are directly based.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.480
The primary changes from the London Rules
revolved around requiring opponents to wear

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.940
padded gloves, forbidding attacking and opponent
with anything but one’s hands, requiring

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.380
any competitor who was downed to get back
up within 10 seconds or forfeit the match,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.230
and setting the rounds at three minutes with
a one minute break in between.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.140
As with the London Rules, the new rules continued
to refer to the roped off area as a “ring”

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.610
despite its actual shape.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.540
The longest known boxing fight in history
took place in New Orleans on Apr. 6, 1893,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.930
between Andy Bowen and Jack Burke.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.920
The fight was for the lightweight world title
and lasted 111 rounds!

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.930
After seven hours of brutal fighting, when
the bell sounded for the 111th round, both

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.920
fighters – dazed and exhausted- refused
to come out of their corners and the referee

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.970
ruled the bout as a no contest.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.519
So yes, after 111 rounds of using their bodies
as punching bags, the contest ended in a tie.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.299
Jack Marles, a London dentist, introduced
the first mouth guard for boxers in 1902.

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.210
At first, the safety measure to protect a
fighter’s teeth and mouth was used only

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.210
in training sessions.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.400
It wasn’t until 1913 that the first boxer
wore one in an official fight.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.409
It didn’t take long for mouthpieces to catch
on among boxing to reduce injuries to the

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.750
teeth and mouth.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.280
Until the mid-1700s, boxing was mostly of
the bare-fisted variety.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.200
When Jack Broughton designed boxing gloves
in the mid 1700s, he introduced them at his

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.639
gym as training tools to reduce injuries to
boxers’ hands and faces prior to official

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.639
fights.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.010
While many think that the introduction of
boxing gloves made the sport safer, the opposite

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.010
is true.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.300
Since the head is pretty much the hardest
part of the body, punching it with a bare

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.669
fist with extreme force is likely to cause
damage to the fist.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.480
As such, bare-fisted fighters tended to concentrate
on landing punches to softer parts of the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:05:20.020
body, thus sparing the head from being knocked
around.
