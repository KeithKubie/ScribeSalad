00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.190
Unlike cut baby carrots, farmers grow “true”
baby carrots to be naturally small, or other

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.080
times they are simply carrots harvested before
they get a chance to completely mature.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.050
“True” baby carrots bear the same cone
shape as a normal sized carrot while only

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.750
being a fraction of the size.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.710
A number of farmers produce these type of
baby carrots when they thin their crops during

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.890
the growing season by removing a certain percentage
of immature carrots.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.320
However, other farmers purposefully harvest
entire crops of carrots young in order to

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.390
sell the baby carrots with their green stems
attached.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.829
That little detail allows growers to prove
that their baby carrots are “true” baby

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.440
carrots rather than carrots cut to look miniature.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.440
The majority of baby carrots sold in supermarkets
are not this type, but are manufactured to

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.880
look a certain way.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.989
The baby carrots that we know today didn’t
arrive in stores until 1989.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.230
Successful carrot farmer Make Yurosek operated
a farm and processing plant in California,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.130
and he believed that there had to be a better
way to use the 400 tons of carrot cull that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.460
his plant processed per day.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.230
Cull carrots couldn’t be sold in supermarkets
because they had issues such as being broken

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.360
or too misshapen.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.780
There were times when as much as 70% of the
day’s processed crop ended up culled.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.030
To solve the issue, in 1986, Yurosek experimented
in creating smaller carrots from the cull,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.830
using an industrial potato peeler and a green
bean slicer.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.740
When he sent them to a large west coast supermarket
chain to see what they thought, he received

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.200
a positive response.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.180
“I said, ‘I’m sending you some carrots
to see what you think…Next day they called

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.480
and said, ‘We only want those.’”

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.360
The process of manufacturing baby carrots
has been refined and streamlined in the years

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.360
since Yurosek first created them.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.020
At Grimmway Farm, one of the United States’
top carrot producers, full-size carrots are

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.030
planted close together in an effort to have
them grow straight and minimize the amount

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.930
of carrot that will need to be trimmed later
on in the process.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.970
Then, a mechanical harvester harvests the
carrots and they are transported to the processing

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.691
facility where workers use hoses and water
to force the carrots out of the truck.

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.880
The carrots are then washed into the processing
facility on luges.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.420
The luges, and the water, serve a dual purpose:
washing off the loose dirt and sanitizing

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.980
the carrots with trace amount of chlorine
in the water.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.000
Next, the carrots are sorted before being
cut into 2 inch sections.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.830
Grimmway Farm then stores the carrots for
one to five days before peeling them and rounding

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.770
the edges in a spiral slide made up of a grated
surface.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.319
Finally the carrots are sorted one last time
before being packaged up and shipped to stores.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.180
The extra carrot bits ground off during the
peeling process either end up as cattle feed

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.380
or become compost.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.970
Concern arose over the past few years about
the use of chlorine in the manufacturing of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.970
baby carrots.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.270
A deluge of chain-emails were sent about claiming
that the baby carrots were soaked in a chlorine

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.230
bath and that the white blush that appears
on the surface is the chlorine coming to the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.230
surface.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.230
In response, Bolthouse Farms, the other top
producer of carrots in the United States and

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.230
largest producer of baby carrots worldwide,
created a website in order to refute the rumors.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.980
The truth is that the process is regulated
by the FDA and the amount of chlorine in the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.040
water is approximately 90% less than the chlorine
level in regular tap water.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.060
That minute amount of chlorine sanitizes the
carrots to prevent consumers from contracting

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.350
foodborne illnesses such as E. coli and Listeria.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.920
Additionally, the white blush on carrots comes
from dehydration, rather than chlorine seeping

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.770
to the surface.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.330
Soaking the carrots in water for a time will
typically cause the bright orange color to

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:45.210
return.
