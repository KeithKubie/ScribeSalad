00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
Guys something just happened which

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.780
absolutely blows my mind. One of my quick

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.910
clips just went over 10 million views.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.980
It's absolutely incredible. Now this is a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.150
video showing a concept where you can

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.800
take an AA battery and a gum

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.570
wrapper and use it to start a survival

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.610
fire. It's a really cool idea I first saw

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.320
on Household Hacker and yes it actually

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.869
does work. Now here's the challenge: while

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.160
reading through the comments I noticed a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.480
lot of you were having trouble with this

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.070
at home because it was either burning

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.449
your fingers or wasn't lighting off at

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.310
all. So the purpose of this video is to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.289
dive into even more detail so you fully

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.060
comprehend how it works and then we'll

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.679
use that technique to start a fire out

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.570
in the desert today. Now the trick to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.770
actually getting this to work lies

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.510
within the gum wrapper itself. So I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.770
stopped by the grocery store and picked

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.090
up three different packs of gum so

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.860
we can compare. What we're looking for is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.270
a wrapper that has a shiny metallic

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.300
exterior but a textured fibrous interior

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.890
something like this, and you're also

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.300
going to need an AA battery which

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.289
you should be able to find in all

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.460
different kinds of electronic equipment

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.890
including flashlights. Now you probably

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.120
know by now that a battery has a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.160
positive end and a negative end and if you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.629
use something conductive to connect the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.430
two ends electricity will begin to flow.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.170
If we think of electricity like water

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.489
then the voltage coming out of the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.899
battery is like the pressure of the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.400
electricity and the conductor that we're

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.080
using is like the tube or the piping

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.400
that takes for water to where we need to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.439
go. If we use a thick pipe like this the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.030
energy can flow relatively freely and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.619
nothing really happens. It's just going

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.880
to get the battery really hot and burn

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.360
your fingertips. *ouch*.  But if we make the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.159
size of the pipe thinner the electrical

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.630
pressure and resistance build up to the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.890
point where they actually generate a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.900
significant amount of heat and it is a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.280
little bit of a balancing act because

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.630
too thick and it won't light off at all

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.180
too thin and it just burns in half. We're

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.530
trying to find that sweet spot where it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.640
goes up in flames every time.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.090
Now what I found works best for me is to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.560
take one of your gum wrappers and cut it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.450
lengthwise into thirds. This will make

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.399
three different igniters. When you've got

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.840
those pieces cut trim it in from the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.060
sides to form an hourglass shape so the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.200
part in the middle is about the same

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.789
thickness as the blade on your pair of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.770
scissors if you've done it right it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.560
should look something like this now here

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.119
is how to get your improvised igniter to

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.130
work take your fourth finger and rest it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.719
underneath one end of the igniter so the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.030
foil is facing up then take the bottom

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.500
of your double a battery and press it

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.030
down into your finger so it holds the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.829
foil in place and use your thumb and

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.179
forefinger to hold the battery straight

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.519
up like this now this last part happens

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.810
pretty quick we're going to take the top

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.160
piece of foil and press this on top of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.840
the battery with our thumb and hold it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.200
vertically until it bursts into flames.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.100
When I made my quick clip I used this big

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.420
5 gum, it works really well for me and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.890
I've got to work almost every single

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.480
time but it doesn't make me wonder how

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.280
other gums might compare so I picked up

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.990
some Juicy Fruit and Orbit just to see

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.550
if there's any difference. Opening up

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.990
here and the first thing i noticed this

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.600
actually got a paper exterior here

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.640
there's no shiny metallic side to that

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.320
at all it's just paper and if we open

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.780
that up it's just paper as well. So just

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.310
based on that observation I do not think

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.020
that Juicy Fruit is going to work, we

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.150
need a shiny conducted metallic surface

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.060
and paper is not going to do the job.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.770
To be fair I'm going to cut this up and

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.450
try it anyway because we can't really be

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.830
sure of the results before we put it to the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.910
test. All right here we go contact and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.960
nothing our hypothesis is confirmed

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.600
paper is non-conductive. No success with

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.890
Juicy Fruit we're going to try Orbit

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.550
next and here's the reveal... yeah these

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.380
are just covered in paper as well so

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.850
pretty sure those are not going to work

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.290
probably better put them to the test

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.550
just to be sure but I already know

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.780
they're not going to work and these ones

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.160
a little bit too short they probably

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.720
won't reach the battery terminals anyway.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.020
Ooh barely. You can get it to reach, but

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.860
barely. That's as good as it gets. No reaction

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.230
all right Orbit doesn't work. It's not going

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.060
to save your life. Very interesting guys

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.620
we have been able to confirm that only

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.030
the gum wrappers with the foil on the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.430
outside seem to work as igniters but

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.780
that's not all if you want to get these

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.250
things to work there are two more things

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.080
you need to know first. First of all the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.610
way you hold your battery actually makes

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.410
a huge difference. If your igniter makes

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.970
contact while your battery is being held

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.440
horizontally, most of the heat will

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.150
dissipate upwards reducing your chances

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.560
of this thing actually igniting at all

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.090
but when you hold your battery

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.070
vertically the heat transfers up into

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.630
the material greatly increasing your

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.370
chances of ignition. If you're one of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.570
the people burning your fingertips when

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.890
trying this the other thing that's good

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.390
to know is rip off little pieces of your

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.090
gum or pieces of the cardboard box. You

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.560
can use these pieces as insulation to

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.970
protect your fingertips when the foil

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.489
makes contact. So now that we have this

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.810
technique mastered let's go ahead and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.820
gather up some dry grass and sticks and see

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.000
if we can use it to start a fire

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.570
That went up in no time flat. Cool

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.830
guys, let's put the gum wrappers away

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.030
and talk about what we've learned so far.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.650
We found that in order to get this

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.970
technique to work we need to use

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.620
wrappers that have foil on the outside

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.270
and some kind of a fibrous material on

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.280
the inside, we also discovered that one

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.540
wrapper could be used to make at least

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.000
three different igniters. We cut these

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.770
wrappers into an hourglass shape and saw

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.120
just how important it was to leave the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.560
right thickness from the middle because

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.030
when the bridge is too thick it doesn't

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.710
light off and when it's too thin it just

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.600
snaps apart. Cutting them to the width of

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.130
one blade on our pair of scissors seem

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.020
to be just about perfect. We found that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.669
if we hold our igniters horizontally the

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.169
heat dissipates upwards and they're less

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.610
likely to go off but if we hold them

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.080
vertically the heat is captured into the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.520
material where they go off nearly every

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.320
time finally we learned that at the end

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.400
of the battery are heating up and

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.960
burning your fingers you can simply rip

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.790
off pieces of gum or cardboard from the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.770
box itself to use as insulation to protect

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.050
your fingers from any burns. As a side

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.790
note I did try ripping about eight gum

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.710
wrappers into igniters but unfortunately

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.820
I wasn't able to get any of them to go off.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.070
That's it for this experiment guys

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.600
thanks for joining me for this video and

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.560
I'll be looking for you the next one

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.710
talk to you then.  That went up in no time

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.290
flat first try. (COZ I'M BATMAN)
