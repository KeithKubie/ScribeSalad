00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.759
- [Voiceover] This right
over here is a screenshot

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:03.662
from a Khan Academy exercise, and it says,

00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:07.169
"Mason stands on the 5th
step of a vertical ladder.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.000
"The ladder has 15 steps,
and the height difference

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.529
"between consecutive steps is 0.5 meters.

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:17.941
"He is thinking about moving
up, down, or staying put."

00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.237
Let me draw this ladder that Mason is on.

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:23.398
It's a vertical ladder,

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:26.255
that's one side of the ladder,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:28.901
this is the other side of the ladder,

00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:31.479
and it has 15 steps.

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.640
Let me see if I can draw that.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.490
This is the first one, two, three, four.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.541
I'm gonna run out of space,

00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:39.838
I need to make 'em closer together.

00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:44.851
It's gonna be one, two, three, four,

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:50.081
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:54.423
10, 11, 12, 13,

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:56.953
14, and 15.

00:00:57.343 --> 00:00:58.947
15 steps.

00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:00.479
Let me make sure it's even.

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.476
The top and the bottom,

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:06.121
and the distance between each of these,

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.047
I guess you could say, steps,
or the rungs of the ladder,

00:01:09.047 --> 00:01:10.697
are half a meter.

00:01:10.697 --> 00:01:15.154
This distance right
over here is 0.5 meters.

00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:17.463
And it says that he's on the 5th step

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:18.892
of this vertical ladder.

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:20.726
He's on the 5th step,

00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:23.328
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:27.461
This is where he is right
now. He's on this 5th step.

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:28.970
And he's thinking about moving up,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.269
or down, or staying put.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:34.402
"Let h of n denote the
height above the ground h

00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:38.048
"of Mason's feet (measured in meters)

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:41.089
"after moving n steps (if Mason went

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.853
"down the ladder, n is negative.)"

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:45.339
All right, h of n.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.160
Denote the height above the ground

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.702
after moving n steps.

00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:54.371
Make sure we understand this.

00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:58.410
If I were to say h of zero,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.350
what is that going to be?

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.380
Well, h of zero means that
he's moved zero steps.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.352
He's moved zero steps,
he's still going to be

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:08.650
on this 5th step of the ladder.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.112
And so how high is he going to be?

00:02:11.742 --> 00:02:14.153
If he's on the 5th step
of a vertical ladder...

00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:19.726
I'm assuming that there's
0.5 from the ground.

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:21.282
This is the ground right over here.

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:26.274
He is one, two, three, four, five steps,

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:28.921
each of 'em is half a meter.

00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:33.126
Five times 0.5 is going

00:02:33.126 --> 00:02:35.466
to give us 2.5 meters,

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:39.137
so h of zero is 2.5 meters.

00:02:39.497 --> 00:02:42.976
If I said h of one, that means he goes up.

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:45.545
H of one means he goes up one step.

00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:48.192
Here, n would be equal to one.

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:51.211
If he goes up one step, h of one,

00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:53.115
he's going to half a meter higher,

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:55.646
so it's going to be equal to three meters.

00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:58.293
We could keep doing that for
a bunch of different inputs.

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.985
Let me write that, that's going
to be equal to three meters.

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:03.981
But anyway, that's not what
they're asking us about.

00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:06.559
They're saying, "Which number
type is more appropriate

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.672
"for the domain of the function?"

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:12.433
The domain, just as
reviewed, that's the set

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.219
of numbers that we could
input into the function

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.123
and get a valid output.

00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:18.749
And it's clear here, see, we have

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.397
to pick between integers or real numbers.

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:22.882
Well, n, which is our input,

00:03:23.742 --> 00:03:26.179
that's the number of
steps he goes up or down.

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.268
It could be positive or negative,

00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:30.985
but we're not gonna talk about half steps.

00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:33.214
Then he'll put his foot
in the air, right over.

00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:36.534
He has to take integer
valued steps up or down.

00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:38.206
Or, I guess, he's taking
integer valued steps,

00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:40.783
if it's positive it's up,
if it's negative it's down,

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:42.478
if it's zero that means he's staying put.

00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:44.336
If n is zero, that means he's staying put.

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:45.520
It's not real numbers.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.118
He can't move pi steps from where he is.

00:03:50.118 --> 00:03:52.532
He can't move square root of
two steps from where he is.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.506
He can't even move 0.25 steps,

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:55.853
then he'd put his foot in the air.

00:03:56.473 --> 00:03:59.521
This is definitely going
to be about the integers,

00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:00.775
not the real numbers.

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:02.958
This function right over
here, the valid inputs,

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.606
I want to be able to input an integer.

00:04:04.606 --> 00:04:06.046
In fact, it's not even all integers,

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.716
because he can't go down
an arbitrary amount.

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.875
In fact, he can't go up an
arbitrary amount either.

00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:14.418
The domain is going to
be a subset of integers.

00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:17.168
Then they say, "Define the
interval of the domain."

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.839
And we have these little toggles here...

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.341
to define the interval of the domain.

00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:29.381
And let's see, the lowest value for n,

00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.275
he can go as far as one, two, three,

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:36.405
four, five steps down.

00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:39.246
In that case, n would be
equal to negative five.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.616
And then the highest value for n is

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:45.811
if he takes one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:49.349
seven, eight, nine, 10 steps up.

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.741
And so that would be n is equal to 10.

00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:54.034
The interval of the domain,

00:04:54.034 --> 00:04:55.943
and actually I just copy and pasted this

00:04:55.943 --> 00:04:57.383
onto my scratch pad,

00:04:57.383 --> 00:05:01.586
n can be as low as negative
five, and as high as 10,

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:03.908
and it can include them as well,

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:05.347
so I'm gonna use brackets.

00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:08.017
My domain would include negative five.

00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:09.387
If it didn't include negative five,

00:05:09.387 --> 00:05:11.598
I would put a parentheses,
but I could put brackets here,

00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:14.440
and I could put brackets there as well.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.878
Just for fun, let me actually input it

00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:18.409
into the actual exercise.

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.823
I'm saying integers, and I'm as low,

00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:23.844
and I can go down five steps,

00:05:24.264 --> 00:05:25.794
and I can go up 10 steps,

00:05:25.794 --> 00:05:29.603
and 10 is also included in my interval.

00:05:29.603 --> 00:05:32.109
Then I can check my
answer, and I got it right.
