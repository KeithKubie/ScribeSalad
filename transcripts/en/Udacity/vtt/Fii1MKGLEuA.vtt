00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.800
Another relationship that we have to understand is

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.870
the one between fabrication cost and our chip area.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.420
Chips are manufactured by taking a silicone disk, called

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.130
a wafer, and subjecting it to a number of

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.290
steps. Each of these steps sort of prints some

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.210
of the aspects of the circuitry that should be

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.690
appearing on each processor. And there are a number

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.546
of these steps. At the end of these steps,

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.809
we take the wafer and we cut it up, and

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.021
each one of these small, squarish things is going to be

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.340
a chip. So this is a single chip. We take

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.150
each chip and we put it in a package. Has pins

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.710
on it. So this is what you normally see as

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
a chip. And then we test these chips. The ones

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.822
that check out fine, we can sell. The ones that

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:51.050
don't check out fine, we throw away because they don't work.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.605
It is important to understand that the manufacturing

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:57.212
process up to cutting the chips up is all

00:00:57.212 --> 00:00:59.636
the same. The wafer is this. Is about

00:00:59.636 --> 00:01:03.116
12 inches in diameter. It cost thousands of dollars

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:06.355
to put it through the manufacturing process, at

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:08.725
which point we hope we get a number of

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:12.201
working chips and very few non-working chips, but

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:16.320
the size of the chip significantly affects the cost.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.230
Again this entire process pretty much has a fixed

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.590
cost. If we have more chips here because they are

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.846
smaller, we will divide the wafer cost by the number

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.436
of many good chips that we get and our chips

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:32.534
will be cheaper. If we have very large chips, we

00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:35.642
will get fewer of them when we test them especially

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:38.528
and we will divide this cost with fewer chips to

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:41.400
get the cost. So it seems like the cost of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.480
a single chip is going to be linearly proportional to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.650
its size, but in fact, things are worse than that.
