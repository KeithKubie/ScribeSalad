00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.704
In today's video,

00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:02.229
we're going to put
something to test

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:04.800
that a lot of you may have been
curious about at some point.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.700
Can a flamethrower be used
to clear away snow?

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:16.940
[Music]

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.500
Guys, we've made flamethrowers.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.700
A lot of flamethrowers.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.343
Several different types
of flamethrowers in the past,

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:24.323
and today, we've got
three of them here.

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.773
We're going to test them all.

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:26.694
I've had to shovel

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:29.100
my driveway several times
in the last few weeks,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.000
and I hate it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.134
Every time I do it,
i just wonder like,

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:35.000
would it be better to just try
and melt it all away?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.400
So we're up here the dome,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.101
and there's snow all
around this dome,

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.040
and we have flamethrowers.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.880
We do.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.100
So we're going to test them out.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.900
We've got three,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.000
we've got our fire
extinguisher flamethrower,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which can use a powder
or a liquid fuel.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.800
We're going to be
using liquid today.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100
We've got our
arm-mounted flamethrower,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.600
which uses canisters
of propane as a fuel.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.574
And then we've got Big Bertha,

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:59.800
the first flame thrower actually
that Grant built,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.100
and this uses gasoline
and diesel as a fuel.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.600
So while I think the biggest one
is going to work the best,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.100
I gotta say I'm
not super confident

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800
that any of them are going
to clear much of the snow.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.369
But we still have to know.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.768
We really want to try.

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:14.067
Yeah.

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:17.000
And I think that no matter
how poorly it performs,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.019
it's going to be so much
more fun than shoveling snow.

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:20.511
So true.

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.100
Shoveling snow isn't fun.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.471
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:24.655
You have seen us use

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:27.200
or create several
flamethrowers in the past.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Now, we're going to go ahead
and take these flamethrowers,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.100
and put it to the test
against the snow.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.600
Okay.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.770
My first question though is,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.644
how effective do you
think this is going to be,

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:36.600
and which one do you think
is going to work best?

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.234
I'll answer your questions
in reverse order.

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:39.533
Which one is going to work best?

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.400
I think that the big one
is going to work best,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.800
because that actually
sprays out fuel.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.000
It sprays it out,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.364
and sometimes, that fuel
can even land on stuff

00:01:48.364 --> 00:01:49.460
and keep burning.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.629
As for how effective
it's going to be though,

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:52.682
I'm really not sure.

00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:54.591
Flamethrowers put out
a lot of heat.

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.013
They do, but not for
an extended amount of time.

00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:57.564
It's true.

00:01:57.564 --> 00:02:00.092
I think the longest
running one is the big one,

00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:02.400
and we only get maybe
a minute out of that.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.082
Maybe this one goes
a little bit longer,

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.079
with it's propane tanks

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.924
because it's not pouring
fuel as quickly.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:08.400
Let's start with the little one.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.900
Let's go.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.900
[Music]

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.700
How to clear
your driveway, test 1.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.500
I think it just went out.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.700
No, it was burning something.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.405
Was it?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.860
Yeah.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.000
Well, my arms' on fire.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.200
So there's that.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.600
Yeah, I couldn't
really see anything,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.000
but you can see the marks.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.100
So, first test didn't go
according to plan.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.699
We think there's probably
just a little too much liquid

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.450
in the canister.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.000
So we've added some boric acid.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.629
That's going to make
our flames green

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.102
so we can hopefully at least
see the flame hitting the snow,

00:02:44.102 --> 00:02:45.950
especially with how bright
it is right now.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.052
I'm also going to try

00:02:47.052 --> 00:02:49.100
and pressurize it
just a little bit more

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.256
so it's spraying out,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.900
and like aerosolizing more
than it did last time.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.160
There goes nothing.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.020
Yeah.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.600
Dang it.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.400
It blew it out.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.470
All right, we're gonna try
one more time with

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.366
what we've got left.

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:05.800
But you can see the green flame.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.500
You can see it's not done
much to the snow.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100
It's pockmarked it a little bit,
but that's about it.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.300
It wasn't very visible.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.286
So we've actually
shovelled a couple

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.977
of snow inside the dome
so we can make it darker,

00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:18.502
and we're going to try
this just one more time

00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:20.880
before moving on
to our next flamethrower.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.000
So guys, we're testing this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.623
because I wanted
to not shovel snow,

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:25.200
and then here I
am, shoveling snow.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.000
Well, it didn't do
anything to the snow,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.900
but it made me very happy.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.940
So amazingly,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.700
that's like the exact same thing
that was happening outside.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.000
Yeah.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.800
&gt;&gt; You just couldn't see it outside.
&gt;&gt; You couldn't see it.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.200
Methanol burns
very light colored.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.800
Like compared to color

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.000
that the lighter fluid burns,
it's almost invisible.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.700
Like you can--

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.200
There's a lot of it
on the ground,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.000
still right here.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.900
This is all on fire,
but it's almost all methanol.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400
And so it's just
almost invisible,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.680
even with the green in it.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:19.800
[Music]

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.100
All right, here it goes.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.350
We're going to do a test.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.820
See if we can get it
to ignite with the taser.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.500
If that doesn't work,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.499
we're going to go
to our little fire sticks,

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:29.500
but here it goes.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.700
Ready and...

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.700
Now, that was considerably more
effective than the methanol.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.140
Just slightly.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:21.480
[Music]

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.200
That got rid of that lump
of snow pretty quick.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.600
I think we need to do it again,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.344
but outside and see how much
we can actually clear away.

00:05:29.344 --> 00:05:32.000
That was about
one shovel full of like--

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.300
With a normal snow shovel
clearing my driveway,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.636
that was about one shovelful.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:38.041
So, it still take several hours,
but you could do it.

00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:39.200
But it got rid of it.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.600
It did.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000
In this situation.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.800
All right, let's refuel.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.620
Try it outside.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:06:04.500
[Music]

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.320
Well...

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.320
Wow.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.660
You put a hole in the snow.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.200
I think that was already there.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.500
It worked a lot better inside

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.600
when it was just a pile
of snow surrounded by dirt.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.374
With the snow
surrounded by more snow,

00:06:18.374 --> 00:06:20.330
it was even less effective.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.502
Yeah, it's true.

00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:23.167
The surface is now slush.

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:23.500
Yeah.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.852
That's about as
far as we've got.

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:26.500
I think I've dropped
down about an inch,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.300
and that was it.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.800
Whole double tanks of propane.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.040
Oh, maybe it wasn't.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.080
Oh, that was only one tank.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.580
That's one.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.100
Oh.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.700
Let's relight.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.330
All right.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.500
That's one tank.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.220
One more to go.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.220
3, 2, 1.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:07:05.020
[Music]

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.000
All right, that's a decent dent.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.260
I mean, kind of.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.900
It is a decent then
given the fact

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.000
that it's 14 degrees,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and we have
several feet of snow.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.542
So that's now both tanks

00:07:16.542 --> 00:07:19.500
worth of fuel emptied down
onto it, and that's,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.600
that's not much.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.200
I think it's still more
than we were expecting to do,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.402
especially after the fire
extinguisher flamethrower.

00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:26.002
That's true.

00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:28.400
The fire extinguisher really
got pretty much nowhere.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.300
This at least like
visibly melted some snow.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.400
It's also softer,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.400
like this is very hard
and frozen snow right now.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.700
This is slushy now.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.400
We've made a slush surface,
and we made it dirty too.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.860
It's nice and clean underneath,
but more melted.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.360
Yeah.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:53.900
[Music]

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.000
So yeah, I don't think
this this particular one

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.800
would be good for cleaning
off your driveway,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.254
but car windshield maybe.

00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:02.668
If you really really don't care
about your car's paint job.

00:08:02.668 --> 00:08:05.000
All right, I think
it's time for Big Bertha.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:32.040
[Music]

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.500
Guys, I've never gotten
to play with Big Bertha

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.520
before so I'm thrilled.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.300
I'm also thrilled

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.900
that Nate is holding that fire
extinguisher in his hand.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.000
A real one.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.100
All right.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.900
Yes.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:55.160

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.260
Wooh!

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.900
I think it works.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.020
I love this thing.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.160
[Music]

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.260
I think that one is
the most successful so far.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.400
It might not be the most
practical or effective way

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.000
of clearing snow
off your driveway,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but I think we can all agree
that it's the most fun.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.407
That's just the look
of pure glee on my face.

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:20.970
That pretty much sums up
how I felt at the time.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.500
Pretty much the result of using
flamethrowers in my experience.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.700
So of the three.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.300
Yep.

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:28.168
Fire extinguisher with methanol.

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:29.500
Pretty much worthless.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:29.800
Yeah.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.970
I'm going to go and say
that does nothing.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.283
Slightly stained the snow,

00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:34.900
and that was
about the end of it.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.700
Propane mounted flamethrower.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.500
Decent.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.120
Surprisingly good.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.500
&gt;&gt; In small quantity.
&gt;&gt; Especially in small quantities.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:41.960
Yes.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.800
Out in the snow
on the driveway, not great.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.723
But I think it actually melted

00:09:46.723 --> 00:09:49.397
about the same amount
of snow as the big one

00:09:49.397 --> 00:09:52.100
that was using diesel
and gasoline as a fuel.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.951
The only advantage I am seeing

00:09:53.951 --> 00:09:57.100
to our diesel and gasoline
flamethrower, Big Bertha,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.630
is that the fuel
itself is being ejected

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.000
with the flame itself,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
so it's landing
and still burning,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.600
so you have a little
bit more burn time.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.700
That's about it.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.000
Overall, I'm gonna say
this doesn't work.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.360
It's very fun.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.100
But it is not very effective.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.500
This is why we use shovels.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.800
It's just takes too
much energy to melt snow.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.600
Guys, that's not all.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.330
You know we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.396
That box up at the top will take
you to our latest video,

00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:25.542
and that box at the bottom is

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.400
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.413
Hit this bomb in the middle
to subscribe to the club

00:10:29.413 --> 00:10:30.655
so you never miss
out on the fun.

00:10:30.655 --> 00:10:31.759
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.900
and I'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.880
Talk to you then.
