00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
&gt;&gt; Now?
Okay.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.230
The question is can India become a superpower?
And my answer is yes.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.330
They have the economic resources; they've
got the energy; and they've

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.630
got all the necessary skills and input factors
to do that.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.689
The question, though, for superpower status
is an attitudinal change.

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.089
Can a country change the way it operates so
that it begins to take

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.689
steps that are good for everybody, not just
steps that are good for

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.300
itself?
That's the challenge of being a superpower.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.720
And that's the challenge that India will have
to step up to.
