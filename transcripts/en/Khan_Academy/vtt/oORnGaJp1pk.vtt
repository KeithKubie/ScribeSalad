00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.516
- So we have the graphs
of two functions here.

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:04.629
We have the graph y equals f of x

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.554
and we have the graph
y is equal to g of x.

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:09.482
And what I wanna do in this video

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:14.482
is evaluate what g of, f of,

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:19.187
let me do the f of it another color,

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:24.088
f of negative five is,
f of negative five is.

00:00:24.088 --> 00:00:26.082
And it can sometimes
seem a little daunting

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:28.010
when you see these composite functions.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.747
You're evaluating the function
g at f of negative five.

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:33.884
What does all this mean?

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:35.045
We just have to remind ourselves

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:36.160
what functions are all about.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.505
They take an input and
they give you an output.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.921
So really, what we're doing is

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:41.129
we're going to take,

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.219
we have the function f.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.843
We have the function f.

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:48.838
We're going to input negative
five into that function.

00:00:48.838 --> 00:00:51.089
We're going to input negative five

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.876
into that function and
it's going to output

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:55.595
f of negative five.

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:58.961
It's going to output f of negative five

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:00.354
and we can figure what that is.

00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:01.747
And then that's going to be the input

00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:03.883
into the function g.

00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:08.040
So that's going to be the
input into the function g

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.014
and so we're going to,

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:13.913
and then the output is going
to be g of f of negative five,

00:01:13.913 --> 00:01:18.581
g of f of negative five.

00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:19.718
Let's just do it step by step.

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:21.646
So the first thing we wanna figure out is

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:25.245
what is the function f when
x is equal to negative five?

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:27.381
What is f of negative five?

00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:31.816
Well we just have to see when
x is equal to negative five.

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:33.279
When x is equal to negative five,

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.739
the function is right over here.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:38.293
Let's see, let me see if I
can draw a straight line.

00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:41.475
So then x is equal to negative five.

00:01:41.475 --> 00:01:43.635
The function is right over here.

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:48.580
It looks like f of negative
five is equal to negative two.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.320
It's equal to negative two.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.852
You see that right over there.

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:57.852
So, f of negative five is negative two.

00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:00.119
And so we can now think of this

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.489
instead of saying g of f of negative five,

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.272
we could say well f of negative
five is just negative two,

00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:08.385
is just negative two.

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:12.170
So this is going to be
equivalent to g of negative two,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.170
g of negative two, g of negative two.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.042
We're gonna take negative two into g

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:23.548
and we're gonna output g of negative two.

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:25.172
So we're taking that output, negative two

00:02:25.172 --> 00:02:26.451
and we're inputting into g.

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.796
So when x is negative two,

00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:32.556
when x is negative two, what is g?

00:02:32.556 --> 00:02:35.761
So we see, when x is negative two,

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:38.223
g, the graph is right over there,

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:42.587
g of negative two is one.

00:02:42.587 --> 00:02:44.956
So this is going to be one.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:49.552
So g of f of negative five
sounds really complicated,

00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:50.922
we were able to figure out is one

00:02:50.922 --> 00:02:52.967
'cause you input negative five into f,

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:54.521
it outputs negative two.

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:58.261
And then you input negative
two into g, it outputs one

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.089
and we're all done.
