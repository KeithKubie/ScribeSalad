00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.780
Dr Riehl: So I want to tell you about the stable marriage problem.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.760
And what I like about it is, it's completely unlike the kind of mathematics that most people have seen in

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.540
high school or in college even. There's no numbers involved, we're not computing anything.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.140
No calculations, no integrals.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.160
Brady: No numbers?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.360
Dr Riehl: No numbers, no numbers even.
Brady: Aw, I'm going then

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.600
(both laugh)

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.720
Let's, let me pose the problem. So I'm going play the role of a Yente. So let's say I live in a remote village.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.980
And there are a bunch of young men and a bunch of young women. And it's in the village's interest that

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.280
everybody gets married. Everybody pairs off. We're only talking about heterosexual marriages today.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.680
That's actually really important to the mathematics, but leave that aside for now.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.220
And I get to arrange the marriages. I get to choose. I know all the young men and young women very well

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.440
I know what their preferences are. But it's really ultimately up to me.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.360
And my ultimate goal, my principle goal in arranging these marriages is stability.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.900
So I don't mean stability over time,  people might grow apart, their preferences might change.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.540
But I mean instead the following scenario. Say I've arranged a marriage between this couple here.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.900
So this young man and this young woman. And then I've arranged another marriage here for another couple.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.620
Another man and another woman. But suppose this woman prefers this man to the husband that

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.720
I've assigned her.  And this man simultaneously prefers this woman to his wife that I've assigned.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.500
Brady: That's not good.
Dr Riehl: That's not good.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
That means that these two are going to say "to hell with this arrangement" and run off together.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.880
So that's what we want to avoid. So I'll say this situation is not stable.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.920
And then the question today is "is it always possible to arrange stable marriages?"

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.760
So I want this instability that I've just described to never occur. So it's quite possible that this woman really

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.020
dislikes the husband that I've assigned her. And so she in particular would prefer this guy,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.580
but he's maybe very happy with his wife. He prefers her to her. So she wants to trade, but he doesn't want to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.680
trade, so this is a stable configuration, even though not everybody is thrilled with the arrangement.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.080
Instability is if and only if two people simultaneously prefer each other to their assigned spouses.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.380
Any other situation is stable. That's the one we're trying to avoid.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.320
Brady: how big a group are we talking here?
Dr Riehl: I'm gonna have no bounds on size whatsoever.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.480
So there could be the six billion people that are on the planet, if we want. Or, you know, ten men, ten women

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.860
in a remote village, and people can have any preferences whatsoever, I can't control what people feel in

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.420
their own hearts, so it's a big question. And it's not at all obvious that the answer is 'yes'.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.780
And furthermore, even if the answer is 'yes', there's a computational question.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.260
Is it maybe there is some stable marriage configuration out there in the universe.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.380
But I need to be able to find it, so I need a way to actually make the arrangements so that I can tell everybody

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.529
who they're gonna be spending the rest of
their lives with.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.620
So the answer is 'yes' and the proof is constructive. There's an algorithm due to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.740
David Gale and Lloyd Shapley so in the 1962 paper "on college admissions and the stability of marriage"

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.700
that proves at this can always be done. So I'd like to describe that algorithm to you now.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.140
This is an algorithm that you can program a computer to run, but I like to describe it as ... via a metaphor

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.360
where the men and women are playing certain roles. So before we begin each man and each woman

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.650
rank the members of the opposite sex.
So in other words everybody submits a preference list.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.979
You know 1 through the end of how many ... who they'd like to be married to. So then on the first day

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:55.319
of the algorithm we'll have each woman proposes to her number one choice. So some of the men will receive

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.700
multiple proposals,  others will receive none whatsoever. So the ones with multiple proposals then

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:08.839
make some rejections, so each man rejects all but his top suitor. So at the end of this step we have what

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.130
we'll call tentative engagement, so some of the women make proposals that aren't rejected yet and those

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.579
those couples are tentatively engaged.
But we'll see that the algorithm isn't quite

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.100
finished just yet. So on day 2 each rejected woman so each woman whose proposal was rejected

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.020
the day before, proposes to her next best choice. Regardless of whether he's free or not.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.039
So some men will receive new proposals
others won't receive any

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.019
and the men now have a chance to trade up. So maybe you had a tentative engagement from the day before

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.340
but you have a better suitor now so you
can rej... break the previous engagement

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.110
and make a new match so again each man

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.170
rejects all but his top suitor. So this is
why we said the engagements are tentative.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.560
If at any time a woman that he likes even better proposes to him, he's free to reject and break the

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.180
previous engagement and become tentatively engaged to somebody he prefers.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.760
Brady: So he can keep waiting for a better offer 
Dr Riehl: He can keep waiting for a better offer

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.730
then on day 
Brady: this is terrible for the women

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.420
Dr Riehl: three, four,  well you think that now but wait till the end. So this is day three, four, five,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.770
and so on we just repeat this process. So any woman who is rejected the day before

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.460
proposes to her next choice and the men
again have an opportunity to trade up

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.800
as they receive better proposals they'll break the previous engagements and keep going

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.840
and then the claim is that that this
stops at some point

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.889
and furthermore once this algorithm
stops

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.320
and the final engagements

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.180
are stable in a sense we discussed
previously

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.340
Let's see an example how this whole process works. What I've done here

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.340
is I've created four hypothetical women
Charlotte, Elizabeth, Jane and Lydia

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.040
and four hypothetical men, kinda funny names Bingley, Collins, Darcy and Wickham

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.060
and then for each person I've listed preferences so Charlotte prefers Bingley to Darcy to Collins to Wickham

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.220
similarly for Elizabeth, Jane and Lydia and the men have preferences also

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.780
Bingley prefers Jane to Elizabeth to
Lydia to Charlotte

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.080
and so on and so forth. So let's run the
algorithm and see who ends up married to whom.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.600
So remember on the first day each woman proposes to her best choice.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.720
So Charlotte proposes to Bingley,  Elizabeth to Wickham, Jane to Bingley and Lydia to Bingley.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:43.480
so see Bingley receives three proposals right off the bat from Charlotte, from Jane and from Lydia.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.860
and Wickham receives one proposal, from Elizabeth. Bingley right now has a choice. He prefers Jane

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:59.580
to Lydia and Charlotte, so he'll reject these two, that is Lydia and Charlotte are both rejected.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.490
and at the end of the first day we have
two tentative engagements

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.410
Elizabeth to Wickham and Jane to Bingley. On the second day

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.840
Charlotte and Lydia, which were rejected
the day before make their proposals

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.630
so Charlotte proposes to Darcy (Darcy is
proposed to by Charlotte)

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.680
and Lydia proposes to Wickham

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.400
Wickham receives the proposal from Lydia. Now Wickham was tentatively engaged to Elizabeth

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.460
but he likes Lydia better so he's now
going to reject Elizabeth

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.850
and she's back on the market. All right so
at the end of the second day we have

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.490
3 tentative engagements: Charlotte to
Darcy, Jane to Bingley, Lydia to Wickham,

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.740
and Elizabeth is unengaged. So on the third day she proposes this time to Darcy.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:52.370
Darcy receives a proposal from Elizabeth who he prefers to Charlotte so she's rejected, and we have

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.500
three tentative engagements again Elizabeth to Darcy, Jane to Bingley, and Lydia to Wickham.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.060
On the third day Charlotte proposes to
her next choice, which is Collins.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:09.280
You can see that Collins doesn't actually think very highly of Charlotte he prefers Jane, Elizabeth and Lydia,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.100
but he hasn't received any other proposal he has no better option. So he says 'yes'.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.440
And now the algorithm terminates because everybody is engaged.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.500
Brady: That's fun isn't it?
Dr Riehl: Yeah!

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.330
Alright, so now is the time for the mathematics. I'm gonna describe a number of theorems ...

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:35.960
Now he's only going to reject her proposal if there's some other woman alright W prime for some other woman ..
