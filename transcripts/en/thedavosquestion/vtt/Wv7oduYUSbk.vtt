00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.830
&gt;&gt; Well, the question in my mind is what's
the most exciting

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.919
innovation, development of the next decade
that will improve the state

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.429
of the world?
As far as I'm concerned, that is the full

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.820
integration of women into
political participation, into economic participation,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.449
into ensuring
that all girls around the world receive the

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:34.770
same education as boys.
And that the wealth of resources of countries

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.500
divided equally between
men and women, because we're beginning to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.290
see now some of the results
of having women more actively in the public

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.960
sphere.
And those results look pretty darn good.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.350
And so to me, we need to continue that innovation
for getting women

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
more into the public sphere and I would hope
and think that it will --

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.870
what I call -- her history.
