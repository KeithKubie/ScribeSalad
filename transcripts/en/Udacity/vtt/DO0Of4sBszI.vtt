00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.064
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This says that the distance between x and 4 is less than 5. Of course, we

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:08.736
know that you also could have the distance between 4 and x is less than 5, since

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:12.824
the absolute value of x minus 4 and the absolute value of 4 minus x are

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:17.531
equivalent to one another. They both measure the distance between these two

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:18.081
points.
