00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.860
Through this lesson, I'm sure you have

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.780
a good understanding and appreciation for the hard

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.380
work in the implementation of an operating

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.790
system on a shared memory multiprocessor that ensures

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.700
capability of the basic mechanisms like synchronization,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.210
communication, and scheduling. And this is not done

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.800
just once. It has to be done a new, for every new parallel architecture that

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.720
comes to market that has a vastly different

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.619
memory hierarchy compared to its predecessors. Can we

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.000
reduce the pin point of individually optimizing every

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.880
operating system that runs on a multi-processor? Now

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.920
what about device drivers, that form a big part of the code base of an operating

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.980
system? Do we have to reimplement them for

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.050
every flavor of operating systems that runs on a

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.960
new machine? Can we leverage third party device

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.160
drivers from the OEM's to reduce the pain point?
