David Doubilet: Unseen,
unknown, mysterious.

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.674
Beautiful and existence,

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.309
city in the sea.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.647
The richest part of our planet.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.418
It was paradise.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.755
(applause)

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.926
Good evening!

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.327 line:0%
What we want to show tonight

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.195 line:0%
is basically a year.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.097 line:0%
A year in photography.

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.867 line:0%
And we will take
you on a journey,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.969
mostly under seas,

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.204
from the boiling hot tropics,

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:16.442
the volcano-laced tropics,

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.878
to the cold water, to the ice,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.413
to the arctic.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.115 line:0%
And I think I may share

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.818 line:0%
a little bit about us.

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:29.688 line:0%
We work as a team.
We're together 24/ 7,

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:30.423
which is--

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:31.691
We are married, you know.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.992
Yes, we are married.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.495
But it's a good partnership.

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.464
Jennifer has always said

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:42.702
that I have this teenage crush

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.870
about Papua New Guinea.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.473
But 18 years ago,
it's now 18 years ago,

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:51.177
I was in a place
called Kimbe Bay,

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.080
I was there for the
total of six days.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.648
And in those six days I made

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.384
some very serious,
wonderful pictures.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:02.355
And I had to go back,
I had to go back.

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.391
But the years passed
and suddenly...

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.728
The phone
rang and it was...

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.763
It was the office

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:13.633
and they said to me,

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.503
"You. You have been selected

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:20.139
to participate, to contribute

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.409
in the 125th anniversary issue,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.211
David: the photography issue

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.413
of the<i> National
 Geographic magazine</i> ."

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.283
They said, "You can
go anywhere you want,

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:33.652
shoot anything you want."

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:39.625
And I said to myself,
"Kimbe Bay," ding!

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.395
And so we had an assignment.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:48.100
But here's a problem that
all of you share right now

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.405
and that problem is 'Where
the hell is Kimbe Bay?'

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:54.907
(audience laughter)

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.910
David: Well, Kimbe Bay is in
the Coral Triangle.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.449
And the Coral Triangle
is where, on this planet,

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:09.422
the most bio-diverse,
the most numbers

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:13.426
of fish, coral and of
course, invertebrates live.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.461
This was a perfect assignment.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.232
What could possibly go wrong?

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.100
Hmm.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:25.137 line:0%
The whole story's
had a cloud over it.

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:27.440 line:0%
Boiling dark cloud.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.575
The monsoon is still going on.

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:33.745
The wettest March
and April since 1970.

00:03:33.745 --> 00:03:37.049
The batteries are smoldering,
stinking and burning.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.952
Your camera's on fire.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.386
It nearly burnt the place down.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.754
Strobes flood.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.922
A GoPro floods.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:43.556
Gone.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:44.490
We lose another light.

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.058
The electronics are scrambled.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.293
Torrential rains.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.127
And kaboom!

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.328
Another $3,000.

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:50.529
Charger blows up.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:55.634
Like this place
has it in for us.

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:57.903
Mosquitoes are buzzing
around our heads.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.039
You don't have to
worry about the bends,

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.573
you have malaria.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:03.676
And as of two days
ago, a cyclone.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.011
Guinea is eating us
up and spit us out.

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.147
And this story was
supposed to be a gift,

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.883
an easy, beautiful story.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:14.320
Funny, all these years,
all these stories,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.121
every place we've
gone to we're sort of

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.390
reluctant to leave.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.592
But it's over now.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:23.061
So say goodnight Buffalo Bob.

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:24.864
Goodnight Buffalo Bob.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.267
Well, the one sunny day.

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:31.971
David: This is what this place
looked like.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.006
It's an absolute paradise.

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:37.877
Deep water with these
wonderful sea mounds

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:41.147
rising from thousands of
feet, almost to the surface,

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.616
and surrounded by volcanoes.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.353
And here's this mysterious lake

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:50.889
called Dok Toek,
the forbidden lake.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.893
No foreigners,
nobody but tribesmen

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:57.029
can go to this lake because
it's full of spirits

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.131
and crocodiles.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:03.002
The offshore reefs, like
this incredible place

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.905
called Kimbe Bomi and
they were far offshore,

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.107
two and a half hour
boat rides every day.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:11.044
Hundred and twenty-five feet
down at the top of the reef.

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.379
They were like absolute gardens,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.016
these deep,
underwater volcanoes.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:23.422
David: Bradford is the most
spectacular dive here.

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:26.091
There's a sea mount
called Bradford Shoals.

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.161
It rises up from the deep,

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.863
it is rounded, steep-shouldered

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:35.435
and has an immense school
of chevron barracuda,

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.603
which swim around
in great circles,

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.871
almost making
funnel-shaped clouds.

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:43.509
Around they go,
spooling upwards.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.850
When fish move in
a circular pattern,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.818
they create the
rarest thing in the sea

00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:54.954
which is a geometric pattern,

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.756
a place that has no
corners, no edges.

00:05:57.756 --> 00:06:01.361
Geometry in a place
of weightless chaos.

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:05.665
♪ (melodic music continues) ♪

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:11.304
And then the barracudas
would form these immense,

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:14.306
circular tornado-shaped towers,

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:17.443
David: going from basically
the bottom of the reef

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.145
all the way to the surface,

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:22.248
sometimes 70, 80 feet high.

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.382
Look at this.

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.351
And here's Jennifer on the side

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:28.087
of one of these towers.

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:31.791
The first time we
landed on this sea mount,

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:36.362
called Joelles,
it was raining fish.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.431
Jennifer Hayes: They were
isolated, they were unfound,

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.200
they were untouched.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.138
And they were de facto
marine protected areas.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.872
They just had no sense of humans

00:06:46.872 --> 00:06:49.809
and one of the scariest things

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.812
and in-your-face
conservation I have ever seen

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.815
was a group of fishermen
in a single boat,

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.683
what they call a banana boat

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.553
and they had found
Joelles reef

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:01.787
and they had anchored on it

00:07:01.987 --> 00:07:03.456
and they had been on
it all night fishing.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.057
And the minute they
saw our boat coming,

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:08.560
they cut their line
and they sped off.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.830
And it turns out
when we went down,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.967
all we found were
hooks and fishing line,

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.404
and half or more of
the fish were gone.

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:20.306
All of the pinjalo snappers.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:24.210
Every pinjalo snapper was gone.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.213
This is one night
on one small piece

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:30.216
of real estate in the
ocean that was wiped out.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:31.750
And the next day when we were

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.588
in the Kimbe Bay market
there were the pinjalos.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.390
And it shows you how fragile,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.826
first off it shows us how
marine protected areas

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.862
work and function
and then it shows us

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:45.798
how vulnerable these places are.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.769
David: There's small
things on this reef.

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:54.006
I have to tell you,
anemones and clownfish,

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:56.842
it's one of the most beautiful
friendships in the sea.

00:07:56.842 --> 00:08:00.312
The anemones protect
the clownfish's eggs,

00:08:00.312 --> 00:08:02.348
protect the clownfish at night

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:03.482
with its stinging tentacles.

00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:04.650
The clownfish
protects the anemones

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:07.286
from being nibbled to
death by butterfly fish.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.521
But Joelles has this
wonderful collection

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.256
of anemones and
toward the evening

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:12.824
they ball up like this

00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:15.895
and the clownfish begin to
burrow in their stomachs.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.631
I also managed to
photograph spawning.

00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:21.800
Here are the big
female clownfish.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.902
And the female is
the dominant partner

00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:25.104
in this relationship.

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:27.573
If the female dies,
the largest male

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:30.008
turns into a female and
begins to produce eggs.

00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:31.544
They're producing
eggs right now.

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:34.247
And that purple curtain
in the background

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.148
is the side of the anemone.

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:40.253
We dove with sharks.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.858

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:56.362
We were amazed and shocked

00:09:56.362 --> 00:10:01.066
and pleased to see
sharks in Kimbe Bay.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:03.268
They would meet you when
you rolled off the boat

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:05.904
and you were like,
"This is the way

00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:08.140
it is supposed to be."

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.175
So it was just
another indicator,

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:15.013
another symbol that
these reefs had survived

00:10:15.013 --> 00:10:18.350
where other reefs throughout
the Coral Triangle

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.720
had not done as well.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.626
David: We dove on a place
called Father's Reef

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:30.062
and we met a hawksbill turtle.

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:32.297
And she met us on every dive.

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:35.300
We could swim with her
as she made her rounds

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.638
past schools of barracudas
and schools of bat-fish.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.873
I love this picture
because it looks

00:10:41.873 --> 00:10:44.210
like the turtle is flying.

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:48.381
And then she'd do
this amazing thing:

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.849
instead of going to the surface

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:51.917
and going back down to
another piece of bottom,

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.853
she would come and she
would rest on our tanks.

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:57.656
And she would do this, she
would take her flippers

00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:58.891
and put her flippers
around the tank

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.793
and rest there.

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:03.895
Jennifer: It was wonderful,
she really was magic.

00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:05.464
She met us on every dive

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:07.499
and she would follow you
and when she was tired

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:08.533
she would rest on you.

00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:09.668
And it was a magic moment.

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:13.405
But it was also a
terrifying moment

00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:16.375
in terms of that makes
this particular animal

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.843
very vulnerable.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.479
The local fishermen
there, they fish the reefs

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:22.948
that they can find and
they harvest anything

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.583
they can find on the reefs,

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.319
from reef fish to turtles.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.289
And we would be diving,
a local banana boat

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:33.058
comes up and with
a group of people,

00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:36.195
the young man swims
down the turtle.

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.896
"How much, how much, how much?

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:38.897
You buy, you buy, you buy.

00:11:38.897 --> 00:11:40.166
Would you like to buy?"

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.868
Your gut inclination is
for a handful of dollars

00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:45.003
is to buy that turtle,

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:46.705
take it to the next
coral sea mount

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:48.006
and let it go.

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:49.475
But you can't do that

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:52.178
because you're setting
up a trade, an economy.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:53.845
They'll go catch another turtle

00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:55.214
and they'll come
back to you again.

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:58.049
Or they'll go catch
the same turtle

00:11:58.049 --> 00:12:00.319
and bring it back to you.

00:12:03.488 --> 00:12:05.958
We were in a tiny empire.

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.393
A perfect, tiny coral empire.

00:12:08.393 --> 00:12:12.197
And we needed, we
needed to have an image

00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:13.332
of coral.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.934
A panorama.

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:18.103
A shot that said, "This
is this coral world."

00:12:18.103 --> 00:12:21.674
Built of tiny polyps,
beautiful in existence,

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.874
city in the sea.

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.711
This picture isn't
the one we wanted.

00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:29.749
David: And we kept looking
and we kept searching.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.084 line:0%
David:
A place called an Ann-Sofie.

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:34.687
It's a group of
islands at the tip

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.788
of the Williamez Peninsula.

00:12:36.788 --> 00:12:38.490
And there's one little island,

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.925
it's not even an island,

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.693
it's an island with a
bunch of trees on it

00:12:41.693 --> 00:12:44.129
and sort of a lone palm tree.

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:46.999
And it has in one corner of it,

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:49.434
a field in very,
very shallow water.

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:52.437
David: In less than a foot
there is a field

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:56.474
of beautiful purple-laced
coral intermingled

00:12:56.474 --> 00:13:01.413
with a cropper coral
and stagnant coral.

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:03.449
David:
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.985
And we worked there
and photographed

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:08.186
David: a picture half and
half out of the water.

00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:10.356
One of the things I
particularly liked to do.

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:13.125
And as we were working
a father and son came up

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.593
in a dugout, they
were fishing there.

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:16.595
We give them lunch later on.

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:20.199
(indistinct chatter)

00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:25.504
Jennifer: We'll see
Anton and his papa again.

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:31.177
♪ (gentle guitar music) ♪

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.214
Whoa! Big fish!

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:41.053
(indistinct chatter)

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.297
It was one of those lovely days

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:53.232
where everything worked out.

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:56.302
We made another
dive, we went home.

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:03.008
Boiling clouds, complicated
skies of Walindi

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:05.077
and its tiny little island.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:09.548
That's the kind of pictures
I really like to make.

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.522
David: Here's the picture.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.965
We recently published a story

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:28.968
in the<i> National
 Geographic magazine</i>

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:31.136
on the gulf of St. Lawrence.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:34.006
Jennifer:
It was a very challenging story

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:37.176
but very near and
dear to our hearts.

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:39.444
We live on the
St. Lawrence river

00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:42.013
in a region called
The Thousand Islands.

00:14:42.013 --> 00:14:44.282
This is our neighborhood.

00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:45.617
David: Yeah, this is not
our house, incidentally.

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:48.086
Jennifer: This is, people
ask us all the time.

00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:52.524
We live in an area
surrounded by 1,800 islands,

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:56.828
storybook castles and
an amazing creature

00:14:56.828 --> 00:14:58.464
Jennifer: called the sturgeon.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:01.566
There are 27 species of
sturgeon in the world.

00:15:01.566 --> 00:15:04.036
They're all in the
northern hemisphere.

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:07.940
All 27 of them are
falling flat on their face

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.674
because they are long-lived;

00:15:09.674 --> 00:15:13.445
they live to be over
100, sometimes 200.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:16.848
Get this: they don't
spawn until they're

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:20.185
about 25 years old.

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.554
And then, not even
every year after that.

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:23.889
it's every five years.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:26.725
So 25, 30, 35 and you can see,

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:29.228
all of a sudden, when
you put the pressure

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.496
of fisheries on a
species like this,

00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:33.365
Jennifer: how these stocks
are collapsing.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:36.234
And these sturgeon are very shy,

00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:37.703
they like deep water,

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:40.139
they're very rare to see
underwater most of the year,

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:43.342
except for one week
in the month of June,

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.277
thousands of them
gather and they meet

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.112
on these spawning beds.

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:50.348
This particular type of
rock, in very fast water.

00:15:50.348 --> 00:15:53.152
This water is like
washing machine water,

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.121
it is about a four knot current.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:59.123
Right now I am behind
a big giant rock

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:01.260
trying to stay out
of the current.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.296
And these girls, these are
all girls waiting to spawn,

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.131
just ignoring me because they're

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.499
all pumped up on hormones.

00:16:07.732 --> 00:16:10.235
Any other time of the year
I couldn't get near them.

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.370
Jennifer: And the sturgeon
are a unique fish.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.507
They are so ugly, I
think they're beautiful.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:17.976
I would marry a sturgeon if
I could marry a sturgeon.

00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:20.712
-I married a sturgeon.
-See their mouth and barbules.

00:16:20.712 --> 00:16:23.582
-You did marry a sturgeon.
-I married a sturgeon.

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.516
Oh my God, you did.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.686
These barbules, see
these four things.

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:29.287
Those are called barbules

00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:31.390
and they have all these
chemosensory ability

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.258
and they go along the bottom

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:34.393
and they brush past something

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.128
and they say, "I can eat that."

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.997
And womp! Down
comes its mouth.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.232
Have you ever seen
a mouth like that?

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.100
(audience awes)

00:16:42.767 --> 00:16:45.804
David: Past Quebec the
river becomes an estuary.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:49.341
And a little past
there the Saginaw River

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.611
joins the St. Lawrence
and there's a population

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:54.013
David: of beluga whales.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.247
Beluga whales are
the white whales,

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.147
the canary whales.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.315
They sing and they burble

00:16:57.315 --> 00:16:59.151
and they make a lot of noise.

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.919
And this guy came right up to me

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.921
and kind of blew me a kiss,

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:04.255
it went bloop!

00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:05.991
A little bubble came out.

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:06.758
(audience laughter)

00:17:07.592 --> 00:17:10.062
David: And then the whale did
this marvelous thing.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:11.296
He tried to eat the camera.

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:14.099
(audience laughter)

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.637
Jennifer: There used to
be 10,000 beluga whales

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:19.972
in the St. Lawrence.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.506
It can support up to 10,000.

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:24.276
And then they were
fished; they were killed,

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.711
because all the fishermen
thought that they

00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:28.514
were competing for fish
so they were slaughtered.

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.982
And then it got down to
a handful of thousand.

00:17:30.982 --> 00:17:34.786
And just weeks ago a
report came out and said,

00:17:34.786 --> 00:17:38.423
"No, no, no, no. We
are down to 800."

00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:39.557
And what is happening

00:17:39.657 --> 00:17:41.994
is there's high
infant mortality.

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:44.196
The problem is they
don't know what

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:46.331
is causing the infant mortality.

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:48.467
So the Department of Fisheries

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.601
and the Canadian scientists

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:52.471
are now in scramble
and panic mode

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:57.342
to figure out how to
preserve these 800 belugas.

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:59.511
They are precious
and they are almost

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:02.381
a symbol of the St. Lawrence.

00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:06.184
David: And don't forget,

00:18:06.184 --> 00:18:09.087
we are in French
Canada, French Canada.

00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:11.222
And I photographed crabs.

00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:12.890
David: Crabs mating.

00:18:13.024 --> 00:18:16.228
(French accent) In French Canada
it is not just mating

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:18.730
but is<i> L'Amour</i> ; love.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.397
(audience laughter)

00:18:19.597 --> 00:18:21.232
They do this for weeks and weeks

00:18:21.232 --> 00:18:23.035
at a time, you know.

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:25.604
(David laughing)

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:26.938
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:32.577
<i> Après, après l'sex, after
 l'sex comes l'cigarette.</i>

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:35.814
(audience laughing)

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:38.584
Jennifer: Gimme that.

00:18:40.218 --> 00:18:41.886
Oh my God.

00:18:42.687 --> 00:18:45.356
Jennifer: The gulf of
St. Lawrence

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:47.792
freezes in the winter time

00:18:47.792 --> 00:18:51.563
and it becomes the
world of the harp seal.

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:54.232
They are nursed by their mothers

00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:56.968
for about 12 days.

00:18:56.968 --> 00:18:58.136
Then they're abandoned,

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:00.071
they're left on the
ice to figure out

00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:02.874
how to become a harp seal.

00:19:02.874 --> 00:19:05.243
How to feed, how to swim,

00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:08.546
how to do anything
and everything.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.483
Jennifer: In 2011,
when this picture was made,

00:19:12.483 --> 00:19:15.686
it took us three days by
boat to get to the ice.

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:19.824
It kept moving, there was
so little ice in the gulf.

00:19:19.824 --> 00:19:23.027
And we located a patch
and a field of ice

00:19:23.027 --> 00:19:25.530
and it had 10,000 seals.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.168
And this is what 10,000
seals begins to look like.

00:19:30.735 --> 00:19:34.239
And we can give you an
idea of what it's like

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:36.508
in the world of the harp seal.

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:39.878
That's its umbilical there.

00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:42.714
A newborn.

00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:45.918
Three days old, with
the mother in the back.

00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:50.455
(baby seal crying out)

00:19:57.261 --> 00:19:59.798
A very nervous mother.

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.803
(baby seal cries)

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.949
Still a very nervous mother.

00:20:26.023 --> 00:20:27.992
To me, they're one of the
most beautiful creatures

00:20:27.992 --> 00:20:29.094
on the planet.

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.228
For the first 12
days of their life,

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:31.930
when they're called
the white coats,

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.200
they look almost
like a stuffed toy.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.202
(audience oohs and awes)

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:41.439
And once in a while
you'll see a blind one.

00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:43.475
And it's very sad because
they'll come up to you,

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.143
thinking you're their mother.

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:46.745
They're desperate,

00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:49.047
without that particular sensory.

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:52.684
And after 12 to 15
days they begin to molt

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.919
and they begin to
shed their white coat

00:20:54.919 --> 00:20:56.354
and become what's
called a beater.

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:59.090
And at this point
they are also eligible

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.759
to enter the hunt.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.261
The Canadian seal
hunt still goes on.

00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:04.596
There's a lower quota

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.398
and they cannot
take the white coats

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.399
but they can take the beaters.

00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:11.269
Jennifer: And David has found
a beater.

00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:16.374
And I find a pup
peering through the ice,

00:21:16.374 --> 00:21:18.443
looking for his mom.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.112
He sees me, he's like, "No."

00:21:21.112 --> 00:21:23.715
(audience laughs)

00:21:24.215 --> 00:21:25.917
Mom is behind me,

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:30.155
going a little crazy now
because I'm between her

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:31.689
and her pup.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.259
She rushes past me
and she greets her pup

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:37.929
and she coaxes him
into the water.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:41.099
They meet with this
underwater nose-to-nose,

00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:42.867
I call it a kiss of recognition.
(kissing sound)

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:44.969
It's like smooch,
are you my mom?

00:21:44.969 --> 00:21:48.373
Are you my pup or
are you an impostor?

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:51.476
And while we're swimming
the pup is very curious.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:52.777
What are you? Who are you?

00:21:52.777 --> 00:21:54.579
What's going on? Who are you?

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.416
And he would try
to swim towards me,

00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:58.583
he would get a little close

00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:00.284
and the mother would come up

00:22:00.284 --> 00:22:02.453
and literally hold
him down, "No."

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.624
And eventually she allowed
him to get a little closer

00:22:06.624 --> 00:22:08.593
and he gets so close
and he scrabbles.

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:10.695
He begins to climb up on my--

00:22:10.695 --> 00:22:13.865
Here you come be the
seal, you're there.

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:16.468
-So he begins to do this.
-I'm the seal.

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:19.070
And then he climbs up onto me,

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.106
I'm the raft, I'm the ice.

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:26.043
And now he's on my
chest, he's tired

00:22:26.043 --> 00:22:27.545
and he's on my chest.

00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:30.882
And he's nosing my mask
like he did his mom.

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:33.918
Like I'm the impostor,
I am the impostor.

00:22:33.918 --> 00:22:35.453
Jennifer: We swim along
and we move

00:22:35.453 --> 00:22:36.922
into this very open water.

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:40.458
Now we're resting,
we're all stopped.

00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:43.495
Then something
nips my left ankle,

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:45.430
then something nips
my right ankle.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.399
And I look down and
there's 30 or 40

00:22:48.399 --> 00:22:53.105
male harp seals
circling below me.

00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:57.609
A male comes up over my back,

00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:59.043
pushes me down,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.280
his penis gets caught in my mask
(audience laughs with disgust)

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.250
taking it off with him.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.120
The mask drops, we're
in 3,000 feet of water.

00:23:09.454 --> 00:23:11.456
I see it, I grab it.

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:13.391
Got my camera here

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:16.194
and the male is
going down below me

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:19.164
and the female sweeps past

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:20.565
and she goes down and the mother

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:23.401
is beating the crap
out of this male.

00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:26.404
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:28.873
The mother surfaces,

00:23:28.873 --> 00:23:32.010
she surfaces and she's
grunting and snorting

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.577
(heaving noise)

00:23:33.144 --> 00:23:35.046
and she comes back
and I'm thinking,

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:37.648
"I'm not sure what's
going to happen now."

00:23:37.648 --> 00:23:41.052
But she comes back
and she uses her head

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:43.654
and her flipper
and her entire body

00:23:43.654 --> 00:23:46.825
and she kind of
scoops up her pup.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.259
Kind of using
everything she's got.

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:50.562
And she kind of gets
him in front of her.

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:54.232
And then she uses her
flipper, her nose,

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:56.701
her body and she scoops me up.

00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:59.237
(audience laughs)

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:01.139
-Now...
-Super mom.

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:03.841
The pup and
I were being propelled.

00:24:03.841 --> 00:24:06.077
Herded through the water,

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:07.578
out of this open
area where we had

00:24:07.578 --> 00:24:09.080
all the males beneath us.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.750
I ducked underneath and
I watched the mother

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.952
and the pup disappear.

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:16.320
I'm pumped up on adrenaline,

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.622
I'm ecstatic, I'm excited,

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:19.190
I go to the edge of the ice

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.558
and I throw my camera up.

00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:22.561
And I'm taking
off my weight belt

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:24.262
and just as I'm taking
off my weight belt,

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:27.699
right at the edge of
the ice a male harp seal

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.468
comes under the edge of the ice

00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:33.071
and he bites me
square in the groin.

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:35.606
And he lets go.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.543
And then he bites me
square in the thigh.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.212
Wonk! And he lets go.

00:24:41.212 --> 00:24:45.183
And I have a very,
very memorable scar

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:46.284
from all of that.

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:49.820
But it's not the scar
and it's not the male

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.191
that I would ever or
want to or will dwell on.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:59.130
It is the female
and her reaction.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.399
Jennifer: And I will say
the world of the harp seal

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:03.301
has been a changing world.

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:05.836
David and I were on
our way back to shore,

00:25:05.836 --> 00:25:10.208
a storm came up and the
ice was so bad, so weak,

00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:11.109
(Jennifer: deep breath in)

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:13.178
that when the
storm came through,

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:17.882
it wrecked the sea ice
and 10,000 pups perished.

00:25:17.882 --> 00:25:19.384
Every one of them died.

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:24.422
They had 100 percent
mortality of the gulf seals

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:26.091
in that particular year.

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:30.128
This past year in 2014
was a big ice year.

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:32.897
That's a relief, we
had a relief year,

00:25:32.897 --> 00:25:35.333
because we had had three to four

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:38.837
almost full-on 100
percent mortality years.

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:44.809
So it is a shifting world
for our climate there.

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:47.379
And what I want to close
on is David and I go back

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.546
every year now.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.484
We have become
addicted to the ice.

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:55.953
-We feel--
-Extraordinary place.

00:25:55.953 --> 00:25:58.323
We go back every year

00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:00.758
and what we're trying to do

00:26:00.758 --> 00:26:02.460
is create a shifting paradigm

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:07.065
away from hunting into
a model of ecotourism.

00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:09.134
Now we can take some people up

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:10.067
and we take a week

00:26:10.167 --> 00:26:11.569
out of the harp
seal hunting boat.

00:26:11.702 --> 00:26:13.337
We buy a week, we
buy another week,

00:26:13.337 --> 00:26:14.706
we buy another week.

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:17.809
And hopefully we'll show
them a different economy.

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.844
An ecotourism-based economy

00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:22.747
where we can take the
pressure off the hunting.

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:26.684
And with that I would like
to thank you all for coming.

00:26:26.684 --> 00:26:29.020
You've been
an incredible audience.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.856
