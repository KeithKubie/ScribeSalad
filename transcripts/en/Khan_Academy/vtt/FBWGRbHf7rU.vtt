00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:06.749
Let T of T, so capital T of lowercase T denote the temperature capital T in Windhoek, Namibia

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.410
measured in degrees Celsius when it's T lowercase T hours after midnight on a given day.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:21.510
The table below lists a few selected values of the function. Alright, when it's 6 hours after midnight our temperature is 19 degrees Celsius

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.279
Nine hours after midnight or 9 a.m. 25 degrees Celsius. 13 hours after midnight, which is the same thing as 1 p.m.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.398
Our temperature is 31 degrees Celsius. When did the temperature increase faster?

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.889
So this is between 6 &amp; 9 a.m.. So 6 &amp; 9 a.m.. 9 a.m.. and 1 p.m.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.719
So that's between these two points, or did the temperature increase at the same rate over both intervals?

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.509
Well if we want to figure out the rate of increase- so let's see rate of

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.719
temperature change

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.110
temperature

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.940
change

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.070
Well this is going to be equal to, our change in temperature capital T, over our change in time.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.699
This triangle, that's the Greek letter Delta, represents change in. So change in temperature over change in time.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.739
So let's think about what this rate of temperature change is, between these different intervals.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740
So between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.. So let me really see

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.900
Change in temperature over change in time

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.809
So what was our change in temperature? Our temperature went up, by 6 degrees Celsius.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.920
Let me just write it here

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.789
6 degrees Celsius. And what is our change in time? Our time went up by 3 hours, plus 3 hours.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.579
So you're going to have a change of 6 degrees Celsius, positive change of 6 degrees Celsius

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.720
over a positive change, we've Gone 3 hours into the future,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.969
Over 3 hours we increased our temperature by 6 degrees or you could say it's an average rate of change of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.570
6 divided by 3 is 2

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.399
degrees Celsius, per hour.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.988
Notice, I'm just keeping the unit's the same degrees Celsius per hour, so that's the rate of change between 6 a.m.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.590
And 9:00 a.m.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.369
Now let's ask ourselves the same question between 9:00 a.m.. and 1:00 p.m.. So our change in

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.129
temperature over change in time

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.299
What is our change in temperature? Well our temperature goes up from 25 to 31 degrees Celsius.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.009
That's another 6 degrees Celsius.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.858
But it's no longer 3 hours to go from 9 hours after minute to 13 hours after midnight

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.479
We're now doing it over 4 hours. So Plus 4 hours.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.529
So 6 degrees Celsius over 4 hours

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.430
and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.040
We actually don't even have to calculate you see that you've had you've had the same change

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.900
But you've had to do it over more hours

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.840
So this is a lower

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.519
Rate of change the temperature is increasing slower here. It took it four hours to increase 6 degrees Celsius well over here it took it

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.219
only 3 hours. So immediately you might recognize

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.150
that this is going to be faster. If you increase 6 degrees Celsius over 3 hours that's faster than increasing 6 degrees Celsius

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.729
Over 4 hours. But just to make the comparison a little bit clearer

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.169
Let's actually just do the math here. 6 divided by 4 well that's going to be 1.5

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.720
1.5 degrees Celsius per hour.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.900
Here you can make the direct comparison.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.810
2 degrees Celsius per hour is faster than 1.5 degrees Celsius per hour.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.549
So that's why we liked this choice up here
