much they wanted dispensers get it up so
one downside is we found with this

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:08.750
one downside is we found with this
 

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.540

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.550
and you're playing for the first time
you're going to be a non spender if you

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560
you're going to be a non spender if you
 

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.520
you're going to be a non spender if you
go into short for example you spend $20

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:04.530
go into short for example you spend $20
 

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.500
go into short for example you spend $20
now we're going to class you as a mid

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.510
now we're going to class you as a mid
 

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.780
now we're going to class you as a mid
spender and what happened is with this

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:08.790
spender and what happened is with this
 

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.240
spender and what happened is with this
system we've got a series of bundles

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.250
system we've got a series of bundles
 

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.380
system we've got a series of bundles
that we've worked out that we think

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:12.390
that we've worked out that we think
 

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.720
that we've worked out that we think
that'll be appealing to users in those

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:14.730
that'll be appealing to users in those
 

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.460
that'll be appealing to users in those
segments and what will happen is there's

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.470
segments and what will happen is there's
 

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.260
segments and what will happen is there's
each time they log in each day they're

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:18.270
each time they log in each day they're
 

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.250
each time they log in each day they're
gonna get shown one of these bundles

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260
gonna get shown one of these bundles
 

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.410
gonna get shown one of these bundles
they might buy it they might not they

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420
they might buy it they might not they
 

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.670
they might buy it they might not they
might buy it and move up to a higher

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680
might buy it and move up to a higher
 

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.170
might buy it and move up to a higher
timeline the next day they're going to

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180
timeline the next day they're going to
 

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.520
timeline the next day they're going to
log in they're going to see another one

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:25.530
log in they're going to see another one
 

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.550
log in they're going to see another one
of these bundles a different one and

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560
of these bundles a different one and
 

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.360
of these bundles a different one and
sometimes at these higher levels would

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:29.370
sometimes at these higher levels would
 

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.710
sometimes at these higher levels would
even go faster than one a day you might

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720
even go faster than one a day you might
 

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.240
even go faster than one a day you might
see a couple in a day and this is much

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:35.250
see a couple in a day and this is much
 

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.950
see a couple in a day and this is much
more effective than the other version

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:36.960
more effective than the other version
 

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.420
more effective than the other version
I'm showing you for a number of reasons

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:38.430
I'm showing you for a number of reasons
 

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.690
I'm showing you for a number of reasons
so what does this work better it's

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:41.700
so what does this work better it's
 

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.280
so what does this work better it's
better upselling than a single price

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:43.290
better upselling than a single price
 

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.660
better upselling than a single price
point bundle with a single price book

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:44.670
point bundle with a single price book
 

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.790
point bundle with a single price book
bundle you've got this tension where

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800
bundle you've got this tension where
 

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.560
bundle you've got this tension where
you've got to decide what price to put

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:48.570
you've got to decide what price to put
 

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.240
you've got to decide what price to put
up yeah so there's time limited bundles

you're showing the correct bundle to the

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959
you're showing the correct bundle to the
 

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:23.600
you're showing the correct bundle to the
correct user then on spending the low

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:23.610
correct user then on spending the low
 

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.010
correct user then on spending the low
value ones the high spending the high

those big spikes in the weekends my kind

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580
those big spikes in the weekends my kind
 

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.360
those big spikes in the weekends my kind
of thing the dangers with these ones is

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.370
of thing the dangers with these ones is
 

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.890
of thing the dangers with these ones is
pretty much the same as the time limited

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900
pretty much the same as the time limited
 

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.420
pretty much the same as the time limited
bundles you've got that problem about

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:53.430
bundles you've got that problem about
 

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.950
bundles you've got that problem about
content burn you've got the problem

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960
content burn you've got the problem
 

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.200
content burn you've got the problem
about cannibalization from the shop but

despite those drawbacks okay

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:03.750
despite those drawbacks okay
 

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.740
despite those drawbacks okay
so this is one thing I just mentioned in

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:06.750
so this is one thing I just mentioned in
 

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.810
so this is one thing I just mentioned in
passing quickly this is a correlation

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820
passing quickly this is a correlation
 

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.210
passing quickly this is a correlation

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.230
five then twenty at that point you go
into the middle spender bracket and

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240
into the middle spender bracket and
 

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.630
into the middle spender bracket and
that's that's where you're going to stay

targeted bundles so imagine that we've
 

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.080
targeted bundles so imagine that we've
got all these different bundles that you

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.090
got all these different bundles that you
 

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.760
got all these different bundles that you
can buy in the game so there's something

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:16.770
can buy in the game so there's something
 

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.650
can buy in the game so there's something

all that kind of stuff so what we'd like
 

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.710
all that kind of stuff so what we'd like
to do and we've actually started work on

to do and we've actually started work on
 

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.360
to do and we've actually started work on
this already is we're going to develop a

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.370
this already is we're going to develop a
 

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.000
this already is we're going to develop a
machine learning approach where we'll

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.010
machine learning approach where we'll
 

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.350
machine learning approach where we'll
look at your users purchase history

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360
look at your users purchase history
 

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.030
look at your users purchase history
we'll run it through a machine learning

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:38.040
we'll run it through a machine learning
 

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.270
we'll run it through a machine learning
algorithm work out what price fits them

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280
algorithm work out what price fits them
 

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.040
algorithm work out what price fits them
really well and that's going to narrow

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.050
really well and that's going to narrow
 

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.240
really well and that's going to narrow
down what bundles are going to show them

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.250
down what bundles are going to show them
 

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.170
down what bundles are going to show them
so if you think you want to spend twenty

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:45.180
so if you think you want to spend twenty
 

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.880
so if you think you want to spend twenty
dollars you can chuck away the 20s the

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:46.890
dollars you can chuck away the 20s the
 

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.470
dollars you can chuck away the 20s the
ones the fives there's now going to be a

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480
ones the fives there's now going to be a
 

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.630
ones the fives there's now going to be a
subset of these $20 bundles which we

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640
subset of these $20 bundles which we
 

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.120
subset of these $20 bundles which we
know that you want to buy then we look

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.130
know that you want to buy then we look
 

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.100
know that you want to buy then we look
at the different types so something like

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.110
at the different types so something like
 

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.330
at the different types so something like
a resource bundle where you're buying

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340
a resource bundle where you're buying
 

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.460
a resource bundle where you're buying
currency in the game if the player is

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:58.470
currency in the game if the player is
 

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.350
currency in the game if the player is
running low on currency they're probably

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360
running low on currency they're probably
 

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.330
running low on currency they're probably
going to be more likely to buy that with

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340
going to be more likely to buy that with
 

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.920
going to be more likely to buy that with
a battle bundle if you're running an

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:03.930
a battle bundle if you're running an
 

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.420
a battle bundle if you're running an
event which where you need to battle a

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:05.430
event which where you need to battle a
 

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.830
event which where you need to battle a
load they're probably going to be more

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840
load they're probably going to be more
 

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.480
load they're probably going to be more
likely to want that at that point in

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:08.490
likely to want that at that point in
 

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.390
likely to want that at that point in
time so with only an effective act in as

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400
time so with only an effective act in as
 

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.400
time so with only an effective act in as
well in deciding which bundle to show

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:13.410
well in deciding which bundle to show
 

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.960
well in deciding which bundle to show
you and we're going to choose the ones

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:14.970
you and we're going to choose the ones
 

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.220
you and we're going to choose the ones
you think you've got the highest chance

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:16.230
you think you've got the highest chance
 

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.980
you think you've got the highest chance
to buy relative to its price so if

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:18.990
to buy relative to its price so if
 

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.980
to buy relative to its price so if
you've got a 10% chance of $100 bundle

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:21.990
you've got a 10% chance of $100 bundle
 

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.750
you've got a 10% chance of $100 bundle
that's better than if you've got a 20%

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760
that's better than if you've got a 20%
 

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.190
that's better than if you've got a 20%
chance to buy the $20 bundle if that

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200
chance to buy the $20 bundle if that
 

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.510
chance to buy the $20 bundle if that
makes sense so we're going to try and

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520
makes sense so we're going to try and
 

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.860
makes sense so we're going to try and
serve you one more thing we're going to

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:27.870
serve you one more thing we're going to
 

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.290
serve you one more thing we're going to
make the mess revenue so that's the plan

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:30.300
make the mess revenue so that's the plan
 

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.590
make the mess revenue so that's the plan
with this and we've actually as I

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600
with this and we've actually as I
 

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.180
with this and we've actually as I
mentioned we started building this we

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:35.190
mentioned we started building this we
 

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.590
mentioned we started building this we
tried a few different approaches the

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600
tried a few different approaches the
 

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.610
tried a few different approaches the
moment of trying and nearest neighbors

shows you it's a very clear picture

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:24.950
shows you it's a very clear picture
 

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.769
shows you it's a very clear picture
maybe clear is not the right word

00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:26.779
maybe clear is not the right word
 

00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:27.940
maybe clear is not the right word
because at the beginning it looks a bit

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:27.950
because at the beginning it looks a bit
 

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.399
because at the beginning it looks a bit
confusing but it gives you a very clear

00:23:30.399 --> 00:23:30.409
confusing but it gives you a very clear
 

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:33.340
confusing but it gives you a very clear
picture of what your how players

interact with your game every symbol

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720
interact with your game every symbol
 

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.299
interact with your game every symbol
here has a meaning every symbol is a

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:37.309
here has a meaning every symbol is a
 

00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.100
here has a meaning every symbol is a
different action that a user is taking

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.110
different action that a user is taking
 

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.799
different action that a user is taking
in your game so a symbol represent

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:41.809
in your game so a symbol represent
 

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:44.019
in your game so a symbol represent
purchase event another symbol represent

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:44.029
purchase event another symbol represent

purchase event another symbol represent
completing a level or an achievement and

00:23:46.389 --> 00:23:46.399
completing a level or an achievement and
 

00:23:46.399 --> 00:23:48.700
completing a level or an achievement and
you see the sequence of actions that

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:48.710
you see the sequence of actions that
 

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.310
you see the sequence of actions that
every users have taken this is a sample

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320
every users have taken this is a sample
 

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.220

of your users it's up to 100 and you can

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:54.230
of your users it's up to 100 and you can
 

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.740
of your users it's up to 100 and you can
see how they interact the first thing

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:56.750
see how they interact the first thing
 

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.060
see how they interact the first thing
you can do with this report is see what

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:01.070
you can do with this report is see what
 

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.820
you can do with this report is see what
action lead to what you what matters to

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:03.830
action lead to what you what matters to
 

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.950
action lead to what you what matters to
you for example what have they done

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:05.960
you for example what have they done
 

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.899
you for example what have they done
before they made their first purchase or

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:07.909
before they made their first purchase or
 

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:10.450
before they made their first purchase or
what are they done before churning and

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:10.460
what are they done before churning and
 

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.220
what are they done before churning and
so you can optimize your game overall

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:12.230
so you can optimize your game overall
 

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.740
so you can optimize your game overall
and see where if you have any issues but

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:14.750
and see where if you have any issues but
 

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.629
and see where if you have any issues but
where it becomes even more powerful and

00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:16.639
where it becomes even more powerful and
 

00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:18.519
where it becomes even more powerful and
relevant to this talk is that you can

00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:18.529
relevant to this talk is that you can
 

00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:20.259
relevant to this talk is that you can
actually filter this

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:20.269
actually filter this
 

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:22.359
actually filter this
report by different types of users so

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:22.369
report by different types of users so
 

00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:23.560
report by different types of users so
for example users that have made a

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:23.570
for example users that have made a
 

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.940
for example users that have made a
purchase and users that haven't made a

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:24.950
purchase and users that haven't made a
 

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.219
purchase and users that haven't made a
purchase or that expend some amount and

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:27.229
purchase or that expend some amount and
 

00:24:27.229 --> 00:24:29.320
purchase or that expend some amount and
then users I'll spend more and you can

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:29.330
then users I'll spend more and you can
 

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.779
then users I'll spend more and you can
start understanding the differences what

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:31.789
start understanding the differences what
 

00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:33.909
start understanding the differences what
really are the different behaviors what

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919
really are the different behaviors what
 

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:35.169
really are the different behaviors what
they're looking for in your game

00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:35.179
they're looking for in your game
 

00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:37.719
they're looking for in your game
depending on what type of category of

depending on what type of category of
 

00:24:37.729 --> 00:24:40.299
depending on what type of category of
users they are so it's a very good way

00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:40.309
users they are so it's a very good way
 

00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:42.609
users they are so it's a very good way
to get some insights and and design your

didn't show them to the users that were
 

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.670

they try to monetize different users

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.050
they try to monetize different users
 

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:07.030
they try to monetize different users
based on their purchase behavior and

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.040
based on their purchase behavior and
 

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.490
based on their purchase behavior and
their propensity to spend again without

having to do much on the analytics side
 

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.330
having to do much on the analytics side
because they just got an input from the

because they just got an input from the
 

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.510
because they just got an input from the
player stats API and that input was

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:16.520
player stats API and that input was
 

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.669

that's just an example you got some
ideas from Fred Stoll called how you can

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:30.980
ideas from Fred Stoll called how you can
 

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.680
ideas from Fred Stoll called how you can
actually start thinking about different

types of users and target them here are

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120
types of users and target them here are
 

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.790

some other ideas just how to use this

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:38.800
some other ideas just how to use this
 

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.850
some other ideas just how to use this
this data you can for example target

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:42.860
this data you can for example target
 

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.950
this data you can for example target
high session length and frequency so

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960
high session length and frequency so
 

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.560
high session length and frequency so
basically the most avid avid players on

basically the most avid avid players on
 

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.620
basically the most avid avid players on
your game with a reward and you can get

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:50.630
your game with a reward and you can get
 

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.330
your game with a reward and you can get
the information about them again

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:52.340
the information about them again
 

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.480
the information about them again
included through the player stats API

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:54.490
included through the player stats API
 

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:58.210
included through the player stats API
you can also target users that I risk of

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:58.220
you can also target users that I risk of
 

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.450
you can also target users that I risk of
churn with some time limited special I'm

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:01.460

your game as soon as possible you can

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.050
your game as soon as possible you can

reach them with a notification you know

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640
reach them with a notification you know
 

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.340
reach them with a notification you know
who they are because they have a high

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:09.350
who they are because they have a high
 

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.260
who they are because they have a high
probability to churn and you get that

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.270
probability to churn and you get that
 

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.450
probability to churn and you get that
from the player stats API you can then

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:13.460
from the player stats API you can then
 

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.240
from the player stats API you can then
target users that are more likely to

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.250
target users that are more likely to
 

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.640
target users that are more likely to
spend with a special offer just to make

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:18.650
spend with a special offer just to make
 

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.790
spend with a special offer just to make
sure that you convert them and customize

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:21.800
sure that you convert them and customize
 

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.820
sure that you convert them and customize
that bundle or that offer to be a bigger

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:24.830
that bundle or that offer to be a bigger
 

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.410
that bundle or that offer to be a bigger
one maybe a bigger value with a higher

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:26.420
one maybe a bigger value with a higher
 

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.450
one maybe a bigger value with a higher
price point for the ones that are likely

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:28.460
price point for the ones that are likely
 

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.880
price point for the ones that are likely
to become high spenders so you get the

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:30.890
to become high spenders so you get the
 

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:31.270
to become high spenders so you get the
idea

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:31.280
idea
 

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.520
idea
again most of the ideas will come from

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:33.530
again most of the ideas will come from
 

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.040
again most of the ideas will come from

saw many developers even the ones that

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:51.770
saw many developers even the ones that
 

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.350
saw many developers even the ones that
are getting very advanced in this

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360
are getting very advanced in this
 

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.930
are getting very advanced in this
sometimes they oversee this and forget

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:55.940
sometimes they oversee this and forget
 

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.450
sometimes they oversee this and forget
about it

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460
about it
 

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.190
about it
the biggest difference between user is

matters a lot I know it sounds intuitive
but sometimes we with machine learning

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:06.420
but sometimes we with machine learning
 

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.330
but sometimes we with machine learning
and analytics and all that we forget

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:08.340
and analytics and all that we forget
 

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.840

about the basics and especially when it

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:11.850
about the basics and especially when it
 

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.910
about the basics and especially when it
comes to pricing you need to make sure

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:13.920
comes to pricing you need to make sure
 

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.070
comes to pricing you need to make sure
that your price is relevant for the

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080
that your price is relevant for the
 

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.710
that your price is relevant for the
country where the user is based and if

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720
country where the user is based and if
 

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.860
country where the user is based and if
you do a/b testing for your pricing you

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:21.870
you do a/b testing for your pricing you
 

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.200
you do a/b testing for your pricing you
should do it a country level and we are

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.210
should do it a country level and we are
 

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.299
should do it a country level and we are
very we think that this is a very

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:26.309
very we think that this is a very
 

00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:28.700
very we think that this is a very
important part of monetizing

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:28.710
important part of monetizing

and that's why we we've been also

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:31.890
and that's why we we've been also

and Asia so check it out in the

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100
and Asia so check it out in the

developer console you have access now to

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020
developer console you have access now to
 

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.410

a much lower price that you can use in

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:00.420
a much lower price that you can use in
 

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.390
a much lower price that you can use in
those markets where conversion is more

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:02.400
those markets where conversion is more

difficult but it's still you can still

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740
difficult but it's still you can still
 

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.669
difficult but it's still you can still
extrapolate value from that so thank you

00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679
extrapolate value from that so thank you
 

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:29.970
extrapolate value from that so thank you
very much
