00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.379
“This episode of DNews is brought to you
by Full Sail University.”

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.490
People ask ALL THE TIME why we're exploring
space and if that money could help people

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.519
on Earth.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.990
I'm here to tell you IT ALREADY DOES HELP!

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:24.760
One of the biggest questions we get whenever
we do space stories is "why are we spending

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.160
all this money on space travel?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160
What does it do for me?"

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
And I'm here to tell you…

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.840
It does a crap-ton for you.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.840
And I’m not just talking about stupid stuff
like batteries, eyeglasses, GPS navigation,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.410
weather satellites or global telecommunications
-- because who needs THOSE things, amirite?

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.290
In 1962, NASA created a program of offices
specifically dedicated to track Technology

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.860
Utilization and Industry Applications of NASA
efforts.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.110
Since 1976, they've published an issue of
what they call "Spinoff" every year, cataloging

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.220
nearly 1,800 projects.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.219
The projects are commercial ventures using
tech either wholly developed by NASA, created

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.710
in partnership or by contract with NASA, or
using NASA patents, experience, technology,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.519
research, personnel, data… et cetera.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.820
Basically, if NASA wasn't around, many of
these techs probably wouldn't be either.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.720
One that caught my eye from the 2013 issue
of Spinoff, was the Space Shuttle Main Engines,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.580
inspiring new solar power plants.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.550
It might not seem immediately obvious, but
it stuck with me.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.520
An SSME would kick on in temperatures as low
as -423 F (217C) and burn as hot as 6,000

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.740
F (3316C) -- hotter than the boiling point
of iron.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.840
It was built for NASA, but the company that
built it (now owned by Pratt &amp; Whitney), took

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.090
the experience of working with superheated
materials and turned it into a 110-megawatt

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.150
solar plant which powers 75,000 homes in Nevada.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.900
Sunlight is concentrated onto a single point
at the top of a tower, and superheated salt

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.820
is used to create steam and turn turbines.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.119
They created a company called SolarReserve
which is now opening plants all over!

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.070
If you're feeling distracted, another NASA
spinoff might help.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.890
Unique Logic created a game that helps you
learn to pay attention by monitoring your

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.890
brainwaves!

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.280
See, NASA scientists know that too much automation
makes the mind wander, and they wanted pilots

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.849
to have an automated system that could tell
if they were distracted..

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.050
If a pilot wandered too far off task, the
flight simulator would release more controls

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.840
to manual -- forcing them to focus.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.130
Whereas if they were on task, the sim would
take over more controls.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.280
This was in the 1980s!

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.550
Today, the technology has been adapted for
video gaming, the nuclear power industry,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.410
US Olympic sports, and NASCAR!

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.569
Speaking of sporting events, another spinoff
is the GigaPan.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.170
You've probably seen these online; they're
giant images taken from mountaintops or building

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.230
spires, or at events which let you zoom in
a seemingly IMPOSSIBLE amount to see shoes,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.700
read newspapers or find faces in a crowded
stadium.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.200
The technology was originally developed for
use on the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.709
It showed up in Spinoff in 2008, when Gigapan
began marketing the technology to consumers

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:06.930
and event planners.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.510
It works by taking hundreds of photos, and
then stitching them together using software.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.840
It creates a very compact system (perfect
for space travel) and creates GIANT images

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.430
(great for analyzing an alien planet).

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.870
And that's just THREE of these amazing technologies!

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.610
Software designed to test the control of spacecraft
long before takeoff has inspired bank fraud

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.610
protection.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.629
And software for analyzing satellite images
of stars was pointed at the human brain to

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.500
help detect alzheimer's in MRI scans.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.650
The number of technologies touched by manned
exploration of space is incredible.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.129
So next time someone writes, "What a waste!"
in the comments, link them to this video.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.129
Oh, and point out that Tang isn't a thing.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.129
It was invented for use on the ground.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.129
Sure, NASA tried it out but it's not a thing.

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.129
Let's move past that myth.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.129
What's your favorite space technology?

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.349
I think mine might be LED lights that help
plants grow.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.370
More food for everyone!

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.409
Tell us yours down below!

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.659
None of these techs would be possible without
software to run the system, and we need people

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.100
to write that software!

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.230
Full Sail University in Florida offers courses
to help train tech professionals by blending

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.340
code and real-world experience.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.610
Students of Full Sail have hands-on access
to technology on their first day, they get

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.030
a discounted laptop and all the software they'll
need to earn degrees in software, mobile and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.220
web development.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.150
They offer a blend of coding AND real-world
experience.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.299
Which is the best way to learn.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.020
