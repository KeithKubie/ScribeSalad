00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.440
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.900
So today is a specific way
to solve linear differential

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.690
equations.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.970
I'll take second order
equations as a good example.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.600
This way is called
variation of parameters,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.970
and it will lead us to a formula
for the answer, an integral.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.730
So that's the big step, to get
from the differential equation

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.070
to y of t equal a
certain integral.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.310
That integral will
involve the right hand

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.440
side, of course, the source.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.320
And if we can do
the integration,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.900
then we get a complete answer.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.900
But in any case, we get a
nice form for the answer.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.130
OK.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.850
So what's the idea?

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.260
So we're looking for
a particular solution.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.810
Today is about a
particular solution.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.140
We have to know two null
solutions to get started.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.319
So we must know these, y1
and y2, null solutions,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.690
with f equals 0.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.870
And of course we do
know two null solutions

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.850
when those coefficients
b and c are constants.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.050
And we'll do it as a good
example, the most important

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.570
example.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.170
But maybe sometimes we can
find the null solutions

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.890
when B and t are changing
in time, time varying,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.740
and that's all to the good.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.500
Those problems are
not easy to solve.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.340
But it's really
constant coefficients

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.250
that we know it works.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.750
OK.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.620
What's the idea?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.430
So the idea is to use y1
and y2, the null solutions.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.570
If we multiply by constants,
we get another null solution

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.230
by linearity.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.380
But the idea is to
multiply them by functions.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.610
The varying, those
constants are not constant,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.120
they are varying parameters.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.600
So this would be the
form of the solution.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.820
And we want to find a c1
and a c2 depending on t,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.500
so that the differential
equation above it is solved.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.560
So of course, I'm going to
plug that into the differential

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.550
equation and find out the
conditions on c1 and c2.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.450
May I just jump to the result?

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.090
This will satisfy that equation.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.920
We know that y1
and y2 satisfy it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.660
with a 0 on the right-hand side.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.500
So we just have to--
So it's c1 of t and c2

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.510
of t that are going
to deal with the f.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.400
So here is the result
after putting it in there.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.600
I discover that c1 prime,
the derivative of t,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:16.900
comes into it times y1 plus
c2 prime times y2 equaling 0

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.550
will give me one equation
for c1 prime and c2 prime.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.570
The other equation
for c1 prime times--

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:34.290
We'll multiply y1 prime
plus c2 prime y2 prime.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.020
Of course, prime
means the derivative.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.250
And that, when I'm plugging
all this into the equation,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.620
I'm going to see an f of
t on the right-hand side.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.050
I have two equations
at each time.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.540
At each time instant I have
two ordinary linear equations.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.110
They're straight lines
in the c1, c2 plane.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.050
They intersect.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.040
We know how to solve--
The most basic problem

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.140
of linear algebra, solve two
equations and two unknowns.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.140
And we do that for each
t, and we get an answer.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.589
So this leads us to c1 and
c2 and they depend on t.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.740
Because-- Well,
actually it leads us

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.050
to c1 prime and c2
prime, the derivatives.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.970
It just happens that when we
plug it in, the c1 and the c2

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.630
themselves disappear because
these were null solutions.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.570
So we know that c1
constant would be good,

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.480
but when we put it in
there, we get equations that

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.160
involve c1 prime at each time.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.650
So I'll take that away.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.000
At each time.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.650
All right.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.020
Two equations, two
unknowns, we solved it.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.150
OK.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.920
And then when we solve them,
we put them back in to y of t

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.310
and can now just
write the answer.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.070
I'll just write.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.440
So I'm not doing all
the gory calculations.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.440
I'm just going to
write the answer.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:21.560
So y of t is going to be-- Just
to be sure, I'm looking here.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.960
That's what I'm going to write,
and I'm going to part c1 and c2

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.060
into that-- c1 and c2 come
from these two equations.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.170
OK.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.320
So I have a y1 of t times c1.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.910
Now, the c1 that comes out
of that happens to be-- Well,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.790
c1 prime comes out of it,
so I have to integrate.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.640
I have to integrate c1 prime.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:06:03.875
So c1 prime that comes out of
that is a minus y2 times the f,

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.540
dt, and then there
is a denominator,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.360
because if I have two
equations and two unknowns,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.990
there's a little 2
by 2 determinant.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.550
I'll just call it W.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.380
It has a famous name in
differential equations.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.830
And I'll tell you that name.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:29.350
W of t is the determinant
of what I have there,

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:36.150
y1, y2, y1 prime, y2 prime.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.850
Two equations, they
have to be independent.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.250
They have to be
invertible to give me--

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.600
and it's this determinant
that is the critical thing.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.640
So that's y1, y2 prime
minus y2, y1 prime.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.090
That's the function.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.840
Remember we know y1 and y2.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.560
The whole deal is starting
with y1 and y2, null solutions,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.730
and combining them.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.120
And you see there is a first.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.092
This is the c1 and now
I have to add in the c2.

00:07:14.092 --> 00:07:18.310
It looks a little messy,
but it's just an integral.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.820
It's just an integral.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.550
So now what is y2
of t multiplied by?

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.010
Well, it's multiplied by c2,
and since this equation gives me

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.120
c2 prime, I'm going to have
to integrate to get c2.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.540
And it turns out to
be y1 of t, f of t,

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:47.030
dt, divided by that
same determinant W of t.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.930
This is-- Let me
tell you its name.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.110
It's named after a
guy named Wronski,

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.640
so it's called the Wronskian.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.470
You can call it that or not.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.570
It's this.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.200
So we know y1 and y2.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.020
That means we've plugged those
in, we find the Wronskian.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.140
We put that in these integrals.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.675
We have the y2s and the
y1s and we're given the f

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:21.170
and we integrate.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.180
Well, if we can integrate.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.780
I don't plan to go
probably much beyond that.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.370
Just I'll stop there.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.700
That's a formula for the answer.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.070
Well, I won't
completely stop there.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.600
Let me do an example.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.620
Let me do an example.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.309
So let's see.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:47.700
I guess my example will be a
constant coefficient equation.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.310
So constant
coefficient when-- What

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.810
are the null solutions for a
constant coefficient equation?

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.710
You remember what happens
with constant coefficients.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.010
You plug in.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:07.850
You get s squared plus Bs
plus C times-- You're looking

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.205
for-- you're trying for an
exponential, and it'll work.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:21.270
So I plugged-- This is
looking for null solutions,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.750
because we have to
have those to start.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.980
They are the y1 and
y2 in my formula.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.400
So my variation and parameters,
the whole new thing,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.440
is completed there.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.420
Just if I want an example, I
have to solve the differential

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.250
equation, and for
that, believe me,

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.520
I'm going to make
B and C constant.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.410
So I solve this equation.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:50.160
So this gives me-- Of course,
I can cancel the e to the st,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.650
because it's never 0.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.000
So this has to be 0.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.570
And that has two roots, and
the quadratic formula tells me

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.410
those two roots s1 and s2.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:06.190
And then my null solutions
are y1 is e to s1t

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.465
and y2 is e to the s2t.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.460
Now, I'm ready to go.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.870
I'm going to put those
into this formula.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.900
I have to do the Wronskian,
and I need another blackboard.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.310
Sorry.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:35.130
This is the only video so far
that went to a third board.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.390
Can you remember I need
the Wronskian and then

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:44.200
I'll reproduce the-- So
there's-- Let me copy again.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:52.480
Y1 is e to the s1t
y2 is e to the s2t.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:01.900
And now that Wronskian is y1,
y2 prime minus y2, y1 prime.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.710
And what does that
come out to be?

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.430
y1 is e to the s1t.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:17.420
y2 prime is the derivative
of that, so it's an s2,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.090
e to the s2t.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.590
That's this term gave me that.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.080
And now I subtract
y2, which is there.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.630
y1 prime, which is the
derivative of this,

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.470
brings down an s1.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.740
You see the beauty of
all these formulas.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.650
Well, beautiful if you like,
formulas, not everybody does.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.230
OK.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:49.200
So now I know all
the terms, and I'm

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.010
prepared to write
again my formula for y

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.450
of t, my solution.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.410
This is the climax now.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.690
I'm going to use the
formula that came

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.360
from variation of parameters.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.450
And I'm going to put in that
function, that function,

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.990
and that W, and I'm
going to see what I have.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.780
OK.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:20.736
So do you remember it
was y1 times an integral.

00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:26.570
Oh, I had better use a
variable of integration here.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.300
I don't want to put
t in there, because t

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.460
is the limit of integration.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:39.010
So y1, do you remember, it
was a minus y2 e to s2--

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:44.590
I'll use just capital
T-- time divided by W.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:49.770
Remember, there's an f
of t and there's a dT,

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.670
and I'm using a capital
T as the dummy variable.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:03.040
And in the bottom goes W, which
is s2 minus s1 e to the s1T,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.910
e to the s2T.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.110
That was the first term.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:15.640
This was the c1
that multiplied y1.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:21.840
Now, I have to remember the
y2, the second null solution,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.230
times its c2.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.150
And that was the integral.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.350
And again, now I have
a plus sign, I think,

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.620
so it was-- put in
parentheses there.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.460
That was the W on the bottom.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:45.830
So it was e to the s1T, f of
T, dT, dT, and that same W

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:54.880
down here, s2 minus s1,
e to s1T, e to the s2T.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.420
OK.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.780
That's the variation
of parameters formula

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.980
for these nice null solutions.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.140
It doesn't get better than this.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.030
And in fact, I guess I can
cancel e to the s2T there.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.580
I can cancel the e
to the s1T there.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.190
I can put this up
with a minus exponent.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.490
Oh yeah, it's going to be good.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.470
It's going to be good.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.900
So here is a constant s2 minus
s1, the same for both terms.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.080
Then I'll put this up here
as a negative exponent,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.890
so there's an e to
the s1t, I'll get--

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.470
You might even see this coming.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:50.340
I get this 1 over s2 minus s1,
and then I have the integral.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.040
And here I have an f
of T in both integrals.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.480
Let me just put
that f of T down.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.600
And I have a dT.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.190
And then what do I--
What else do I have?

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:10.340
I have this thing which I can
put inside but with a small t.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.640
I'm not integrating that.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:20.080
I think if you look there,
you have e to the s1t,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.610
and then this will come
up with a minus sign.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:28.470
Does that look good to
you for the first term?

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.420
And then the second
term will have

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.810
that same 1 over s2 minus s1.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.790
Now, what do I have?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.700
e to the s2T is going to
come up with a minus sign,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:54.010
so I have an integral of
e to the s2, t minus T.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.510
I think there's a minus.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.770
Haha.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.520
Don't forget that
minus, Professor Strang.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.480
And f of T, dT.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.870
Now, right there I'm
going to put the answer.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.110
I'm going to put the
answer, and for me, this

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.220
was the highlight
of the whole thing.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.200
I didn't know what would come
out of variation of parameters.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.790
I wasn't-- I'm not at
all an expert in that.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:30.970
But I just followed the
rules, put in these two

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.350
null solutions, computed
W, put it all in,

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.250
ended up with this
answer, and then I

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.080
was very happy to recognize
what this answer was.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.600
This answer is the integral
of something times--

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:56.060
This is the integral from 0 to
t of something times f of T, dT.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.530
And what is that something?

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:04.010
It comes from that term divided
by this with a minus sign,

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.930
and this term divided by
that with a minus sign,

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.770
and when you put
those in, what do you

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.660
get but the impulse response.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.119
What I've called g of t.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.470
And it's that t minus T.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.940
So here you go.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.619
This is the big moment.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:31.220
g of t minus capital
T, f of T, dT.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.140
Focus camera and attention
on that last result.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.150
So that's the formula
that we end up

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:43.820
with from the
variation of parameters

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.970
applied to the constant
coefficient problem.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.800
It's given us what
we already knew.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:57.240
It's told us that the solution,
the particular solution, y of t

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:05.630
is the integral of the
inputs, the right-hand side,

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:13.520
the forcing term, f of T, times
the growth term, the impulse

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.710
response.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:18.450
We could imagine
that at every time T,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.990
we have an impulse
of size f of T.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.060
And that impulse
grows by the impulse

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:31.750
response, g, over the remaining
time until it gets us to here.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.770
Let me just clean that up.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.630
And then we have to
take all those inputs,

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:45.940
so we integrate over all those
inputs, and we get that answer.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.070
That's the ultimate
formula for the solution

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.240
to our differential
equations, to

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.730
our linear constant coefficient
differential equation.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.940
So we've reproduced that
formula in the one case,

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:06.200
constant coefficient case, when
we can find the null solutions

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.450
and run this variation of
parameters formula right

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.090
through to the end,
and that's the end.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.880
Thank you.
