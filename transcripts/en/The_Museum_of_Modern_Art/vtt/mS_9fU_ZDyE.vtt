00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.500
Ok, so we’re set up right?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.200
Is that right?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Yep

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.480
Um should we?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.879
Should we test this out visually?

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.150
How does this look?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.289
Looks good.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.560
It looks really good.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:33.230
Today’s order, and more or less the rules
of which every team has been given is 30 minutes

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.730
total.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.489
So 20 minutes of presentation and 10 minutes of discussion, question and answer

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.489
Tilt it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.489
Let’s go the other way

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.489
This way?

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.489
Yeah

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.489
Well, no.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.489
No, no.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.489
You know it’s a little bit tongue in cheek
of the idea of the event horizon, its kind

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.489
of like...its not the party at the end of
the world, but its kind of like the summer

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.699
warm-up and this idea of this like unknown
event that’s going to take place.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.079
Ryan stayed up late last night

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:06.180
I stayed up pretty late last night, so I apologize
for any of the like free speech that comes

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.920
out.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.640
Sometimes you make things and then when you
look at them you’re like ‘wow I can’t

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.890
believe I made that, that’s a little bit
outside my comfort zone.’

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.009
But I guess that’s the whole point of doing
competitions like this is you find things

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:34.680
out about yourself you didn’t quite know,
so…

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:45.720
Look at this cutie

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.840
The project, essentially is knitted light,
and embodies a co-produced materiality between

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.350
people, individuals and a collective group,
and the way that they engage with the project

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.710
through adaptive and responsive materials
and changing programs that shift from day

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.450
to night.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.190
And so it was really important to me in the
context of the presentation to have a number

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.730
of ways of expressing that, and so virtual
reality allows for a really immersive experience.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.709
So sorry, tell me again?

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.720
So the two buttons on the side here will allow
you to move around.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.290
Right.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.400
And if you click the trigger it’ll change
from day to night.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:48.410
If it’s about seeing something new, and
making a statement about what YAP is in its

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.410
18th year

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.410
Yeah

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.640
There is really only one choice.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.710
Yeah, I agree.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.880
You wanna call for a vote Sean?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.380
Alright.
