00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:10.130
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.630
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Akile Gursoy,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.720
thank you for agreeing
to be with us today.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.360
I know that you are an accomplished
chairman of the department

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.570
of anthropology at the
university here in Turkey.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.630
That you have written,
that you have researched,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.060
that you're working
on issues of women.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.860 position:56%
And you gave an absolutely wonderful
keynote speech at the conference,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.960
the [inaudible] conference
here in Istanbul.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.050 position:56%
And the Library of Congress who's
filming this whole thing was wanting

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.880
very much to have you
to highlight the profile

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.530
of such an accomplished
woman as yourself.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.260
I would very much like to know
something about your background.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.350
How did you become
who you are today?

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800
And so do give us an idea.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.100
Where you were you born?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.470
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Thank you very
much for all your compliments.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.890
You put me in a sort
of central big light.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.530
For myself, I was born in Ankara,
at the capital city of Turkey.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.610
My parents and their
families come from the Balkans

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.010
and from Central Anatolia.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.790
And I was educated
initially in Ankara.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.710
Coming from the a political family,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.500
we had a lot of some
upheavals in our life course.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.380
So I continued my high
school education in Istanbul,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.810
and later I went to England
to Cheltenham Ladies' College

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.420
to pick up my A levels there.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.870
I went to university in English

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.410
to Durham University
to study anthropology.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.190
But after I finished, all the rest
of my life I came back to Turkey,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.970
and I have been working
in my home country.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.560
Teaching at the university.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.600
For a couple of years, I worked in
Eastern Turkey in a health project

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.030 position:56%
in trying to reduce child mortality.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.070
That was some, for me it was
a significant part of my life.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.390
I have, I am presently
trying to build a department

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.290
in a newly founded
university in Istanbul.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.590
So this is.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.330
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Is
it a private university?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.850
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: It is
a foundation university.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.790
It is not exactly private maybe in
the sense of being totally private.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.240
But in Turkey we have a history
and a traditional foundations.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.320
And this is a modern foundation.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.630
So it is, in one sense
it is very closely linked

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.840
to this central state
university system,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.180
but at the same time it has an
independent private functioning

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.910
nature to it.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.060
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: How did
your family influence you?

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.420
You said you came from
a political family.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.400
And tell me a little
bit about your family.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.700
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: I, yes.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.850
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: I heard, I
heard some rumors, but tell me,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.320
your grandfather plays a
very important role in.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.280
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Well,
my grandfather was,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.410
he was the last prime
minister of [inaudible].

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.210
He was with him in his last years.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.000
They were very good friends.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.290
And later the way history
developed, he was the president

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.960
of Turkey between 1950 and 1960.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.790
So that is my one generation
political background.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.670
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Legacy, that's right.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.970
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Legacy.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.580
And my mother, she was also
a member of parliament.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.100
Due to political circumstances
later in her life, she had decided

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.230
that it would be a good
idea to end her politics.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.040
So she was involved in politics,
she was a member of parliament

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.750
for I think almost ten years.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.020
But for myself, I am much
committed to academic life,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.470
to wanting to work
with young people.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.480
This comes as a priority in me.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.370
I do not have much interest
in daily actual politics.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.730
Politics, politics.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.580
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So
you had wonderful mother,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.870
but you created your own
niche, your own way of life.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.170
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: I think so.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.470
I was.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.770
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: You
chose your own way.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.070
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Yes, yes.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.340
But in my family, I can say
that from my childhood onwards,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.910
I think this is something
that holds for many children,

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.030
many women for our
part of the world.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.010
My family was very much
interested in my education.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.040
My father, my grandfather,
and my mother.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.470
They had high expectancy
of how we would perform.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.930
Not just myself, but my sisters.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.020
They were very interested in our
grades and how we did at school.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.960
So I think we got a lot of
backing from them morally.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.410
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Support is very important.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.900
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Support is very
important for women, I think.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.130
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: But what got
you interested in anthropology?

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.490
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Yes, people
are always asking this

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.100
because it's not a very usual.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.400
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Usual, no.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Usual subject area.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.440
I think had I never gone out
of my own country to study,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.130
maybe I would not at all
have realized that there is

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.650
such a discipline as anthropology.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.820
But I think moving away from
home at a very young age

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.710
and entering a boarding
school in England,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.020
it suddenly made me realize
how there can be very

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.420
different lifestyles.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.890
How people can think differently,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.580
live their daily courses
very differently.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.940
So this lead me to think

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.450
about different customs,
different societies.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.530
And in my final year at
Cheltenham Ladies' College,

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:26.350
we were receiving a lot of
advice, advisory from the teachers.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.100
And when we talked about
these interested, you know,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.050
I said I'm really interested
how food can be different,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.850
beliefs can be different,
lifestyles, everything, music.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.530
So she started giving me books on
anthropology, and the more I read,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.040
the more I became interested

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.850
in how throughout the whole
world all these different

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.410
lifestyles coexist.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.110
I ended up studying anthropology.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.210
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And you focused
on Turkey in your PhD dissertation.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.510
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Yes.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.470
My PhD dissertation was so
when I came back to Turkey.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.080
Of course, then I started
family of my own.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.610
I was married, I have a son.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:17.340
And much as I would have liked to,
I did not go abroad to do research.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.210
I did all my research
work here in Turkey

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.960
which is a very large country.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.870
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.600
And a very rich one, too.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.280
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: A very rich one.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.580
So my.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.880
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
And what was your.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.180
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: PhD, yes.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.990
My PhD dissertation topic was on
women workers in a tea backing

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.760
and brewery factory in Ankara.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.840
I looked at their relationship
with the syndicates

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.210
and how their adaptation
to city life

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.310
and how they managed their
lives working as workers

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.270
in this tea packing factory.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:02.750
So my PhD research topic was in a
way on the anthropology of labor,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.650
on urbanization, on women's issues.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:11.870
But as soon as I completed my
PhD topic before I had time

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:17.050
to even develop it further,
I had this offer from UNICEF.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.050
They asked me if I
would be interested

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.910
in being their communications
officer

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.470 position:56%
for this program they were starting.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:32.470
And the program had one foot at
the Turkish Ministry of Health.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.260
This was in the 1980s.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.480
The other part was
Southeastern part of Turkey.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.580
So I quit academic life.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.890
I thought I would never
come back to academia,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.530
that I would spend the rest of
my life doing development work

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:55.340
and working in villages in small
towns around health issues.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.740
So I joined them for two years,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.450
and that was a very
enriching experience for me.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.750
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Actually, that's wonderful

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.530
because I had exactly
the same experience.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.330
I joined UNICEF as well
and worked with women

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.700
and children in villages
for a while.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.170
But then you came back
after a while, that's it.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.440
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: I was
maybe a little frustrated

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.820
or maybe a little too idealistic.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.040
I felt I was not able to do as much

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.700
as I felt I should be doing
given the circumstances.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:34.870
So I moved myself out from UNICEF
and started looking for a job.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.770
And among, there was a period
of time I was searching

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.030
for a job, something to do.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.590
And my son was very
young at the time,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.170
so it was not very easy
committing myself to jobs

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:54.310
that would require a lot of
travel, a lot of other commitments.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:10:01.440
And eventually I entered a
very large state university

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.160
in Istanbul, Marmara University.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.290
I worked there for about 15 years.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.230
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: In the
anthropology department?

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.520
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: They had
no anthropology department.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.030
I worked, it was, again,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.960
a university that was
big in formation.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.500
Throughout my life, I seem
to have entered places

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.290
where they are in a
stage of formation.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: But that's always
exciting because you [inaudible].

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.240
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: That's true.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.240
You kind of help the
structure being formed.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.990
I found myself eventually
at the Department

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:39.760
of International Relations,
so I have also studied a lot

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.900
of their theories and I'm familiar

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.790
about the international
relations' outlook to life as well.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:52.610
But when I was there in my
last years, we were trying

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:58.510
to form a social science department
with my colleagues, sociologists,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.830
anthropologists, psychologists.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.230
And as we were trying to achieve
this in a state university,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:13.810
the way things developed, I had
an offer from Yeditepe University

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.040
to come and develop the
anthropology department

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.250
which became a very
exciting offer for me,

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.480
and I changed my life course.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.780
And that is what I have been doing.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.680
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And you, in
a way, established it, isn't it?

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.580 position:56%
I mean, the anthropology department?

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.130
Or you expanded it.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.860
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: I
established it, I guess.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.300
And I would like to expand it more.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.920
We have some very interesting
courses being taught.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.170
We have very, I believe,
very good students.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:46.680
One of them is presently right now
in Mongolia studying Shamanism.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.270
We have very interesting projects.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.780
I'm very happy to be there,
and I hope for some years

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.050
to come I will stay and continue
to develop the department.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.700
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And it
is important, you know,

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.600
to work on the culture
and the society.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.850
And as you said, you know,
those very first ideas

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.210
that got you excited in
anthropology, sort of all the ones

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.260
that you're following
through now with your work

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.560
in anthropology, isn't it?

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Yes, in that sense
I think I am lucky I am doing things

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.340
that are still relevant to my
own significances in my mind.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.150
Of course, there's also a lot

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.620
of administrative work
I do, but [laughs].

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.760
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: We all
have to do some of it.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.350
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: To do some of
the things that maybe we would

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.490
like to diminish time wise, yes.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.790
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
But in your students,

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.340
you find the same excitement
about anthropology,

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.930
about studying the culture
in the students you have

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.690
in the anthropology department?

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.050
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: I think I do.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.170
I think despite the fact
that now there is a kind

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.570 position:56%
of generational difference, I think.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:03.020
I see this maybe in my son, in
all the young people I meet.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.980
They have a different way
of relating to issues,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.390
to how they will spend their time.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.170
They are maybe much more
realistic about certain things.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.950
But they are, I think,
committed, and they are ready

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.490
to give a lot from themselves.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.300
They work hard, so I'm
very happy with them.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.760
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: That's great.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.930
Well, thank you so much, Akile.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.950
And thank you for sharing these
wonderful experiences with us.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.260
And I know that many will
follow in your footsteps,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.480
and I'm sure you're
going to be inspiring,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.110
and you are inspiring your
students and many beyond that,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.840
beyond Turkey and outside.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.140
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Thank you.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.440
You are very kind.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.660
I will look forward to listening
to all of the other interviews.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.570
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: You have
made a major contribution

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.170
to it, to our program.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:00.400
Not only with your
presentation yesterday but also

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.300
with sharing your personal
ideas and hopes and wishes.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.600
&gt;&gt; Akile Gursoy: Thank
you very much.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.790
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank
you so much, Akile.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.660
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
