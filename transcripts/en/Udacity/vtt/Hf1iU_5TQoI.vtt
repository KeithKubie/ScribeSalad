00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.740
I want to start off our discussion,
with a little exercise where we try to

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.330
find an upper bound on
the value of a linear program.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.970
We'll start with this one here, and

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.010
we're going to take a linear combination
of these inequality constraints,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.600
to obtain an upper bound
on the objective function.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.330
Multiplying the first inequality by y1,
and the second by y2.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
And adding them together gives
us this inequality here.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.950
Where I have collected terms.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.270
Note that it's important
that the y's be non-negative

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.280
to avoid reversing the inequalities.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.678
Note that if we choose y1, and

00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:41.138
y2 such that 2 y1- y2 is at least 6.

00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:46.864
And also that, y1 + 2 y2, is at least
negative 2, well then this becomes,

00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:52.600
an upper bound on the objective
function, for our linear program.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.440
And for the exercise,
I want you to choose y1 and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.580
y2, to make this bound
as tight as possible.
