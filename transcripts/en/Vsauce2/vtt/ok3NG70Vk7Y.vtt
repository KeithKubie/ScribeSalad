00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.819
The nICE mug invented by Glenn Auerbach lets
you drink your beverage out of a mug made

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:05.819
of ice.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.950
And an inventor in Portland has created a
new type of mattress specially designed for

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.929
the perfect night of cuddling.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:12.929
Vsauce!

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.630
Kevin here.... this is Mind Blow

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.650
Engineers at Stanford University have invented
a microbial battery to create electricity

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.920
from poop.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.910
The prototype is the size of a D-battery and
uses naturally-occurring wired microbes that

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.570
produce electricity as they digest plant and
animal waste.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.590
And they hope that one day they can use a
similar system on a large scale in sewage

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.260
treatment plants to create great amounts of
electricity.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.590
Researchers at IK4-CIDETEC have made a polymer
that has the ability to repair itself.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.530
They cut the material in half and without
the need of any catalyst or stimulus, it fully

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.210
recovered its mechanical properties after
simply being left for two hours at room temperature.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.100
The applications for this discovery can help
in industrial applications, electrical and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.070
automotive sectors, various construction,
and developing biomaterials.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.840
Pioneer has created a new AR-HUD navigation
system that superimposes information onto

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.990
the windshield.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.299
It gives the driver the ability to see navigation
and other important information right in front

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.969
of them without having to take their eyes
off the road.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.590
It uses a laser and a concave half mirror
to project the image.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.920
It even includes information like parking
and restaurants that are nearby so you don't

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.369
have to distracted looking for anything.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.149
I'm just a bird.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.650
Layin' on another bird.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.119
"Just Mayo" and "Beyond eggs" are new products
looking to replace eggs with plants.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.540
The makers claim the plant-based artificial
eggs do a great job with baking cakes and

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.229
making mayonnaise but have yet to master scrambled
eggs.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.149
YOBOT is a robot that's solving luggage management
problems at a hotel called Yotel, in New York

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.149
City.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.850
With the push of a button guests can have
their luggage sent to nearby airports.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.720
You simply choose your airport and your terminal
and Yobot will send it there before you get

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
there.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.500
They're currently looking into creating an
app that let's you track your luggage on its

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.650
way and in the future they hope to create
a way to not only send luggage but also people

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.990
to their airport destinations.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.990
So yeah.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.890
The MINIR is a minimally invasive neurosurgical
intracranial robot.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.950
Created at the Maryland Robotics Center, the
idea is that this little robot could suck

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.110
out cancerous tissue from the human brain.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.920
And it's special because it can be used while
the person is undergoing an MRI.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.040
Since the MRI maps the tumor in real time
even as it shifts during surgery the robot

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.180
will be able to effectively remove all the
cancerous tissue.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.430
Charalampos Loannou of Greece created this
movement enhancing glove for the Google science

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.430
fair.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.280
The idea came to him when he saw his grandmother
having difficulty picking up the TV remote

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.520
due to a lack of mobility in her hands.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.040
It has pressure sensors and motors that can
adjust the strength to the object being grasped.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.040
He created the glove so the wearer can gain
back the strength to do every day tasks like

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.760
picking up objects.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.730
Boeing's Unmanned Little Bird is the first
full-size autonomous helicopter.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.540
And it even has the ability to land itself.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.520
The sensor in the helicopter maps the terrain,
plans routes, checks for a landing site's

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.800
safety, and avoids obstacles.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.540
Most auto pilot programs that are used now
are only for cruising and all of the decision

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.820
making is still left to the human controlling
the aircraft.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.290
It's a first for robotic aviation and since
the job of a medevac pilot is extremely dangerous

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.810
- they hope that this will save the lives
of pilots in the future.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.050
Finally, if you haven't seen this yet it's
an incredible video called Box from Bot And

00:03:43.050 --> 00:04:01.210
Dolly that uses projection-mapping on moving
objects...

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.790
I'm gonna leave you with a guy hitting an
egg in mid air with a boomerang and then catching

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.790
it.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:05:03.089
And as always - thanks for watching!
