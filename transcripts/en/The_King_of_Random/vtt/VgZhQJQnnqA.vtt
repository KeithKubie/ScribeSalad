00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.300
Here's' how you can become the coolest person on the block by building a device to make it rain candy!

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
I started this project with a trip to my home
improvement store for these PVC parts.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.350
I'm gonna get the hard stuff out of the
way, so I'll measure different lengths of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.330
schedule 40 PVC pipe and start cutting. I'm
mainly using 2" and 1" pipe for the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.660
cannon, and 1 1/4" pipe for the detonator.
A chop saw worked well for me, but

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.280
I had to be careful because sometimes things
like that happen.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.760
All the pipe is now cut to the lengths I want,
and before I glue the pieces in place

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.630
permanently, I'm gonna dry fit them all
together to see how they fit. My design

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.030
is for 2 separate 12" air tanks, joined together
with 1" pipe, and connecting to an

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.170
in-line sprinkler valve. I'm also gonna
add a manual ball valve and an end cap

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.979
that I'll thread a pneumatic adaptor onto
later. This 90 degree elbow will be my

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.419
base for a 2 foot tube of 2" PVC pipe that
will act as my cannon barrel.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.300
It's looking really good and I'm very happy
with the design so it's time to glue it up.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.850
I'll use some purple primer to get the PVC
ready for gluing, making sure to put a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.139
coating on all the parts that will be connected.

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:29.520
Now I've finished gluing it back together
using PVC cement and am adding some

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.289
thread tape to these connector nipples to
ensure an air tight seal. I expect this

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.769
system will be pressurized around 135 PSI
and this should help prevent leaks.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.030
It's time for a pressure test. I'm gonna
start around 60 PSI and test for leaks,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.279
then slowly work my way up over 100.

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:47.469
I've closed off the manual valve and disconnected
the air hose and I don't hear

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.979
any air leaking, so I'm going to test the
sprinkler valve release by shorting it out

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.719
on this 9 volt battery. It's actually a 24
volt valve, but a single 9 volt battery seems

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.159
to work fine for this purpose.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.520
And the valve works great, so it's time to
wire up the detonator.

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:04.099
I'll take the 1 1/4" cap and drill a hole
just big enough to insert a

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.719
momentary switch, and then I'll drill a 1/8"
hole in the bottom cap, to feed my

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.890
wire through. This is doorbell wire and I'll
tie it in a knot to prevent it from pulling

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.700
back through the cap again. Now I can add
the 1 1/4" x 4" pipe body to the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.380
base, and then prep the wires for a good connection.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.180
I'll wire the momentary switch in series with
the battery and sprinkler valve,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.120
then give it a quick test to verify it's all
working correctly. Perfect! It's all working

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.970
great so I'll secure the switch, and tuck
the battery and wires into the detonator body.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.640
Now I'm wrapping the wire around some scrap
1" pipe, it to give it a neat

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.820
coiled look, then I'll get to work on a wad
for the barrel.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.530
This is the piece that will push the candy
up and out, and I'm going to make it out

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.180
of these plastic cups. I'll cut the bottom
quarter inch off the bigger cup, and then

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.900
shave about quarter inch from the top of a
3oz cup. When joined together they

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.810
make a perfect fit into the 2" barrel and
when it's time to load the candy, I'll push

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.460
them to the bottom with a makeshift ramrod.
These are super cheap and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.840
surprisingly durable, but still gentle enough
to convert this cannon into an

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.460
Epic water balloon launcher! Look for that
in another video!

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.930
Alright, this system is looking pretty good,
but I want it to look amazing. So I'll

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.040
clean off the UPC stickers with some adhesive
remover, and then

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.000
spray paint it red and black.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Everything is back together, and I'm really
happy with how this is looking.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.280
The daunting question now is, will it work,
or was this all for nothing?

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.840
Time to test it out.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.430
The plastic cups are in place, and I'm using
these jelly candies for practice.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.390
It's ready to go in 3 … 2 … 1 … FIRE!

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.340
Amazing!

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.760
These candies shot up around 100 feet in the
air, and completely covered the back

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.820
yard, making an exciting candy hunt for my
kids, and a hit novelty at the birthday party.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.600
Well I'll call that an epic success!

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.580
