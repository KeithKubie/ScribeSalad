00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:01.123
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

00:00:01.123 --> 00:00:02.874
we set up a random variable x,

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:04.409
which was defined as the number of heads

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:07.291
from flipping a fair coin five times,

00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:08.824
and then we figured out the probability

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:10.602
that our random variable
could take on the value

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:13.767
zero, one, two, three, four, or five,

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.942
and just to visualize that, in this video,

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:17.257
we will actually plot these,

00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:18.374
and we'll get a sense of

00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:21.675
this random variable's
probability distribution.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:23.700
So let's do that.

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:25.875
Actually, maybe I'll do it like this,

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.243
so that we can see the probabilities.

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:34.373
Actually, let me erase this
business right over here.

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:36.542
Whoops, that's not working.

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:39.324
Here, that might work.

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:42.706
Let me erase this real fast,

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:44.824
these little scribbles
that I had off-screen,

00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:48.874
and then we can actually
plot the distribution.

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:51.708
Alright, so at one axis,

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:54.025
I'm gonna put all of
the different outcomes.

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:56.844
So let me...

00:00:56.844 --> 00:01:00.833
That looks like a pretty straight line,

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:06.148
and then at this axis, I'm
going to plot the probabilities.

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:10.791
And that looks like a
pretty straight line,

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.041
and let's see what the probabilities are.

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.925
We have, let's see,

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.919
it's all gonna be in terms of 32nds,

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:20.358
and we get as high as 10/32,

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:23.235
so let's say this right over here is

00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:26.175
10/32,

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:31.673
half-way up there, we have two 5/32,

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:34.424
so let's see, that looks like about half,

00:01:34.424 --> 00:01:38.641
that right over there is 5/32,

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:41.720
and then 1/32 would be about this,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.742
that's one, two, let's see...

00:01:43.742 --> 00:01:47.391
If I were to split it
up, one, two, three...

00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:49.664
Actually let me do it a little bit...

00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:53.240
One, two, three,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.154
four, five.

00:01:55.154 --> 00:01:59.241
Alright, so let's say this
is 1/32 right over here,

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.943
and our probabilities,
so this right over here,

00:02:02.943 --> 00:02:06.083
probability, so this is the values

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:08.274
that the random variable could take on,

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:11.193
so I'll just make a little histogram here,

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:14.914
so x equals zero,

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:17.482
and the probability there,

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:19.775
and actually since I
want to do a histogram,

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:22.224
it will look like this,

00:02:22.224 --> 00:02:24.541
so let me do it a little bit different.

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.078
So, put it right here,

00:02:27.078 --> 00:02:30.479
so x is equal to zero.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.958
Right there, the probability is 1/32,

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.091
and I can shade that in.

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.641
Now, over the probability
that x equals one,

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.492
x equals one is 5/32,

00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:43.942
so let me draw that,

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:46.712
so 5/32,

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:50.153
so, put the bar there,

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.918
so let me shade that in,

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:55.169
so this right over here

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.368
is the probability that x is equal to one,

00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:01.184
that we get one, that one, exactly one,

00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:04.768
out of the five flips result in heads.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.585
Now we have the probability x equals two.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:10.286
x equals two is 10/32,

00:03:10.286 --> 00:03:12.846
so that's going to look like this.

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:22.122
Alright, my best attempt
at hand-drawing it.

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:28.949
Somehow I like the aesthetics
of hand-drawn things more.

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.716
Sometimes if you just get
a computer to graph it,

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:31.531
I don't know, sometimes,

00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:33.633
it loses a little bit of its personality.

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:37.449
Alright, so that right over
there is the probability

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.666
that our random variable
x is equal to two.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.766
Then we have the probability
that x equals three,

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:45.951
which is also 10/32.

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:50.546
So that is also 10/32,

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.670
so let me draw that.

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:57.394
So this is also 10/32,

00:03:58.025 --> 00:03:59.904
shade this in.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.383
Dum-de-dum-de-dum, alright.

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:08.567
I find this strangely
therapeutic. (chuckling)

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:11.193
Alright, so this is the probability

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:14.093
that x is equal to three.

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:17.757
Now x equals four, that's 5/32.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.854
So we go back right over here,

00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:23.193
and that's 5/32.

00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:27.697
So, shade that one in.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:33.350
So this right over here
is x is equal to four,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.462
and then finally, the probability

00:04:34.462 --> 00:04:38.116
that x equals five is 1/32 again.

00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.351
Same level as this right over here,

00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.936
shade it in, so this right over here is,

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.334
our random variable x equaling five.

00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:48.735
And so, when you visually show

00:04:48.735 --> 00:04:50.384
this probability distribution,
it's important to realize,

00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:52.701
this is a discrete
probability distribution.

00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:54.951
This is a discrete random variable.

00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:56.810
It can only take on

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.238
a finite number of values.

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:01.084
Actually, I should say it's a

00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:02.834
finite discrete random variable.

00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:04.784
You could have something that
takes on discrete values,

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:06.485
but in theory, it could take on

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.151
an infinite number of discrete values.

00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:10.301
You could just keep counting
higher and higher and higher.

00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:11.518
But this is discrete, in that

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:14.035
it's these whole, these particular values.

00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:15.818
It can't take on any value in between,

00:05:15.818 --> 00:05:16.876
and it's also finite.

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:19.262
It can only take on x
equals zero, x equals one,

00:05:19.262 --> 00:05:22.035
x equals two, x equals
three, x equals four,

00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:23.834
or x equals five,

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:28.284
and you see when you plot
its probability distribution,

00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:30.955
this discrete probability distribution,

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:35.578
it starts at 1/32, it goes up,
and then it comes back down,

00:05:35.578 --> 00:05:37.568
and it has this symmetry,

00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:40.377
and a distribution like
this, this right over here,

00:05:40.377 --> 00:05:41.985
a discrete distribution like this,

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:44.584
we call this a binomial distribution,

00:05:44.584 --> 00:05:45.700
and we'll talk in the future

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.235
about why it's called a
binomial distribution,

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:51.851
but a big clue...

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.550
Actually, I'll tell you why

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.351
it's called a binomial distribution,

00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:56.318
is that these probabilities,

00:05:56.318 --> 00:05:59.366
you can get them using
binomial coefficients,

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:00.784
using combinatorics.

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:02.117
In another video, we'll talk about,

00:06:02.117 --> 00:06:04.235
especially when we talk
about the binomial theorem,

00:06:04.235 --> 00:06:07.554
why we even call those
things binomial coefficients.

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:11.667
It's really based on taking
powers of binomials in algebra,

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:15.186
but this is a very, very, very,
very important distribution.

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:16.701
It's very important in statistics,

00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:21.337
because for a lot of discrete processes,

00:06:21.337 --> 00:06:24.568
one might assume that the
underlying distribution

00:06:24.568 --> 00:06:26.485
is a binomial distribution,
and when we get

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.605
further into statistics,

00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:31.695
we'll talk why people do that.

00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:34.729
Now, if you were to have

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.735
much more than five cases here,

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:38.217
if, instead of saying
that the number of heads

00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:40.018
from flipping a coin five times, you said,

00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:41.568
x is equal to the number of heads

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:45.200
of flipping a coin five million times,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.926
then, you can imagine,
you'd have much, much...

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:50.018
The bars would get narrower and narrower

00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:53.117
relative to the whole hump,
and what it would start to do,

00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:57.468
it would start to approach
something that looks really,

00:06:57.468 --> 00:07:00.082
something that looks
really like a bell curve.

00:07:00.082 --> 00:07:00.935
I think I'm gonna do that in a color

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:03.867
that you can see better,
that I haven't used yet.

00:07:03.867 --> 00:07:05.664
So, it would start to look...

00:07:05.664 --> 00:07:07.993
So if you had more and more of these,

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:10.865
if you had more and more
of these possibilities,

00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:13.735
it's going to start approaching

00:07:13.735 --> 00:07:15.935
what looks like a bell curve,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.485
and you've probably heard
the notion of a bell curve,

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:21.384
and the bell curve is
a normal distribution.

00:07:21.384 --> 00:07:24.402
So one way to think about it,
is the normal distribution

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.034
is a probability density function.

00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:27.367
It's a continuous case.

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:29.318
So, the yellow one,

00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:32.500
that we're approaching
a normal distribution,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.450
and a normal distribution, in
kind of the classical sense,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.151
is going to keep going on and on,

00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:42.818
normal distribution, and
it's related to the binomial.

00:07:42.818 --> 00:07:45.051
You know, a lot of times in statistics,

00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:47.019
people will assume a normal distribution,

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:48.735
because you can say, okay,
it's the product of kind of

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:52.885
an almost an infinite number
of random processes happening.

00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:55.318
Here, we're taking a coin, and
we're flipping it five times,

00:07:55.318 --> 00:07:57.801
but if you imagine molecules interacting,

00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:58.986
or humans interacting, you're saying,

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:01.652
oh, there's almost an infinite
number of interactions,

00:08:01.652 --> 00:08:04.200
and then that's going to result
in a normal distribution,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.518
which is very, very important
in science and statistics.

00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:12.485
Binomial distribution is the
discrete version of that,

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:14.068
and one little point of notion,

00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:16.134
these are where the distributions are,

00:08:16.134 --> 00:08:17.084
this is where they come from,

00:08:17.084 --> 00:08:17.901
this is how they're related.

00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:21.377
If you kind of think about as
you get more and more trials,

00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:23.217
the binomial distribution
is going to really

00:08:23.217 --> 00:08:25.001
approach the normal distribution,

00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:26.000
but it's really important to think about

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.269
where these things come from,

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:29.385
and we'll talk about it
much more in a statistics,

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:31.569
because it is reasonable to assume

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:33.268
an underlying binomial distribution,

00:08:33.268 --> 00:08:34.300
or normal distribution,

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.569
for a lot of different types of processes,

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:39.401
but sometimes it's not, and
even in things like economics,

00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:41.117
sometimes people assume
a normal distribution

00:08:41.117 --> 00:08:42.818
when it's actually much more likely

00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:44.584
that the things on the
ends are going to happen,

00:08:44.584 --> 00:08:46.685
which might lead to things
like economic crises,

00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:48.050
or whatever else.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.652
But anyway, I don't want to get off-topic.

00:08:49.652 --> 00:08:51.750
The whole point here
is just to appreciate,

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.519
hey, we started with this random variable,

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:56.018
the number of heads from
flipping a coin five times,

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:57.884
and we plotted it, and
we were able to see,

00:08:57.884 --> 00:09:00.341
we were able to visualize
this binomial distribution,

00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:01.351
and I'm kind of telling you,

00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:02.652
I haven't really shown you,

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:05.401
that if you were to have
many, many more flips,

00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:08.050
and you defined the random
variable in a similar way,

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.551
then this histogram, this bar chart,

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.318
is gonna look a lot
more like a bell curve,

00:09:14.318 --> 00:09:16.318
and if you had essentially
an infinite number of them,

00:09:16.318 --> 00:09:16.902
you would start having

00:09:16.902 --> 00:09:18.694
a continuous probability distribution,

00:09:18.694 --> 00:09:20.784
or, I should say,
probability density function,

00:09:20.784 --> 00:09:24.784
and that would get us closer
to a normal distribution.
