00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.689
We’re almost there guys, we’re almost
done with winter.

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.750
Hang in there, please don’t be sad anymore.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.360
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.500
Dudes, i get it.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
winter sucks.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.750
its why i moved to California.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.650
In winter its miserably dark and cold and
you just want to stay inside, sleep all the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.020
time, you lose all interest in your hobbies,
everything seems meaningless.. wait.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.300
that sounds a lot like depression.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.790
Is winter blues a thing?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.820
Is seasonal affective disorder real?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.590
Well for 1 out of ten people it is.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.920
according to a review published in Physician
and Sportsmedicine.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.039
Other studies suggest that number could be
as high as 1 person in 6 in high latitude

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.309
areas like Glasgow or Moscow.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.120
Symptoms are pretty similar to depression,
like feeling down and sluggish.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.780
With SAD energy level decreases too but it’s
more common for people to eat more, especially

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.249
starches, and to sleep a lot.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.249
ur r

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:07.540
So how does this happen?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.960
Well one popular idea is that during the winter
you get exposed to less sunlight and that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.229
makes you sad.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.729
Sunlight contains two forms of light, ultraviolet
A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB).

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.420
Your skin needs UVB to make vitamin D. Shorter
days in the winter means less sun, and makes

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.630
you less likely to get your daily dose of
vitamin D. Vitamin D does a lot of things,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.970
but it’s involved in the synthesis of serotonin
and dopamine in the brain, the two chemicals

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.369
usually identified as playing a role in depression.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.490
A review published in the journal Medical
Hypotheses looked at bunch of other studies

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.710
and found that vitamin D deficiency was likely
to be a contributing factor in SAD.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.020
But what if it’s a kind of hibernation?

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.659
Recently the sleep tracking app “Sleep Cycle”
said that among their users, people in snowier

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.350
states sleep longer than those in sunnier
states.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.909
On average they slept about 13 minutes longer.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.240
Maybe that’s not the most scientific data,
BUT those who suffer from SAD often sleep

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.060
more and are more tired during the day.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.500
They have an increased appetite and often
gain weight.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.290
This sounds a lot like what happens during
hibernation, which is a way for animals to

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.200
conserve energy during winter months when
food availability changes.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.860
In animals, hibernation is controlled by a
lot of processes throughout the brain and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.860
in the body.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.950
One of which is the production of melatonin.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.000
Hibernating animals produce it for longer
during the winter months.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.230
One study in the Archives of General Psychology
found a similar thing in people with SAD,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.170
the period of production of melatonin at night
was longer in winter months than in summer.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.030
Healthy people didn’t have this pattern.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.600
Either way, hibernation or not, it’s annoying
and there is something you can do if you suffer

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600
from SAD.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.060
You can get vitamin D from fatty fish like
tuna.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.730
Lightboxes, which aren’t approved or regulated
by the FDA are said to trick your body into

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.480
thinking it’s sitting in daylight.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.370
One study published in the American Journal
of Psychiatry found that lightboxes are just

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.250
as effective as antidepressants and help patients
feel better sooner and with less side effects.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.320
Alright, what about you?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.880
Do you feel pretty bleh in the winter?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.150
