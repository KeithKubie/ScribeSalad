00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
 

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.730
You go for a job interview.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.380
And the first thing that your
interviewer says is, look,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.080
you have great work experience.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.370
You seem like a
nice young person.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.580
But what I really care about
is your logical reasoning

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.162
capabilities.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.620
So what she says
is, just sit down.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.890
I'm going to ask you a question
about some math expressions.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.170
And you say, sure, shoot away.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.260
Give me some questions
about math expressions.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.990
And she says, all right.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.460
So you have two integers,
integer a and integer b.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.340
And she tells you that
integer a is greater than 0,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.280
and integer b is less than 0.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.290
Then she says that
we also know that a/b

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.690
is greater than a times b.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.020
So then she says, tell me
some interesting things

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.300
about a and b and
a/b and a times b.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540
And you say, OK, I'll
give my best shot.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.950
And I encourage you to
actually pause now and try

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.239
to think about how these
things might relate,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.030
or how b might be
constrained, or a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.430
might be constrained,
and then unpause it.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.840
So I assume you've
unpaused it, so let's think

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.380
about this a little bit.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.570
So the first thing, we know that
a is positive, b is negative.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.980
So if I take a positive
divided by a negative,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.720
what am I going to get?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.220
Well, this right over here, a
positive divided by a negative

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.220
is going to be a negative.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.620
What happens if I take a
positive times a negative?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.360
Well, ab is also going
to be a negative.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.957
A positive times a negative
is also a negative.

00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:34.540
So really what we're
saying is that we

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.460
have two negative quantities,
and this one right over here

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.510
is greater than that one.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.460
So let's visualize
that on a number line.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.840
So let's say that this
right over here is 0.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.860
This right over here is
the positive direction.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.230
This is the negative direction.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.220
We know both of these are
negative, but a/b is larger.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.030
So a/b is going to be to
the right of a times b.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.800
So we know that a/b,
it has to be negative.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.755
It has to be the left of 0.

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.920
a/b is going to be to
the right of a times b.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.850
 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.070
So one way to think about it is
they're both negative, but a/b

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.551
is going to be less negative.

00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:23.050
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.340
it's going to have a
smaller absolute value.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.320
Its distance from 0, which
is another way of thinking

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.182
about absolute value, its
distance to the left of 0

00:02:31.182 --> 00:02:34.674
is less than a times b's
distance to the left of 0.

00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:36.090
But because they're
both negative,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.640
and we're talking about
distances from the left of 0,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.915
the one that has a smaller
distance to the left of 0

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:44.655
is less negative, and is
therefore a greater number.

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:46.671
So, so far your interviewer
seems impressed.

00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:47.670
So that was pretty good.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.657
You were able to get a
lot of clues just out

00:02:49.657 --> 00:02:51.740
of this little bit of
information that I gave you.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.200
But tell me more.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.760
Tell me more about
what b has to be

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.190
and whether we can
constrain it in some way.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.260
And you say, well, OK.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.470
I've got some clues here, the
fact that this absolute value

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.640
right over here is going to be
less than this absolute value.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.230
We know that the
absolute value of a/b

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.010
is going to be less
than a times b,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.930
than the absolute
value of a times b.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.400
Once again, it's going
to be not as far left

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.145
of 0 as a times b is.

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:21.930
So that's how we can
make that statement.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.035
But let's actually manipulate,
algebraically manipulate

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:26.730
this inequality here.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.350
We could multiply
both sides times b.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.620
So let's do that.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.790
Let's multiply
both sides times b.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.672
b Is less than the 0.

00:03:37.672 --> 00:03:39.130
So if you're
multiplying both sides

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.760
of an inequality by
something less than 0,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.535
it swaps the inequality.

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:44.660
That's why I got rid of it.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.660
I'm going to rewrite it.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.564
So b times a/b is
going to negative.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.480
We know it's negative.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.150
So it's going to be
less than ab times b.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.580
If we just multiply it
out, these cancel out.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.860
We get a is less than
a times b squared.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.500
Well, now if we
want to simplify it,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.806
we can divide both sides by a.

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:08.180
And since a is
greater than 0, it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.830
does not change the inequality.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.240
So we divide both sides by a.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.790
This becomes 1, and this
just becomes b squared.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.780
So we're left with 1
is less than b squared.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.700
Or another way we could think
about this, we could say, well,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.390
if 1 is less than b squared,
that means that b-- let's

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.580
be careful here-- that means
that the absolute value of b

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.430
is going to be greater than 1.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.870
So this means that the absolute
value of b is greater than 1.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.720
And you say, wait,
Sal, how did you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.200
get from that to that
right over there?

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.920
Well, just think about
this a little bit.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.200
If I square something, and
if it's greater than 1--

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.051
so that means that either
b is less than negative 1,

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.050
because if it was negative
1, if you squared it,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.940
you would get 1.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.230
If it was greater than negative
1, or just directly greater

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.700
than negative 1, if it was
negative 0.99, then when

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.707
you square it, it would
be something less than 1.

00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:13.790
So that doesn't work.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.270
So b has to be less
than negative 1 or b has

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.111
to be greater than 1, because
for the same exact logic.

00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.110
If it was exactly equal
to 1, if you squared it,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.020
this would be equal.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.070
If it was 0.5, then
squared it would

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.041
be 0.25, which wouldn't
be greater than.

00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:31.790
So you know both of
these things are true.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.710
And this is another
way of saying

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.310
that the absolute value
of b is greater than 1.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.780
Now, we have our
other constraint,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.510
that b is less than 0.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.320
So since we know
b is less than 0,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.209
we can take this
out of the picture.

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:48.250
And if the absolute value
of b is greater than 1,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.820
and b is less than
0, then we know

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.050
that b has to be
less than negative 1.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.590
So wherever negative 1 is, b
is going to be less than that.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.330
And your interviewer is very
impressed and she says, look,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.300
you've done very
good reasoning here.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.933
I think you deserve the job.

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:06.433
