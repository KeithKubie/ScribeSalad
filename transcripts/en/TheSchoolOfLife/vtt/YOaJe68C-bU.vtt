00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.100
It's clear capitalism doesn't work very well at the moment

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.860
but most of us feel there isn't anything to be done

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.120
we're stuck with it because there's just no alternative

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280
That's nonsense

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.180
there are plenty of good workable suggestion for reform

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.440
and here are four of them

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.400
We have to bear in mind that capitalism isn't just one thing

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.460
There are almost as many varieties of capitalism as there are capitalist countries

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
There are american, german, singaporean, swedish, danish, korean versions of the thing

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320
The differences include the sizes of the welfare state

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.480
from around 10% of GDP in Korea to over 30% in Finland

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.460
The importance of state-owned enterprises

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.500
producing less than 1% of GDP in the US

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.520
But 22% of GDP in Singapore

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.060
And the power of trade unions,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.440
with nearly 70% of workers unionized in Norway

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.460
and only about 10% in the US.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.600
Capitalism has got dials

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.880
and we can adjust them

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.980
Think that Sweden, that supposedly high-tax-addicted country

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.600
only introduced income tax in 1932

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.420
two decades after the U.S.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.160
and nearly a century after Britain

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.980
Or remember that the US, that pro-the-rich place today

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.200
had a top income tax rate of 91% between 1915 and 1963

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.960
and it didn't do them much harm at all

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.340
so we don't have to chug capitalism in a bin

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.280
the trick is to tweak and reform it in intelligent ways

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.620
When people hear of options to adjust capitalism

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.860
for the benefit of all

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.360
they tend to think

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.560
that sounds beautiful

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.340
but in the end the 'free-est' variety

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.840
that you find in the US

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.200
will ultimately outcompete the others because it's just superior

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.000
the argument goes like this:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.140
the US variety maximizes growth by minimizing the constraints on wealth creation

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.360
which creates higher inequality

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.040
but in the end makes everyone better-off in absolute terms

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.780
than under a more equal but less dynamic system

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.020
but if you look at facts

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.400
it's overwhelmingly not true

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.220
that the freer varieties of capitalism grow faster

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.160
From 1955 to 1980, the time when regulations were much stricter,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.020
The world economy grew 2.6% per year

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.220
For the next 30 years, the heyday of neoliberal economics

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.300
it grew at only 1.3%

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.780
In its miracle growth periods between 1958 and 1982

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.880
Japan, Korea and Taiwan

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.860
had governments hell-bent on dictating business activities

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.680
and it worked rather well for them.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.800
Contrary to the popular belief,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.100
that a large welfare state is bad for economic growth,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.400
Finland, with the welfare state 1.5 times bigger than that of the US,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.820
30% of GDP as against of 20%

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.500
has grown faster than the US

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.560
with an average annual per-capita income growth rate of 2.7% for the last 40 years

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.280
against 2% in the US

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840
A well designed welfare state

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.600
with integral retraining and redeployment programs

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.760
promotes, rather than deters growth

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.840
Importantly, when people feel secure

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.360
they take risks

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.100
which is the life part of capitalism

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.100
"Secured people dare"

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.560
as the old slogan of the swedish social democratic party used to go

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.140
Unlike what some economists like to tell us

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.240
it doesn't have to be a hard choice between security and stagnation on the one hand

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.860
and perilous insecurity and economic dynamism on the other

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.580
It isn't some inevitable natural phenomenon

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.560
You sometimes hear that CEOs

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.160
need to have huge paybacks or they won't deliver the goods

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.100
but data consistently shows no relationship

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.000
between a rising executive pay

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.340
and executive performance

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.840
Then there is the claim that we redistributing wealth impoverishes everyone

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.680
but some of the most productive and wealthy countries in the world

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.340
redistribute avidly

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.660
Before redistribution throught the tax system

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.900
Germany in 2011 was a far more unequal country than the US

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.680
Germany's G.I.N.I.'s coefficient, an indicator of income inequality

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.960
in which zero means absolute equality

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.840
and 1 means absolute inequality

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.300
was at 0.51, higher than in the US, where it was 0.50

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.480
But after redistributive taxes

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.740
Germany's G.I.N.I. coefficient fell to 0.29

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.740
while the US, with a far more elite-friendly tax system

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.760
saw its G.I.N.I coefficient fall to only 0.38

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.060
Moreover, countries can limit the very ability of the market to generate inequality

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.140
through formal regulations or informal business practices

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.860
South Korea, for example,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.840
has by far the lowest rate of inequality in the developed world

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.520
with a G.I.N.I. coefficient of just 0.34

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.220
But this didn't come about by magic

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.720
rather because the country has lots of regulations

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.600
protecting some pretty nice things

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.700
like organics farms, and small shops, especially bakeries and bookshops

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.140
And it has laws that keep CEO compensation low by international standards

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.340
All this preventing the full manifestation

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.600
of the inequalizing tendencies of an unfettered market

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.640
In other words, inequality is not the result of uncontrollable forces,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.380
like technology or international trade

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.100
There are lots of tools that a society can use

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.440
in order to reduce it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.760
and a lot of the wealthiest and most dynamic countries

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.100
are using them very wisely indeed already

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.240
The rise of the financial industry is a blight on capitalism

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.580
making it unstable, unequal and very short-termist

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.200
For example, in the 1960s

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.840
if an investor bought a share on a company in the UK

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.900
they held on to it for an average of 5 years

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.280
By the mid-2000s

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.880
the number had fallen to a mere 7 months

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.020
Faced with the radically diminishing patience of their investors

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.380
companies have done a host of nasty things

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.040
to make investors happy right now

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.720
at the expense of the long term

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.060
They suppress wages

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.120
squeeze suppliers

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.840
and chug back profit at shareholders, rather than reinvesting

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.480
Between 1950 and 1970, the hundred largest US corporations retained 65% of their profits every year

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.260
But by the 200s, they were retaining a mere 6%

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.840
vastly diminishing their own abilities to invest

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.820
for a properly succesful future

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.500
It's actually rather easy to encourage long-term-oriented investment

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.420
you just need to give greater voting rights and tax advantages to long-term shareholders

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.660
and you need to have sovereign wealth funds and national pension funds

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.320
representatives of the long term collective interests

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.740
using their considerable financial power

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.000
to back long-term-oriented corporate behavior

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.860
Above all, mergers and acquisitions need to be made more difficult

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.620
as is the threat of these that typically pushes managers

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.620
towards actions that please fecal short term investors

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.260
All these schemes may seem like pipe dreams

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.320
but they're far more tantalizing than this

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.560
They're real possibilities, alive in certain favored enlightened corners of the globe right now

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.360
There is no need to give up on capitalism

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.660
We just need to understand it a little better

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.240
and stand up to arguments that bully us into accepting its worst versions.
