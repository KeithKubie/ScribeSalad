00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.885
- It is an absolute trophy, come to

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:04.771
get a close up look of that!

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.035
It also comes with a
plum sauce, but I'm just

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.618
gonna taste it just
like this, on it's own.

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:19.018
(cheery music)

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:22.949
Really quickly, before you continue

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.847
watching this video, I
wanted to let you know,

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:26.966
that I published a full Hong Kong travel

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.873
guide over on my blog, migrationology.com.

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:32.038
It includes all the details
of everything we did.

00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:35.213
Especially all of the
food and the restaurants,

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:36.838
and all the details, you'll find all

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:38.202
of that in the travel guide.

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:40.837
So I will link it below
in the description box.

00:00:40.837 --> 00:00:43.530
And also, maybe try to
link it somewhere here.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.341
But go check that out for all

00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:47.848
the details from all these videos.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.810
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Weins

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.165
from migrationology.com, in Hong Kong.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.582
It is a down pouring morning!

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.922
It's raining really hard and so

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:00.594
the only logical thing to do

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:03.508
this morning, is to go eat dim sum!

00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:05.675
(raining)

00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:10.627
(mumbling)

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.417
(clanking)

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:23.293
This restaurant is called, Sam Hui Yat,

00:01:23.293 --> 00:01:25.139
and this is just the neighborhood,

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:27.391
kind of, hole in the wall family run

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:29.864
dim sum restaurant, in Hong Kong.

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:31.094
They have all of the dim sum

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:32.742
within the bamboo trees, steaming

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:34.652
right at the front of the restaurant.

00:01:34.652 --> 00:01:37.745
And so you just pick and
choose the ones you want.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:39.266
I really love this place.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.025
This one is the shumai, and then also

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:44.281
this one, I'm not sure what this

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:45.656
one is exactly called, but my mom

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:50.083
always called this phu jute,
which is the bean curd.

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:50.916
And then I think there's minced

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:52.486
pork in the middle, this one is

00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:54.175
the classic chicken feet, had to

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:55.522
go with the chicken feet.

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:58.325
Also got some shrimp har gau, and then

00:01:58.325 --> 00:01:59.875
also some meatballs, and then my

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:01.384
personal favorite, I had this yesterday

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:03.113
as well, lo mai gai, which is

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:05.863
the treasured, sweet sticky rice.

00:02:06.712 --> 00:02:08.134
Okay, I'm gonna begin
with one of the shumai.

00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:09.567
And I think these are, I'm not sure

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:10.711
there's shrimp in this one, or

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.711
mostly just minced pork.

00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.616
That's salty and porky, and oily.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:20.055
Oh that's delightful!

00:02:20.055 --> 00:02:23.222
Let me follow that with a swig of tea.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.511
Okay I'm gonna grab some of this

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:28.261
chili sauce, put some in my bowl.

00:02:30.392 --> 00:02:32.685
Alright, while the har gau is hot and

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.863
fresh, I'm gonna have one of these,

00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:35.117
these are little shrimp dumplings.

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:38.034
Dip this into the chili sauce, that

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:43.387
is just a good, classic, har gau,

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:45.744
the sticky glutinous wrapper.

00:02:45.744 --> 00:02:48.193
And then just filled with
shrimp on the inside.

00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:50.103
Next up for the bean curd rolls.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.801
And this has been one of my
favorites since I was a kid.

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.071
I love that bean curd, and it may

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:56.737
not be the prettiest, that like

00:02:56.737 --> 00:03:00.320
crinkly bean curd, but
it tastes fantastic.

00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:07.636
Oh I love it so much, I think it's

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:10.655
stuffed with, minced pork,
mushrooms and carrots.

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:11.815
And then that skin has a little

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.982
bit of a chewiness to it, a quick dip.

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:23.428
Let me open up my package next.

00:03:23.428 --> 00:03:27.595
Oh I get excited every time
I unravel one of these.

00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:31.652
Oh, I love how it just glistens!

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.428
And you can immediately smell that aroma.

00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:36.928
Of the lotus leaf.

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:39.737
Peel that back.

00:03:41.603 --> 00:03:42.549
Okay.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.970
And you can see all of those insides

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.860
just oozing already, how sticky

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.360
and hot and wonderful that is.

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:54.516
It's so good, it's so comforting.

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:59.091
The rice is just glutinous, and sticky

00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:01.836
and then it's gooey on the inside.

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:04.181
With minced meat and maybe some

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.264
sausage in there as well.

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:13.299
So awesome and followed by tea!

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:15.278
Actually now that I taste more

00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:18.557
of that, I think it's chicken in there.

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:19.643
I don't know if there's minced pork,

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:21.555
maybe minced pork as
well, but mostly chicken.

00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:23.125
Meatball time!

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.586
Oh yes, these are some, whoa,

00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:28.523
these are some stuck together meatballs!

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.305
That's gonna take a little bit of prying.

00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:31.972
Alright, here we go!

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:36.608
Oh and I think there's bean
curd on the bottom of it too.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:40.914
A meatball definitely needs
to be dipped into the sauce.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:42.145
I've got a hanging piece of bean

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:44.645
curd on this meatball as well.

00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:55.680
That's just solid minced pork.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.300
But it has a little bit
of a spongy texture to it.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.511
And then I also had to
go for the chicken feet.

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:05.094
Look at these big wrinkly feet!

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.006
Oh yeah, that has a lot of skin!

00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.736
And a lot of little bones as well!

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:26.278
It's pretty good, it's
very, very, gelatinous.

00:05:26.278 --> 00:05:28.519
It's very, very, kind of squishy,

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:30.272
and a little bit leathery, it taste

00:05:30.272 --> 00:05:32.189
like very soft leather.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.654
And you can actually feel like that grip.

00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:39.361
On the bottom of the chicken feet.

00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:41.111
It's like goosebumps.

00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:50.051
There's actually a lot to
eat on these chicken feet.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.504
(sighing)

00:06:07.504 --> 00:06:10.070
Pure satisfaction, I love this place.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.186
It's small, it has a
neighborhood feel to it.

00:06:13.186 --> 00:06:15.095
I think a lot of the people that come here

00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:17.447
live in the area, and have been

00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:19.137
coming here for many, many, years.

00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:20.455
And this is a great place to

00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:23.258
have a real hole in the wall style

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.925
dim sum experience in Hong Kong.

00:06:29.068 --> 00:06:30.078
Well I guess you can see it, but it

00:06:30.078 --> 00:06:32.516
stopped raining while we had dim sum.

00:06:32.516 --> 00:06:35.482
So perfect, it's still
drizzling just a little bit.

00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:39.161
But nice that it's not
down pouring anymore.

00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:40.734
Some of you may already know this,

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.723
but my mother is Chinese, but from Hawaii.

00:06:43.723 --> 00:06:45.389
And so I grew up eating a lot of Chinese

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.101
food, and I grew up especially

00:06:47.101 --> 00:06:49.516
loving dim sum when I was a kid.

00:06:49.516 --> 00:06:51.831
And so every time I eat dim sum,

00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.893
it reminds me of my family, it

00:06:52.893 --> 00:06:55.906
reminds me of my childhood, yeah

00:06:55.906 --> 00:06:59.046
dim sum holds a special place in my heart.

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:00.828
And almost as soon as I said the rain

00:07:00.828 --> 00:07:04.159
has stopped, it has started raining again.

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.598
We are back at the metro station,

00:07:05.598 --> 00:07:07.798
on our way to central
station, and hopefully

00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:11.112
we are gonna have goose for lunch today.

00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:13.695
(bright music)

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:22.442
Oh it is raining pretty hard, I

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.425
need to take out the umbrella.

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:28.008
(bright music)

00:07:32.332 --> 00:07:33.910
The last time I was in Hong Kong

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.501
I ate roast goose at a place called,

00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:38.925
Yat Lok, but some people say that the

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:42.355
roast goose at Yung Kee is even better.

00:07:42.355 --> 00:07:46.087
Say that it is the best roast
goose in the entire world.

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:47.561
It's a little bit of an upscale

00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:49.384
restaurant I think, but
I think it's gonna be

00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:53.301
worth it, I cannot wait
to try the roast goose.

00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:59.349
This restaurant has a lot
of history in Hong Kong.

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:01.996
It started off as just a very, very, small

00:08:01.996 --> 00:08:04.730
local family run restaurant, and it

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.313
has turned into a goose empire!

00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:11.631
It is such a tough decision.

00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.273
I'm trying to debate
right now, if I should

00:08:13.273 --> 00:08:14.985
order the steamed chicken, definitely

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:16.488
ordering the goose of course, but I'm not

00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:18.520
sure if I should order the steamed

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.232
chicken, or the soy marinated chicken.

00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:24.376
Right now I'm leaning towards
the soy marinated chicken.

00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:26.088
I made my order for the main dishes,

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:27.864
but I also got an appetizer.

00:08:27.864 --> 00:08:29.820
And they are very well
known for this appetizer

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.333
as well, which is thousand year old egg.

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:35.903
I got a half and also
served with pickled ginger.

00:08:35.903 --> 00:08:38.956
It almost looks like a jello, I'm

00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:40.993
gonna take some of the pickled ginger.

00:08:40.993 --> 00:08:44.160
Stick that on top, or maybe all of it.

00:08:45.323 --> 00:08:48.753
No, maybe two slices,
and let me begin with

00:08:48.753 --> 00:08:51.806
the egg white, which is actually like,

00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:53.639
whoa that is slippery!

00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:08.249
That does have the texture of jello.

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:11.416
It's really quite mild, oh, maybe not!

00:09:13.623 --> 00:09:16.966
You can taste that it
does have some age to it!

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:19.909
Let me re-add that ginger, and all

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:23.223
that yolk is spilling out, oh-no.

00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:24.604
I'm losing it now.

00:09:24.604 --> 00:09:27.123
Okay, I'm gonna have to break and

00:09:27.123 --> 00:09:30.472
tear it together with that ginger.

00:09:30.472 --> 00:09:32.741
The egg does have a bitter taste to it.

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:36.908
But then paired with that
ginger, the ginger is sweet.

00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:44.692
I wouldn't say that's
my absolute favorite.

00:09:44.692 --> 00:09:46.073
But it's not bad.

00:09:46.073 --> 00:09:48.203
The chicken and the
choy sum have just come.

00:09:48.203 --> 00:09:51.007
And we're still waiting on the goose.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.264
But I should just mention
that I ordered tea.

00:09:53.264 --> 00:09:55.064
And they have a number of different teas

00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:56.584
you could choose from, I went with

00:09:56.584 --> 00:10:00.345
some pu-erh tea, which
is a black fermented tea.

00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:02.095
And I really like it.

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:10.554
It indeed does have a little
bit of a dirt flavor to it.

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:14.414
But it's very earthy,
just slightly bitter.

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:16.247
But very, very smooth.

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:22.157
I ordered the soy sauce marinated chicken.

00:10:22.157 --> 00:10:23.718
In order to get a real appreciation for

00:10:23.718 --> 00:10:25.970
this you need have to
see it really up close.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.889
You can see how the skin is separated

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:31.965
completely from the meat and just

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.732
that golden, soy sauce,
glaze on top of it.

00:10:35.732 --> 00:10:38.338
For this piece, right here on the top.

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:39.458
I think this is a combination of

00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:42.093
garlic and maybe green
onions, and maybe ginger.

00:10:42.093 --> 00:10:44.102
I'm not totally sure, and then oil.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:48.102
Which I will apply,
generously to my first bite.

00:10:54.752 --> 00:10:56.453
Oh that's a bite to savor!

00:10:56.453 --> 00:11:00.898
Oh that texture, and that
flavor, that explosion!

00:11:00.898 --> 00:11:04.148
Of salty, garlicky, green onion flavor.

00:11:07.202 --> 00:11:09.378
You can really taste
the different textures

00:11:09.378 --> 00:11:11.885
of the chicken, and the skin.

00:11:11.885 --> 00:11:14.967
The chicken meat is like, it's tender,

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.825
and juicy, and then the skin has

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:18.455
a very jelly texture to it, but

00:11:18.455 --> 00:11:20.336
they're like completely separate.

00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:24.503
And then that sauce, wow,
is just packed with flavor.

00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:28.061
Oh it's salty, it's oily, fragrant,

00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:31.144
it's garlicky and green onion packed.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.592
And also, our waiter
said that choy sum, is in

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:37.509
season and I got the
version with oyster sauce.

00:11:46.582 --> 00:11:48.749
It's crisp and very juicy!

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.548
That entire stem is very juicy,

00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:55.131
and I need some rice with that.

00:11:57.447 --> 00:12:00.614
Oh, even the rice is really good here!

00:12:03.048 --> 00:12:07.048
I think the grand arrival
of the goose has come.

00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:10.750
Let's welcome him to our table.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.653
- Thank you!

00:12:24.653 --> 00:12:25.486
- Thank you.

00:12:25.486 --> 00:12:28.051
And on the menu, you can
order a couple of different

00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:31.708
portion sizes, and I ordered the section

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:33.426
of course, with the drumstick.

00:12:33.426 --> 00:12:36.513
She brought it over, and as soon as

00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:37.732
she brought it over, she topped it,

00:12:37.732 --> 00:12:39.682
anointed it with a sauce, and I think

00:12:39.682 --> 00:12:40.907
there's some peanuts in the sauce.

00:12:40.907 --> 00:12:42.492
I'm not sure what else, there's types

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:45.011
of juices are within that sauce.

00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:48.679
But that skin of that goose, is insane!

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:50.262
It's golden-bronze!

00:12:51.407 --> 00:12:53.844
Roasted perfectly, and you can actually

00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:57.582
smell the aroma of that goose oil and fat.

00:12:57.582 --> 00:13:00.397
It is an absolute trophy.

00:13:00.397 --> 00:13:02.556
I'm gonna start with
this piece right here.

00:13:02.556 --> 00:13:03.473
On the top.

00:13:06.377 --> 00:13:09.776
Oh let me pull that off real fast.

00:13:09.776 --> 00:13:11.732
Come to get a close up look of that.

00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:14.031
It also comes with a
plum sauce, but I'm just

00:13:14.031 --> 00:13:17.614
gonna taste it just
like this, on it's own.

00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:35.369
Oh.

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:40.159
That is ridiculous, that skin!

00:13:44.403 --> 00:13:46.452
It's just completely juicy, with

00:13:46.452 --> 00:13:49.731
fats and oils from that goose.

00:13:49.731 --> 00:13:52.610
And that meat is so succulent, and

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.754
it has a little bit of a
muscular texture to it.

00:13:54.754 --> 00:13:58.587
And with every bite, you
can taste that goose.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.013
Wow.

00:14:01.013 --> 00:14:02.333
Okay let me reach down here for

00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:05.103
a piece of the leg, right there.

00:14:05.103 --> 00:14:09.270
And I'm gonna dip it more in
that sauce that came with it.

00:14:12.642 --> 00:14:15.428
What I like about it,
is it's not too salty.

00:14:15.428 --> 00:14:16.781
And you can really taste the flavor

00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:20.356
of the goose and the succulent meat.

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:23.084
The quality of that goose.

00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:24.186
And for this piece, I'm gonna dip

00:14:24.186 --> 00:14:26.603
it into the sweet plum sauce.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:36.357
I think that's a back bone!

00:14:36.357 --> 00:14:40.357
Wow, that skin is juicing
right now in my mouth.

00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:45.980
Okay that was an incredibly fatty piece.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.650
Maybe pure fat, we're
about half way through

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.053
the plate of goose, and this is gonna

00:14:51.053 --> 00:14:52.707
be my next bite here, you just

00:14:52.707 --> 00:14:54.669
have to fully examine this bite.

00:14:54.669 --> 00:14:57.676
Look at that skin, it's like a full

00:14:57.676 --> 00:15:00.369
circle of skin, and I'm not sure, at

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:03.400
first I thought it was from the drumstick.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.501
But maybe it's from the
wing, 'cause the drumstick

00:15:05.501 --> 00:15:07.057
is over here on the other side.

00:15:07.057 --> 00:15:08.751
But there is some meat under here, I think

00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:11.038
this is gonna be a pure, boneless bite.

00:15:11.038 --> 00:15:12.495
With just a little bit of meat.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.147
And look at that ratio, that entire, like

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.690
sleeve of skin, you need to just

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.005
see this as close as
possible, to just fully

00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:23.668
appreciate and just gaze into that skin.

00:15:23.668 --> 00:15:25.668
And that bronze shimmer.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.760
What I would like to mention, is that,

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.343
within the skin, not only is it just juicy

00:15:40.343 --> 00:15:43.959
and crispy, but it has such a complex

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:46.895
flavor, you can taste
all of that, marinade.

00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:49.159
I'm sure they use a mix of
ingredients to marinate it.

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:51.225
And then also, you can actually taste

00:15:51.225 --> 00:15:53.669
the charcoal, roasted, flavor to it.

00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:57.836
It's like caramelized skin,
it's just an absolute treat.

00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:03.118
That was just the perfect amount of goose.

00:16:03.118 --> 00:16:06.478
I feel fantastic, and slightly giddy,

00:16:06.478 --> 00:16:09.688
after eating that, that skin is just

00:16:09.688 --> 00:16:13.483
it's a remarkable thing,
it's just unbelievable

00:16:13.483 --> 00:16:14.935
when you are eating it.

00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:18.052
And I savored every single bite of that.

00:16:18.052 --> 00:16:21.802
Our total bill came to
654 Hong Kong dollars.

00:16:24.142 --> 00:16:26.731
Just stepping outside after that meal,

00:16:26.731 --> 00:16:30.388
that goose has nearly
put me into a slumber.

00:16:30.388 --> 00:16:32.971
(bright music)

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:40.829
It's starting to drizzle again.

00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:43.499
So I think it's just gonna
be a rainy, drizzly day.

00:16:43.499 --> 00:16:44.886
All day long.

00:16:44.886 --> 00:16:46.221
So we are heading back to the subway,

00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:49.384
we're gonna go back to the
hotel for a little while.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.967
(bright music)

00:16:57.196 --> 00:16:59.971
I'm not sure if I'm suffering right now

00:16:59.971 --> 00:17:03.888
from a case of jet lag,
or a case of goose lag.

00:17:05.595 --> 00:17:07.845
(dripping)

00:17:09.303 --> 00:17:11.370
I decided to detour the nap, by

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.523
coming down to the club lounge.

00:17:13.523 --> 00:17:15.773
And having a cup of coffee.

00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:19.664
(loud exhale)

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:23.401
And this view behind me, the harbor,

00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:25.484
the streets of Hong Kong.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:29.298
(beeping)

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.393
We are taking the subway on our

00:17:31.393 --> 00:17:34.156
way to Temple Street Night Market.

00:17:34.156 --> 00:17:35.491
(loud incoherent chatter)

00:17:35.491 --> 00:17:38.294
Oh wow, it is rush hour
right now in Hong Kong.

00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:41.347
(loud incoherent chatter)

00:17:41.347 --> 00:17:43.930
At least we're getting closer.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.704
Luckily the trains come
like, every 30 seconds,

00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:49.572
at just rush hour time, but it is packed!

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:51.489
(beep)

00:17:55.069 --> 00:17:58.318
We got off the subway
at Yau Ma Tei Station,

00:17:58.318 --> 00:18:01.914
and we're gonna go to a
restaurant first for dinner,

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.602
before going to Temple
Street Night Market.

00:18:04.602 --> 00:18:07.185
(bright music)

00:18:11.996 --> 00:18:15.113
(loud chatter)

00:18:15.113 --> 00:18:17.063
In this area there are
a number of restaurants,

00:18:17.063 --> 00:18:19.350
that specialize in clay pot rice.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.153
And I chose to come to Four Seasons.

00:18:22.153 --> 00:18:24.695
This is a great like,
open room restaurant.

00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:28.445
And they mainly have a
huge selection of clay

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.542
pots of rice, with all
sorts of different toppings.

00:18:32.542 --> 00:18:35.450
I got the one with Chinese
mushroom and chicken.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.102
And they also specialize
in oyster omelets here.

00:18:38.102 --> 00:18:40.784
But I think I've had my quota for oil

00:18:40.784 --> 00:18:43.239
for the day, so I decided
not to order that.

00:18:43.239 --> 00:18:47.331
But just got the clay pot
rice, and a order of vegetable.

00:18:47.331 --> 00:18:48.788
This restaurant has an atmosphere that's

00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:52.769
similar between, a food
court, and a garage.

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:55.723
For vegetable I ordered
water morning glory bowl.

00:18:55.723 --> 00:18:58.527
That's quite a pile of
water morning glory.

00:18:58.527 --> 00:19:00.343
And then fermented bean sauce on the side.

00:19:00.343 --> 00:19:02.676
Okay, I'll get some of this.

00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:09.722
And get a little bit of that,
I bet that's really salty.

00:19:14.598 --> 00:19:18.015
Yeah, it has almost a cheesy taste to it.

00:19:20.663 --> 00:19:22.729
Very salty and then, the water morning

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:25.234
glory is still crisp
and a little bit slimy.

00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:27.106
But the vegetable is very plain,

00:19:27.106 --> 00:19:29.392
maybe just plain steamed or boiled.

00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:33.014
Because it's meant to eat with this sauce.

00:19:33.014 --> 00:19:34.181
For flavoring.

00:19:39.927 --> 00:19:41.407
It only took about five minutes

00:19:41.407 --> 00:19:44.140
and the clay pot has
arrived, hot and fresh.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.928
As soon as he brings over the clay pot

00:19:45.928 --> 00:19:47.983
they you pay for your meal.

00:19:47.983 --> 00:19:49.352
And they have the orders written

00:19:49.352 --> 00:19:50.977
on these little pieces of paper.

00:19:50.977 --> 00:19:54.373
Which are kinda like half
stuck to your dishes.

00:19:54.373 --> 00:19:56.873
Oh, that steam smells awesome.

00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:00.136
Oh it's so fragrant!

00:20:00.136 --> 00:20:02.168
It's like a soothing fragrance.

00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:04.936
The rice you can smell that fresh steamed

00:20:04.936 --> 00:20:08.976
rice with a little bit
of a roasted aroma to it.

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:11.854
You can smell that chicken
and those mushrooms.

00:20:11.854 --> 00:20:12.922
And you can see how the chicken

00:20:12.922 --> 00:20:15.871
is almost like melted onto the rice.

00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:17.368
What you have to immediately do is

00:20:17.368 --> 00:20:19.313
give it a squirt of the sauce.

00:20:19.313 --> 00:20:22.980
I think this is dark
soy sauce of some sort.

00:20:25.848 --> 00:20:28.286
Alright I'll just go for
a little bit at first.

00:20:28.286 --> 00:20:29.934
Okay what I'll do is I'll dish some

00:20:29.934 --> 00:20:32.434
of it out into my little bowl.

00:20:35.471 --> 00:20:37.638
Get that piece of chicken.

00:20:39.383 --> 00:20:42.133
Oh it does smell incredibly good.

00:20:46.922 --> 00:20:48.779
That mushroom.

00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:51.037
Let me go in with my spoon.

00:20:51.037 --> 00:20:53.370
Get a bit more of that rice.

00:20:57.607 --> 00:21:01.107
Let me just taste some of that rice first.

00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:10.649
That is really, really, smokey tasting.

00:21:10.649 --> 00:21:13.899
And I think I got a
little piece of the crust.

00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:16.482
From the clay pot on that bite.

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:24.625
It tastes like the chicken has been

00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:27.759
marinated maybe in some oyster sauce.

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:30.179
Before it was tossed on top of the rice.

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:34.033
And yeah the chicken almost
has a melt-y feel to it.

00:21:34.033 --> 00:21:36.204
This is just straight comfort food.

00:21:36.204 --> 00:21:40.371
Chicken and rice, and a
smokey clay pot fragrance.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.568
The rice almost has a nutty flavor.

00:21:47.568 --> 00:21:50.818
Next I'll try some of this chili sauce.

00:21:52.797 --> 00:21:53.630
Oh yeah.

00:21:58.671 --> 00:22:00.504
Oh, that's very salty.

00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:08.027
You gotta use just a tiny
bit of that chili sauce.

00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:09.860
Really, really, salty.

00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:16.263
You gotta really splash on the sauce.

00:22:16.263 --> 00:22:18.004
You gotta like coat your whole rice in it.

00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:19.757
It tastes so good.

00:22:19.757 --> 00:22:21.510
I think it's soy sauce but maybe with

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.177
a little bit of sweetness in it.

00:22:26.815 --> 00:22:28.341
And I'm just going with that rice right

00:22:28.341 --> 00:22:31.341
out of the pot, on that crusty edge.

00:22:34.998 --> 00:22:37.831
Yeah, with that sauce all over it,

00:22:39.647 --> 00:22:42.647
and that crusty, smokey, nutty edge.

00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:47.645
That was good, fragrant, a simple taste.

00:22:47.645 --> 00:22:49.381
But I like that sauce!

00:22:49.381 --> 00:22:51.638
That soy sauce, just a little bit

00:22:51.638 --> 00:22:53.356
of a sweet tinge, but it's not

00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:55.980
like the thick dark soy sauce.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.075
But it tasted really good with that rice.

00:22:58.075 --> 00:23:01.408
And the, like melting pieces of chicken.

00:23:04.587 --> 00:23:05.420
Hello!

00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:09.346
(laughing)

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:13.102
And that is right, just one lane over

00:23:13.102 --> 00:23:14.692
from Temple Street, so now we're walking

00:23:14.692 --> 00:23:15.818
over to Temple Street, we're gonna

00:23:15.818 --> 00:23:19.818
walk around the night
market for a little while.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.035
At the Temple Street Night Market, you

00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:27.234
will find all sorts of random things.

00:23:27.234 --> 00:23:30.067
From electronics and batteries, to

00:23:31.065 --> 00:23:34.982
flashlights, and clothes,
and cell phone cases.

00:23:37.101 --> 00:23:40.851
Bracelets, antiques,
clothes, CD's and DVD's,

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:45.581
all sorts of random things.

00:23:45.581 --> 00:23:48.498
(bright pop music)

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.540
I'm gonna go ahead and end the video

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.148
for today, right now, Ying and I

00:23:57.148 --> 00:23:59.868
are gonna leisurely stroll around

00:23:59.868 --> 00:24:01.906
for a little while, and then take

00:24:01.906 --> 00:24:03.745
the metro back to our hotel.

00:24:03.745 --> 00:24:04.993

the subway, whoa, I almost ran into

00:24:24.151 --> 00:24:27.151
a parking meter, we took the subway.

00:24:31.778 --> 00:24:34.034
That just slid out of my chopsticks!

00:24:34.034 --> 00:24:35.160
