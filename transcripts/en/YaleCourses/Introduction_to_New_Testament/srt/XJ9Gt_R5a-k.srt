1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,520
Last time we talked about the book of
revelation and I ended up by saying,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:08,810
uh,

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,080
trying to place a revelation in the
context of Roman politics and the imperial

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:17,550
cult. Uh, clearly this author,
whoever wrote revelation,

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,620
and it is somebody named John,
all those who said,

7
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,620
it's not the same John who wrote
the gospels are wrote the letters.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,700
It's not John Son of [inaudible]
is just some of the guy named John.

9
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,000
John was a very common name
for Jews in the first century.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,940
So it's not uncommon that
we have a guy named John,

11
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:35,580
but don't know exactly who he is in
relation to be anybody else in early

12
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,090
Christianity. One of the things
that I ended, but it was by saying,

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,700
let's imagine his politics.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,270
This is clearly an anti Roman document.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,540
That's the one thing we
can say about it for sure.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,220
Who would write this and why would
he write it to these seven, uh,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,230
these seven letters to these seven
churches that we have in revelation.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,450
One way to think about this is if this
document was written toward the last part

19
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:05,350
of the first century, uh, as a lot
of scholars think it is, he may,

20
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:09,930
this may be an, and I said,
remember his Greek is bad.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,670
He doesn't write Greek. Well, sometimes
it's even grammatically wrong in places,

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,680
uh,
is just not bad Greek,

23
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:19,350
even though we don't have really good
Greek and most of the New Testament.

24
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:23,820
But this is the worst. How do you think
of someone who is against eating meat?

25
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:24,990
Sacrificed to idols?

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,090
Seems to think of himself as a true
Jew and the Jews who are occupying

27
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,820
synagogues in different parts
of Asia minor as not true,

28
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:37,821
Jews anti women as far as
their roles in the churches.

29
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:40,620
He, there's nothing we know about
this one when he calls Jezza Bell,

30
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,360
except that he's using this nickname
from the old testament for a whore like,

31
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,830
uh,

32
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,830
idolatrous woman Jezza Bell and labeling
some Christian woman who's a leader in

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,350
some of these, one of these churches,
he's labeling her with this terrible term.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,171
Uh,

35
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:01,171
and I suggested maybe he's
actually writing against
the kind of Christianity we

36
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:03,030
see represented by Paul's churches,

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,630
which were right there in these places
such as ethicists and Smyrna that he's

38
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:07,464
writing too.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,460
Because Paul's churches actually have
people in them who are fairly well off.

40
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,120
In some cases, they seem to be fairly
comfortable with Roman culture.

41
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,720
They may have their own businesses,
they have their own slaves. Uh,

42
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,980
there are women leaders in Paul's
churches. Paul allows that sort of thing.

43
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,100
As some of you have pointed
out in your papers on that, um,

44
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,400
and they believe it's okay to
eat meat sacrificed to idols,

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,030
which this author seems to
think is idolatrous in itself.

46
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,510
So I suggested that maybe this guy is
riding Rome rep revelation precisely to

47
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:44,190
attack the kind of, uh, Christianity we
see represented in Paul's on letters.

48
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,760
What kind of person might this be?
One way is just to imagine,

49
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,100
and this is pure speculation,
pure imagination.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,390
What if this guy had come
from Palestine himself?

51
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,750
Maybe he lived through the Jewish war
of 70 [inaudible] 70 when the temple of

52
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,580
Jerusalem was destroyed and
Jerusalem was overrun by the Romans.

53
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,710
Thousands of Jews were taken into slavery
and taken to Rome and sold off to be

54
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:13,090
slaves. And, uh, the land was
devastated to a certain extent.

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Maybe he lived through that war and
that increased his hatred of the Romans.

56
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,400
And he gets to western Asia Minor.

57
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,280
He's traveling around other parts
of the Metro, eastern Mediterranean.

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,990
He gets to western Asia Minor.

59
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,090
And here he doesn't see followers
of Jesus who aren't like him. Poor,

60
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,310
uh,
not very well educated,

61
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:37,900
perhaps hateful of the Roman empire
and sit and see themselves as being

62
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,220
oppressed by the Roman Empire.

63
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,940
He sees Christians who think that
their followers of Jesus also,

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,740
but they're fairly
comfortable in their world.

65
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,780
They live in a comfortable Greek
and Greco Roman urban environments.

66
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,630
And so he writes revelation
to try to shake them up,

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,140
to get them to hate roam
as much as he hates Rome,

68
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,790
to get them to be just as wary
of the imperial cult as he is.

69
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,920
So that's one picture definitely have of
early Christianity that we see an anti

70
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:09,910
Roman kind of politics.
The live question this week.

71
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,250
And the question you'll be talking about
in your discussion groups on Thursday

72
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:16,240
and Friday and some of you will be writing
papers about is what is the politics

73
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:20,860
of early Christianity in some
of the old Hollywood type days.

74
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,020
The idea was the,
uh,

75
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,800
early Christianity where it was a
movement of slaves are all completely poor

76
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:31,090
people and Rome was always going around
persecuting early Christian groups.

77
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,840
And there's these little bands of
early Christians huddled in dining room

78
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:39,070
somewhere huddled in, in the catacombs
and Romer huddled in caves. Well,

79
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,210
that's Hollywood.

80
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,960
The Romans actually didn't pay that much
attention to the early Christian groups

81
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,030
at all until much later than this.

82
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,240
There was no coherent persecution
attempt by the Romans against the,

83
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,170
uh, the Jesus movement at any time
until much later, uh, in history.

84
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,240
So you don't have Rome taking even
notice of most of these little house

85
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,990
churches, uh, founded by Paul and
other Christian missionaries, uh,

86
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,840
for the first several decades.

87
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,170
And so you had actually a variety of
ways that these people themselves related

88
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:17,800
to Rome as an empire and we,
and so we see that with revelation.

89
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,870
We see this heavily anti Roman view.

90
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,990
But remember what Paul said in Romans
13 let every person be subject to the

91
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,440
governing authorities.
For there is no authority except from God.

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,190
And those authorities that exist have
been instituted by God. Therefore,

93
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,940
whoever resists authority
resists what God has appointed.

94
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:41,320
So God has appointed the Roman governors
according to what Paul is saying here.

95
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,270
And those who resist will incur judgment
for rulers are not a terror to good

96
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,410
conduct,
but to bad government.

97
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,720
Roman governors are a threat only
to people who are bad, not to good.

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,860
The writer of revelation would disagree
with that completely it. This is crazy.

99
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,500
Do you wish to have no
fear of the authority?

100
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:05,300
Then do what is good and you'll receive
its approval for it is God's servant for

101
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,134
your good.

102
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,910
Okay?

103
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,440
But if you do what is wrong?

104
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:14,920
You should be afraid for the authority
does not bear the sword in vain.

105
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,800
It is the servant of God to
execute wrath on the wrongdoer.

106
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,860
So the Roman governor,
from Paul's perspective,

107
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:24,940
at least as he puts it there in Romans
13 is actually God's servant to punish

108
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:25,774
wrongdoing,

109
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,990
completely different view of Roman
power that we then we had in revelation.

110
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,810
So where do the different
documents of early Christianity?

111
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,550
Remember we've stressed
in the whole course.

112
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,720
The diversity of early Christianity is
different Christianities in the first

113
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:45,460
century. Where did the different
documents align up on their politics?

114
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,270
Are they revolutionary or are
they accommodating to power?

115
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,210
Are they pro ramen?
Are they anti Roman?

116
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,420
And we've already got now two seemingly
opposite positions except look over at

117
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:02,410
first Corinthians.
Now remember,

118
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,050
you have to have your bibles with you.

119
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,030
First Corinthians two verse six.

120
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,810
Yet among the mature we do,
we do speak wisdom.

121
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,020
Though it is not a wisdom of this age
or of the rulers of this age who are

122
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:24,770
doomed to perish, but we speak
God's wisdom, secret and hidden,

123
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,110
which God decreed before
the ages for our glory.

124
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,220
None of the rulers of this age
understood this for if they had,

125
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,970
they would not have crucified
the Lord of Glory. Now,

126
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,500
Paul knows that the Romans
crucified Jesus. They're almonds.

127
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,710
Crucifixion is not a Jewish
punishment that would be stoning.

128
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,270
So in the Jewish leaders wanted to
punish somebody with death and Jerusalem,

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,240
they had, they got a mob together
and they stoned the person.

130
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,900
Stoning was the Jewish
means of capital punishment.

131
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,830
Crucifixion was the Roman means of
capital punishment. Paul knows this,

132
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,050
so is he here talking about these
authorities who crucified Jesus?

133
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,430
That is the Romans.

134
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,300
Pilot obviously is a governor
of Judea at the time,

135
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,380
but pilot was simply the representative
of the Senate and the emperor.

136
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,830
So as Paul blaming the Senate and the
emperor for the crucifixion of Jesus here,

137
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,370
what does it mean by rulers? So you have
some scholars who use this text to say,

138
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:22,761
well,

139
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:27,560
even in spite of what Paul says in Romans
13 Paul doesn't have any great love in

140
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,520
his heart for Rome.

141
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,350
He still believes that they are
evil powers who crucified Jesus.

142
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,590
They're in the, they're in the
process of perishing as we speak,

143
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,800
and they'll certainly be destroyed by
God when Jesus comes back on the clouds

144
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:44,630
with his holy Angel Army.
But other scholars say, no.

145
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,650
The word here for ruler
are con in the Greek

146
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,540
could refer to superhuman and Jelic kinds
of powers we would call supernatural

147
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,474
powers.

148
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,460
So just Paula is Paul talking
here about sort of say, tannic,

149
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,420
angelic powers that rule the cosmos.

150
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,120
Because remember we've talked
about apocalyptic world view,

151
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,840
and one of the aspects of an apocalyptic
world view is that different countries

152
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,270
have these angelic forces,

153
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,830
these angelic leaders that are the true
power behind their government or behind

154
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,930
their nation.
So in Daniel,

155
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:26,931
we've got the prince of Persia is
understood as this angel who runs Persia.

156
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,380
So every nation has these angelic powers,

157
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,730
are satanic powers because of course
Satan is himself a depicted as an angel in

158
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,820
the UN,
in the Jewish Bible.

159
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,210
So is Satan just one of many kinds of
powers like this or our rulers of the

160
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,390
cosmos.

161
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,860
And is Paul actually talking about Angelic
Superhuman Powers here that crucified

162
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,800
Jesus rather than,
than the Romans?

163
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,270
Or as some scholars would do say,
and I'm in this last camp,

164
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,250
maybe he's talking about both.

165
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,270
Maybe Paul is including
the Romans in this,

166
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,070
these rulers who ignorantly crucified
Jesus, and so we'll be destroyed.

167
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,870
But maybe Paul also believes that the
Romans are themselves controlled by

168
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,470
superhuman, say Tannic, angelic powers.

169
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,080
If that's how you read
First Corinthians two,

170
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,530
then Paul's view of Rome
isn't quite as positive,

171
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,610
just straightforwardly positive as
you would get from Romans 13. Right?

172
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,360
So when you ask scholars,
uh, this question,

173
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,600
is early Christianity politically
revolutionary against Rome,

174
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,430
or is it politically accommodating?

175
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,700
You're going to get scholars
lining up on both sides of this.

176
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:44,100
Some of them say no, they read,
they read, or the Christianity is,

177
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,290
for the most part, revolutionary
and anti Rome. Others say, no,

178
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,980
it was accommodating. They were
fairly conservative and comfortable.

179
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,680
So this is a place we,

180
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,930
we assigned this topic for your papers
this week because this is actually

181
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:58,470
something where there's a live debate
that goes on among scholars themselves.

182
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,180
There's not one correct answer to
this question. It's complicated,

183
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,450
so it's a good thing for you
to look at. Of course, we,

184
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,720
we've already read Luke and
acts two and Luke and acts.

185
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:13,980
That author seems to present
Rome and kind of a strange,

186
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,720
ambiguous way.
On the one hand,

187
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,100
the author goes out of his way to have
Roman governor after Roman governor say

188
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,900
that Jesus is innocent. Paul is
innocent. This movement is innocent.

189
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:29,010
They're not revolutionary.
Paul is eventually taken to Rome,

190
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,800
but it's after the governor
said, well, I could release him.

191
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,630
I don't see anything
that this guy has done.

192
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:37,830
It's just a dispute among Jews and
yet Paul appeals to the emperor,

193
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,350
so he is sent to Rome in the book of acts.

194
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,540
But all these Roman governors declare
that Christianity is not politically

195
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:50,160
insurrectionist so that it looks like
the author is actually riding almost a

196
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:54,190
more apologetic book about the Romans
except then is that the people that

197
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,024
pointed out,

198
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,140
all of these Roman rulers come across
looking like they're rather incompetent

199
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:03,250
and powerless. They almost can't seem to
control the mobs that are around them.

200
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,230
They can't seem to really resist the
Jewish leaders who want to accuse Paul of

201
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,730
being insurrectionist,

202
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:15,210
so is wrong presented in the book of
acts and and the gospel of Luke as a good

203
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:21,370
force or a bad force
or an ambiguous force.

204
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,010
Now what we've got is the letters were
going to the documents we're going to

205
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,980
look at here
first.

206
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,600
Let's get second Thessalonians.

207
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,600
We've looked already at some of these
documents that seem clearly to be anti

208
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,160
Rome such as the book of revelation.

209
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,510
Second decile Odians is one of these
letters of Paul that some scholars believe

210
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:49,660
Paul actually wrote and other
scholars believe he did not write.

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,680
I tend to be on the camp that said
he probably did not write second

212
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,543
Thessalonians,

213
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,500
but unlike Ephesians and Colossians and
the pastoral epistles where it's much

214
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:03,520
clearer that they're written in a very
different style of Greek than Paul's

215
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,080
seven undisputed letters.

216
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,070
Second Thessalonians is actually the
Greek of second as lungs actually looks

217
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,600
pretty much like Paul's Greek,

218
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,110
so you can't throw second Thessaloniki
ins out of the authentic epistles of Paul

219
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:19,330
on the basis of the
Greek style like we can.

220
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,610
I think some of the other letters
that claimed to be by Paul.

221
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,070
Why is it that I say say, I don't think
second Thessalonians is by Paul? Well,

222
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:30,250
for one thing, this is not so important,
but we'll get to it in a minute.

223
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,600
He actually has a message in
second Thessalonians about
the coming of Jesus that

224
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:38,440
seems to contradict what he'd been
saying in first Thessalonians in first

225
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:43,150
Thessalonians. He says, it's coming
very soon. Get ready, don't go to sleep.

226
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,690
Jesus is coming back and the Paris or
will happen is all going to happen very

227
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,690
soon. And he says, no, we don't
know exactly when it's gonna happen,

228
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,130
but it's going to happen very soon.
In Second Thessalonians, as we'll see,

229
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,160
he actually says, no, no, no,
no. Don't quit work or anything.

230
00:13:57,161 --> 00:14:01,450
Don't quit your day job because some of
the people and desolate Annika according

231
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:04,960
to this author seem to have quit their
jobs because they're ready for Jesus to

232
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:08,590
come back so soon. He says, no,
no, you should still be working.

233
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,910
There is going to be a few things that'll
happen first before the end comes and

234
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,670
then he lays out a timeline of
what he's expecting to happen.

235
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,980
And I'm going to walk you through
that timeline in a minute.

236
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,430
So some scholars who said what second
Thessalonians teaches about the end time

237
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,300
and the coming back of Jesus differs
enough from what Paul had actually said

238
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,860
about it in first Thessalonians,

239
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,550
that it might be written by a different
person at a different time in a

240
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:35,650
different situation.
That's one argument.

241
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,900
I think the more convincing argument to
me is if you take the beginning of first

242
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:41,740
Thessalonians,

243
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,270
I mean the beginning of
second Thessalonians and the
end of second Thessalonians

244
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,280
and you put them side by side
with parts of first Thessalonians,

245
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,790
they look very, very much
alike. Now wait a minute,

246
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,540
they look alike.
So that means they're not by Paul.

247
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,230
This is what I'm thinking
when you, if, if I'm,

248
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:05,180
if Paul is going to sit down
and write another letter,

249
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,800
the second [inaudible] is he going to do
so with the copy of first Thessalonians

250
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,634
in front of him?

251
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,420
Is he going to do so even recalling the
same words and phrases that he used in

252
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,630
the previous letter? I don't
think so. In other words,

253
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:25,631
I think second testimonials in certain
parts of it looks suspiciously too much

254
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:31,121
like first Thessalonians
to be an authentic leader
by Paul because when people

255
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:32,360
write another letter,

256
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,870
they use different words they so that
you don't sit down and basically repeat

257
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,600
words and phrases and things
from your previous letter.

258
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,590
So that made the one place
where you don't sign.

259
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,920
Find those words and phrases being the
same is precisely in the second chapter

260
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:49,880
of Second Thessalonians,

261
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:54,881
that middle part where this author is
teaching a different timeline for the end

262
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,510
time than first Thessalonians head.
So in my mind I'm thinking, okay,

263
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,560
if you want to ride a pseudonymous
letter and claim to be by Paul,

264
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,460
how do you make it convincing? Well, if
you knew first Thessalonians is a letter,

265
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,060
you might actually take that as a model
and read for assessment is carefully and

266
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,470
imitate the style and
imitate even what's said.

267
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,220
But then you stick in the second chapter
of Second Thessalonians where you give

268
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:21,620
your own timeline for what
you think is going to happen.

269
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,710
So that's why I think
it's probably not by Paul,

270
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,300
but scholars kind of divide up on second
Thessalonians and a lot of different

271
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:29,630
ways with many scholars,

272
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,690
even critical scholars who don't believe
Paul wrote all the letters that are in

273
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,290
his name in the New Testament and they'll
say they still think Paul did right?

274
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,670
Second vessel onions. But now what's
the goal of writing? And here's what,

275
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,690
let's look at this chapter two,
the first 12 verses of chapter two.

276
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:48,920
Now read along with me so you'll know
I'm not lying to you because every time I

277
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:52,250
get a chance I like to lie to students,
lead them astray

278
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,130
as to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
and are being gathered together to him.

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,720
We beg you brothers. Again, it doesn't
say sisters in the original Greek,

280
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,750
not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarm,

281
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,300
either by spirit or by word or by letter,

282
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:12,380
as though from us to the effect that
the day of the Lord is already here.

283
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,940
So he's mentioning there may have been
a letter circulated in Paul's name

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,640
claiming that the resurrection
has already happened.

285
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,870
The day of the Lord has already come.

286
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,440
So there's a reference to notice how
if this letter is synonymous as I claim

287
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,130
there's a reference to a pseudonymous
letter in the pseudonymous letter.

288
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,590
That's actually not unusual
in the ancient world.

289
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,130
Sometimes if you're riding a pseudonymous
letter, you'll put a reference, say,

290
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,790
well now some people been circulating
synonymous letters by me and I condemn

291
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,670
them for it. Of course it's in a letter.
That probably itself is pseudonymous.

292
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,110
That's irony, irony. We see in
some of these ancient letters,

293
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,520
let no one deceive you in any way
for that day will not come unless the

294
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:58,140
rebellion comes first and the
lawless one is revealed. Okay.

295
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,870
The lawless one,
what's the talking about here?

296
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,360
The one destined for destruction.

297
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,940
He opposes and exalts himself above every
so called God or object of worship so

298
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:13,320
that he takes his seat in the temple
of God, declaring himself to be God.

299
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
So this is something like another sort
of antichrist figure that we've seen in

300
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,660
the book of Daniel.
Uh,

301
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,000
Jesus in his own little apocalypse in
mark 13 other places talks about the

302
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:27,540
abomination of desolation
being set up in the temple. Uh,

303
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:32,520
so this author is saying this person
is going to call himself God and set

304
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:36,150
himself up in the temple in Jerusalem.

305
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,130
Do you not remember that I told you these
things when I was still with you and

306
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:45,210
you know what is now restraining him so
that he may be revealed when his time

307
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,900
comes. Okay? Now the risk,

308
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,330
the thing restraining him comes from
one Greek word cut tech on and it means

309
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,170
something holding back or something
holding, holding back something.

310
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,770
And we can't tell necessarily here
whether this is talking about a thing,

311
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,930
a power or a person.

312
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,400
Is there a person who's keeping this
guy back in the wings who's not letting

313
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:10,401
this a divine self promoter settings
and set himself up in Jerusalem

314
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,330
for the mystery of lawlessness
is already at work,

315
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,680
but only until the one who
now restrains is removed. Ah,

316
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,660
so this restraining force,

317
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,850
our risk training thing are restraining
person is at some point going to be

318
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,910
removed from the geographic,
from the political scene,

319
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,090
and then this other
characters is going to come in

320
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,910
and then the lawless one will be revealed.

321
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,810
Yeah.

322
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,860
Whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with
the breadth of his mouth annihilating him

323
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:44,360
by the manifestation of his coming.

324
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,740
The coming of the lawless one is apparent
in the working of Satan who uses all

325
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:50,390
power signs,
lying wonders,

326
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,020
every kind of wicked deception for those
who are perishing because they refuse

327
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:56,480
to love the truth and soul be saved.
For this reason,

328
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,580
God sends them a powerful delusion.

329
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,820
Leading them to believe what is false
so that all who have not believed the

330
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:04,910
truth but took pleasure in
unrighteousness will be condemned.

331
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,730
What's going on here?
Well,

332
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,180
there's some extent your
guess is as good as mine,

333
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,980
except that I know a bit more about
ancient Jewish apocalyptic and so I have a

334
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,560
few resources to draw on.
For one thing though,

335
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:22,010
I think what's going on here is this
author is referring to some kind of

336
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,530
antichrist figure.
He doesn't use the term here,

337
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,700
but he's clearly saying this is someone
who's setting himself up as as divine

338
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:29,181
has god.

339
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:32,570
He's going to take a seat in the temple
in Jerusalem and he's going to proclaim

340
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:37,040
himself to be God, or perhaps he's also
referring to a messianic pretender.

341
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,460
Maybe he's thinking that
this will be another messiah,

342
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,190
a false messiah of sorts.
That is the anti Christ.

343
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,450
If that's true, then what was he imagined
going on? I think what he's doing,

344
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:50,620
and this is my speculation,

345
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,280
I think he's actually imagining
a Jewish false messiah,

346
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,950
this cert,
somewhere hidden.

347
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,550
He knows not where there's some guy
somewhere in Palestine or someplace else

348
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,450
who's hiding in the wings, waiting
for the moment when he can come out,

349
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:12,451
declare himself as the Messiah and enter
the Jerusalem temple and set himself up

350
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,540
as the Divine Messiah figure.
If so,

351
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,540
what's keeping him from doing it now?
Well,

352
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,300
maybe it's just some supernatural force.
Maybe it's even God.

353
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:25,330
Maybe as God has just decided it's
not yet time for this to happen.

354
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,770
But what if the thing that's keeping
them from doing it now is precisely the

355
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,750
Romans.
In other words,

356
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,870
the force that's keeping any Jewish
Messiah figure down now would be the Roman

357
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:40,780
empire. They're not allowing kings.
No. Look what they did with Jesus.

358
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,370
They also executed other, uh,
Messiah figures in the first century.

359
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,900
The author therefore sees the Roman
emperor at work and the Roman Empire,

360
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,700
and that's the thing,

361
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:56,620
restraining this false messiah
from setting up shop in Jerusalem,

362
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,720
but he says that's going to be taken away.
How's that going to happen?

363
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,730
Again, we don't know. But in my mind,

364
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,470
it's the idea that somehow
the Roman emperor is going
to be moved out of the way

365
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,410
by God when the time comes
for this all to happen.

366
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,850
And then there's Jewish Messiah was set
himself up and then Jesus will come in,

367
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,260
destroy the false messiah,

368
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,070
and that's when we'll have the setting
up of the real kingdom of God. Now,

369
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,110
as I said,
that's speculation,

370
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,760
but what I'm doing is saying what kind
of scenario is he possibly imagining?

371
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,440
But the reason I do this little scenario
is because what would be this guy's

372
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:36,640
view of Rome and the relationship
between the Christian movement,

373
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:41,020
the Jesus Movement and Rome? Well,
he, if my little scenarios right,

374
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,140
he doesn't see Rome as simply an
a whole heartedly negative thing.

375
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,570
Rome actually has a purpose in God's plan.

376
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,160
Rome's purpose is to keep back this
false Jewish Messiah from appearing.

377
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,630
And then when that purpose has done, God
will remove the Roman Empire from being,

378
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,510
uh, uh, political, uh, geopolitical force.

379
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,030
And then the beginning,

380
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:09,031
the real beginning of the
end time schedule will kick
into gear and Jesus will

381
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,290
come through,
destroy this lawless one,

382
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,940
the one set of false messiah also
destroy the Romans preps and set up the

383
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,760
Kingdom of God. But what that
does is that gives us another,

384
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,570
another look at what an author
may have conceived Rome to be.

385
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,160
And it's not nearly as negative
as the revelation offer author.

386
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,260
It may not also be completely positive
either because he still sees Rome

387
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,120
apparently is being destroyed in the end.

388
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,230
So second Thessalonians though therefore
looks like a case where someone's

389
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:46,141
writing a letter in Paul's name precisely
to counter the idea that Jesus is

390
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:47,750
coming back tomorrow.

391
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,830
And because he believes you have to
have a certain number of things that are

392
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:55,190
going to happen, it's still is
fairly soon in the future. He's not,

393
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,320
he's not expecting a thousand
years or anything like that,

394
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,370
but he's seems to believe that there's
gonna be a timeline of geopolitical

395
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:06,200
events that take place before Jesus
comes back. So that second Thessalonians,

396
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,340
any questions,

397
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,440
comments or outburst about
that before I move on?

398
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,740
Yes sir.

399
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,730
Is it possible that to give it the
cult of the Roman emperor or here

400
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,160
that he might be referring
to the Roman emperor here?
Uh, it could be, uh, in fact,

401
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,210
uh, that that's possibly the way
some things set up. But the thing,

402
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,640
the reason I don't think
it's the Roman emperor,

403
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:31,950
here's because he talks
about this character as if
he's hidden for the moment.

404
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,970
It's a mystery and the won't,
he's not revealed the Roman emperor.

405
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:38,670
You could have never said here was not,
was not revealed.

406
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,210
The Roman emperor was visible everywhere
you looked in the Mediterranean.

407
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:45,210
It's time, statues, inscriptions, temples.

408
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,320
So I think he's probably not talking
to the Roman emperor as the lawless one

409
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,780
that cause the Roman emperor
wasn't hidden at the time.

410
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,183
Okay.

411
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,760
Any other questions? Okay. Now though,

412
00:24:57,761 --> 00:24:58,810
let's look at first Peter.

413
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,840
So we're going to another little text
that asking again the same question.

414
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,990
What is the politics of the
early Christian movement?
The early Jesus Movement?

415
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,330
First Peter, by most of us scholars, we
don't believe Peter Actually wrote it.

416
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,540
Um, the reasons are again, numerous.

417
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,680
And notice,
this is not an anonymous letter like a,

418
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,030
the letters of John are that
don't claim to be written by John.

419
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,260
This one actually claims to be written by
Peter the Apostle as does second Peter.

420
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,330
Why do we think Peter the actual apostle
didn't write it well? For one thing,

421
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,800
Peter was even as, uh, the
new testament several times,

422
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:44,020
lets us know an illiterate fishermen,

423
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,150
he probably couldn't read or write
if he could read or write. He,

424
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,800
it's almost certain that he couldn't
read or write Greek at the level of Greek

425
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:54,790
that this letter is written.

426
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,120
There are other things in the letter
that make us think that it looks like a

427
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,400
Christianity in a little bit later
stage than the very primitive area of

428
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:05,890
Christianity. The development
of doctrine, the development of,

429
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:08,260
of the notions of Peter himself.
Uh,

430
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,970
the idea that that certainly the theology
of the letter seemed to look later

431
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,310
than the most primitive
time of early Christianity.

432
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,970
But most of us would just say simply on
the basis of the language itself. Uh,

433
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,190
we don't believe the Peter,
the actual apostle wrote this letter.

434
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,440
So look what he's, he's, he's
right. He says, he says, Peter,

435
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:33,970
an apostle of Jesus Christ to the exiles
of the dispersion in punches, Galicia,

436
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:37,720
Kappa Dosha, Asia and Bithynia.
So again, he's writing to,

437
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,230
he calls them exiles of the dispersion
so that some people might think, well,

438
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:43,650
these talking to Jews then the,
the disperse Jews,

439
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,330
but he clearly including
gentile Christians in this
too. So he's talking about,

440
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,930
uh, followers of Jesus who
live in all these different,

441
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,360
this different geographical area.
And again,

442
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,380
this is sort of what we would now
call Turkey, the area of Turkey,

443
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,850
both Asia minor, which proper was
just the western side of Turkey,

444
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,450
but pretty much all that
area of that occupies Turkey.

445
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,030
Now he calls them exiles though.

446
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,060
And I don't think he's talking about
this in an actual political sense.

447
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,650
He spiritualizing the notion
that followers of Jesus
are exiles in our world.

448
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,460
We don't belong here. He
says. So he says also,

449
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,850
um,
one 17,

450
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,230
if you invoke his father,

451
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,620
the one who judges all people impartially
according to these live in reverent

452
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:35,130
fear during the time of your exile.
Again,

453
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,980
followers of Jesus are exiles to 11.

454
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,381
Beloved,

455
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:44,070
I urge you as aliens and exiles to
abstain from the desires of the flesh,

456
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,390
that wage war against the soul.

457
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,440
These are great terms that would have
meant in the ancient context precisely

458
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:53,550
what illegal alien means.
And I'm co contemporary American context.

459
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,560
You're here illegally. So all the
followers of Jesus, according to a rider,

460
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,720
live in the Roman Empire as illegal
aliens basically are not illegal aliens,

461
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,760
but definitely is aliens.
Maybe they're illegal aliens,

462
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:10,170
but they don't really belong.
So he also said,

463
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,620
he's talking not just to Jews.
He says in one 18,

464
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:16,980
you know that you were ransomed from
the futile ways inherited from your

465
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:19,740
ancestors, not with perishable
things like silver and gold,

466
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,440
with the precious body of
Christ's blood of Christ.

467
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,810
So the ancestors referring here,

468
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,370
he's clearly from to gentiles who have
come into the church, uh, as gentiles,

469
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,990
and then now occupy their
role, uh, as people,

470
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:38,400
as part of this alien people to now,
what's this guy's politics?

471
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,840
Look at two 13

472
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,760
for the Lord's sake, except the
authority of every human institution.

473
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,120
Uh,

474
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,440
now we're pretty clear that the authority
here is not at least just referring to

475
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:56,970
angelic type supernatural authorities,
but he's referring to the human rulers,

476
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,410
whether of the impo emperor as supreme
or of governors as sent by him to punish

477
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:06,510
those who do wrong and to praise
those who do. Right? Of course,

478
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,110
the governors of the different parts of
the Roman empire were appointed either

479
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,270
by the Senate or by the emperor himself.

480
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,810
This author's not too neat about,
uh,

481
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,880
the actual politics of the first century.

482
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,080
So He seems to believe that all go rub
governors are appointed by the emperor,

483
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,050
which was in fact not the case,
but some of them weren't.

484
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,520
Many of them are appointed by the Senate.

485
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,040
He doesn't care about
those kinds of niceties.

486
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,430
For it is God's will that by doing right,

487
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,260
you should silence the ignorance of the
foolish as servants of God live as free

488
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:41,860
people. Yet do not use your freedom
as a pretext for evil. Honor everyone.

489
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,480
Love the family of believers.
Fear God. Honor the emperor.

490
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Can you imagine the author of
revelation saying that he could not,

491
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,500
it would have broken his jaw to say,
honor the emperor.

492
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,910
He also doesn't seem to have a whole lot
of love for just people in general. The,

493
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,440
the book of revelation seems to have a
lot of loyalty for the people who are in

494
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:06,274
the group,

495
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,700
but there seems to be a lot of despising
for pretty much anybody outside the

496
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:10,534
group.

497
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,070
So that's the political
conservatism of first Peter.

498
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,210
He's writing a letter to followers of
Jesus who live throughout the area of

499
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:23,170
Turkey. He's trying to get them to see
that they don't really belong to Rome.

500
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,140
They're not Romans, he doesn't,
doesn't address them as Romans.

501
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,690
They don't really belong to the
political situations they're living in.

502
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
They should see themselves as aliens,

503
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:36,150
as exiles and yet they're still see
themselves as properly subservient,

504
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,900
honorable,
well behaved exiles in a Roman context.

505
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,960
And so that plays itself out
also in some of the other, uh,

506
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,570
social justice issues in this,
in the politics. Look at two 18,

507
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,340
right where we stopped after. He
says, honor the emperor slaves,

508
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:57,820
except the authority of your
masters with all deference,

509
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,470
not only those who are kind and gentle,

510
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:04,000
but also those who are harsh for it as a
credit to you. If B, being aware of God,

511
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,280
you're endure pain while
suffering unjustly.

512
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,580
If you endure when you are beaten
for doing wrong, what credit is that?

513
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,850
If you endure, when you do write and
suffer for it, you have God's approval.

514
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,820
This is ideologically very problematic.
Telling slaves,

515
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,300
you know, just submit. And
if you're being beaten,

516
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,980
don't blame your master for beating
you. Just endure it. I mean,

517
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:30,250
if you do wrong and your master beats you,
then you deserve to get beaten,

518
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,330
but you should endure it even when you
get beaten for things you don't deserve.

519
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,170
Talk about the opiate of the masses.

520
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,010
This is precisely the kind of religion
that classical Marxism critiques or

521
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:50,740
religion that exists to keep the slaves,
the slave, to keep the poor poor,

522
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,540
to keep the downtrodden,
downtrodden.

523
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,820
So part of the honoring of the emperor
is to teach slaves just to submit.

524
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,570
And if you can't enjoy it when you're
being beaten, at least put up with it.

525
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,900
Look at, uh, three,

526
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:09,901
one through seven wives in the same way
except the authority of your husbands.

527
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,050
My mom used to always hate it when
that read out these passages in church,

528
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,010
we'd have a very loud
discussion of such patches.

529
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:23,011
It's over Sunday dinner then after
this wives in the same way except the

530
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:26,470
authority of your husbands. So that even
if some of them do not obey the word,

531
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,770
they may be won over without a word
by their wives conduct. She used to.

532
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:32,590
Some of these women are followers of Jesus
and their husbands are not Christians.

533
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
They should still obey them.

534
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:38,800
Though he says he doesn't allow women
to use their Christian allegiance,

535
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:39,560
uh,

536
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,770
and there the Lordship of Christ over
them to get out from under the Lordship of

537
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:43,604
their husbands.

538
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,610
Yeah.

539
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,190
Do not adorn yourself outwardly
by braiding your hair,

540
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,740
by wearing gold ornaments
are fine clothing. Rather,

541
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:53,950
let your adornment be the inner self
with the lasting beauty of a gentle and

542
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:56,590
quiet spirit,
which is very precious in God's sight.

543
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,890
My mom especially hated that
gentle and quiet spirit part.

544
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,040
She had no intentions of being
a very gentle and quiet spirit.

545
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,440
It wasn't this way long ago.

546
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:09,160
Did the holy women who hoped in God used
to adorn themselves by accepting the

547
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:10,690
authority of their husbands.

548
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,400
And he goes on like that
and they look at five five

549
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,190
chapter five verse five.

550
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,360
In the same way you who are younger
must accept the authority of elders.

551
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,210
And all of you must clothe yourselves
with humility in the dealings with one

552
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,390
another. For God opposes the proud,
but gives grace to the humble.

553
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,730
So in all of this stuff,
this author is basically telling people,

554
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:37,960
stay in your place. No
revolution, no rebellion.

555
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,190
Don't even resent the people who are
over you and have authority over you.

556
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,370
So this is quite clearly political,
quieting them

557
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,040
political accommodation.

558
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,400
Uh,

559
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,820
and one of the reasons he's doing this
as scholars appointed is that he seems to

560
00:33:55,821 --> 00:34:00,821
believe that Christians can help their
reputation if they don't rock the boat.

561
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,790
So you get versus like this to 12,

562
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,140
conduct yourselves honorably among the
gentiles. Now notice he's, these are some,

563
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,000
these are converted gentiles themselves,

564
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:16,180
but he doesn't call them gentiles because
the gentiles is still now a term for

565
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:19,150
those people outside the body of Christ,
outside of Christianity,

566
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,140
conduct yourselves honorably among the
gentiles so that though they malign you

567
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:24,010
as evil doers,

568
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,880
they may see your honorable deeds and
glorify God when he comes to judge.

569
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,040
And in chapter three verse 15

570
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,513
okay,

571
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,960
in your heart,
sanctify Christ as Lord.

572
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,870
Always be ready to make your defense
to anyone who demands from you and

573
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:42,310
accounting for the hope that is in you,
yet with gentleness and reverence.

574
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,970
So he's basically very conservative
in his politics and his ideology.

575
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,540
For one reason,

576
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:54,630
he wants these groups of followers of
Jesus not to be disrespected by outsiders.

577
00:34:56,111 --> 00:35:00,070
He wants them to develop a good reputation
so that they can't be persecuted so

578
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:02,440
that they can't be opposed
by local authorities.

579
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,620
So here we have a clear case of a totally
different ideological take on early

580
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:11,350
Christianity, but it's still
apocalyptic. This is what's interesting.

581
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:14,410
He's still this, hi, hi. This
other hasn't thrown away.

582
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,220
The Christian apocalyptic that we saw
working so much in revelation to be anti

583
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:22,300
Roman. He still has it. You
can see places. He says in
chapter four, verse seven,

584
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,890
the end of all things is near. Well,
that's apocalyptic. Cism the end is near.

585
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,810
Therefore, be serious and discipline
yourself for the sake of your prayers. Uh,

586
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,270
in four 12,
beloved,

587
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:38,460
do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal
that is taking place you to test you as

588
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:42,390
though something strange were happening
to you. So any suffering that you have,

589
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,380
he says chocolate up to the suffering
that comes with the apocalyptic fire.

590
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,230
This is testing you. So
again, just endure it.

591
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:53,700
And 17 for the time has come for judgment
to begin with the household of God.

592
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,020
If it begins with us,

593
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,990
what will be the end for those
who do not obey the gospel of God?

594
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,370
So he does believe that the people who
are persecuting them now are dissing them.

595
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:05,760
Now, I'm not so sure that sometimes it
was astrical physical persecution in these

596
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:09,300
communities were enduring. He may just
believe that they're being disrespected,

597
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,180
that they're being discriminated
against in some way.

598
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:17,040
But what his solution to this is for
them not to rock the boat, not to rebel,

599
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,110
not to fight back, but actually to just
be good boys and girls. Be Submissive.

600
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:26,730
Slaves, be submissive women to your
husbands. And then, uh, if possible,

601
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:30,180
people will see your submission
and that'll make them
respect the message of the

602
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:32,670
Gospel. If not, those
people will be destroyed.

603
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,290
But we have to into our own punishment
and serving. Now also the apocalyptic,

604
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,520
they apocalyptic material here there
serves a different purpose than it did in

605
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:43,500
revelation and some other
Christian and Jewish texts.

606
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,240
It's not particularly there to
make you to explain your suffering.

607
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,010
It's just there to be endured.

608
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,370
It's just there because it's part of
the message of early Christianity.

609
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,320
So it doesn't really help fight against
injustice in any way as you might be

610
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:01,890
able to see it doing other texts. Now,
how does this happen in second, Peter,

611
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,670
we'll just look at this briefly
because we're almost out of time,

612
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:06,810
but I show you one more thing.

613
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,600
I believe second Peter was
written by someone else,

614
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,030
not Peter again for some
of the same reasons,

615
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,270
but I also believe it was not written
by the same person who wrote first Peter

616
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,520
because it's rather different.
In fact,

617
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,910
I believe Second Peter was written
sometime in the second century,

618
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,060
maybe even decades after
the letters of Paul and,

619
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,520
and the book of revelation
and these others were written.

620
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:31,710
And it seems to me to show a different
stage in the development of Christianity,

621
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:31,711
Christianity.

622
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:35,340
Now it looks different in the second
century than it did in the first century.

623
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:38,880
And I'll walk you through this and
show why I say that and how it works.

624
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,860
First look at second Peter Three two.
Well,

625
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,370
we'll start reading at the beginning
of chapter three. This is now beloved.

626
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:49,260
The second letter I'm writing to you.
Ah,

627
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,290
so he seems to know about the existence
of the first letter of Peter in them.

628
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:58,620
I'm trying to arouse your
sincere intention by reminding
you so that you should

629
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:02,610
remember the words spoken in the past
by the holy prophets and the commandment

630
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:04,590
of the Lord and Savior
spoken through your apostles.

631
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,250
So this is already something
like a post epistolic letter.

632
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,090
He's hearkening back to the beginning
of the Christian movement when they were

633
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,320
prophets and apostles,

634
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,620
even though he's setting himself up
as Peter the Apostle in the letter,

635
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,800
the tone of the letter makes it sound
like the apostolic era is somewhere in the

636
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,310
past for, for this guy's a version
of Christianity for his community.

637
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,490
So we read second Peter is actually a
really good example of post epistolic new

638
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:38,890
testament writing. He also has
references to the gospels themselves.

639
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:42,910
Look at one 17.
Uh,

640
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:46,940
I'll start reading at one 16
for we did not follow cleverly,

641
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,360
cleverly devised myths when we made
known to you the power and coming of our

642
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:54,170
Lord Jesus Christ. But we had
been eyewitnesses of his majesty,

643
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,620
for he had received for he received
honor and glory from God the father.

644
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,700
When that voice was conveyed to him by
the majestic glory saying, this is my son,

645
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:03,320
my beloved,
with whom I am well pleased.

646
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,990
We ourselves heard this
voice come from heaven.

647
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,620
When we were with him on the Holy
Mountain, what is he referring to?

648
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,830
What's the event exactly? The
transfiguration. He's red, his gospels,

649
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,473
at least one of them.

650
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,940
And he's hearkening back to the story
of the transfiguration of Jesus on the

651
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:27,440
mountain with Moses and Elijah there.
And of course who were the apostles?

652
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:31,370
The disciples were with Jesus at the
time, Peter and, and was one of them.

653
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:31,941
There were three of them.

654
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:35,690
So Peter was there and he's recalling
that scene from the gospels.

655
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,670
So there's reference to Gospel traditions
here and maybe even he's actually read

656
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:44,050
some written gospels that
we have in our text. Uh,

657
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,260
he also says because something
like a reference to first Peter is,

658
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,780
I already said that my, when he says
I've already written to you once,

659
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:54,530
that could be a reference to first Peter.
And then he talks about Paul's letters.

660
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,510
So he knows Paul's letters.
Three 15 wait, is that right?

661
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,720
Yep. Sorry, we get three
14. Therefore beloved,

662
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:08,380
while you are waiting for these things,
strive to be found by him at peace,

663
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,310
without spot or blemish and regard
the patients of our Lord as salvation.

664
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:17,490
So also our brother Paul wrote to you
according to the wisdom given him.

665
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,620
Speaking of this,
as he does in all his letters,

666
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,110
there are some things in
them hard to understand,

667
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,340
which are the ignorant and unstable
twist to their own destruction as they do

668
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:32,110
the other scriptures, you therefore
beloved. So he goes on to admonish them,

669
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,100
but notice what he's doing. He actually
calls Paul's letters scripture.

670
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,730
Now, Paul, when he was
writing his letters,

671
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,160
he thought he was riding
authoritative letters,

672
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:45,340
but there were authoritative because
he was an apostle who had founded the

673
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,370
churches. Most of the time
he was writing to churches.

674
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:51,490
He himself found it so he felt like he
had authority over these churches to

675
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,670
write authoritative letters, but Paul
didn't think he was writing scripture.

676
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,310
When Paul talks about
scripture in his letters,

677
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,600
he's talking about Jewish scripture,
the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible.

678
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,650
This guy though is far enough removed
from Paul's own day that he can actually

679
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:11,680
refer to Paul's letters as themselves.
Part of scripture.

680
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,010
That's one of the things we run.

681
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:15,070
The reason we think this
took a while to develop.

682
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,050
You just don't have in early Christianity
the automatic acceptance of Paul's

683
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,710
occasional letters because they were
real letters written to real situations.

684
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,570
Being elevated now to the status
of holy writing scripture.

685
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,380
This author is living now in a post
epistolic age in a post Pauline age and

686
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:37,120
he's, he obviously he's is
probably by this time, they don't,

687
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,530
they don't have a new testament yet,
but probably about this time,

688
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,670
he's already familiar with
maybe a collection of Paul's
letters that are being

689
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:48,350
circulated as scripture among
different churches in Asia Minor.

690
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,050
He also may,
as I said,

691
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,060
be be familiar with some gospels that
are being circulated as off authoritative

692
00:41:56,451 --> 00:42:01,220
texts in early Christianity.
So he's clearly living in
a later time. Like I said,

693
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,560
maybe in the second century
when these things have happened.

694
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,930
And then one last thing that is
interesting to, to talk about, uh,

695
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,220
what keep your finger there in second
Peter, but we're going to look at Jude.

696
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,590
So flip over to Jude,
which is right before revelation.

697
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,053
Okay.

698
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,670
Jude is a short little letter.

699
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,540
Jude 14.

700
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:28,950
Okay.

701
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,510
It was also about these,

702
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,860
he's talking about Tom Evil
angels are angels of some sort.

703
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,330
That Enoch member Enoch is
that character in the very,

704
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:42,840
very early part of genesis who was
only a few generations from Adam.

705
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,260
But there were apocalypses written and
Enoch's name and published just in the

706
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,800
last century or so before
this, that, uh, two sec,

707
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,700
two or three centuries before
this. So we have different, uh,

708
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:57,840
different documents called the
apocalypse of Enoch or the revelation of

709
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,190
[inaudible] you knock itself,

710
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,080
Enoch in the seventh generation
from Adam prophesied saying,

711
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,490
see the Lord is coming with 10 thousands
of his holy ones to execute judgment on

712
00:43:08,491 --> 00:43:12,210
all and to convict every one of the
deeds of ungodliness that they have

713
00:43:12,211 --> 00:43:15,990
committed in such an ungodly way and
of all the harsh things that ungodly

714
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:17,280
sinners have spoken against.

715
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,440
Yeah.

716
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,580
So notice what he's doing. He's
quoting, he knock it literature,

717
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:30,030
which isn't in our Bible as if it is also
true prophecy in scripture from Enoch.

718
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,250
Okay? Now that's what Jude does. It's not,

719
00:43:33,251 --> 00:43:35,470
it's important because he's
having a debate about angels.

720
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,980
But now look over at second Peter Two 10

721
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,430
is this right?
Yes.

722
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,190
I'm not going to read all of
this, but um, if you look at,

723
00:43:54,191 --> 00:43:58,090
if you read second Peter
Two Verses 10 through 22,

724
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,400
you have a bunch of material that
second Peter is getting out of Jude.

725
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,560
In other words,
second Peter,

726
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,470
they're all three second Peter
doesn't only know the letters of Paul,

727
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,680
he knows Jude also and he's using Jude
as a source and he copied some of that

728
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:18,700
out. But what's interesting enough,
he takes out the quotation from Enoch.

729
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,290
He doesn't have that. And there was, he
takes Jude as a good Christian source,

730
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:28,360
but he takes out the stuff he found
in Jude that he doesn't consider good

731
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,340
Christian material and
Christian scripture.

732
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,850
So he edits out of Jude stuff that by
that time he believes is not really part

733
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:37,170
of Christian scripture.
What again,

734
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:41,580
what this shows us is that their author
of second Peter is living in a time when

735
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:46,350
we actually see the beginning of
Christian scripture coming about.

736
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,920
This is a very different time from the
epistolic period when they were just

737
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,590
writing letters,
occasional letters for different purposes,

738
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,420
not having any idea that they were
creating a new testament themselves.

739
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,040
This author is not living in the time
by which we have a new testament that'll

740
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,720
take another few centuries to come about.

741
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:07,050
As I talked about the very first lecture
when I talked about Canon development,

742
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,490
that's going to happen,

743
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:13,170
but he's certainly living in a time
that's between the epistolic period when

744
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:15,990
everything is much more chaotic and
there's not any Christian scripture.

745
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,230
And now you do have Christian scripture
scripture on its way to becoming its own

746
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,590
canon. So Ha. So this isn't
a post epistolic period.

747
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:28,380
So the last thing is what
does the apocalyptic do here?

748
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,410
Look at three verse three Second Peter
Three verse three because there is

749
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:37,890
apocalyptic here also. First,
you must understand this,

750
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,430
that in the last days scoffers will come
scoffing and indulging their own lusts

751
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:45,300
and saying, where is the promise of his
coming for? Ever since our ancestors died,

752
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,820
all things continue as they were
from the beginning of creation.

753
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,320
Notice that's gotta be posts.

754
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,140
Peter Peter in his own time
would never have talked about.

755
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,780
The beginning of the Jesus
movement is happening way,

756
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:56,880
way in there with our ancestors,
right?

757
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,150
They deliberately ignore this
fact that by the word of God,

758
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,720
the heavens existed long ago and an earth
was formed out of water and by means

759
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:06,510
of water through which the world of
that time was diluted with water and

760
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:08,010
perished by the same word.

761
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:10,980
The present heavens and earth
had been reserved for fire,

762
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,740
had been kept until the day of judgment
and destruction of the goddess.

763
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,860
So he believes this end is coming,
this end of fire,

764
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,880
the destruction of the current world,
but do not ignore this one fact,

765
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,260
beloved that with the Lord,

766
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:26,220
one day is like a thousand years and
a thousand years are like one day.

767
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,920
The Lord is not slow about his
promise as some think of slowness,

768
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,760
but is patient with you not wanting any
to perish but all to come to repentance.

769
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,420
But the day of the Lord will come like
a thief and then the heavens will pass

770
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:37,500
away with a loud noise.

771
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,800
The elements will be dissolved with fire
and the earth and everything that is

772
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:45,801
done on it will be disclosed so that
he does have an apocalyptic scenario,

773
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,720
but what does it do for him?
Nothing.

774
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,380
It's just something that's part of
Christian doctrine that he's passing on.

775
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,390
He's not,
there's no franticness here.

776
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:56,310
There's no idea that it's going
to happen right now. In fact,

777
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:59,370
he says it could happen
in a thousand years.

778
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:05,780
We're no longer with this letter in a
kind of Christianity that has apocalyptic

779
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:08,040
fervor to it.

780
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,820
We're in a kind of Christianity that
is starting to have its own Christian

781
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:14,460
scripture, this fairly
conservative, again,

782
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:19,140
politically that you don't see a lot of
stuff against Rome in that sort of thing,

783
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:24,270
and the function of the apocalyptic
apocalyptic autism here is simply us.

784
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,410
Just something you believe if you're a
Christian. Again, it's another example.

785
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,110
Apocalyptic is a political ideology,

786
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,550
but what kind of politics it teaches in
the early times of Christianity can very

787
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,660
apocalyptic,

788
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:45,460
can be something that strengthens you
against Roman oppression that labels Rome

789
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,640
for you as a whore and
Jessebelle and a monster.

790
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,750
Or it can teach you to be quiet
and go about your business.

791
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,190
So one of the things you're going to
be talking about today and your in your

792
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:01,360
sections is which kinds of texts and
early Christianity that we've looked at

793
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,690
function what way politically
and apocalyptic is one of
those political kinds of

794
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,580
forces in early Christianity,
although certainly not the only one.

795
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,500
You're supposed to look at these texts
and say what politics is assumed by these

796
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:17,290
texts.
So you next week.
