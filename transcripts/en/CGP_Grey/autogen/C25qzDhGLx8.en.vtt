00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.020
 When do you want to die? 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.120
 King of death is busy, but 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.160
 He can make you a place now 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 Is it early, later possible, you in the future will book the date 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.400
 Old with life I lived it fully. 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.860
 Maybe a little bored and ready for your appointment 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.280
 Now maybe you're thinking about it 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.460
 But when the appointed time comes to you the king of death 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.120
 The date is not in the future 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.780
 Because you do not live in the future 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.100
 You always live in the present 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.200
 Therefore, you always die in the present 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 For the king of death will come to all sooner or later 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.320
 Humans formed a foolish relationship with death. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.860
 Such as the hostage whom she loved. 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.240
 Humans say to themselves 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.680
 The few decades they have taken from the King of Death are the right amount. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.780
 Living long and healthy will be boring 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.480
 Their lives will be abnormal. 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.400
 Imagine all the problems if the king of death took leave. 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.000
 He will whisper to you the king of death it 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.280
 A friend of yours 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.400
 Near always, human beings grow; Bigger, stronger, healthier and smarter. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.120
 At first, then comes the harvest of the slow death king 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.060
 "Death is part of life." He whispers. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.100
 Death gives life meaning 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.280
 This is madness. Suffering does not give happiness. 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300
 Happiness means itself. 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.280
 If you torture people to make them appreciate life. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.340
 You will be a monster. 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.040
 Just like this person 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.020
 There is no father asking the king of death to whiten the skin of his son. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.720
 Weaken their bones, darken their eyes and minds and make them paralyzed 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.460
 In a thousand ways over several decades and eventually kill them 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.220
 To give life meaning. 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 But what will you do? The world contains pain and death. 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.180
 That is why your mind will believe lies that horrible things you can not keep away from 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.560
 Is a good thing for you. 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.040
 Although death is part of life 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.720
 Cholera was part of life until humans 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.660
 They developed wells and sanitary drains to separate water from waste 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 Myopia was part of life until it disappeared. 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.120
 Just because something is part of nature does not make it good or necessary 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.760
 It is nature to live life dirty, 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.280
 Strong and short. 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.340
 It is normal for humans to look at what 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.600
 Nature has a starting point. 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.200
 As a task paper, when people concentrate 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.180
 Technology evolves 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.320
 With that capacity, we can make life better 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.820
 And now some simple tools with a real promise to slow down or stop the vulnerability 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.340
 Something has become clear on the horizon. 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.320
 Which makes it questionable 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.060
 What is the power of the king of death? 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.240
 With little time and focus, can humans make it 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.580
 These simple instruments of shields and swords make the king of death in his place 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 Maybe for ever? Maybe but 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 And if the first generation of the two 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.240
 Maybe they live today 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.960
 Generation lives a healthy life 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.320
 The length of time they wish 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.000
 But to make this happen, we must eradicate the minds of thousands of years 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.640
 Who accept death 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.120
 Death is not the solution to imagined and volatile problems 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.060
 Face the challenges that a longer life will bring 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.100
 Humans will not long for the king of death 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.220
 They create a new king of death to solve their problems. Just when our cities grew up 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.580
 We did not mix water to retrieve cholera 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.400
 Human beings must ignore the acquired deficit 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.400
 Who was imposed upon them by the king of death and their minds 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.640
 And do not look at weakness and disease as a natural and inevitable 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.620
 But as a disease of the past and must be attacked as all diseases 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.660
 As a disease of the past 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.280
 Which affects all human beings 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.400
 As a source of unhappiness 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.760
 There is no suffering in your near future 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.300
 But in your presence 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.840
 The question is when will we start a concentration project 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.760
 Our attention and our equipment are against 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.560
 The King of Death is an important thing 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.060
 And teams only one day 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.840
 May be inevitable 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.120
 In any aspect of the future crack you will find yourself on them 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.800
 She travels for ever 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.900
 Or fall back into the abyss 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.920
 Have you been late? 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.800
 We probably will not win the war against death. 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.380
 For death has all the power 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.600
 But perhaps we can win the battle against the thing after death, the same age. 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.800
 There is a real chance that you will live longer and have a healthy life 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.740
 But do you have to do this? We'll find out in this video
