00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:03.806
&gt;&gt;Karen Gilpin: By showing them
that what we're doing

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:09.126
in the classroom is affecting their
community and helping their community,

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:13.436
they see its value, and so
they're willing to buy-in,

00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:17.896
even if the academics get a little hard,
they're willing to work a little harder.

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:28.246
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Any problem isn't really
a problem, it's an opportunity.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.466
Right? It's an opportunity
to learn something.

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:35.756
They may not be the hero that rides
in and solves the problem completely,

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:37.066
but they get a piece of it.

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:38.506
They can be part of the solution.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:41.086
&gt;&gt;Jacob: This could be right over there.

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:44.926
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: You know, with our agriculture
program, in tying in the chores

00:00:44.926 --> 00:00:46.876
that they have to do,
they live that every day.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:50.476
&gt;&gt;Jacob: We're actually building
playgrounds for the animals,

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:55.906
because we've found that they have
been trying to jump over the fence.

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:59.506
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: The kids really started to
think, "[sigh] They're kind of bored,

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:00.776
why are they acting this way?

00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:02.096
Why do they keep getting out?"

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:05.866
&gt;&gt;Kevin: They hardly have anything to
play with, and sometimes they'll get

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:08.396
on the watering containers.

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.646
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: The one rain barrel,
when it got knocked over,

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:12.086
the goats started jumping over it.

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:13.776
So like, "Well, huh, they like that.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:15.336
What else could we make?"

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:17.896
So that's when we came
up with the idea of,

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:19.456
"Maybe they need some
playground equipment."

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.496
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: Ladders here, slides here.

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:22.726
Let's see what we can design.

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:26.086
Kind of tie our engineering
piece in and problem solving.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:31.296
&gt;&gt;Jacob: We had to draw our own design,
and it had to be from everybody's idea.

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:33.696
&gt;&gt;Kevin: We're trying to build the model

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:37.396
like we have it on paper,
but like in 3D.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.466
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: And they're going to build this
model, and then they're going to get

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.036
to see the actual thing built.

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:47.556
&gt;&gt;Jacob: Professionals will pick the
best one to be put inside the barnyard.

00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:50.746
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: I had them tell me what
materials they thought they needed.

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.376
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: So they're already
collecting stuff.

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:53.726
Do we have popsicle sticks?

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:54.596
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: We have popsicle sticks.

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:54.786
Glue?

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:55.286
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: Mm hm.

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:57.386
I'm curious to see what they're
going to do with the peanut butter.

00:01:57.836 --> 00:02:02.366
The other thing that we might want
to provide them is a model animal,

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.106
so that they can get this to scale.

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:08.356
&gt;&gt;This is how we're going
to scale our model.

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:11.886
If you are making something for
the goats or sheep to play on,

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:14.566
this should probably fit on it.

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:16.996
&gt;&gt;Students: [talking excitedly]

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:21.036
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: When it's something where
they know it's gonna be out there

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:26.076
in the schoolyard, they're
totally engaged with it.

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:29.086
Because there's also a sense of
pride, like I helped do that.

00:02:29.196 --> 00:02:31.896
I mean, they're going to have this
cool product at the end, but they're--

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:35.636
hopefully will also remember, "We
built models, we worked as a team."

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:39.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, I don't think
they would need a feeder on there.

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:43.316
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: "I got to use a saw, I
learned how to use a measuring tape.

00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:47.446
You know, I know what a 90-degree angle
looks like because it's over there

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:50.656
on that playground for the goats,
and I see it every day I'm outside."

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.966
&gt;&gt;Broken.

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:55.926
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:02:56.056 --> 00:02:56.976
&gt;&gt;You can use some of these.

00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:00.216
&gt;&gt;Karen Gilpin: Well, one of the
standards for first grade is

00:03:00.286 --> 00:03:04.256
that students are aware
of the things around them.

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.016
&gt;&gt;It's wiggling to get the skin off.

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:08.236
&gt;&gt;Ohhhh!

00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:12.896
&gt;&gt;Karen Gilpin: We have been tagging
butterflies for several years.

00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:17.756
And then in the spring, we didn't
see many butterflies around here.

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:20.266
So we've talked to park rangers,

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:23.726
they have seen that this
area was low in milkweed.

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.436
&gt;&gt;Caroline Blizzard: We talked about,
you know, what's happening

00:03:25.436 --> 00:03:28.386
with the milkweed habitat loss,
and their milling patterns,

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.746
the climate shifting, all
of that that's playing in.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:32.316
And they really understood it!

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.956
&gt;&gt;You guys are going to
help us this year by helping

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:36.976
to plant their favorite plant.

00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:39.786
&gt;&gt;Students: Milkweed!

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.186
&gt;&gt;Caroline Blizzard: Milkweed!

00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:43.066
Why do they need milkweed?

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:43.926
&gt;&gt;Student: To lay their babies.

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:45.606
&gt;&gt;Caroline Blizzard: They lay their eggs.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:46.836
Give me five!

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:47.006
All right!

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:51.536
&gt;&gt;Karen Gilpin: We've read both informational
text on butterfly migration,

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:53.996
fictional text, social studies.

00:03:54.036 --> 00:03:57.186
We have tracked butterfly
migration on a map.

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:58.246
All kinds of things.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:01.496
Math, when we put the milkweed
here in the ground today.

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:01.676
&gt;&gt;Caroline Blizzard: All right!

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:04.316
You guys tell me which
one is three-quarters.

00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:05.336
&gt;&gt;This one.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:07.876
&gt;&gt;Caroline Blizzard: All right, so just
about like this, all right?

00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:10.556
And then you're going to lay
a seed right on top of that.

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:11.543
&gt;&gt;Yeah!

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:12.456
&gt;&gt;Caroline Blizzard: Can you find one?

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:13.556
Here, spread them out, there you go.

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:17.696
&gt;&gt;Caroline Blizzard: They really understand
that it's not about just what's happen

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:21.136
at Crellin, or even in Garrett
County, you know, you can ask them,

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.496
"Do the tornadoes in
Texas right now matter?"

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:25.736
And a second-grader here will you, "Yes,

00:04:25.936 --> 00:04:27.786
because that's where the
Monarchs currently are."

00:04:28.276 --> 00:04:28.796
&gt;&gt;Good job.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:30.426
You need some seeds?

00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:31.606
&gt;&gt;Okay, boys...

00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:34.746
&gt;&gt;I think they're starting to feel
like the things they think matter,

00:04:34.746 --> 00:04:36.126
the things that they do matter.

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.406
Even when I'm eight.

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:38.796
Even when I'm nine.

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:42.216
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: Because they're so
invested in it, and really engaged

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.996
in the process, it really cements it.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:45.736
It's something that they'll remember.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:46.986
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: Yeah, connections

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.696
to their outside world only
make learning more meaningful

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:53.136
and more purposeful, and more lasting.

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:56.306
&gt;&gt;Karen Gilpin: We're teaching them
to be people, important people,

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.976
who can do anything they want to do.
