[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.930
JENNY ARDEN: Hi, I'm Jenny.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.650
I'm a designer at Google.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.090
I work on the
self-driving car project.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.470
Before this project at Google,
I worked on YouTube for TV,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.400
designing TV-specific
experiences.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.770
And I also worked on Google's
core business search.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.930
So before that, I had my
fair share of agency work,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.000
mostly in New York City.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.070
And I've started a couple
small businesses as well.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.170
So what I want to
talk about today

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.990
is what it feels like to be
a creative person working

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.880
on a project that has
no concrete definition

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.880
and has very little structure.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.870
More specifically, I want to
talk about the emotional ups

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.020
and downs that creative-minded
people go through when they're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.290
working on something
brand new, and how

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.550
you can use those emotions
to be your North Star.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.940
So to start out, I want you
to think back and recollect

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.850
the first moment that you
had a truly creative moment

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.480
and recognized it.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.330
For some of you, it may
have been a simple drawing.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.970
And I think there are some
rock stars in this room

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.530
probably had been
artistic since birth,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.080
so this shouldn't
be too hard for you.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.010
So this is mine.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.340
I drew this when I was three.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.560
And it hangs in the kitchen
of my house where I grew up.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.400
My mom looks at it
every single day

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.050
when she makes
her cup of coffee.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.550
What I love about
this is it somehow

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.880
captured life according
to my three-year-old eyes.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.094
You have my parents.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.010
My mom's on the right.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.270
She's kind of leaning back.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.360
My dad's in the middle.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.590
Then we have our old sofa.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.650
We had this thing forever.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.690
And I used to play
with my toys on it.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.390
And then on the left, in
a very abstracted way,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.060
is a huge pile of books.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.820
And we had piles and piles
of books in our house.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.280
What I like about this is that
somehow, this simple drawing,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.870
it accurately
represented everything

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.790
that I had at that time.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.340
So for other people, their
first creative experience

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.240
may have been building a fort.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.730
My mom is a
self-employed writer.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.910
So we used to get these
really insanely thick boxes

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.060
full of her books.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.330
And they were the ultimate
building material for kids.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.500
So we would create these very
elaborate mazes and forts.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.860
And sometimes, especially
in our own bedrooms,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.212
we would layer them,
kind of creating a three,

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.210
four-story maze.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.170
And they were kind of
like a human ant farm.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.390
So what we loved about
building these forts

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.180
is that we made
something out of nothing.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.240
Somehow you can take something
as clean as cardboard

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.560
and make it interesting
and important.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.430
In this picture, this is an
architecture firm that I found.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.860
They're called Nothing.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.470
And their entire premise
is based off the idea

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.226
that you can take something
very simple, a plot of land,

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:55.600
something that
has nothing there,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.470
and make something absolutely
beautiful out of it.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.990
Their office, the
interior of their office,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.420
is built entirely
out of cardboard,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.450
and it's pretty elaborate.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.770
So despite all this creativity
that we have at an early age,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.640
something happens.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.160
Kids are fearless and
will show their art.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.880
But as we get older, we're
less secure with our confidence

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.350
and our own creativity.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.440
The door starts to
close, and many designers

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.452
keep their work locked away
until they think it's perfect,

00:03:28.452 --> 00:03:30.160
or until they have a
deadline and they're

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.800
forced to show it to their team.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.810
We start to fear judgment.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.350
We fear judgment from
our peers, and we

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.700
fear that we're going
to be embarrassed.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.760
How many times have you looked
over a designer's shoulder

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.930
to see their work in progress,
and their actual posture

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.320
starts to change?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.850
They start to recoil, and their
voice sounds apprehensive.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.020
And they give you
this doe-eyed look

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.850
that they just fear
that you're going

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.320
to say it's going to suck.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.310
That is their worst nightmare.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.360
So why is this?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.150
Part of our DNA, the fact
that we are designers,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.250
we have built into our
DNA the essence of taste.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.460
Being a great designer
is to have good taste

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.730
and to know what good
taste looks like.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.140
This means we love beauty,
and invention, and things

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.560
that surprise us.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.460
We fall in love
with great design.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.700
But we also want to
produce that great design

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.500
and have an effect
on other people.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.660
But as we face this
big blank page,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.680
whether that's your
sketch book or Photoshop

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.150
or whatever tool you use,
and start to design away,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.840
our craft doesn't
always meet our taste.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.630
And it's especially
in the beginning

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.880
of a designer's career
this is very true.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.550
So sometimes our
fear of judgment

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.480
is actually knowing for a fact
that the design we've created

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.510
is not nearly as good
as we want it to be,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.070
and we're about to
be called out on it.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.440
So let's layer on top of
that those moments when

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.620
you work on a project
that's truly innovative.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.080
I've been working on the
self-driving car, which

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.890
is pretty innovative, so I've
been living and breathing

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.410
this uncharted territory
for quite a while.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.160
Now you're this designer
that wants to create,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.470
and you're swimming
in this abyss.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.040
You're in this space
of uncertainty.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.240
You want to grab at all
the tangible aspects

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.880
and make something out of it.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.360
And you don't have
all the answers yet.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.570
So in the back of
your head, you know

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.770
that you want to make
something great as a designer.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.150
You're working with
a project that you

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.608
don't have all the
definitions for.

00:05:31.608 --> 00:05:34.260
And you want to make it awesome.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.480
So what does this mean?

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.300
For those that can
relate, definitely

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.003
the entrepreneurs and
inventors in this room,

00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:46.206
you know that being in this
spot can be a very lonely place.

00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:47.830
It's especially
interesting when you're

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.300
surrounded by nondesigners,
and they're all looking at you

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.550
to come up with a solution
because you're the creative.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.340
For your coworkers that haven't
been on a project like this

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.680
before, they make the
project look like this.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.300
And they may think
it looks like this,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.280
where it has a
beginning and an end.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.390
The reality?

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.860
Experience is a lot like this.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.090
For those who are confused,
this is Tough Mudder.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.280
This race is full of
obstacles, and scary hazards,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.010
and barbed wire,
and contraptions

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.940
that will electrocute you.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.910
It's pretty crazy,
and people pay for it.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.550
It's messy, and it's
ugly, and you're not

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.270
sure you're going to finish.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.670
So what's interesting is that
it's less about the individual,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.540
and it's more about
the team effort.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.150
Everyone has to help
everyone to finish.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.440
I can say for a fact that I've
been on three projects that

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.650
have definitely felt like this.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.400
And I'm going to walk you
through two of them today.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.910
Several years ago, when I
was working in New York City,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.800
I was working with an
agency called Razorfish.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.540
You might have heard of it.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.970
And this is a project
that was really

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.140
based on business innovation.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.380
So a small team
of us were tasked

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.430
with creating a really
interesting dashboard

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.420
for the United Nations.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.340
This project was
focused specifically

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.780
on economic
development in Africa.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.680
For 12 years,
representatives from the UN

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.640
went door to door
to small businesses

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.300
throughout the continent
and interviewed the owners.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.960
They would ask questions
like, was tax rate reasonable?

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.970
Did you have to use a
bribe to get business done?

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.930
Were you able to find
educated workers?

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.415
Did you have reliable
access to electricity

00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:37.900
and water-- some pretty
basic things to do business.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.260
So hundreds and hundreds of
questions-- again, 12 years.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.039
They had this massive database,
this huge spreadsheet.

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:47.830
And all the answers
were collected verbally

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.300
and then compiled into this
database, mostly a huge Excel

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.170
spreadsheet.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.400
And this was a lot of work.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.100
I mean, 12 years
is a lot of work.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.420
So why did they do this?

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.730
They had a vision.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.060
And they thought if they
can collect this data,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.460
they can reveal to
foreign investors

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.220
which countries were
doing fair business

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.380
and which countries were
actually very corrupt.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.120
This was a very important time.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.090
Many large companies
were looking at Africa

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.340
as the next big emerging market.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.980
The cost of business
in India and China,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.050
it was already rising.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.280
So Africa was seen as the next
step for companies seeking

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.690
alternative low-cost solutions.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.280
This dashboard that we
created, this was a prototype.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.800
This was just a rough design.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.900
It really represented
the parsing of the data

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.490
and allowed for quick
custom filtering,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.799
display visualization,
and revealed

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.590
the countries that were
doing fair business

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.140
and the countries that
had corrupt practices

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.320
in a real and tangible way.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.540
They could actually see it.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.700
So three months later, to my
surprise, I am now in Ethiopia.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.180
And I have to present this.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.365
Never been to the continent of
Africa, definitely never been

00:08:58.365 --> 00:09:01.670
to Ethiopia-- very cool
place, very vibrant,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.590
full of color and life.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.010
And I found myself
presenting these designs

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.710
to diplomats, and ministers,
and African leaders seated

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.920
in a very traditional UN setup.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.100
If you've ever seen
pictures of it or on TV,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.260
it feels very official.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.900
Each person sits at their desk.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.910
They have their placard.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.150
They have their translator
with a microphone.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.300
They have titles like
Kenyan Minister of Mines,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.790
which I did not know existed.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.500
And all of these diplomats
were there to listen to us

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.510
and to see our solution.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.950
To be honest, I was
absolutely terrified.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.390
There was not a single
designer in that room.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.620
And they were all
definitely official looking.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.190
But what helped us
more than anything

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.720
was believing that the actual
solution that we'd created

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.340
solved the problem.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.810
But what was also scary
was that the solution

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.120
was incredibly polarizing.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.150
So we gave this
presentation, and we

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.140
get two types of feedback.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.940
Naturally, those
representatives from

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.420
business-friendly
countries were psyched.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.600
We're now finally rewarding
them for doing good business.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.270
But those other
countries, those countries

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.490
that maybe had not
so favorable scores,

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.080
they were pretty
pissed off at us.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.650
And that was a
difficult situation

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.600
to be in when you're
trying to present that.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.970
So the takeaway from
that is that when

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.200
you're working on something
that can fundamentally

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.790
change how we
think of a problem,

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.250
it's very likely that you're
going to make a lot of friends.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.835
But you can also
make some enemies,

00:10:39.835 --> 00:10:41.780
and you'll have some naysayers.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.620
I think Airbnb and Uber probably
experienced some of this.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.900
They kind of know what
we're talking about.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.850
And the self-driving car, we
deal with some of this as well.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.320
The design may not have
been revolutionary.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.530
Data dashboards are not special.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.190
But the use of that
design had a huge impact.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.050
In this case, we
were potentially

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.610
affecting the business landscape
of an entire continent, which

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.200
is a huge thing.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.180
Now let's talk about
the self-driving car.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.800
This is the next
project that I'd

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.260
say I was in kind of a
Tough Mudder situation.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.910
On this project, I'm
reminded every single day

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.080
that we're solving a
computer science problem.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.270
Now mind you, when I
came onto the project,

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.500
I had no automotive
background whatsoever.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.097
I am a user experience designer.

00:11:27.097 --> 00:11:29.430
I try to actually get to the
heart of what people really

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.780
want.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.890
So as a designer,
I'm reminded why

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.940
we're doing this
in the first place.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.160
I'm motivated by how
the project can actually

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.570
change lives, and communities,
and landscapes in a real way.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.470
I'm motivated by the idea
that we are all bad drivers

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.250
if we want to admit it or not.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.400
We text.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.640
We read emails.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.000
I've seen people put
makeup on while driving.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.690
I saw a guy eating a bowl
of soup while driving.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.210
This is actually truly
dangerous, life-threatening

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.770
behavior that we are conducting.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.420
And we just do it because
it's always that chance

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.300
that it's not me.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.410
I'm not the one that's
going to cause the problem.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.450
So diving a bit deeper
into the project,

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.800
we can talk about the lasers,
and the radars, and the map

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800
tiles, and the latency.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.300
But what my team, the
UX team, is really doing

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.000
is creating experience
that does not yet exist.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.430
What's really interesting
is that we've actually

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.140
been talking about self-driving
cars since the '50s.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.230
This illustration was
created in the '50s.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.760
So it's not really
a new concept.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.980
But what is happening
now is that we're now

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.610
creating the first
experience for it.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.560
It's not just blue-sky reality.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.880
It's now an actual experience.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.190
So we have a lot of questions.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.670
First off, where do we start?

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.470
If there's no analogous
offering out there,

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.660
how do you start
creating experience?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.500
And then the next big question
is, what is the new driving?

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.597
If you're not driving,
what is driving then?

00:13:02.597 --> 00:13:03.930
We're going to show you a video.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.013
And this was produced by
the self-driving car team

00:13:06.013 --> 00:13:09.290
to show you what the experience
of the prototype feels like

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.664
and how people reacted to it.

00:13:12.664 --> 00:13:14.568
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:19.328 --> 00:13:21.720
MALE SPEAKER: Today we have
something extra special

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.390
for you guys.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.340
And you guys will be
some of the first people

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.631
outside of our team and outside
of Google to ever ride in it.

00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:34.370
JANET: Ah, there it is.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.870
ALL: Wow!

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.910
LINDA: Isn't that cute?

00:13:43.712 --> 00:13:45.253
MALE SPEAKER: Go
ahead and buckle up.

00:13:45.253 --> 00:13:46.732
JUDY: OK, Annie, here we go.

00:13:46.732 --> 00:13:47.718
ANNIE: Here we go.

00:13:47.718 --> 00:13:50.200
THIDA: All right,
Connie, let's go.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.090
LINDA: There's no
steering wheel in the way.

00:13:56.341 --> 00:13:58.090
CHRIS URMSON: It was
a big decision for us

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.420
to go and start building
our purpose-built vehicles

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.030
for this.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.470
And really, they're
prototype vehicles.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.950
They were a chance for us to
explore, what does it really

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.180
mean to have a
self-driving vehicle?

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.740
But in the small amount of
time we've been working on it,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.280
we have functional prototypes.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.416
It's exciting.

00:14:15.416 --> 00:14:16.920
THIDA: It's really cool.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.730
It was really kind of
a space-age experience.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.476
JUDY: Oh, OK!

00:14:21.476 --> 00:14:22.934
Hurray!

00:14:22.934 --> 00:14:25.850
We're like queens.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.730
ANNIE: You sit, relax.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.420
You don't have to do nothing.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.260
It knows when you need to stop.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.650
It knows when you need to go.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.440
JUDY: It actually rides
better than my own car.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.170
ANNIE: Yes.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:37.910
It's true.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.430
WALT: What she really liked
was that it slowed down

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.199
before it went around a
curve and then accelerated--

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.490
WALT AND LINDA: --in the curve.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.202
WALT: She's always trying
to get me to do it that way.

00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:49.660
LINDA: That's the way I learned
in high school driver's ed.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.330
JANET: So if I had
a self-driving car,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.790
I could spend more time
hanging out with my kids,

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.540
or helping them
with their homework,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.316
even just tending
to them, finding out

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.690
how their day was,
and not having

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.023
to wait until you get home
and have dinner and all that.

00:15:04.023 --> 00:15:04.910
So it would be good.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.000
NICK: Human feeling of it
is very well engineered.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.390
And it is very smooth.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.130
There's nothing that makes you
feel the least bit threatened.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.250
It's impressive.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.132
I'm totally in love with this
whole concept. [LAUGHTER]

00:15:17.132 --> 00:15:20.710
STEVE: Our lives are made up of
lots and lots of little things.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.760
And a lot of those little
things for most people

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.690
have to do with getting
from place to place,

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.420
in order to connect and
do things, be with people,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.940
go places that they need
to go, and do things.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.160
And so there's a big part
of my life that's missing.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.340
And there is a big
part of my life

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.650
that a self-driving vehicle
would bring back to me.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.400
CHRIS URMSON: This is
a first step for us.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.940
And it's really exciting to
see the progress we've made.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.410
The opportunity for people
to just move around and not

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.000
worry about it-- it's going
to be incredibly empowering

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.325
and incredibly
powerful for people.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.795
STEVE: I love this!

00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:54.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:55.780
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:03.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.140
JENNY ARDEN: Great,
so you kind of

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.640
get to see a little bit
of what it feels like.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.350
A lot of people, when they
first think about self-driving,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.210
they're worried about
giving up control.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.260
And they're thinking that
it's going to be really scary.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.872
But it ends up actually being
pretty boring after 30 seconds.

00:16:19.872 --> 00:16:23.410
You're just kind of sitting
back, and you let it go.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.217
So you've all seen our Lexus
vehicles driving around.

00:16:26.217 --> 00:16:28.050
And we've learned a lot
from those vehicles.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.160
And we're still
learning from them.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.035
They're still driving
around, and we're still

00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:32.150
improving our software.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.830
At some point, Chris Urmson,
who you saw in that video,

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.600
decided it was time to really
create our own vehicle that's

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.190
entirely focused
on self-driving.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.500
The industrial design
team did an amazing job

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.850
creating a car that's truly
optimized for the sensors

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.290
and cameras.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.850
That's why we did this.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.990
So it may look
cute and friendly.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.730
But it's also
designed with purpose.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.660
Every choice there
had a purpose.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.980
You saw in the video that
there's no steering wheel.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.980
There are no peddles.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.250
There's no control.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.410
And that changes the entire
experience in a vehicle.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.040
So what you're seeing here,
now getting into the software,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.871
this is the
engineering interface

00:17:15.871 --> 00:17:18.079
that we have that displays
what the vehicle's seeing.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.319
And it's definitely an
engineering interface.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.819
When you're in the
prototype vehicle

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.652
and you're looking at
this at the same time,

00:17:24.652 --> 00:17:25.740
it's pretty fascinating.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.700
And this display's
changing real time.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.640
And in this particular
design, you are the red car.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.420
So that's the actual vehicle.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.810
You have other cars around you.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.010
Those are the purple boxes.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.170
And this is a pretty
interesting situation,

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.367
because a group of pedestrians
is crossing the crosswalk,

00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:45.700
and you're trying to turn right.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.250
So you see the trajectory of
a green line to the right.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.210
And the yellow boxes
there are pedestrians.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.680
So we're really
tracking everything

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.490
that we see, all the
different objects.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.740
We can categorize what
kind of object it is.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.250
Is it a car?

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.030
Is it a bike?

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.660
Is it a pedestrian?

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.180
And we can predict a little bit
of what they're going to do.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.110
So we kind of know
where pedestrians walk.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.620
We kind of know where cars go.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.240
But we also are constantly
collecting more data

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.940
in case something
happens and we need

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.390
to make an emergency maneuver.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.670
We believe that this
interface is pretty important

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.740
as far as user experience goes.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.370
And it helps the
user learn to be

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.910
comfortable with
giving up control.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.250
As we work on a more
consumer-facing version

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.380
of this, we're asking
ourselves a lot of questions.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.380
So how much do we show?

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.450
This is showing
everything that we know.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.460
It's pretty detailed,
which may not be necessary.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.430
Maybe people don't
need to see all this.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.810
So do we show
everything or we don't?

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.200
Should we do an
edited-down version?

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.167
Should it be super realistic, or
should it be super abstracted?

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:48.750
That's another thing
that we're trying

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.014
to figure out as
a design problem.

00:18:51.014 --> 00:18:52.430
And then what about
camera angles?

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.250
We can actually do almost any
camera angle in this display.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.850
So here we're kind of
bird's eye from the back.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.400
But we could do true birds eye.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.390
We can pan right.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.170
We can pan left.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.300
We could do first person, as
if you're just looking out

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.220
through the window as
if you're a driver.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.070
So we have a lot of variables
here, and a lot of things

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.440
that we have to test over
and over and over again.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.520
So lots of questions--
absolutely no

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.480
precedents for this.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.050
We're trying our best guesses.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.040
This is our process.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.350
We try our best guesses.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.830
We prototype every day.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.760
We're prototyping
and prototyping.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.020
And we're refining
over and over again.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.100
Frankly, it's a
really long process

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.360
with lots of uncertainty.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.880
And as we chip away at it,
we get closer and closer

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.260
to something that we believe in.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.190
So the software engineers
and the digital designers

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.610
on this project, as opposed
to the industrial designers,

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.650
we have a unique challenge.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.360
So for one, the prototype
is almost entirely

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.900
controlled through a phone app.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.730
It's literally the
keys to your car.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.720
So there are not a lot
of phone apps out there

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.980
that have that level
of mission-critical

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.360
responsibility.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.310
The only experience I can think
of that comes close to this

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.380
is when you use an
electronic boarding pass

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.560
when you go to the airport.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.870
If your phone dies, you're
not getting on that plane.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.170
But you do have another option.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.890
You can hassle the gate agent
to print you another one.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:12.834
You wait in that line.

00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:14.000
They're usually pretty busy.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.160
So it's kind of a hassle,
but it's not a huge deal.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.020
So it's not quite an
analogy, but it's close.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.080
We're also working
hard at creating trust.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.210
I think a lot of
new technologies

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.040
have this challenge.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.610
But seeing that this
is a moving vehicle,

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.810
it's even more important
to let the user know

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.730
what the car knows.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.430
So that was the
self-driving car.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.710
If you have questions,
definitely I

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.720
can answer some of them.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.511
A lot of the things
related to the program,

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:48.850
I can't really answer
those questions, especially

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.000
our detailed process.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.185
People always try to ask me.

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:52.060
I can't answer those.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.550
But after this, please,
if you have questions

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.900
about what I've said
today, afterwards we're

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.350
going to have a
little Q&amp;A session.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.440
So what I wanted to
sort of bring together

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.460
is my thoughts about
emotions and when

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.280
you're working on
these projects.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.320
So for those that live
and breathe 10X concepts,

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.670
meaning ideas that improve
problems by 10 times,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.610
I truly believe
that your emotions

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.310
can be your North Star.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:25.920
So anxiety, for example--
it's not always a bad thing.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.770
Medically, it increases
your blood flow.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.200
It releases hormones
like adrenaline.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.820
It allows your mind
to work on overdrive.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.080
For those procrastinators
in the room--

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.240
I am one of them-- your
work can feel better

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.510
when you wait till
the last minute.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.710
Sometimes that pressure to
produce just makes better work.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.850
But for a lot of
people, anxiety is

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.600
felt because you
don't have a plan.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.900
So I think it's
important to note

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.990
that you can't plan innovation.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.770
You can have these
big ideas, and you

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.200
have an idea where
it's going to,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.920
but there really is no concrete
roadmap for innovation.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.906
I once heard the
creator of Radiolab,

00:22:06.906 --> 00:22:08.280
which is by far
my favorite radio

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.690
show-- I absolutely
love that show.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.260
And he's won great
awards for basically

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.670
changing the format of radio.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.900
He said, "I don't think
change can be planned.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.400
I think it's only
something that can

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.805
be recognized after the fact."

00:22:20.805 --> 00:22:22.180
And I absolutely
agree with this.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.099
And the two projects I
shared with you today,

00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:26.390
I think it's absolutely--
we're obviously still working

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.470
on the self-driving car.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.210
But we're definitely
feeling this.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.080
So you can have a plan,
especially for the next couple

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.920
weeks, but expect that
it will change a lot.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.170
Because there's a lot
you just don't know.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.940
The real challenge is
to be OK with that,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.830
and to recognize that
your anxiety is usually

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.780
a sign that you're either
going to figure something out,

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.570
you're about to get there, or
the plan is about to change.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.360
It's one of the two.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.490
So for those moments that you
experience fear with your work,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.810
know that fear is usually
a sign that you're

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.240
working on something brand new.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.990
And that's a pretty lucky
place to be as a designer.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:12.300
This is a rare, rare
occasion, so be grateful.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.750
But you may be a new
designer learning your craft.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.877
That is also a scary place.

00:23:17.877 --> 00:23:19.710
And you're trying things
for the first time.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.940
Or you may be
working on something

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.023
like the self-driving car.

00:23:22.023 --> 00:23:23.840
It kind of feels the same.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.130
Either way, you're
diving into the unknown.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.250
And you will learn from it.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.820
If you're feeling
comfortable, chances

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.760
are you either found a
bit of clarity and maybe

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.270
a few answers, or maybe you've
relied on something safe

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.670
and maybe already done.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.190
That's not necessarily
a bad thing.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.140
But please make sure
that you're doing it

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.980
because it's a
better experience,

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.100
not because it's easier.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.610
And this is my last
major point here.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.850
If you are experiencing
a moment of joy,

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.720
those moments where
you're like, I freaking

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.124
did that-- and we've all kind
of had either little moments

00:23:58.124 --> 00:24:00.040
of that, or big ones
where there was a launch,

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.540
or you just showed
up for a meeting,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.050
and you were really actually
proud of that design--

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.840
take the time to celebrate.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.880
More often, I see so
many designers run out

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.319
of drive and creativity
because they're pushing

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:13.360
and they're fighting to
get to those moments that

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.620
reveal answers.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.430
And they just start to burn out.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.480
And I really think
small celebrations

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.800
throughout your process will
save you from burning out,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.990
especially when you're
working on a very

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.310
long-term innovative project
like the self-driving car.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.520
So feel love for design.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.140
That will keep you going.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.160
Be grateful that you have
the power and privilege

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.170
to make something meaningful.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.680
And that's it for me.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.730
Any questions?

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.870
I'd love to answer
any questions I can.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.520
Thank you.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.420
DIEGO: Hi, I'm Diego, and I'm
a designer and researcher.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.265
I was wondering if
you could tell us--

00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:03.040
and I don't know if you can--
how do you quickly validate

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.860
some of the assumptions
that you're working on?

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.150
It seems like there's a pretty
significant prototype you're

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.770
playing with, with the car and
the interface working together.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.930
JENNY ARDEN: Yeah, so I'd
say that our project is

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.680
divided into two components.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.390
So there's industrial design.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.870
And luckily, with
building a car,

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.430
there is some
precedence to that.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.690
And there's some
people actually here

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.689
that know about that
process way more than I do,

00:25:27.689 --> 00:25:29.300
because I didn't
come from automotive.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.383
So they're kind of roughly
following this process.

00:25:31.383 --> 00:25:34.720
But like I was
kind of explaining,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.450
they course-correct a lot.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.830
And they are all willing to kind
of deal with change and deal

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.120
with limitations that
they're faced with.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.644
So it's almost more of an
attitude than a process.

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:47.060
They have a process,
but they also

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.160
have the attitude
to accept change.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.274
On the digital side, we
have two major components

00:25:53.274 --> 00:25:54.190
that we're working on.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.060
It's the phone app,
the control of the car.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.750
And we have this kind of
crazy screen in the prototype.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.330
It's long and
skinny, and it sits

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.740
about four feet from the eye.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.950
That's the one that is
more difficult for us.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.550
We can design a phone app pretty
easily to control the car.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.080
But that UI and the
engineering interface

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.700
that I shared with you,
it's pretty gnarly.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.710
So basically what we do is
we just try everything out.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.320
Everything is a hypothesis.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.600
And we get into the prototype.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.640
If you don't experience
it firsthand,

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.420
if it's just at your
computer, you're

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.560
never going to
get a real answer.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.300
So we really believe in
taking it out in the field

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.910
and experiencing it firsthand
and getting a gut check

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:37.500
with it.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.860
And then obviously, the
next step after that

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.990
is testing with real users.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.490
So we've identified
user groups that we

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.330
want to really get
their feedback from.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.413
We put it in front of them
and get their insights.

00:26:48.413 --> 00:26:50.640
And we just keep going
and going and going.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.300
This is not sort of
a waterfall effect.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.730
My researchers are next
to me every single day

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.600
testing things.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.390
AUDIENCE: I'm curious.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.230
You're a user experience
designer, correct?

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:09.250
I'd love to know more about the
experience you're aiming for.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.503
Because it seems so broad,
and everyone in the video

00:27:11.503 --> 00:27:13.862
is either-- not disabled.

00:27:13.862 --> 00:27:14.570
Everyone's happy.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.069
And everybody's
having a great time.

00:27:16.069 --> 00:27:18.240
And I'm curious.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.730
Are you striving for
collaboration and communication

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.040
between passengers?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.540
I just am a little more
curious about the specifics

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.124
of that goal.

00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:30.290
JENNY ARDEN: Yep, so I
agree, everyone in that video

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.040
did look very happy,
unnaturally so.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.540
But they actually
were really happy.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.160
It was a good day for us.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.590
The experience, I'd say we have
different feelings about it

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.860
depending on when you're
thinking about the project

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.860
and how far along it is.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:49.870
So when we release it
to the world, which

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.960
will happen one day, we're
just trying to get trust.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.140
We just want people to feel
safe and really trust it.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.310
And we will not launch anything
that isn't absolutely safe.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:05.720
We have very, very high bars
for all of our safety metrics.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.670
So safety, trust-- number one.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.310
Friendly-- no scary robots.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.450
That's really important to
us as a user experience team.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.500
Further out, though,
the feeling that we have

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.600
is that we can actually change
some really interesting aspects

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.120
about society.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.240
Think about it-- you get
your driver's license

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.130
as a rite of passage
when you're 16-ish.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.840
What if that doesn't
exist anymore?

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.030
That's kind of crazy.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.110
There's a fly over here.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.480
That's kind of crazy.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:41.120
So what is the new rite
of passage for driving?

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.640
There are lots of things
culturally in our DNA

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.410
about driving,
especially in California.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.660
We care so much about driving.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.490
How is this project
going to change that?

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.729
And those are the things that
we're thinking about a lot.

00:28:54.729 --> 00:28:55.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:59.690
Have you done any explorations
of more nontraditional spaces

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.950
within the car,
thinking about it

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.900
not just as a place for seats,
but as a place for a desk,

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.940
as a place for an
exercise bike, as a place

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.560
to accomplish other goals while
you are being transported?

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560
JENNY ARDEN: Absolutely.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.410
So one of the questions I posed
was, what is the new driving?

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.700
If you're not driving,
you're doing something else.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.700
So if you're doing something
else, what is that,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.760
and how can the space
enable that other activity?

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.660
So could we enable working?

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.980
Could we enable conversations?

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.030
Maybe enable productivity,
or just relaxation-- you just

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:37.420
want to unplug and
sit back and relax.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.410
As a user experience
team, these are definitely

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.959
the things we're thinking
about, and thinking

00:29:41.959 --> 00:29:43.500
about how the interior
of the vehicle

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.190
itself can be
configured or changed.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.310
Or we can design
something to really cater

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.614
toward one of those experiences.

00:29:50.614 --> 00:29:52.030
AUDIENCE: Now that
you're spending

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.300
so much time in
self-driving cars,

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.775
would you say that it's
made driving in your car

00:29:56.775 --> 00:29:59.599
or driving around
more or less fun?

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:01.140
JENNY ARDEN: So I
actually hate cars.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.431
I'm going to be totally honest.

00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:03.440
I'm a cyclist.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.976
I don't like cars.

00:30:04.976 --> 00:30:06.600
So it's funny that
I'm on this project.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.470
But it's actually great, because
I believe in a different thing.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.300
I believe that there's a
place for cars, especially

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.560
the joy riding when
you love vehicles

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.570
and you love the machinery
and the engineering.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.920
There are plenty of people
on my team who are like that.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.020
And I respect all
of their hobbies

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.870
and their passion for it.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:30.960
But for me, I'd say
that I am already

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.410
someone who was kind
of on the other side.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.680
In college, I was
in a major accident.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.460
And I had post-traumatic
stress from it,

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.280
so I couldn't actually get
into a car for about a year.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.210
I had to walk or ride my bike.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.340
That's why I became
a cyclist, because I

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.960
was so terrified
to get into a car.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.570
So I already, in my
depths of my being,

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.860
really feel that this
is a necessary thing.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.100
OK, thank you, guys.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.850
[APPLAUSE]
