00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.090
We’ve all heard love is like a drug.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:09.360
So does that mean heartbreak is like withdrawal?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.020
Hello lovers, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.929
If you’ve ever fallen in love, this also
means you’ve probably experienced heartache.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.230
Breakups are so painful that they can lead
to feelings of loneliness, anger, and even

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.529
clinical depression.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.330
And they affect more than just your feelings.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.890
We’ve already done an episode on how heartbreak
literally hurts your heart.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.429
And you probably also know that emotional
pain, especially with rejection, can activate

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.540
the same neurological regions as physical
pain.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.540
Yep.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.239
To your brain, getting accidentally hit by
a rogue baseball on your shoulder is the same

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.920
as hearing, “It’s not you.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.920
It’s me.”

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.260
So what is really happening in your brain
when you’re experiencing heartbreak?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.500
To really get a full grasp of this, we have
to first look at what’s happening in the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.830
brain when we ARE in love.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.740
It’s not just one thing going on.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.969
Turns out, there are many processes involved
that together comprise a system of motivation,

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.230
reward, and addiction.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.750
But, the two major chemicals involved are
the neurotransmitters dopamine and oxytocin.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.750
In one study published in the Journal of Neurophysiology,
researchers looked at the brains of 17 people

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.290
experiencing intense romantic love at its
early stages.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.450
They showed them either photographs of their
beloved or a neutral acquaintance.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.770
And using fMRI technology, the researchers
found that when looking at their loved one,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.280
there was greater activation in areas that
are dopamine rich - like the right ventral

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.350
tegmental area and the medial caudate nucleus.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.940
Interestingly, other studies have shown that
the ventral tegmental area also activates

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.400
when humans are under the effects of cocaine.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.250
So, it’s not really just a metaphor when
songwriters call love a drug and their lovers

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.440
an addiction.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.340
Our brains literally get hooked on love.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.780
So when we go through a breakup, it can look
a lot like withdrawal.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.870
Even though we know it’s bad for us to go
stalk our exes’ photos on social media we

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.810
end up doing it anyway, because our brains
are seeking the reward of all the feel-good

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.030
chemicals associated with our ex.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.710
What’s more, studies have shown that when
deeply in love we include our partners in

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.069
our concept of ourselves; One study published
in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.140
Neuroscience found that in long-term loving
partnerships, several of the same brain areas

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.250
associated with maternal love and bonding
are activated - so when we lose our partners

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.980
it’s like we are losing a part of our identity
- we’re being torn apart.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.260
All of this helps explain the deep sense of
loss and emptiness after a breakup.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.220
In fact, a study published in the American
Journal of Psychiatry found that the brains

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.660
of people going through heartache looked a
lot like the brains of those who were grieving.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.700
In another study, researchers at Rutgers,
Einstein Medicine and Stony Brook, teamed

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.530
up and found that when they looked at photos
of their exes, the brains of the brokenhearted

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.170
had high activation in the ventral tegmental
area, ventral striatum, prefrontal cortex,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.850
and cingulate gyrus, which are areas related
to “gains and losses, craving and emotion

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.850
regulation”.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.140
What’s interesting is that there was some
overlap in the brains of those who were happily

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.440
in love and those who were dumped - particularly
in the ventral tegmental area.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.690
Basically, regardless of whether your crush
is making you miserable or blissful, your

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.440
brain still craves and seeks them - much like
a drug.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.630
So when you can’t have them, like because
they broke up with you, it feels awful.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.330
But the good news is that just like a drug,
you can drop it and recover from it.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.640
Which is good to know since, many scientists
argue that we are evolutionarily adapted to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.810
fall in and out of love multiple times throughout
our lives.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.940
If you’ve fallen in and out of love, why
not share with a website.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.030

story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.
