00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.830
&gt;&gt; I think one thing that
you've all spoken to is,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.210
this idea that some people see us
as like the magic of librarians.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.100
And they almost think that they
just know all of this information

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.390
as opposed to what you're saying.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.680
Is you're saying, you know how
to get to that information.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.940
And I guess what I'm wondering
is, how much of that getting

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.760 position:75%
to the information do you share with the patron?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.340
As opposed to just, I'm looking
for this, or here it is.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.300 position:67%
How much do you share the journey, I guess?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.020
&gt;&gt; I'm happy to show the journey.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.170 position:64%
I mean it's really great to give them the
tools and to show them, subject headings

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.900
or search techniques or something.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.940 position:63%
Because the smarter they are the better.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.040 position:59%
I mean the faster they'll get the
information; I assume you're the same?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I share all the time, which makes
my answers really, really long.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.520
[Laughter].

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.900 position:59%
Because I'll even tell them the things
I've looked at that I didn't find it.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.850
So they don't go and duplicate
that kind of search.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.680
And so, you know we're teachers
too in our own way.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.830
And so we want people to
learn tools that they can use

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.210 position:72%
in the future, not just for that one question.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.010
&gt;&gt; And my team actually staffs the
chat service here at the library.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.890
We're one of two areas that
some have a chat service.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 position:73%
We do it two hours a day Monday through Friday.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.600 position:69%
And one of the great things about chat is
that we then can interact live with patrons.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.920
So when they submit us a question,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.540
we can actually conduct a
reference interview with them.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.000
At the same time still looking
for the information.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.590 position:56%
And pretty much share with them the
search process that we're using live

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.550
to find the information for
which they are looking.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.440
And so we can kind of conduct
that kind of search.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.980 position:63%
And give them a real time, some real
time insight, into the search strategies

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.900 position:63%
that librarians use to find information.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.590 position:63%
And I think they find that very helpful.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.530 position:70%
&gt;&gt; You know; I think I picked up on a phrase?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.650
Maybe Tom's a little more
familiar with it than I am?

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.920
But this reference interview
could you talk to me a little bit?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.300
That might uncover what that
means for me, if you don't mind?

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of times when people
come in they, they either don't want

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.170 position:64%
to tell you exactly what it is or they're
not sure how to say what they want.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.180 position:64%
And so, I call it permission to be nosey.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.510 position:61%
Permission to just ask them questions
and find out more about what they want.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.360 position:75%
Because they often don't know how to explain it.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.210
And it, it just lets us in to
what they're trying to find out.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.400 position:63%
And I find that my biggest problems come
when I assume I know what they want.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.840
When I don't ask enough questions.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.310 position:58%
When I don't listen carefully enough.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.840
And I don't know if you would
add to that about the interview?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.730
But it's asking a lot of questions.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.080
&gt;&gt; Right. It's asking a lot of
questions, it's being receptive

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.410
and listening carefully to
what a person has to say.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.630 position:72%
And then based on that information, asking
the appropriate types of open ended questions.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.000
To kind of mind down and figure
out exactly what they want.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.720 position:64%
Because more often than not, the original
question that a patron comes to us with,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.070
is not the question that
they actually really have.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.050 position:69%
&gt;&gt; And, and sometimes part of that
interview isn't just getting at the subject,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.310 position:70%
but how much information do you need on this?

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.180 position:73%
Do you need a full biography or is a
biographical article on one of the dictionaries

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.110 position:56%
on reference going to be ok for you?

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.660
So, so also deadlines.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.700 position:69%
You need to know; how soon do you need this?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.420
That kind of thing.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.120
So, all those are pieces
of a reference interview.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.160
&gt;&gt; Right. One of the challenges I
found and maybe you have it too?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.920
Is that with, "ask a librarian",
it's often extremely difficult

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.360
to conduct a reference interview.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.140 position:56%
Because a person will use one of our
web forms to submit us a question.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.720
And there's no easy way for us
to quickly clarify what type

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.630 position:56%
of information they're really after.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.890 position:59%
Or how much information they're after.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.100 position:72%
So often times, we have to gage in a rather
lengthy correspondence, via "ask a librarian".

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.210
Or sometimes, I've actually
found, just picking up the phone

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.860
and calling them directly is the
easiest way to go in the situation.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.860
&gt;&gt; That's what I often do.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.700 position:58%
I pick up the phone and just say "I
just need to know a little bit more."

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.550 position:58%
Because I could type for a long time,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.670
but it's just so much easier
if I could just talk to them.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.970 position:63%
And, and they're often surprised that
the Library of Congress is calling them.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.460
But then [laughter] they realize
that it's, we're human beings too

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.230 position:56%
and we are just trying to help them.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.610 position:64%
So, it, I find those really fun actually.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.380
&gt;&gt; I've actually had replies when
you said "we're human beings too".

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.290 position:63%
Somebody wrote back and said that "Gosh,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.650 position:58%
I didn't realize a real person was
going to be answering this question."

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.300 position:66%
I think they thought that we were Google
behind the scenes and just going to do it.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.670

of the Library of Congress.
