00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.164
- [Voiceover] I have some
example problems here from

00:00:02.164 --> 00:00:05.647
our equivalent vectors
exercise on Khan Academy,

00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:08.062
so let's go through these
and like always, pause

00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:10.578
the video and see if you can
work through them on your own.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.328
So this first one says, "Are
vectors u and w equivalent?"

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:19.695
And so we can see vector u here in blue

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:22.249
and vector w right over here.

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.989
And we have to remember a
vector is defined by both

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.355
having a magnitude and a direction.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:30.956
And so for two vectors to be
equivalent they have to have

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:33.463
the same magnitude and the same direction.

00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:36.459
So when I look at these
two, they are clearly

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:38.525
pointing in different directions.

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:41.033
Vector u is pointing to the bottom right,

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.287
that's the direction it's pointing in,

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:45.561
and vector w is pointing
to the bottom left,

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:50.109
so they definitely aren't equivalent.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.592
So they are not equivalent,
scratch that out.

00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:58.307
So they have different
directions, different directions.

00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:01.506
Different directions.

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:03.310
And also think about the magnitude.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.492
If I just look at the
length of the arrows,

00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:07.954
just eyeballing it,
they look pretty close.

00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:10.299
Let me verify that.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.015
So if I'm starting at the
initial point for vector u,

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:15.430
how much do I move in the x direction?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.213
Well in the x direction
I go from negative eight

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:25.213
to negative three, so I
could say my change in x

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.800
is positive five, my x increases by five

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.632
as I go from the initial point,
from the x coordinate of the

00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:37.228
initial point to the x coordinate of the

00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:38.379
terminal point, so that length.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.698
The magnitude of just
the x component is five.

00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:44.950
And let's see what happens
in the y direction.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.362
So in the y direction, I start
at y equals negative two,

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:53.053
right over here, and then I go down

00:01:53.053 --> 00:01:58.053
to y equals negative eight.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.043
So my change in y, change in y,

00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:08.043
is equal to negative six, negative six.

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:11.750
Also think about this one over here.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.422
What's my change in x?

00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:15.930
What's my change in x?

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.786
Well I'm starting at x equals eight,

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:23.290
and I am going to x equals three.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.377
So my change in x is negative five.

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:31.719
I'm gonna write that,
change in x is equal to,

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.643
this is my change in x, change in x.

00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:37.686
And then what's my change in y?

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:40.565
Well I start at y is equal to eight

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:42.794
and I go down y is equal to two.

00:02:45.504 --> 00:02:46.738
Do it just like that.

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:51.683
So my change in y is
equal to negative six.

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:56.350
Now based on the changes in x's and y's,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.555
I can figure out the magnitude
of each of these vectors.

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:07.064
The magnitude of u, so I
could write it like this, the

00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:10.895
magnitude of u, sometimes you'll
see the notation like this,

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:15.895
the magnitude of u, of
vector u I should say,

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:18.371
is going to be equal to, we're just gonna

00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.695
use the pythagorean theorem here.

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.459
It's going to be the square root.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.224
The length of this hour is just a

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:26.103
hypotenuse of the right triangle.

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:27.659
So it's going to be the
square root of five squared

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.676
plus negative six squared so
it's gonna be the square root

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:36.676
of 25 plus 36, which is
equal to the square root of,

00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:39.408
what is that?

00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:42.983
It's going to be square root of 61.

00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:44.841
I can make that radical
a little bit smaller,

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.141
square root of 61.

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:48.672
Now what about vector w?

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:53.672
So the magnitude of vector w is,

00:03:54.613 --> 00:03:57.469
I could use a double, those double bars.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.860
The magnitude of vector
w, well that's going to be

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.784
the square root of negative
five squared, which is 25

00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:06.988
plus negative six squared,
which is going to be 36.

00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:10.355
Well that's going to be the
square root of 61 as well.

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:12.933
So they have the same magnitude,
just different directions.

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:14.767
So let's see, no they have the

00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:16.322
same magnitude, but different directions.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.180
Yup, that's the choice we like.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.833
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:23.586
Are vectors u and w equivalent?

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:27.858
Alright, so these look pretty
equivalent just eyeballing it.

00:04:27.858 --> 00:04:29.855
It looks like they're pointed
in the same direction,

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:32.549
they're going from the
bottom left to the top right.

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:34.383
And it looks like they're the same length,

00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:35.962
but we can verify them.

00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:39.538
Once again by looking at
their x and y components.

00:04:39.538 --> 00:04:42.928
So in the x direction, or
thinking about how much we change

00:04:42.928 --> 00:04:44.785
in x and change in y when we go from the

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.852
initial point to the terminal point.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:51.852
So in the x direction, for
vector u, we go from negative

00:04:52.122 --> 00:04:57.122
seven to negative four,
so we increased by three.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.086
And what do we do over here?

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:03.662
We go from x equals two to x equals five.

00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:08.167
So our x component once again
has a magnitude of three,

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:10.976
our change in x is a positive three.

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:14.157
And so our change in y,
what is that going to be?

00:05:14.157 --> 00:05:16.734
Well we're going, on this
vector, from y equals...

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:18.267
Whoops, I'm using the wrong...

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:23.267
We're going from y is equal
to one to y is equal to six.

00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:29.571
So the magnitude of the y
component, we could say, is five

00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:31.661
or our change in y is a positive five.

00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:36.026
And then the change in y over
here also is a positive five.

00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:38.696
We go from negative seven to negative two.

00:05:38.696 --> 00:05:40.554
It's also a positive five.

00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:42.225
So notice our change in x is

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:44.617
the same, it's a positive three.

00:05:44.617 --> 00:05:46.660
Our change in y is the
same, positive five.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.518
So that let's us know that we have

00:05:48.518 --> 00:05:51.420
the same magnitude and direction.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.420
And so these are equivalent,
these are equivalent vectors.

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.429
And, in fact, as we'll see in
the future, you can actually

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:03.703
denote a vector by its components.

00:06:03.703 --> 00:06:08.703
We could say that vector u,
vecotr u, is the vector five,

00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:13.278
oh sorry, the vector three comma five,

00:06:13.278 --> 00:06:18.278
our change in x comma our change in y.

00:06:19.307 --> 00:06:23.463
And that is exactly the same as vector w.

00:06:23.463 --> 00:06:28.463
So that is exactly the same as
vector w, has the same change

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.056
in x, same change of y as
you go from the initial

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:34.260
point to the tip of the
arrow, the terminal point.
