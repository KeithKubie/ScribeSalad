00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.710
Snow is great for skiing, making Calvin-style
snowpeople, and also for drinking or boiling

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.210
to make mac n' cheese and sausages.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:16.710
Where did you think that water came from?

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.810
The Sierra Nevada mountains in California
are beautiful snowcapped peaks at any time

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.900
of year.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.050
During the October to May rainy season, the
Sierras might see as much as 30 feet of snow,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.399
and they keep at least a little bit even during
the summer.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.980
But a new study published in Nature Climate
Change, found the Sierras have almost no snowpack

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.530
this year; less than the area has seen in
more than 500 years, actually.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.760
That… sounds bad…

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.120
Snowpack is what scientists call the total
amount of snow and ice on the ground.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.640
According to the National Resources Defence
Council (NRDC) the state's snowpack used to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.400
store 15 million acre-feet of water (1,850,000
hectare meters).

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.900
Put another way, the historical average snowpack
is 28.3 inches (71.8cm) but a survey in April

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.620
2015 found only 1.4 (3.6cm).

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.600
And it's not just bad for skiers and snowboarders,
most of the precipitation that falls in California

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.100
comes in the form of mountain snow and that
snow melts to become our drinking water.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.530
Water from the Sierra snowpack helps generate
electricity, and provides one-third of ALL

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.909
DRINKING WATER in California.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.420
In fact, 65 percent of all water comes from
rivers and streams.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.780
Because snow on mountains can build and build,
its a good measure of how much water will

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.569
be added to the region as the snow melts.

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.759
As it melts, the snowpack refreshes rivers,
lakes and reservoirs used for irrigation and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.759
public water supplies.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.149
So, when the snowpack is low, rivers, lakes
and reservoirs aren't replenished, and the

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.539
drought continues (or worsens).

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.310
This same process works around the country.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.539
If you turn on a faucet in Seattle, the Cedar
and Tolt rivers come out of your faucet, in

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.469
New York the Delaware River basin flows outta
there, the Mississippi River streams out in

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.639
Minnesota's Twin Cities and Atlanta gets the
Chattahoochee and Flint rivers.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:03.130
Here in California, we're getting snowmelt
from those distant mountains.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.200
Surface moisture is what keeps us alive and
cooking.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.939
It's the great circle... of life.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.200
So, the implications of a light snowpack are
massive, we know this is the worst by comparing

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.970
data, data, data.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.870
Scientists take cores of blue oak trees and
compare the rings to determine which seasons

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.450
were wet or dry.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.360
In wetter seasons, trees grow as much as they
can, but when it's dry, growth slows drastically.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.360
Researchers compared snowpack measurements
taken over the last few decades by satellites

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.520
and by scientists in the field, to ring data
from 1500 blue oak trees, and found a perfect

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.520
match!

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.530
Using these two datasets, they've found this
is the lightest snowpack in five centuries…

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.770
FIVE HUNDRED YEARS.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.770
Why?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.140
Well, we're in a record one-in-a-thousand-year
drought, but that drought has been exacerbated

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.850
by human effected climate change.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.810
Don't just take my word for it, bioclimatologist
A. Park Williams from Columbia University

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.810
told the New York Times, "even though the
chances of a drought like this were extremely

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.610
unlikely in the past, in the future it will
be more likely to occur" because of rising

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.850
temperatures contributing in the 8 to 27 percent
drop in soil moisture in California.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.760
No soil moisture, no tree growth.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.560
No snow pack, no water for people who live
in Cali.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.600
That's REAL hashtag calilife y'all.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.910
85 percent of United States residents get
their water from public utilities replenished

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.970
or fed by the water cycle.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.970
I grew up with well water, which is super
rare!

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.070
But when people can't get water from dried-up
rivers and streams to add to reservoirs or

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.460
irrigate their fields, they go for aquifers!

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.800
Earth's surface has pockets of water in it
that have trickled down over the eons, and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.270
we're sucking it out at a rate so fast, it
cannot be replenished, and the pumping causes

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.190
the surface to LITERALLY drop into the empty
space.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.940
Some groundwater is being pumped down "50
to 100 feet below previous historical lows,"

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.560
according to the California Department of
Water Resources.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.250
Water is a precious resource!

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.740
Even if you live in the lush East Coast, or
in countries where water is easy to come by;

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.420
conserving water is a good habit to get into
for now in case drought hits in the future.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.530
California built a whole farming industry
in a desert, after all, you never know what

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.770
the future will bring.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.230
Turn the water off when doing dishes, washing
faces or hands, and forgo baths for short

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.230
showers.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.220
This is good to follow even in places that
AREN'T currently affected by drought.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.330
Freshwater in the ground, lakes and rivers
only accounts for 1 percent of all the water

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.350
on our planet.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.350
Don't waste it.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.420
How do you conserve water?

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.370
Got any tips?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.480
I always read in the comments how you guys
love my cool nerdy t-shirts— I get them

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.990
