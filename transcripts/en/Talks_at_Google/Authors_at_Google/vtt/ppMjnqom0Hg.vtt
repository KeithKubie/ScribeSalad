[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:07.240
JOHN HOLL: This is really cool.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.560
I get to do a lot of really cool
things in my life and my job.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.050
This is one of those
things like where,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.760
since I use your products
daily, almost minute by minute

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730
in my life, being here--

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.420
one, I'm really nervous about
what you guys know about me.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.000
But two, this is
a real privilege.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.440
So thanks for having me.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.815
KEVIN NELSON: Our
pleasure, John.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.120
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.229
Let's go ahead
and dive right in.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.800
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.216
KEVIN NELSON: You
open up the book

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:37.110
talking about your history
of discovering beer.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.770
I believe your father
drank Heineken.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.130
JOHN HOLL: He did.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.720
He does.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.500
KEVIN NELSON: And what
did the other members

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.400
of your family drink?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.191
JOHN HOLL: They were
a lot of Bud drinkers.

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:44.790
a lot of Bud Light drinkers.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.010
I think just given
the time, and I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.870
think this is relatable
to a lot of folks

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.440
as well, our parents, our
grandparents, whatever,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.680
drank whatever was available
to them at the time

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.200
or whatever they perceived
their brand to be.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.100
So there were families that were
Schaefer families, or Bud Light

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
families, or Busch
families, or whatever.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.395
My dad, for whatever reason--

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:09.270
and I still haven't
talked to him about this,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.220
even though it's in the book--

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.870
he would get Heineken
in the house.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.340
And he just kind of liked it.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.110
He liked the weird
skunky taste, I guess.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.760
And when I would sneak tastes
when I was 12 or 13 or 14,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.370
whatever, you know--
yeah, about that--

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.215
this is terrible.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:26.490
Like, why would you
want to do this?

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.620
And I drink it today, I'm
like, this is terrible.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.820
Why would you want to do that?

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.700
But it's also-- it's
a really fine beer,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.130
and it's a well-made beer.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.230
So I think drinking-- so much
of what our experiences are,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.750
depending on your
age, comes from those

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.840
who we were watching.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.140
We were watching their habits.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140
I learned it from watching you.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.300
And we're at this
point, though, where,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.100
with so many breweries
in the country

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.830
that, my daughter, who's
20 months old right

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.680
now, by the time you know she
hits 18 in the UK and 21 here,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.669
she'll know a world that has
endless beer possibilities.

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:06.960
So I have no idea what'll be
in my fridge at that point

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.669
or what she'll gravitate
towards, but yeah,

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.039
so much of it is just timing.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.240
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.950
My grandfather drank Schlitz.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.510
He was my introduction to beer.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.090
And when I was young,
probably starting at age

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.280
seven or eight, when I
would go to his house.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.020
He had bought these
little eight-ounce,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.424
barrel-shaped beers.

00:02:23.424 --> 00:02:24.840
And he would give
me one of those.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.800
So I've been a beer lover
since, you know, walking time.

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:35.080
I also enjoyed
your story about--

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.150
I think you described it as
choking down your first IPA

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.850
at the local brew pub.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.980
What do you think about that
today when thinking back?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.870
JOHN HOLL: You know,
so it's twofold.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.000
And I don't want to
disparage too much.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.950
I still go back to
that brewery where

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.000
I drank my first IPA
on draft, as it were,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.860
on my 21st birthday.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.480
I walked into this
local brew pub,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.140
and I forced myself to
drink a beer because I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.490
wanted to drink better beer.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.130
I wanted to be accustomed
to something that was not

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.430
what everybody was drinking at
the frat parties or the college

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.270
parties.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.840
And the bartender
served me this IPA

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.330
and laughed at me as I was
like, ugh, this is terrible.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.040
You know, he sounded like
Cleo in the beginning.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.170
But the cool thing is that
the bartender actually

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.120
explained hops to me.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
And when we think about IPAs,
and it's the most popular craft

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.380
beer style right now, it's
bitter for the most part.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.400
It's hop forward, and hops are
part of the cannabis family.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.650
You can't do with hops
what you do with cannabis.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.660
Like, don't try.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.570
I don't know what the policy
is here, but just don't.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.690
Hops are good for making
beer and making beer only.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.490
But in those early
days, and even still,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.800
it's a bittering agent
in a lot of ways.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.770
And when you say
"bitter" to people, like,

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.334
oh, I don't want to try bitter.

00:03:52.334 --> 00:03:54.000
But this bartender
started talking to me

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.060
about pine and grapefruit
and citrus and some

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.070
of these other
flavors and aromas

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.990
that are derived from hops.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.540
And I think once you can
flip your brain to that

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.790
and start thinking about
it those ways as opposed

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.100
to just the bitter
sensation, but actually

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.194
what it is that we're
tasting and experiencing,

00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:11.860
it brings you around
in a whole new way.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.510
So I'm really grateful that I
ordered a second pint that day

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.790
and that it inadvertently set
me off to where I am right now.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.630
Which is, again, in this,
you know, cool room.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.050
KEVIN NELSON: I used to
travel quite a bit to England

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.910
in my 20s, so long time ago.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.270
And remember what a revelation
it was to go to a pub

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.890
there and have a cask ale,
a pulled English bitter.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.732
And these days,
the term "bitter"

00:04:36.732 --> 00:04:38.940
is kind of a misnomer compared
to what we drink today

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.260
with West Coast IPAs.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.210
But it was my
introduction to the--

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.710
I think you described it
as non-beer-tasting beer.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.690
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.829
And I think beer-flavored beer
is one of these things where--

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:51.870
and I talked about this
a little bit in the book.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.630
But we lost our food
traditions in a lot

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.270
of ways in the same time that
we lost our beer traditions.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.980
And so we used to know where
all of our food came from,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.060
and we used to know
where our beer came from.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.900
Before Prohibition, there was
something like 4,300 breweries

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.670
operating in the
country, which is crazy

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.380
when you think about it.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.930
And back in those times, if
you were drinking local beer

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.410
in wherever city you were in,
you knew where it came from.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.910
And you knew where your meat
came from, and your vegetables,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.560
and your bread, and your
cheese, even if you made it

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.700
at home kind of thing.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.280
And then we lost
our way with, like--

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.460
Velveeta became--
instead of real cheese

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.422
and fresh-baked bread,
it was Wonder Bread,

00:05:27.422 --> 00:05:29.630
and a plastic tray in the
microwave for five minutes,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.100
and we called it dinner.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.900
And before
Prohibition, the beers

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.900
were stouts and saisons and
ales of all different kinds,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.635
and spruce tip, whatever.

00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:39.260
And then, by the time
we got out of it,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.640
it was all beer-flavored
beer in the same way.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.759
And so we've sort of come back
a little bit in a great way

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.050
where you can eat local and
you can drink local in ways

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.370
like you haven't before.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.930
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah, interesting.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.390
Beer, of course, has
an ancient history.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.220
And there's even
some scholarship now

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.890
that suggests that beer is the
actual root of civilization

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.260
as opposed to bread,
which we normally hear.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.896
I can't think of anything
better than having

00:06:00.896 --> 00:06:01.420
people sitting in one spot--

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.420
JOHN HOLL: I like the
laughter that's happening.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.600
Like, people are like, yeah,
those are my ancestors.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.575
That's cool, yeah.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:08.450
KEVIN NELSON: And then,
of course, for years,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.967
drinking beer was safer
than drinking water.

00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:12.800
JOHN HOLL: Oh, yeah.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.104
KEVIN NELSON: So maybe give
a little history on that end

00:06:16.104 --> 00:06:18.770
and also the role beer played in
the founding the United States.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.310
JOHN HOLL: Yeah, so
there's a lot of evidence

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.240
to suggest that the nomadic
tribes early on would find

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.910
sweet grass that they would
then steep in warm water

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.530
and it would become beer.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.480
Or even not steep in warm water,
just, like, naturally ferment.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.880
They'd put grass in water,
and the sugars would naturally

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.550
ferment from the
yeast in the air,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.490
and that they would happily
get drunk off of it.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.570
And when they found places
that they were like,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.670
oh, we like this.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.760
Let's stay here,
because it's good to us,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.480
and the goddess Ninkasi,
who is the goddess of beer,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.810
is good to us in this place.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.580
And so a place--

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.134
people would stay there.

00:06:57.134 --> 00:06:58.550
But when you look
back, especially

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.440
to the United States,
this is a country

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.030
that was founded on beer.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.490
Captain Bradford's diaries
from the "Mayflower"

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.000
said, "Our victuals were running
low, especially our beer."

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.550
And so beer was potable
water on the ships.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.400
And the original plan was
to go down to Virginia.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.594
But they stopped off in
Massachusetts instead

00:07:16.594 --> 00:07:18.260
and got down to the
business of brewing,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.120
because the beer on board, this
3.2 near-beer Porter, whatever,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.880
that was their food,
their sustenance they

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.961
were almost out of.

00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:28.460
And then, from that
point on-- and I

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.501
talked about this in the
book a little bit more--

00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.780
of during the
Revolution, you know,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.610
the Founding Fathers
were drinking ales,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.440
were drinking ciders.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.630
We hear a lot about how
George Washington and Thomas

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.490
Jefferson were homebrewers.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.529
A lot of that's nonsense.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.320
They weren't like
sitting around the garage

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.230
with their sleeves rolled
up and fife music playing

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.570
in the background as they're
mashing in their homebrew

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.220
recipes.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.210
No, it was done by the
women of the household

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.820
or the slaves of the
house at the time.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.634
But they played a role in it.

00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:00.800
And then suddenly we became
a country of immigrants.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.426
And if you were a
barber or a baker

00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:05.300
or a tailor in the Old
World, you'd come over

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.572
and you'd apply that here.

00:08:06.572 --> 00:08:08.780
And we were really lucky to
have a lot of brewers who

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.520
came over as well and set up.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.630
And so yeah, we've had a really
long, complicated relationship

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.270
with beer in this country
for a really long time.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.000
And it continues to today.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.350
KEVIN NELSON: Very interesting.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.864
So beer is made traditionally
with four ingredients.

00:08:23.864 --> 00:08:24.530
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.200
KEVIN NELSON: Malted barley,
hops, water, and yeast.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.090
And yeast was only
discovered a little later.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.350
It kind of happened by
accident for a long time.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.450
JOHN HOLL: Right.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.310
We thought it was magic.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.900
We thought it was a
gift from the gods.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.858
KEVIN NELSON: People
would use the magic stick,

00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:35.611
and they would--

00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:37.610
stirring the juice, and
it would turn into beer.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.780
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.250
KEVIN NELSON: And the word
"malt" is kind of funny.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.083
The only other place
we hear the word "malt"

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:44.680
is with malted milk
balls or malted milk.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.650
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.140
KEVIN NELSON: What is malt,
and how did those ingredients

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.207
come together to make beer?

00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:51.290
JOHN HOLL: Well, malt is--

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.140
it's a grain.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.140
And so you can use all
different kinds of grain.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.310
You can use rye or
sorghum or rice or corn.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.400
And a lot of brewers do
in their beer as well.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.360
So it is basically a means
to get sugar into water.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.140
You boil the grain
to get it into water,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.230
and then the yeast is added--

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.660
the hops are added for
flavor and for bittering.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.350
And then yeast comes
into the play afterwards

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.270
and eats the sugars and creates
alcohol and carbonation,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.080
as it were.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.570
But I think, arguably, the
most important ingredient

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.910
to talk about is water.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.120
And without it, we
wouldn't have beer.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.620
Without it, we
wouldn't have life.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.560
Without it, we wouldn't have our
general existence, as it were.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.570
And it's fascinating to me that
homebrewers and beer drinkers,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.400
they love talking about
hops first and foremost.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.050
It's the flavors, the
aromas, the bitterness.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.772
It's a very sexy,
exciting ingredient.

00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:50.730
Water is just-- we sort
of take it for granted.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.344
We turn the tap,
and there it is.

00:09:52.344 --> 00:09:54.260
But when you think about
how much of the world

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.540
doesn't have access
to fresh water,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.240
or what you see happening
in Flint, Michigan,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.580
and in some other
cities as well,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.340
we as beer fans
and beer drinkers,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.110
and especially as the
brewers themselves,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.810
need to be thinking about where
their water is coming from

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.310
and how to protect the
resource to fight back

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.150
against people who are trying
to damage our water sources.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.660
And that, to me, I think is
the most important thing that

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.834
doesn't get talked about.

00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:24.500
But now that I just
bummed out the room,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.760
I think we should
probably have a beer.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.870
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah, so I agree.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.453
It's fun to talk about beer, but
it's a lot more fun to drink.

00:10:29.453 --> 00:10:31.280
So what are we going
to try here first?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.440
JOHN HOLL: So this
is Allagash Saison.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.790
I'm just going to do a--

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.330
KEVIN NELSON: Thank you.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.913
JOHN HOLL: --reach
over for you there.

00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:37.960
KEVIN NELSON: Perfect.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.310
And talk about
tasting beer, too.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.229
How should we approach this as
we taste our first beer today?

00:10:43.229 --> 00:10:45.020
JOHN HOLL: All right,
so right off the bat,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.330
and I'm not faulting you
guys, but this is actually

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.690
really kind of cool.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.200
So on this glass, you're
going to see carbonation

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.280
sticking to the inside.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.238
And Cleo's going to lose
her mind a little bit.

00:10:54.238 --> 00:10:57.710
But you see the carbonation
sticking to the inside walls

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.764
of the glass?

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:00.680
That's probably because
this is a fresh glass,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.560
and it hasn't been
fully rinsed out yet.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.440
But if you walk into
a place like a bar,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.695
and you see carbonation
sticking to the inside,

00:11:08.695 --> 00:11:10.070
that typically
means that there's

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.130
some dust behind or
some soap residue,

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.820
or something that makes
it a non-beer-clean glass.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.270
Again, we're all
fine here today.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.270
And I'm actually really
glad that that happened,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.027
because it's a pet peeve of
mine when I'm out at a bar,

00:11:23.027 --> 00:11:24.860
especially a place that
considers themselves

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.480
to be a beer bar.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.910
But in the same way that you'd
return a dirty fork if you

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.300
got it at a restaurant, it's
just one of those things

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.009
to be mindful of.

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:34.591
KEVIN NELSON: So I
want to assure you,

00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:36.890
first of all, that we
handwashed all the glasses

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.664
and rinsed them, because
we knew this could come up.

00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:42.830
JOHN HOLL: It's in the book.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.430
It's one of my
things in the book.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.450
All right, so a couple of
quick ways to taste beer.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.810
First, also, when you're
doing Instagram or Twitter

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.790
or whatever you guys
are doing these days.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.439
Google+--

00:11:53.439 --> 00:11:54.230
[AUDIENCE GROANING]

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.890
Labels out always.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.730
Sorry, sorry.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.900
That was mean.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.340
That was so mean of me.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.130
So always labels out first
so that people can see

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.930
what you're doing.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.940
Appearance is really important.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.210
Think about what the
color makes you think of.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.440
Is it the color
of autumn leaves?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.670
Is it black as night?

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.297
Is it the color of a
sunset or whatever?

00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:19.880
Think about what the
color of the beer

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.490
makes you think of in your mind.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.870
Next thing is aroma.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.766
And you kind of get it
going to about 45 rpm.

00:12:27.766 --> 00:12:29.390
Older folks in the
room are like, cool.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.490
The hipsters are like, yeah,
and everybody else is like, huh?

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.130
So you do that.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.740
And then most people will go
like this [INHALES DEEPLY]

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.560
to smell the beer.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.072
Don't do that.

00:12:39.072 --> 00:12:40.310
Like, don't.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.807
Not only are you going to
get the tip of your nose wet,

00:12:43.807 --> 00:12:46.140
and you don't want that, but
it's not going to help you.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.130
So the thing that I kind of
like to do is like a typewriter,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.347
or like a drive by, where
you just start to inhale,

00:12:52.347 --> 00:12:53.930
and you run the glass
under your nose.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.490
So you're getting
the ambient air,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.550
and then you're
getting the beer,

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.950
and then you're getting
the ambient air again.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.820
And starts to think
about flavors.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.970
And we can talk more about
that, I guess, but think

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.770
about the flavors that
are coming through,

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.450
the aromas that
are coming through.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.860
Does it smell spicy?

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.120
Does it smell like lemon?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.490
Does it smell like whatever?

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.100
Then the next thing
is obviously taste.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.830
And that's the fun
part, certainly.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.070
But so much of what we perceive
as taste comes from aroma.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.560
And so think about
what you just smelled.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.719
If it was a lemon or a
cake or whatever spice

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:28.510
that comes through.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.990
And now is it is it
much more acute now

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.220
that you've tasted the beer?

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.587
And it probably should be.

00:13:34.587 --> 00:13:36.670
And then the next thing
to take into consideration

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.129
is mouth feel.

00:13:38.129 --> 00:13:39.670
And so you take a
sip and you hold it

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.010
on your tongue for about
three seconds or so.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.600
And feel the carbonation.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.140
Is it like Scrubbing Bubbles,
or is it a little bit more flat?

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.510
Does the liquid feel thick?

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.384
Does it feel watery?

00:13:51.384 --> 00:13:53.800
A lot of people will say to
me, oh, I don't like Guinness.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.810
It's much too heavy.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.090
And they're just judging
the beer by its color.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.920
But if you ever take
a sip of Guinness,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.180
it's very watery on the tongue.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.349
There's almost no body
to that particular beer.

00:14:05.349 --> 00:14:06.890
But some of the IPAs
that we're going

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.437
to have in a minute that
are lighter in color

00:14:09.437 --> 00:14:11.020
are going to coat
your tongue and sort

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.942
of this oily, slick kind of way.

00:14:13.942 --> 00:14:15.400
And then the last
thing to consider

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.410
while you're tasting a beer
is really do you like it?

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.600
And if so, great,
have some more.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.864

foil for this entire talk now.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.450
That's cool, because there's
7,000 breweries in the country

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.820
right now, and they're all
making a multitude of styles.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.241
And you'll find
something that you like.

00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:41.470
Like this saison
from Allagash, which

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.680
has been making great beer
in Maine for 25 years now,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.380
and is one of the top
brewers in the world.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.510
And they do
Belgian-inspired beers,

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.010
and this is a
Belgian-inspired beer.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.890
And this is one of the
best examples in the US

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:54.960
that's being made today.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960
So that's why we got it.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960
KEVIN NELSON: Very nice.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.462
Tasty.

00:14:57.462 --> 00:14:58.420
Everyone like that one?

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.860
Who liked that one?

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.230
Who didn't like that
one, besides Cleo?

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.460
JOHN HOLL: All right,
but really quick,

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.760
what don't you care about it?

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.780
There's a guy in a
blue shirt back there.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.285
What didn't you care about it?

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.910
AUDIENCE: I just
don't like the flavor.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.270
I don't know how else to put it.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.500
I mean, I like the
mouth feel, but I

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.820
don't care for the flavor.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.460
KEVIN NELSON: So that
clove cinnamon flavor

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.624
isn't your thing?

00:15:19.624 --> 00:15:21.040
JOHN HOLL: And
that's cool, right?

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.330
I mean, and that's the thing.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.540
Like, this isn't an
attack by any means.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.610
So often in beer
geek culture today,

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:32.159
though, people will try to
convince you why you're wrong.

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:33.950
And I don't think that
that's a fair thing.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.410
And I think that
the smart brewers

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.510
know that diversity is king.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.050
And so you can walk into
Allagash, you can get stouts.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.257
They make their table beers.

00:15:42.257 --> 00:15:43.840
They make a whole
bunch of other stuff

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.200
as well, because they know
that not one style of beer

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.804
is going to appeal to everybody.

00:15:48.804 --> 00:15:51.220
And there's some brewers that
just make one style of beer,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.690
and I think they're
alienating themselves

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.990
a little bit you know too much.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.440
So like, yeah.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.590
I think if you give
every beer a fair shake,

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.173
and that's what I like to talk
about in the book a little bit.

00:16:02.173 --> 00:16:05.124
But give every beer a fair
shake, but also in the same way

00:16:05.124 --> 00:16:06.790
that if you don't
like Brussels sprouts,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.030
or you don't like goat cheese,
or you don't like anything

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.490
else that we experience
in life, nobody gives you

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.760
a hard time for that either.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.730
So the beer fans
that try to give you

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.250
a hard time for
not liking a beer,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.020
I don't think they're
doing it right.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.520
KEVIN NELSON: Go
with what you like.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.186
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:16:22.186 --> 00:16:24.180
KEVIN NELSON: Absolutely.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.345
So this is one style of beer.

00:16:27.345 --> 00:16:30.530
We have these four ingredients--
malt, hops, water, and yeast.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.599
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:33.890
KEVIN NELSON: How do you make
different styles of beer?

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.510
What goes into that?

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.750
JOHN HOLL: So, so much of it
is how much you use of each.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.180
And then, again, there's
different flavor components

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.650
to each of the main ingredients.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.902
And so I like to--

00:16:46.902 --> 00:16:48.485
I think I might have
talked about this

00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:49.580
the last time I was here.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.190
But if you look at the
four main ingredients,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.500
and you think about
them in food terms,

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.530
so water doesn't always
just tastes like water.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.370
It can have a salinity to it, or
a little bit of an iron content

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.570
to it.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.490
Or it can be hard
water or soft water.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.472
But if you travel around enough,
or you grew up in a place

00:17:08.472 --> 00:17:10.430
where you got your water
from a well versus now

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.109
you're getting it
from a city aquifer,

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.109
you notice the different
tastes in that.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:18.020
And malt, depending on how
it's kilned or roasted,

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.829
can have every flavor from
Cheerios to Grape Nuts

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.829
to chocolate and
coffee and toffee

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.599
to even, like, burnt acrid.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.600
You go to a good wood-fired
coal pizza place,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.860
and the pie comes out.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.560
And on the crust, you have that
little burnt bubble on the end.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.710
And everybody reaches for
it instinctively, right?

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.459
And we know what it's
going to taste like.

00:17:38.459 --> 00:17:39.380
It's carbon.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.450
It's burnt.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.442
But we do it anyway.

00:17:41.442 --> 00:17:43.400
And we taste it, and it's
bitter on our tongue.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.226
Malt can taste
like that as well.

00:17:45.226 --> 00:17:47.600
There's people-- again, I use
Guinness as a great example

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.266
because it's a beer
that everybody's had

00:17:49.266 --> 00:17:50.360
and everybody knows.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.830
People swear that there's
coffee and chocolate in it.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.620
There's absolutely not.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.500
Those are two
expensive ingredients.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.384
They're using malt that has
been roasted to taste like that.

00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:03.050
And then hops can
tastes like everything

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:09.320
from grapefruit and pine
to pineapple and peach

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.980
and strawberry.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.630
And there's blueberry
ones out there,

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.050
and there's tangerine and
lime and lemon and mango,

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.770
and everything else in between.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.900
And then yeast can
have banana and bubble

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.860
gum and clove and
pepper and flowers

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.160
and honey and everything else.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.760
So it all just depends
on the strains,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.100
and how much you're using,
and what combination

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.120
you're using in them.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.760
And then you can--

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.470
it's game on when it comes
to brewers these days,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.360
where they're just putting--
anything goes in their beers

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:36.860
these days.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.430
If you can eat it, brewers
have made a beer with it.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.210
And everything is on the table.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.630
Literally everything
is on the table.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:49.340
From money to sheep shit to--

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.200
sorry, I don't know if
I can say that here.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.900
I hope you guys are cool--

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.510
to all kinds of exotic fruits.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.720
I had a beer that was once
brewed with grilled beef

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.160
hearts.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.900
There was a beer
that Dogfish Head did

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.380
that was brewed with moon dust.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.850
Everything is on the table.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.772
And it's all ridiculous, but
it can also taste really good.

00:19:10.772 --> 00:19:11.730
Sorry, this guy's got--

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.410
KEVIN NELSON: I saw
we had a hand up.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.036
Can we--

00:19:13.036 --> 00:19:15.410
JOHN HOLL: See, this is the
fun part about beer tastings,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:15.740
right?

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.020
It's always like,
let's do it at the end.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.061
And everybody's like, I've
had a couple of beers.

00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:20.570
I got things to say.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.920
AUDIENCE: I had a question
just about the saison.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.690
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:24.350
Aw, man.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.990
AUDIENCE: What gives it more
of the characteristic flavor?

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.101
Is that the hops, or
the yeast, or the malt?

00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:30.100
JOHN HOLL: More of the
yeast than anything else.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.920
It's sort of a saison yeast
in the Belgian tradition.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.190
But also the grain
bill helps a lot.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.877
The hops are very not all that--

00:19:40.877 --> 00:19:42.710
I'm not even speaking
intelligently anymore.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.360
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.236
AUDIENCE: The chair .

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:47.026
JOHN HOLL: I know, I'm
going to fall asleep

00:19:47.026 --> 00:19:48.380
in this comfortable chair.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.640
Yeah, the hops play a
minimal, minimal role in this.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.610
So it's usually just the
yeast strain and sort

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.280
of some of the malts
that go into it.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.470
KEVIN NELSON: So,
perfect transition.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.750
Hops kind of get
all the attention

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.852
in the beer world today.

00:20:00.852 --> 00:20:02.060
JOHN HOLL: So much attention.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:02.851
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah.

00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:04.590
But like as you're
talking about now,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.282
malts and yeast really make
up that the dominant flavors.

00:20:08.282 --> 00:20:09.990
JOHN HOLL: Well, I
don't know about that.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.950
I think hops in IPAs
are the dominant flavor,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.020
and that's the idea.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.620
And these days with hazy,
juicy IPAs, where it's DDH,

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.450
it's Double Dry Hop, and
brewers are putting 20,

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.710
30 pounds of hops
into a barrel of beer,

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.950
which is a ridiculous waste
of ingredients, in my opinion.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.540
But they're doing this anyway.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.590
No, hops are definitely, in
IPAs, the dominant flavor.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.540
But yeast is the most important.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.734
Malt gives us the alcohol.

00:20:37.734 --> 00:20:38.900
And then water is important.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.302
But hops are sexy.

00:20:41.302 --> 00:20:43.010
I mean, like, look at
this picture that's

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.750
up here right now.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.810
That's a really cool-looking
piece of vegetation

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:48.600
that's growing.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.420
And when you walk
the hop fields,

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.770
and you just see binds and binds
and binds of this as you go.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.920
And it's vibrant, and it's
one of these things like where

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.670
the hop rubbings, when
you go to the farms

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.740
or you go to a brewery,
and you tear them open,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.020
and there's the sticky
powder on the inside of--

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.190
lupulin.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.890
It's an interactive
ingredient as well.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.750
Malt, we sing about
it as kids when

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.181
we're singing amber waves of
grain in the national anthem--

00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:17.180
not the national anthem.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.830
In my country 'tis--

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.100
KEVIN NELSON: "America
the Beautiful."

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.266
JOHN HOLL: Yeah, "America
the Beautiful," thank you.

00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:23.090
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.740
I wish I could blame it on the
jet lag, but I really can't.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.970
But yeah, you know,
so malt has always

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:34.320
been a part of our
collective experience.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.380
But it's not sexy.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.660
It's not marketable
in a lot of ways.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.310
Malt goes into our cattle
feed, and our dog food,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.390
and our Cheerios in the
morning kind of thing.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.040
And it looks nice
when it's waving

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.810
in the breeze and everything.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.395
But hops are really
unique to beer.

00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:53.520
And so I think that that's
one of the other reasons

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.670
that it's become as--

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.840
I don't know, the front and
center, the mascot of beer,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.240
than anything else.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.010
KEVIN NELSON: So once we're
done here, over on the bar,

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.200
I brought in some various kinds
of malts that you can try.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.600
You can actually pick up
some of that and chew it.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.420
Taste-- each one
has its own flavor.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.180
And two kinds of hops as well.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.939
Don't eat those.

00:22:14.939 --> 00:22:16.230
JOHN HOLL: Don't, don't, don't.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.700
KEVIN NELSON: Just smell those.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.440
JOHN HOLL: I got really nervous
that were going to-- like,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.356
where are the interns?

00:22:20.356 --> 00:22:22.460
It's like the interns
can go, and yeah.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.652
That's what we used to do
at my old magazine with--

00:22:25.652 --> 00:22:26.860
KEVIN NELSON: And then yeast.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.401
I didn't bring any of yeast in,
but if you ever get a chance,

00:22:29.401 --> 00:22:31.790
go down to White Labs
down in San Diego.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.520
They do something
really interesting.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.340
They take one wort,
which is the sugar

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.490
water you start with before
you ferment it into beer,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.140
and they pitch four
different yeasts.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.030
They split it into four
different fermenters

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.500
and pitch four different yeasts.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.540
So then you taste the same beer.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.810
And the only change in the
beer is from the yeast.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.815
And it is fascinating.

00:22:49.815 --> 00:22:52.200
Mind-blowing, if
you're a beer geek.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.790
You go from nice,
traditional ales

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.130
to these cinnamon-y
clove Belgians

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.830
with just a change in the yeast.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.950
JOHN HOLL: Yeah,
it's really cool.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.960
Yeast is all around us right
now, by the way, though.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.760
If it got cold enough
and you guys brewed

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.190
a beer in your parking
lot or something,

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.340
and you wheeled it outside
into your parking lot

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.290
in the cold enough
weather, there's

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.829
natural yeast that
would inoculate.

00:23:14.829 --> 00:23:17.120
KEVIN NELSON: And we see some
brewers doing this today.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.420
They're doing some
wild yeast, definitely.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.490
JOHN HOLL: Yeah, that's like how
our nomadic ancestors did it.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.930
KEVIN NELSON: So,
at that, I think

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.190
it's time for beer number two.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.970
JOHN HOLL: Perfect.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.110
KEVIN NELSON: What are we
going to be drinking here?

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.280
JOHN HOLL: I just
came from here.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.446
Like, literally this is why
I was late getting here,

00:23:31.446 --> 00:23:35.400
because I was drinking with Alex
Nowell, the brewmaster there,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.609
who's a wonderful individual.

00:23:36.609 --> 00:23:38.941
If you have a chance to go
down and visit their brewery,

00:23:38.941 --> 00:23:40.300
it's like 20 minutes from here.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.335
And this is their
Day Job Pale Ale.

00:23:42.335 --> 00:23:44.460
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah, they're
just over in Inglewood.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.470
It really is a great
spot to stop by.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.290
You can bring food in, and
they're good folks over there.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.040
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.950
All right, so the thing
that I like about this beer

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.540
is I'm not against
the modern age hazy,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.350
juicy IPAs that exist.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.289
I'm not.

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:02.080
I think that they're
cool in a lot of ways,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.980
and I love that it's
pushing the idea of beer

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.330
forward in America,
and what beer can be.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.970
But I really like
looking at this beer.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.860
This is a fun beer to look at.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.370
And a lot of the hazy juicies
that are out there these days,

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.760
where they're thick
like milkshakes,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.490
they're dense as all get
out, they're pulpy, juicy,

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.360
orange juicy things.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.240
Garrett Oliver of
the Brooklyn Brewery

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.090
said not too long ago that
the hazy New England style

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:35.400
IPAs were the first beer
built for the Instagram age.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.260
And it's true.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.510
My Instagram is populated with
just endless, endless people

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.530
taking pictures of hazy,
juicy, light-consuming,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.250
black star-esque IPAs.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.770
But there's just
something about looking

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.040
at an almost-clear glass
of beer with a really nice,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.770
fluffy white head.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.020
KEVIN NELSON: And a nice logo.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.360
JOHN HOLL: Yeah,
logos out always.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.610
KEVIN NELSON: Thank you, Cleo.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.414
JOHN HOLL: By all means.

00:25:03.414 --> 00:25:04.830
Yeah, the New York
office is going

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.870
to be really jealous
of these, by the way.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.245
KEVIN NELSON: They
always aren't.

00:25:08.245 --> 00:25:09.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:10.100
JOHN HOLL: Wow.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:10.975
KEVIN NELSON: Cheers.

00:25:10.975 --> 00:25:12.399
JOHN HOLL: Wow, all right.

00:25:12.399 --> 00:25:13.440
It's the guy from Jersey.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.288
I'm suddenly
feeling outnumbered.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.640
But then, you know, it's got
this really nice tangerine note

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.290
to it.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.450
A little bit of pine
on the background.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.180
It's using some old school hops.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.980
A little bit a new school
flavor to it as well.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.500
And this just bridges the gap.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.020
This is one of those
beers that, for me--

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.330
this is my day job, by the way.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.925
Hanging out and drinking.

00:25:37.925 --> 00:25:39.300
And this is the
beer that I would

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.140
want to just sort of
while away the afternoon.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.547
As a complete aside,
and I don't know

00:25:45.547 --> 00:25:47.130
if I get into this
in the book or not,

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:51.265
but I'm a huge advocate for
day drinking now and again.

00:25:51.265 --> 00:25:52.140
KEVIN NELSON: Cheers.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.950
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.380
But seriously, just take
a day off and just go

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.780
sit in a bar with a book.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.300
Not necessarily
this one, but just--

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.490
and this is the type
of beer where, I mean,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.870
it's a lower ABV, right?

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.330
It's only in the
5% range I think.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.434
Yeah 5.6%.

00:26:07.434 --> 00:26:08.850
So you can have a
couple of these,

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.100
and it's not going
to put you under.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.190
But just the lost
art of having a beer

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.664
during the middle of the day,
I think, is so important.

00:26:16.664 --> 00:26:18.330
Or a drink during the
middle of the day.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.695
And feeling a little
indulgent about it.

00:26:20.695 --> 00:26:22.320
I think we've lost
our way a little bit

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.570
with, like, even technology
and some of these things

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.653
of always being connected.

00:26:25.653 --> 00:26:27.330
It's just nice to
go sit in a bar.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.160
And this is the type
of beer that would

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.750
lend itself perfectly to it.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.320
KEVIN NELSON: It really is one
of my favorite things to do.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.910
Sit at a bar, talk to people.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:34.110
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.859
KEVIN NELSON: It really
is a way to unplug

00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:38.980
from all of our constant
notifications and stuff.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.430
JOHN HOLL: Or just sit with
your own thoughts, you know?

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.800
On the podcast that I
do, Steal This Beer,

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.020
we're served beers blind.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.452
So in black glasses,
the guest brings on--

00:26:49.452 --> 00:26:50.660
it's this podcast that we do.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.334
And the guest
brings on the beers.

00:26:52.334 --> 00:26:53.500
We don't know what they are.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.850
My co-host Augie Carton
from Carton brewing and I,

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.080
we don't know what they are.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.690
They're served to
us in black glasses.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.630
And we talk about what the
beer is, not necessarily

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.260
what we want it to be.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.230
But then we also
write a sentence

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.570
of where we would like
to enjoy that beer.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.520
And that's sort of a
fun exercise as well.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.260
And this is, again,
the name plays to it.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.760
But this is a beer
that I would just

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.740
go sit at the Venice Tap House.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.700
Is that still open?

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.790
KEVIN NELSON: Yep,
Venice Ale House.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.540
JOHN HOLL: Yeah, the
last time I was here,

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.020
I got into a lot
of trouble there.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:28.510
I almost missed a flight
on my way home from there.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.266
Any of the guys who were
there, are you guys here?

00:27:31.266 --> 00:27:31.766
Yeah.

00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:33.044
That was fun.

00:27:33.044 --> 00:27:35.730
That was so much fun.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.010
I almost missed my flight.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.930
It was pretty wild.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.167
But yeah, yeah, well, we'll
try to repeat it, but yeah.

00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:44.000
But think about those
types of things, like,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.333
where you'd want to have a beer.

00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:46.974
Try to place it situationally.

00:27:46.974 --> 00:27:49.390
I don't know, I feel like I'm
off the rails at this point.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.450
KEVIN NELSON: No, it's all good.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.190
So you mentioned
earlier Prohibition

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.620
and the changes
that brought to you

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.200
beer drinking-- and any
alcoholic beverage drinking.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.610
After the 21st Amendment,
things started to recover.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.070
But things like farmers,
and there were just

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.560
all kinds of things that were
affected in the supply chain.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.410
What's different about drinking
beer then versus drinking beer

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.980
today with these-- now we were
back up with more breweries,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.050
finally, from pre-Prohibition.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:16.250
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.410
It's easier to drink better
beer than ever before.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.700
And that's the thing.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.507
It's also easier to drink
bad beer than ever before.

00:28:25.507 --> 00:28:26.090
And it's true.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.980
Just because you
can open a brewery

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.710
doesn't mean that you're
going to make great beer.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.210
And so one of the
things, like I was

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.040
talking about with--
if you see carbonation

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.380
on the inside of
the glass, knowing

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.870
some of the off flavors
that exist in beer.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.440
Like, if you taste
buttered popcorn,

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.420
or you taste wet
cardboard or smell

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.510
wet cardboard, or green apple.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.640
A lot of these things that
we know in general life

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.600
are considered to be flaws
when it comes to beer.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.300
You don't want to taste
buttered popcorn in your stout.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.340
You don't want to
taste it in your lager.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.680
You don't want to taste skunk
in your Dutch lager as well.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.020
But we all know
that with Heineken,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.330
and we kind of give
that a pass, right?

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.670
So, like, my dad
was drinking it.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.160
But that happens because
the light comes in,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.980
and the blue UV ray
negatively interacts

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.130
with the alpha acids
inside of hops and turns

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.030
hops to taste like skunk.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.010
And it's something
that we all know.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.950
But skunk in marijuana
sometimes is kind of desirable.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.550
So it's these picking
and choosing things.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.860
But when brewers are
putting stuff out,

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.040
and you taste these
things at a local brewery,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.620
it doesn't necessarily mean
that they're making great beer.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.120
And that's a larger
problem as well.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.340
So with so much choice
come so much great,

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.211
because also you
can now taste beers

00:29:45.211 --> 00:29:46.460
that are made with everything.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.022
And brewers are
fearless, and they're

00:29:50.022 --> 00:29:51.230
doing some really cool stuff.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.510
But there's a lot of
good with a lot of bad.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.380
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.080
So, next topic, science.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.090
This is something that
people don't normally

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.100
think of with beer.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.930
JOHN HOLL: Is that Matt Farber?

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.030
From the University of
the Sciences in Philly?

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.530
KEVIN NELSON: That's
from the UC web

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.500
page for their brewing program.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.820
JOHN HOLL: OK.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.829
So that's UC Davis?

00:30:11.829 --> 00:30:12.620
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.050
JOHN HOLL: That looks like
a guy who is also a brewing

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.760
professor in Philadelphia.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.430
So they all look the
same, apparently.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:19.444
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:19.444 --> 00:30:21.360
KEVIN NELSON: Maybe only
when holding a glass.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.616
JOHN HOLL: Professorial
white guy in glasses, yeah.

00:30:24.616 --> 00:30:26.990
KEVIN NELSON: So how is science
used to make better beer?

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.656
You talk about people who open a
brewery and they make bad beer.

00:30:29.656 --> 00:30:30.650
What goes on with it?

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.060
JOHN HOLL: They're
not embracing science.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:32.850
That's the thing.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.240
Science and technology are
at our fingertips right now.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.550
I mean, we now
can know more than

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.840
at any other point
in our history.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.510
And science and technology have
brought us closer as people.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:48.440
I mean, it hasn't been
great in a lot of ways,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.520
but it has made things
that we previously didn't

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.740
understand in the forefront.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.990
KEVIN NELSON: No longer magic.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.698
JOHN HOLL: Right.

00:30:57.698 --> 00:30:59.317
It's no longer the
goddess of Ninkasi.

00:30:59.317 --> 00:31:01.650
But I also don't think that
we should lose that as well.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.620
I think we should
understand it and appreciate

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.140
that there are things
that happen in nature,

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.940
and that there is
nature, and that there

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.800
are these things
that will always

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.920
be a little bit outside of
our grasp of understanding.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.050
And that's really cool
to sort of reach for it.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.420
And we don't always have
to break it all down.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.920
But you can run beer through
all manners of equipment

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.420
these days, and it'll tell you
exactly what's wrong with it.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.378
And, like, that's cool.

00:31:24.378 --> 00:31:29.100
We didn't have that 15
years ago, 30 years ago.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.650
Our grandparents didn't have it.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.140
And so I think it's pushing
us forward ever more.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.680
And I love the role
that it's playing

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.499
in that aspect of
the beer industry.

00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:39.290
KEVIN NELSON: Nice.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.240
You talked earlier about
all the different kinds

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.365
of ingredients that are
going into beer these days.

00:31:43.365 --> 00:31:44.140
JOHN HOLL: Yep.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140
KEVIN NELSON: We're in--

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.570
we're in the fall
season now where

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.295
there's pumpkin spice
lattes and pumpkin breads

00:31:49.295 --> 00:31:50.555
and everything else.

00:31:50.555 --> 00:31:51.860
You can't swing a dead
cow without hitting

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:51.930
something pumpkin.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.060
JOHN HOLL: You're setting
me up here, uh-huh.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.570
You got to get interesting
story about the origin

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:01.380
of these pumpkin these pumpkin
flavored beverages Yeah,

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.700
and now I can't remember it.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.910
So everybody thinks
of PSL when it comes

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.200
to Starbucks and everything.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.340
And good on them.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.560
Beer did it first.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.000
It's the old "South
Park" episode.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.040
Simpsons did it.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.880
Yeah, it's-- boy, I just
dated myself there, didn't I?

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.160
That was, like, even less of
the crowd knowing about 45 rpm.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.320
Yeah, so beer was doing
pumpkin-flavored beers

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.610
early on.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.170
I don't care for them.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.660
I'm of the camp that
they should all just

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.721
be rounded up, put in a
giant pile, and set on fire.

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:38.720
But I also know that
there's people who love it.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.330
And it goes back to the
saison thing before.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:45.320
I don't like that combination
of spices in real life,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.730
not necessarily in beer life.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.910
I don't like it.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.200
I don't pumpkin
pie, but people do.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.080
But the cool thing is, is
that beer is a blank canvas.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.697
And so there's a
brewery in Wisconsin

00:32:56.697 --> 00:32:59.030
that I wrote about a couple
of weeks ago for "Craft Beer

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.000
&amp; Brewing" magazine,
where I work,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.880
that did a candy corn beer.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.710
And they sort of
mimicked candy corn.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.930
And then I just saw on
the news this morning

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.700
that now they're doing
a white stout that

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.920
evokes the idea of eggnog.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.320
And there are beers that
tastes like s'mores,

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.330
and there are beers that
taste like bear claws,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.930
or Bavarian donuts--

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.240
Boston cream donuts, I
should say-- or jelly donuts,

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.490
or whatever.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.800
Beer is a blank canvas,
in a lot of ways,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.130
to add flavors to things.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.600
And that, I think,
is kind of cool,

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.610
because I don't
begrudge people who

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.300
like whatever it is that's in
that glass up on the screen

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.730
right there.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.465
But I don't want to drink it.

00:33:39.465 --> 00:33:41.840
KEVIN NELSON: So I think it's
time for beer number three.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.260
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.880
KEVIN NELSON: What are
we going to have here?

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.130
JOHN HOLL: Excellent question.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.080
So now we're getting
into the next--

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.407
so we went from a pale ale, and
now we're going into an IPA.

00:33:51.407 --> 00:33:53.240
This is a brewery that
I haven't been to yet

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.690
but I know is
really popular when

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.230
it comes to this general area.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.380
And in fact, my Uber
driver on the way over here

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.840
asked if I had been
to El Segungo yet.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.739
Segundo?

00:34:03.739 --> 00:34:04.780
KEVIN NELSON: El Segundo.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.780
JOHN HOLL: Segundo.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.502
I'm going to butcher it.

00:34:07.502 --> 00:34:08.960
And I said, no, I
haven't been yet.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.389
And he's like, oh, they
did a Steve Austin beer.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:12.590
And I was like, that's cool.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.409
Did you go to the brewery
because of Steve Austin?

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.780
And he's like, yeah,
yeah, that's why I went.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.670
And I was like,
that's really cool.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.812
So it's a cool
local brewery that's

00:34:22.812 --> 00:34:24.020
doing some really cool stuff.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.520
Whoop.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.853
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah, they're
good, good folks over there.

00:34:26.853 --> 00:34:28.480
You should definitely
go check it out.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.920
They're, of course-- they're
mainly known for IPAs.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.469
They do many, many
varieties of IPAs.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:35.719
Lots of different hop
varieties, so it's fun.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.380
You can really taste the
individual types of hops

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.225
in their beers.

00:34:39.225 --> 00:34:41.350
JOHN HOLL: But even the
clarity off of this-- and I

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.100
can taste a little
bit more of the sugar.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.219
So this is obviously
a thicker beer.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.409
If you do mouth
feel, the hold it

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.570
on your tongue for
three seconds again,

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.639
you're definitely
going to come across

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.900
where it's going to coat
your tongue a little bit.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.691
It's going to be a
little bit more viscous.

00:34:55.691 --> 00:34:59.350
It's going to be a little
bit more tongue coating.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.830
This is really fun.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.080
It's got that sweetness to it.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.850
It's got a little bit of pine.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:12.570
It's dank in some ways, to
use that current phrase,

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.809
as it were.

00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:14.850
KEVIN NELSON: Herbaceous?

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.660
JOHN HOLL: Herbaceous, yeah.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.300
It's kind to
everybody, as it were.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.110
If this actually goes up
online, my wife will watch this.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.610
And she'll be like, you tried
to make a marijuana reference.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:28.040
That was really cute.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.716
You don't know shit.

00:35:29.716 --> 00:35:32.700
And neither does she, but
she knows more than I do.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.530
She's going to be
like, oh, you tried.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.660
That was really cute.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.070
Yeah, this is just a fun beer.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.195
It's an easy drinking beer.

00:35:39.195 --> 00:35:41.280
This is probably
higher in ABV, right?

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.330
KEVIN NELSON: I'm
guessing about seven.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:42.665
JOHN HOLL: It is.

00:35:42.665 --> 00:35:43.530
It's straight up 7%.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:52.080
This, at some point, will go in
the Museum of Beer Technology

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.650
of a 22-ounce bottle.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.300
Everybody is doing
cans these days.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.770
Everybody is switching to cans.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.350
The 22-ounce bomber
bottle that you either

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.587
could drink by yourself if
you are having a tough day,

00:36:04.587 --> 00:36:06.420
or that you could share
it with your friends

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.250
if you are feeling generous.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.970
This is a packaging style
that probably will not

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:17.440
exist in widespread use in
another year and a half.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.690
So this is kind of fun.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.770
We're ahead of the curve.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.309
We're watching the
dinosaur watch the--

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:24.600
AUDIENCE: Why the can movement?

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.624
JOHN HOLL: What's that?

00:36:25.624 --> 00:36:26.915
AUDIENCE: Why the can movement?

00:36:26.915 --> 00:36:29.782
JOHN HOLL: Oh, why
the can movement?

00:36:29.782 --> 00:36:30.740
A couple of different--

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.114
I'll jump over
there in a second.

00:36:32.114 --> 00:36:33.810
The question was, why
they can movement.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.770
Most breweries are switching
to cans these days.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.670
One-- I love this.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.060
One, it keeps out all light.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.560
So you're not going to get that
Heineken problem, especially

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.140
with so many hoppy beers
being made these days.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.200
When you put a beer
in brown glass,

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.120
it doesn't let light through
as much as green glass.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.160
So this is why most craft
brewers use brown glass.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.049
Clear glass is
absolutely the worst

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:00.090
because it lets the most
amount of light through,

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.890
so your beer will
skunk really fast.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.740
Green it'll skunk
less fast, but still.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.260
And brown, it'll take
just a little bit longer.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.210
Cans let no light through.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.600
That's first and foremost.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.150
It's also lighter packaging.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.880
They're easier to transport.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.930
They're easier to pack.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.640
They're easier to stack.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.070
For outdoor lifestyles,
which craft beer has really

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.130
sort of embraced, of hiking
and biking and fishing

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.520
and everything, it's easier
to carry around cans in,

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.550
and it's also easier-- much
easier-- to carry them out,

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.390
recycling-wise.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.090
So there's a lot
of benefits to it.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.850
KEVIN NELSON: So, speaking
of glass for bottles,

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.770
you made quite a strong
point in the book

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.110
about not liking
what we kind of think

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.159
of as the traditional
draft beer glass.

00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:43.950
JOHN HOLL: Hate it.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.370
KEVIN NELSON: Why is that?

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.950
JOHN HOLL: It does no
favors to the beer.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.480
It does zero favors to the beer.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.850
So there's white wine
glasses and red wine glasses,

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:59.270
and there's science
behind why they work.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:03.550
Wine figured out marketing early
on in the US post prohibition.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.580
And they got themselves in
the white linen tablecloth

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.440
restaurants, and
they said, if you're

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.730
going to go out and
spend $50 on a bottle,

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.130
it might as well be wine.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.830
And we didn't have beer
that was worth $50 like when

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.060
all this was happening.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.660
Now we do.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.460
Now we have beers that are
worth $300, or $400 or $500,

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.250
as it were.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.030
There's wine prices in beer now.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.350
So we had this utilitarian,
one-size-fits-all glass that

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:33.800
if you didn't want beer, but
you also wanted soda or seltzer

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.950
or apple juice on the
rocks or whatever,

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.670
this was the easily
stackable beer glass.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:44.150
Utilitarian, all-purpose
glass, as it were.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:48.840
I'm trying to think of a
technology thing, but I can't.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.440
But I think that when you have
even a glass like this that

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.010
has a wider lip
at the top of it,

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.445
you can get your nose in if you
do want to smell it that way.

00:38:58.445 --> 00:38:59.820
You're not going
to dribble down.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.080
There's ergonomics
that go into glassware.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.220
And the pint glass just
is not where it should be.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.720
KEVIN NELSON: Yeah, a lot of
well-known European beers, they

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.636
have a traditional glass
associated with that.

00:39:11.636 --> 00:39:12.300
JOHN HOLL: Yes.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.270
KEVIN NELSON: And if
you go to a bar there,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.664
you'll typically-- you'll
get that glass for that beer.

00:39:16.664 --> 00:39:17.330
JOHN HOLL: Sure.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:21.920
So Duvel or Orval,
or some of these

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.540
have their own
branded glassware.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.620
Those aren't necessarily
built for making the beer

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.170
taste better as much
as it is marketing.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:32.750
The Orval glass looks
like the Orval glass,

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.541
and you should only
drink Orval in it.

00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:37.790
And I think that that's
correct because that's the way

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.441
that they want you to do it.

00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:40.940
And there's people
who will disagree

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.590
and say, well, you can
drink it in anything.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.423
And yeah, of course.

00:39:43.423 --> 00:39:45.740
You can drink it in a
jelly jar if you want to.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.870
But I think it adds to
an overall experience.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.610
I don't think that
the pint glass

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.740
adds to the overall
beer-drinking experience.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.198
If you're out at
a bar and somebody

00:39:53.198 --> 00:39:55.160
serves it to you, cool.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.210
But if you're at home, invest in
a really nice beer glass or two

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.360
in the same way that
you might a wine glass,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.240
and it'll make it better.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.640
KEVIN NELSON: There a
question over there?

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.140
AUDIENCE: Do you
know the beer glass

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.114
that the Sam Adams
brewery tour gives out?

00:40:11.114 --> 00:40:11.780
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.910
AUDIENCE: And they really make
a huge point of talking it up

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:14.930
and all its different features.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.250
Is that actually
a good beer glass?

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.650
JOHN HOLL: It is.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.850
I have several at home.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:18.200
That's why I'm asking.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.158
JOHN HOLL: Yeah, they
call it the perfect pint.

00:40:20.158 --> 00:40:24.380
Sam Adams spent, I don't know, a
couple hundred thousand dollars

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.030
researching that.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.720
It has nucleation points
on the bottom of the glass,

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.530
so all of the carbonation
is concentrated

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.110
and then rises to the
top and sort of keeps

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.940
this nice head of foam going.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.792
It's got a wide lip
on there as well,

00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:38.750
so you can get your lip
around it and your nose

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.260
in without spill-- like, they
spent some fun time on it.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.870
The problem is, it's
really great for home.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.600
It's impractical,
even at Applebee's,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.950
because the other breweries
don't want their beer being

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.870
served out of a Sam Adams
glass because that's

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.580
marketing for them.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.530
The glass doesn't
necessarily stack well--

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.990
maybe two or three-- before
it becomes like a Jenga

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.260
game that's unwieldy.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.650
Where the shaker pint, like,
you can walk into places

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:07.720
and it's 20, 30 deep against
the wall, as it were.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.550
So this is the cockroach
of beer glasses.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.740
It's not going to go away.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.890
But that doesn't
mean that at home you

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.960
can't have great beer glasses.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.770
There's a guy in
Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.110
The Pretentious Beer Glass
Company, he calls himself.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.390
And it's all tongue-in-cheek.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.910
But he has an MFA
in glass blowing.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.160
And he makes beer glasses.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:36.740
And it's what I use at home
when I'm feeling extra fancy.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.500
And I love it.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.125
But for the most
part, I just drink out

00:41:39.125 --> 00:41:42.290
of a tulip glass at home
just because I like the stem.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.380
I like the aroma.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.290
I like how it feels in my hand.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.109
It's kind of fun.

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.900
KEVIN NELSON: Nice.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.802
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:41:48.802 --> 00:41:50.760
KEVIN NELSON: You talked
about bottles already,

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.570
but I wanted to read a quote
from a friend of yours, Nate

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.400
Schweber, you have in the book.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.090
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.090
KEVIN NELSON: This is a
poetry about beer bottles.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:03.170
"As sleek as airplane wings
and smooth as polished stone,

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.850
these laborers of
the beer industry

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.400
sweat like construction
workers, sing

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.790
like wind chimes when clinked,
and sigh like happy man

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.137
when relieved of pressure."

00:42:13.137 --> 00:42:14.220
Can you say anything more?

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.290
We already talked about
color and stuff, but--

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:16.280
JOHN HOLL: No, no, I can't.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.488
And that's why I quoted Nate
in the book saying that.

00:42:18.488 --> 00:42:20.810
So Nate Schweber, who works
for the "New York Times,"

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.330
who's one of my
closest friends, who

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.890
wrote a great book
on fly fishing

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:28.280
about Yellowstone, if
anybody likes to fly fish,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.930
go pick up Nate's book.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.010
Shameless plug for that.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.920
But no, it's poetic.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.450
And beer is poetic.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.130
Like, there's so
many things where

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.629
I think if we just show up at
the bar at the end of the day,

00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:42.270
and we say, beer, and, you
know, we do this type of thing.

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.650
But I think if we stop to
think about the artistry that

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.710
goes into it, or even just
the ergonomics of a bottle,

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:53.270
or the ergonomics of a glass,
or how a glass feels in our hand

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.630
this way versus
another one, there's

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.830
a lot of romance in drinking.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.950
There's a lot of
romance in beer,

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.600
a lot of romance
in the ingredients

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.620
and the passion that
goes in behind it.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.550
And I love that quote from Nate.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.800
I think it's some of the
most beautiful writing that's

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.590
been done on beer ever.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.970
And I've read a lot on it.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.850
And I was the editor at
"All About Beer" magazine

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.530
when we published those words.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:20.690
And as soon as I read
it, I was like, damn it,

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:21.940
I'm putting this on the cover.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.210
It's brilliant.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.550
So yeah, I think we have
to think about it that way.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.110
KEVIN NELSON: Very nice.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:26.930
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:30.440
KEVIN NELSON: So, anybody
want to have another beer?

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.430
OK.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.890
What are we drinking here?

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:34.760
JOHN HOLL: Brother Thelonious.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.592
So, this is from North Coast.

00:43:38.592 --> 00:43:39.800
KEVIN NELSON: Where are they?

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.600
JOHN HOLL: They are in
Northern California.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.600
They're north from here.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.130
KEVIN NELSON: Look at
that beautiful color.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:45.930
Cheers.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:46.596
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:43:46.596 --> 00:43:50.180
[CHUCKLING] Yeah, sure.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.520
All right.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.550
I love this beer.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:44:01.490
So this is an abbey ale
from North Coast that part

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.977
of the proceeds--

00:44:02.977 --> 00:44:05.060
I actually don't know where
they're at these days.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.000
But part of the proceeds went
towards the Thelonious Monk

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.200
Jazz Institute for scholarships
and things like that.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.050
I don't know what
it is on the bottle,

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.190
but this is at
least 12%, 13%, 14%.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:19.130
AUDIENCE: 9.4%.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.240
JOHN HOLL: 9.4%?

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.870
All right, well, I was way off.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.790
This is one of those
beers that when I saw it

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.070
on the distributor list,
I got really excited,

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.600
because I don't get this a
lot where I live anymore.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:37.580
And it's just such a really
nice, fun, indulgent beer,

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.540
in a way.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.320
The last time that I saw this on
tap at my local back in Jersey

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.270
City, New Jersey, I had a pint
of it, because I was like, oh,

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.380
it'd be irresponsible
if I didn't.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.815
And then it was irresponsible
that I had two more afterwards.

00:44:52.815 --> 00:44:54.740
And I think I called out
of work the next day.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.020
KEVIN NELSON: Cheers.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.311
JOHN HOLL: Yeah, I know, it's--

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.000
the small pour goes a long way.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.840
But this is-- you get that sort
of roasted brown sugar, candy

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.200
sugar thing going on with it.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.760
It's got some dark stone fruit,
like a little bit of plum

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.760
and fig coming through as well.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.070
We started off with the
Allagash Saison, which

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.100
is an American interpretation
of what a Saison should be,

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.530
but that tries to stay
as true to the style.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.250
And ending on this
beer is very much

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:27.330
the same way, that in
between the two IPAs

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.850
are very much these
beers that have

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.570
defined the American tradition
and the American beer market.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:35.550
But right now, the
two beers that sort of

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:39.640
bookended this show us the old
world of where we came from.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.620
And I think that that's
really important.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.580
As all things progress, we
can't forget our history.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.910
We can't forget where
things came from.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.320
And in technology, right?

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.730
It's like, I think about
my first Nokia phone

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.170
back in the day.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.960
The 5150.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.830
And I appreciate now
that I have a Samsung 9

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.160
or whatever in my pocket.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:02.940
But, like, it's--

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.092
KEVIN NELSON: Android.

00:46:04.092 --> 00:46:06.300
JOHN HOLL: Yeah, yeah, it's
definitely-- yeah, it's--

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.130
yeah.

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:10.440
Yes, very much so.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.262
Android here.

00:46:11.262 --> 00:46:12.720
I'm going to stop
at the Help desk,

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.320
if that's cool, on the way out.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.690
No, but like, to remember
where we came from, I think,

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.035
is really important to
appreciate where we are today.

00:46:21.035 --> 00:46:22.410
KEVIN NELSON: So
I had a question

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:26.730
I was going to ask you
about how do all these--

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.490
JOHN HOLL: That's
just a mean sign.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:30.900
KEVIN NELSON: --about how do
all the breweries stand out

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.900
in this cacophony
of brewery today?

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.560
But we're almost out of time.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.010
So if we can, I'm going to
go ahead and skip this one.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:38.885
JOHN HOLL: All right.

00:46:38.885 --> 00:46:41.970
KEVIN NELSON: And I'd like
you to end on talking about

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.310
something-- a topic that's
been in the news a lot today,

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.260
even here at Google--

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.300
sexism in beer.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.460
One of our beers today
from Three Weavers

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.110
is a female-owned brewery.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.610
It's three women who own that.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.675
JOHN HOLL: Yep.

00:46:54.675 --> 00:46:56.133
KEVIN NELSON: Maybe
talk just a bit

00:46:56.133 --> 00:46:57.600
about kind of the
history of sexism

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.330
in beer, and where
the industry is today.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.980
JOHN HOLL: It's getting better.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.050
It's getting better.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.107
For a long time, it was a
male-dominated industry,

00:47:07.107 --> 00:47:08.940
both in the people who
worked at the brewery

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.260
and who owned the brewery.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.210
But beer itself as a
beverage doesn't know gender.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:16.230
It doesn't know sex.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:17.070
It doesn't know religion.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:17.986
It doesn't know creed.

00:47:17.986 --> 00:47:22.350
It doesn't know your
political beliefs, as it were.

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:25.489
It's a great leveler
in a lot of ways.

00:47:25.489 --> 00:47:27.030
But when the beer
that was being made

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.610
for a long time of the
beer-flavored beer,

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.904
the American industrial
light lager, yeah,

00:47:32.904 --> 00:47:34.320
there's women who
drank it, but it

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.740
wasn't being marketed to them.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.040
In fact, it was almost
being marketed against them,

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.800
where you'd see Budweiser
commercials with women

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.130
in bikinis being
objectified, and then

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.725
the guys clinking their
glasses, being like, yeah.

00:47:46.725 --> 00:47:51.480
And these days, you walk into a
tap room like at Three Weavers,

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.470
and it's diverse.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.330
People are coming
for the good beer.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.550
And they can come
from the tech sector,

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.760
or they can drive an Uber,
or they can be a reporter,

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.257
or they can be whatever.

00:48:04.257 --> 00:48:06.090
And they're all coming
in for the same beer.

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:08.370
And it's sort of this
great leveler for us.

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:11.100
And so yeah, sexism still
exists in the industry.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.870
And I get into it
in the book where

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:14.411
there's some breweries
that have done

00:48:14.411 --> 00:48:18.270
some really boneheaded things,
some really stupid things.

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:21.930
Naming their beers that
seemingly promote rape culture,

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.230
or that are xenophobic,
or homophobic,

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:29.400
or anything else in between.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.530
And if you're doing that
and you're a brewer,

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.750
get the hell out
of the industry.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:35.190
Just, like, stop.

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:36.460
We don't need it.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.550
We don't want it.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.640
But I think that consumers
are speaking up now more

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.239
and more thanks to technology.

00:48:43.239 --> 00:48:45.030
And there's a lot of
cool things that exist

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:46.196
between beer and technology.

00:48:46.196 --> 00:48:49.920
But if somebody posts something
on Facebook, and they're like,

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.700
hey, we've named this beer, and
it's this really idiotic name,

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:58.200
it whips around the world
so fast with smart people

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.450
being like, knock this off.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.130
Like, this is wrong.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.840
And you can almost
set an egg timer

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.430
to when the apology
is going to happen.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:09.690
And I think that that's
great, because it keeps people

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.270
in check, and it
sort of hopefully

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:15.810
drives that culture underground
enough so that it eventually

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:16.770
just disappears.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.562
Because we don't
need it in our world.

00:49:19.562 --> 00:49:21.270
KEVIN NELSON: I have
some more questions,

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:22.410
but we're really out of time.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:22.993
JOHN HOLL: OK.

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.860
KEVIN NELSON: Check
out John's podcast,

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.060
where he discusses this and
other interesting topics

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.340
in the beer world.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.430
So check it out.

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:30.940
John, thanks so much for coming.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:31.370
JOHN HOLL: Thanks so much.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.890
This was a real pleasure.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.056
KEVIN NELSON: Real pleasure.

00:49:33.056 --> 00:49:36.120
[APPLAUSE]
