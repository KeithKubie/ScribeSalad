00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.660
LINDA ROTTENBERG: Hello.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.980
It is great to be
back at Google.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.480
I met Larry Page and
Sergey Brin in 1999.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.300
We were actually all part
of a world economic forum

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.490
group called The Global
Leaders for Tomorrow.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.180
And there were about
50 of us a year

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.740
from different industries
and different countries.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.940
And most of us had actually
been using Google Search before.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.220
So none of us were
particularly surprised

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.770
by the trajectory
of Larry and Sergey.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.160
But I vividly remember
early on the two

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.520
of them sitting down with this
very animated Chinese guy who'd

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.770
been this English teacher and
had set up the Yellow Pages--

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.570
the online Yellow
Pages of China.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.800
And he had this idea for
this big marketplace.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.470
It seemed quite
improbable to most people.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.230
And in fact, he was
known as Crazy Jack.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.050
And I'm sure many
of you are guessing

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040
that this is Jack Ma who
just took Alibaba public.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.630
So yet another example of
why crazy is a complement.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.080
I want to step back
and share a little bit

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.300
about how I got here.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.250
So I grew up outside of Boston
in a traditional family.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.510
My parents met as high school
sweethearts in Rhode Island.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.920
My dad went on to be a lawyer.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.990
My mom stayed at home
to raise three kids.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.360
And they are very loving,
very focused on education,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.280
and inherently risk averse.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.120
So some of this
rubbed off on me.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.400
I went to Harvard for college.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.110
I went to Yale for law
school, got to law school

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.710
and figured I had no
interest in practicing law.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.690
So I found out about
this opportunity

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.720
to go to Latin America
after law school.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.660
My parents assumed it was a one
year Peace Corps type thing.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.450
And I started in Chile and
Uraguay, landed in Argentina,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.150
and just fell in love
with the culture,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.440
learned tango, and rooted
for local soccer teams.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.510
But something started
happening, which

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.050
is that now it was the mid
'90s and everyone at home

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.220
was talking about
Yahoo and Netscape,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.900
and this entrepreneurial
revolution I was going on.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.090
And in Latin America, all
the young people I met

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.260
were aspiring to
government jobs.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.150
And this was very
confusing to me.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.690
And my aha moment
came when I was late

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.960
for a meeting in Buenos
Aires and got into a taxi,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.789
and learned that my driver
had an engineering degree.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.080
So I asked what I thought
was a logical question, which

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.220
is excuse me, but what are
you doing driving a cab.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.010
And he proceeded to say that
the governments weren't hiring

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.860
and all the old school companies
didn't have any use for someone

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.330
with his skills.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.360
And I tried to ask
why it was that he

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.970
wasn't starting a new company,
becoming an entrepreneur.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.880
And I realized I didn't
know the word in Spanish

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.020
for entrepreneur.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.540
And though it's hard
to believe today,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.740
20 years ago, there was
no word actively used

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.900
in Spanish or Portuguese
or Turkish or Arabic

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.980
for entrepreneur.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.436
Now, I say this so that the
blogosphere won't get mad at me

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:12.560
and say oh, you gringa,
you don't know emprendedor,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.370
empreendedorismo exists.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.660
In fact, I will scroll
and then go backwards,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.380
but five years into
starting Endeavor,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.300
we got a call from the editor
of the Portuguese-Brazilian

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.610
dictionary saying partly
because of Endeavor's work,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.130
he was adding the
term emprendedor

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.110
and empreendedorismo
into the Lexicon.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.590
So there is a word today,
but there really wasn't.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.340
And this was this moment for
me when I said, wait a minute,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.970
why isn't there an
organization to support

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.260
these dreamers, these
innovators in places

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.280
that don't support risk taking?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.200
But to do this, I had to
take some risk myself.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.540
And the first meeting of
Endeavor with my co-founder

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.580
Peter and myself took place
at my parents' kitchen table

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.820
in Newton.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.410
And when my parents
overheard us plotting

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.320
this global organization,
they were not pleased.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.795
My father came over
and reminded me

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:04.670
that I don't have a
trust fund and would need

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.240
to be financially independent.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.630
If you don't want-- well, how
about consulting, he said.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.240
When this wasn't
working, my mother

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.230
who's always been very
on-message about her desire

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.019
to have us produce
grandchildren came over

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.479
and suggested that maybe getting
on planes for all this time

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.270
wouldn't be the best
way to start a family.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.710
And besides, she
said very nicely,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.380
my eggs were not
getting any younger.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.830
This month I
actually told my mom

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.420
that she was just ahead of her
time, because as most of you

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.380
know, Apple and
Facebook started--

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.760
for better or for worse--
these egg freezing programs.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.750
But so my mother was
just ahead of the time.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.540
But to me, this-- my
kitchen table moment,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.290
as I call it-- was
really this moment

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.670
that I think that every
dreamer I know faces.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.370
It's this tension between
doing what's safe and expected

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.210
and doing what's
unsafe and unknown.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.020
It's this juncture
between fear and hope.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.880
And I chose hope.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.020
And I committed
myself in that moment

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.040
to help dreamers who
are feeling scared,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.680
who are feeling stuck
in their moments

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.860
get unscared and unstuck.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.780
So that really was the
origin of Endeavor.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.460
Now, pretty soon after
that, Peter and I

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.870
had to find funding.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.175
And no one thought
this was a good idea.

00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:26.300
First of all, we were
starting in emerging markets.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.230
We were finding
entrepreneurs, but we

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.520
were starting as a nonprofit to
support these very high growth

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.740
business innovators because
we felt there was money,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.512
there was talent, there was
no trust in these markets.

00:05:38.512 --> 00:05:39.970
So we wanted to
start out initially

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.280
just as a pure nonprofit.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.330
And people thought
this would never work.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.070
So I finally got a meeting
with an Argentine real estate

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.790
investor who would become the
one the largest landowners

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.720
and self-made entrepreneurs
in the country.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.011
And it was a 10 minute meeting.

00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:58.470
His name is Eduardo Elsztain.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.320
And five minutes into our
meeting, he looks at his watch

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.890
and said I know, you
probably want a meeting

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.430
with George Soros, who
was his largest investor.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.570
And I looked at him
and I said no, Eduardo.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.920
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.070
You're an entrepreneur.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.630
This organization is about
supporting entrepreneurs.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.990
I want your time, your
passion, and $200,000.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.990
So the meeting had been
taking place in English,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.180
but at this point, he
turns to his right hand guy

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.610
and he says, esta
chica esta loca.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.270
So I respond in Spanish
that I'm disappointed

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.660
that this from the man who
walked into Soros' office

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.830
and came out with a
$10 million check, he

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.322
was lucky I only asked
him for $200,000.

00:06:38.322 --> 00:06:39.530
At that point, he turns away.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.113
I had no idea what
he was going to do.

00:06:41.113 --> 00:06:43.670
And he immediately
takes out a check

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.160
and writes me the $200,000.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.870
And I always say that I
walked out of that meeting

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.280
with our first chairman of
Endeavor, Argentina, $200,000,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.570
and my nickname la chica loca.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.500
Which when we later moved to
the Middle East, carried over.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.350
So just to tell you a little
bit-- you heard the numbers.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.250
Endeavor now operates
in 22 countries.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.520
We've screened 40,000
candidates, selected 1,000

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.550
to work with.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.010
And as you heard, they generate
now over $7 billion annually

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.260
and they've created
400,000 jobs.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.640
So I just want to stick with
Argentina for the moment

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.770
and tell two stories
just to encapsulate

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.690
what it is that we do.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.060
One of the first-- so first of
all, we build in every country

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.060
we operate in, or every
city now that we've

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.450
expanded also to Miami
and are going to Detroit.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.620
So we're in the United States
as well as Europe as well as

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.730
Africa, Asia, the Middle
East and Latin America.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.560
And in every country, we form
a board of top business leaders

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.950
who will agree to put
their money, their time,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.560
and their networks
to work to help find

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.940
these innovators in
every single industry,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.697
in every walk of life
in their country.

00:07:51.697 --> 00:07:53.280
And the requirement
is people who have

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.380
an idea that really can go big.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.240
We are about that
scale-up moment.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.980
At that point, we scour the
country, we build local teams.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.710
Endeavor now has 350
people operating full time

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.590
around the world.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.430
And we look for who
these dreamers might be.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.760
We put them through
a year long process.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.680
And one of the
first people we met

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.830
was this kid named
Wences Casares.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.860
And I kept getting introduced
to him by people who said,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.430
well, you're crazy.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.780
We think he's crazy.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.270
You two should meet.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.420
He had grown up on a
sheep farm in Patagonia

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.640
and had the idea to create
the E-Trade of Latin America.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.340
Now, he did not have
the right family

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.549
connections or last
name, but he was

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.230
determined to make this happen.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.890
So much so that he
convinced his two sisters

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.610
to drop out of college
with him and had

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.090
to travel back to the
sheep farm in Patagonia

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.470
to tell his dad that
three kids were dropouts.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.030
That beat my story.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.260
34 investors had
turned him down.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.590
He had almost nowhere to go.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.740
But we saw this kernel of this
amazing entrepreneur in him.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.330
So we put him
through the ringer.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.120
We selected him as an
Endeavor entrepreneur.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.720
And at that point, we
brought him on a road show.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.540
We helped him raise $4 million
initially in venture capital,

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.880
including from Fred Wilson,
one of the top VCs in New York.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.540
We helped him find a COO and
build a senior management team.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.270
We recruited a Harvard MBA to
help him with a business plan.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.610
And then later, Wences
married my assistant Belle.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.220
Endeavor is a full
service organization.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.890
18 months later, Wences
sold his company patagon.com

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.920
to Banco Santander
there $750 million.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.484
I got 34 phone calls the next
day from those investors who

00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:39.150
had turned him down
saying, did you find

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.035
any other entrepreneurs
in our country.

00:09:42.035 --> 00:09:44.160
But here's what's really
important about the story,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.035
it doesn't end there.

00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:48.050
Wences has gone to found
five other companies.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.050
He's now known for a
Bitcoin company called Xapo.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.660
And he is one of the
most prolific mentors

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.640
and angel investors
on the continent,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.970
even though he's now
living in Silicon Valley.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.270
And four of the
people he mentored

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.150
were these four guys
in Buenos Aires who,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.790
when the peso
devalued 66% in 2003,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.940
said this is the best time
to start a software company.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.570
And everyone said,
are you kidding me?

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.930
This is a disaster.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.551
Why would anyone start a
software company from Argentina

00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:22.050
now?

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.470
No one is going to buy this.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.800
And they said no, you have
all this design talent

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.610
and we actually have a
cheaper labor force now.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.077
But we can create really
high quality products.

00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:33.660
They founded a company
called Globant.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.220
They came through our process.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.887
We actually rejected
them the first time

00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.553
they came through our
selection process,

00:10:38.553 --> 00:10:40.190
thinking they were too arrogant.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.070
They came back
through the process,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.200
become Endeavor entrepreneurs,
go on to get as their clients

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.330
Disney and Google and Nike.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.020
They become one of the largest
job creators in the country.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.670
And this August when
all of Argentina

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.280
was facing another debt crisis,
they took Globant public

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.520
on the New York Stock Exchange.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.900
And now they're
creating universities

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:12.320
within universities to help
train people to get IT jobs.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.760
And the last story
I'll tell, just

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.470
because it takes the cycle
forward and shows that we're

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.350
about all types
of entrepreneurs,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.410
and one of the things I
feel is really important

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.750
to tell stories of
different types of people.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.540
One of the four
founders of Globant

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.180
sat on one of the
selection panels

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.750
where he'd been rejected
10 years earlier.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.430
And he was paired with
Steve Case of AOL.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.600
And they were debating
on a number of companies.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.540
And one of the
people they selected

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.950
was a woman named
Latifah Al-Waalan.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.180
And Latifah grew
up in Saudi Arabia.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.690
She got an MBA at the
University of Washington

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.920
and became immersed in
Seattle's coffee culture

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.020
and realized how frustrated
she'd been throughout her life

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.930
that her mother made
terrible spicy Arabic coffee.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.750
And Latifah had tried to
recreate her grandmother's

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.530
delicious recipe and found
it incredibly complex

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.650
and time consuming.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.310
It took 30 minutes
to make the coffee.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.120
And Latifah thought,
oh my God, no

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.690
wonder so many Saudi women are
stuck for hours in the kitchen.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.590
There must be a better way.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.140
So she resolved to
create an automated

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.990
version of Arabic coffee, the
Nespresso of Arabic coffee.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.430
She goes back to Riyadh.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.520
First, she blends seven
spices and lightly roasted

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.540
beans into prepackaged,
premeasured packages.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.270
She then works with
local engineers

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.740
and they manufacture
a machine that

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.210
reduces the time of
brewing the coffee by 75%.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.900
So her grandmother's recipe goes
from 30 minutes down to seven.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.210
And like every other
nay sayer, people

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.940
think this'll never work.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.920
No one will ever buy it.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.110
Now, most of the
naysayers were men.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.944
And when they went back
to tell their wives,

00:12:48.944 --> 00:12:50.401
the wives were
like, wait a minute.

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:51.710
Where can we get one of these?

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.260
And one wife said
to her husband,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.500
you don't get it because
you don't spend time

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.340
in the kitchen.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.140
I'll take those 23 extra
minutes, thank you.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.210
And Latifah just became
an Endeavor entrepreneur.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:08.284
She now sells her
manufactured Nespresso machine

00:13:08.284 --> 00:13:09.950
through Whole Foods
and Williams Sonoma.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.820
This year she'll
generate $10 million.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.670
And what I love about
that story-- and now

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.920
we'll get to why I
wrote the book-- is

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.420
that I think we
need to freshen up

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.860
our image of the entrepreneur.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.870
And one of the
things I've realized

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.260
working in so many
different environments

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.510
is that people hold
themselves back

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.430
in part because they feel like
they don't have an engineering

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.530
degree and don't live
in Silicon Valley.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.060
So I kept saying you don't
need to be a boy in a hoodie

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.510
to be an entrepreneur.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.194
And one of the things I do in
the book is share many stories

00:13:41.194 --> 00:13:43.610
of Endeavor entrepreneurs and
non-Endeavor entrepreneurs--

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.720
people modern,
people historical,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.130
people in every industry.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.400
Because I feel like if we create
relatable and diverse role

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.880
models, people will say if he
can do it, if she can do it,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.850
I can too.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.200
But I had two other
reasons for finally sitting

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.250
down and writing a book.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.617
I should say I'm married
to an author, Bruce Feiler.

00:14:02.617 --> 00:14:04.450
He's written 12 New
York Times Best Sellers.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.990
And I will say if any
of you are married

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.630
and you want empathy
for your spouse,

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.570
try doing what they do for a
living for a couple of years.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.480
It changes your view on them.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.110
And most entrepreneurship
books focus on the startup.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.390
And what I've come to believe
is that entrepreneurship

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.100
is a journey that
starts there, but it

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.650
goes to the scale-up phase.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.020
It's a journey of getting going,
going big, and going home.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.140
Because I think that also it's
about how we marry our passions

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.700
and our work lives
with our family lives.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.230
And so I really wanted
to write a book that

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.190
carried through the entire
arc of that journey.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.120
So the sections of the book are
get going, go big, and go home.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.930
But my last reason
for writing a book

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.740
is I started getting these
unexpected calls a couple years

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.030
ago, first from managers
of Fortune 500 companies

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.190
saying we are telling
our workers to be more

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.480
entrepreneurial and we think
we're being very clear,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.799
but they're not
getting the message.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.340
And the people inside
those companies

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.570
were telling me I'm terrified.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.760
If I fail, I'm going to
lose my budget or my job.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.400
Can you help me get these skills
to be more entrepreneurial

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.560
and get ahead at work
without risking my job?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.900
And then parents at
drop-off at the school

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.240
where Jennifer and I
send our children started

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.430
coming and saying, you
know what, I've lost my job

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.970
and I'm in transition, and
I don't know whether to go

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.110
into another company.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.100
Or I have this idea that I've
been looking at in my basement,

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.530
and I'm trying to figure
out if I can take it.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.860
And what I realized
is that we all

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.460
need these entrepreneurial
skills today.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.160
Entrepreneurship is not
just for the entrepreneurs

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.410
that are the high growth
companies as we know them.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.200
Entrepreneurship
is for everyone.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.920
Michael Dell told
me something that I

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.300
love and have to
repeat it, which

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.310
is that today, there are the
quick and there are the dead.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.970
And to me, entrepreneurship
is for people

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.840
who want to get ahead
and take some risk.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.520
But in fact, the
riskier strategy

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.740
is to do nothing at all.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.280
So that was what
I set out to do.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.030
And the first thing I realized
is that we need a new lexicon.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.615
Because we've this very clunky
word of entrepreneur and made

00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:11.070
it even clunkier by adding
all these qualifiers

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.430
from social entrepreneur to
mom-preneur to co-preneur.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.040
And so I created the
zoology of entrepreneurs

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.327
and told stories around them.

00:16:18.327 --> 00:16:19.410
The first to the gazelles.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.880
These are the high growth
entrepreneurs from Google

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.670
to Home Depot to Jenny Craig.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.860
Endeavor works
with the gazelles.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.430
And that's a pretty known term.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.810
I created a term called
the butterflies for people

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.940
who are formally mom and pop.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.499
But I found today they need just
as many entrepreneurial skills,

00:16:36.499 --> 00:16:38.540
even if you're starting
something in your kitchen

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.240
or in your basement,
you actually

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.290
need to know how
to get on the web

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.600
and how to get distributors,
or how to get on Shark Tank.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.940
And then there's
the dolphins that

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.570
are the social entrepreneurs
or people also in government.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.134
And I use dolphins
because they're

00:16:54.134 --> 00:16:55.800
the most cooperative
and social animals.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.090
But if you harm a dolphin's
pod or their environment,

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.640
watch out.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.339
But my favorite animal species
in the zoo are the skunks.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.960
And many of you are skunks.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.849
This comes from Lockheed
Martin's Skunk Works program

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.640
that built fighter
jets in the 1950s.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.119
But it's also because we need
people to stink up the joint.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.270
And so one of my
favorite things that's

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.770
happened in the last eight weeks
since the book has been out

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.880
is people are coming saying,
I'm a skunk, I'm a skunk.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.570
So that is one of my goals,
to breed more skunks.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.109
So let me start with Get Going.

00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:33.650
And I'm going to go through some
of the sections of the book,

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.108
and then I really want to open
it up to a lot of questions.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.150
So it turns out that the
biggest barriers to getting

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.900
going are actually-- it's you.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.520
And that everyone is looking
for permission from their spouse

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.530
or their parents or their boss,
and really what they need do

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.200
is give themselves permission.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.140
And it's like what Bobby Jones
said about golf, that it's

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.100
a game played on a
five inch course,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.370
the distance between your ears.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.420
And I talk to a lot of people
about how they gave themselves

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.510
that permission to go forward.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.600
And one of the things
that people had to do

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.220
is drown out the
noise around them.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.940
So we all know
the phrase friends

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.340
don't let friends drive drunk.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.381
Well, I've come to believe
that friends don't let

00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:18.630
friends test drive their ideas.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.630
And the reason is
that they're either

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.970
trying to tell you--
it's like taking them

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.292
to the last bridal fitting
and asking them to tell you

00:18:26.292 --> 00:18:27.750
that your wedding
dress is anything

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.970
but perfect since there's
no time to change it.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.179
Or they're so
nervous that you're

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:34.470
going to risk everything that
they're going to tell you

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.370
how terrible this idea was.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.965
And they're not
reliable narrators.

00:18:37.965 --> 00:18:39.840
And one of my favorite
stories in this regard

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.900
is the Banana Republic founders,
who are a courtroom sketch

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.050
artist and a photographer.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.080
And they decide to
found this company.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.410
And they want to create these
khaki uniforms like Safari,

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.920
but they also have
the cartoon artist

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.969
sketches out these
wonderful-- he calls himself

00:18:58.969 --> 00:19:00.760
the minister of propaganda
and sketches out

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.000
these wonderful quirky letters.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.630
And they're planning to use
this as the marketing tool.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.921
And they go to a friend, they
take it off the printers,

00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:09.720
and the friends look
at this and they say,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.320
you can't send this out.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.620
This is horrible.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.400
Oh my god.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.240
You left your jobs for this?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.950
You're going bankrupt.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.660
And they almost don't
send it out, but they do.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.130
And years later when Banana
Republic cells to GAP,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.255
it's mainly because of these
quirky letters they did it.

00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:31.630
So they would never have gotten
it off the drawing board.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.504
So friends don't let friends
test drive their ideas.

00:19:35.504 --> 00:19:36.920
Once you give
yourself permission,

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.799
people have all of these reasons
why they can't move forward.

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:42.340
And many of them
revolve around risk.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.423
And what I've come to
realize is that our attitude

00:19:44.423 --> 00:19:46.600
about entrepreneurship
and risk is all wrong.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.140
We talk about these
moonshots, and yet just

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.510
as many entrepreneurs
are minnovators.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.200
They start with
mini innovations.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.980
They're not risk
maximizers, they're

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.070
actually risk minimizers.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.040
So first of all, we
think that companies

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.410
start with millions of dollars.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.040
It turns out half
the Inc 500 companies

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.640
were founded with
$5,000 or less.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.020
Crowdfunding makes
this even easier.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.500
Second, we think
people go all in

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.570
and then they leave
their jobs immediately

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.030
and they risk everything.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.330
Sara Blakely, when she
founded Spanx-- many

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.020
of us familiar
with her products--

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.900
she sold fax machines
for two years

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.650
while she was getting the
product up and running.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.310
Phil Knight of Nike-- who's more
just to do it than Phil Knight?

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.490
He spent nearly a decade
doing other people's taxes.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.880
He worked as an accountant while
someone else sold the shoes.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.910
So people don't take big
risks, they start small.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.370
And even inside
companies, what I realized

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.830
is people did not
go to the boss.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.890
People did not create
these big business plans.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.654
They stopped planning,
they started doing,

00:20:48.654 --> 00:20:49.570
but they went stealth.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.590
So when I looked at Pfizer
and AT&amp;T and MTV and Clorox,

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.840
and looked at these
entrepreneurs, these skunks

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.970
within these companies, it
all fell through a pattern

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.960
that they basically realized
a need that needed fixing.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.170
They go with their own
budgets or 10% of their time--

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.221
you guys have 20% time,
but most people don't.

00:21:11.221 --> 00:21:13.720
And they started and they don't
get permission from the boss

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.680
until they have
the proof points.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.670
So at Clorox, it
was these two moms

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.740
that created these
eco-friendly products.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.080
And it was only after they
had a product line that they

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.350
went and told their boss.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.980
It became Clorox
Green Works, which

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.020
was the first
innovation in Clorox

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.040
within 20 years in a major way.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.600
So stop planning
and start doing.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:38.160
Now, the second step of
entrepreneurship is going big.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.505
But what happens
at that point is

00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:45.160
that many people have
engines crash to the floor,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.010
just as Henry Ford literally
had his prototype of the Model T

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.986
crash to smithereens before
he vowed to rebuild it.

00:21:51.986 --> 00:21:53.360
And I actually
have a white board

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.200
of all the common mistakes
that entrepreneurs make

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.484
and how they can then scale-up.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.150
But I want to focus
on two things today,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.500
and then I'm happy
to answer questions--

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.330
chaos and leadership.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.530
Because one thing that is common
for all entrepreneurs is you

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.480
hit this moment of chaos,
whether it's of your own making

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.939
or whether it's the
situation around you.

00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:14.480
And what I've come
to realize working

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.210
in Egypt after the revolution,
in Miami after recession,

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.530
and Greece after its
financial crisis,

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.210
is that stability
favors the status quo,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.770
but chaos favors
the entrepreneur.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:30.420
Walt Disney actually started
with nothing in his pocket.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.820
All his cartoons
were taken from him,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.890
including Oswald the
Rabbit, which at that point

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.600
was his successful character.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.250
It was stolen from him.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.650
And in a rage on a
train, he drew a mouse

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.380
with red velvet
pants and buttons

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.670
that became Mickey Mouse.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.970
And it was in his moment of
despair and the moment of chaos

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.150
that that creation was made,
and it's so emblematic.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.500
And my favorite
story in the book

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.280
is actually a story of managing
chaos and managing risk.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.510
And it takes place in the
1800s in Northeastern France

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.800
when a woman named Barbe Nicole
Ponsardin inherits a family

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.230
winery and is put in charge of
this business she knows nothing

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.940
about.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.870
And she manages to
revolutionize it.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.280
She takes the bottles and
turns them upside down,

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.370
freezes off the excess yeast,
and creates modern champagne

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.970
as we know it.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.470
So her 1811 vintage is known
as the first modern champagne.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.960
But just as Barbe Nicole
perfects the process,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.610
the Russians invade.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.040
And all the experienced wine
owners shutter their doors

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.650
to protect their vineyards.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.550
Barbe Nicole spots a
marketing opportunity

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.510
and resolves to get the
Russian army wasted.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.820
Today they drink, tomorrow
they will pay, she says.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.210
And this works incredibly well.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.260
And she makes one
more calculated risk,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.160
which is before peace is
signed, she runs the blockades,

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.120
gets her bottles right outside
St Petersburg and Moscow

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.660
so that when the
treaty is signed,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.020
her bottles arrive first
beating out the competition.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.700
Czar Alexander declares he
will drink only the Widow.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.740
Veuve is the French
word for widow,

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.140
and Barbe Nicole's late
husband was Francois Clicquot.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.640
This is the story of
Clicquot, and it's

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.650
the story of how one woman
embraced the turbulence

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.390
around her and took
smart risks to become

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.680
the first female owner
of a multinational.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.280
It's a great story.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.320
So the last thing I want
to just briefly mention

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.014
before we go to questions
is I did a lot of digging

00:24:37.014 --> 00:24:37.680
into leadership.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.350
And this is really important
in the context of skunks,

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.059
because as I mentioned
before, all of these leaders

00:24:43.059 --> 00:24:44.350
were saying I don't understand.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.400
We talk about failure.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.483
We talk about risk taking.

00:24:46.483 --> 00:24:47.920
Why isn't it getting through?

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.100
And it turns out 40%
of managers today

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.150
say they won't take risks
because they fear retribution

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.810
if something goes wrong.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.140
And I looked at, OK,
everyone talks about

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.620
and gives lip
service to failure.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.180
What are companies
that actually really do

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.020
a good job at inculcating
this into the philosophy?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.030
And two that came up-
one is the Tata Group.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.080
So Ratan Tata runs the
largest conglomerate in India.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.340
He actually just retired.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.330
And in his last year
as chairman-- and he's

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.700
in his 70s-- he announces
a prize for the best failed

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.020
idea, which I think every
company in the world

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.010
should institute a prize
for the best failed idea.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.780
The other story which
was really new to me

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.170
was the story of WD-40.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.960
We all use this product
to get our squeaky doors.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.590
Does anyone know how it started?

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.090
OK.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.180
So in the 1950s, this
guy named Norm Larson

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.610
was trying to solve rust
in the aerospace industry.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.180
And he tries one formula.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.380
He figures it has to do
with water displacement.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.780
First formula doesn't work,
second formula doesn't work.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.230
39 formulas failed.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.220
The 40th formula,
he gets it right.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.610
He brings it to
General Dynamics.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.650
And it works in the
missiles, but the workers

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.080
start sneaking it home
to fix those car doors.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.046
And so Norm Larson's
like, wait a minute.

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:05.920
I got something here.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.640
I'm going to create a
consumer facing company.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.340
Looks to name the product, goes
back to his lab notes-- water

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.220
displacement 40th formula.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.070
So failure is
inherent in the brand.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.760
And today, the CEO says for
every decision in the company,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.059
we are going to have
these learning moments.

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:26.600
We're going to talk
about what failed

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.089
and what went wrong in
addition to what went right.

00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:31.130
So I think there are things
that you can actually

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.920
do to actually go from talking
about failure to embedding

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.920
this notion of risk taking.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.580
I alsa-- again, while, I
love the moonshots idea,

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.700
I think for some people
that scares people off.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.740
And I've come to believe
that minnovations,

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.820
these many innovations,
are almost as important

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.450
as the moonshot ideas.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.720
And then we need to have both.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.840
But the last thing I'll talk
about-- because it's the most

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.120
personal, it was the
hardest for me to learn--

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.450
was as a female
leader, I had always

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:07.480
thought that the job was to
be independent and strong and

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.060
confident and to separate your
family life from your business

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.120
life.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.890
And this worked
well for a while,

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.650
then I had identical twins
and I was put on bed rest.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.340
And so that went out the window.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.170
But I was still
managing somewhat.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.410
And then six years
ago, my husband Bruce

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.330
got diagnosed with a
rare case of bone cancer.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.940
And we learned that he
was going to have to go

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.100
through a year of chemotherapy.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.400
He would also have
a 16 hour surgery

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.800
to replace his entire
femur and to graft

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.780
the fibula onto the femur.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.870
This had been performed
only twice before.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.980
Our girls were
three at the time,

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.050
and this was right when
Endeavor had gotten $10 million

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.560
to double the rate
of our expansion.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.750
And I was not
getting on a plane.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.760
I was going to go to those
chemotherapy sessions

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.870
and make sure the
girls were stable.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.030
And I told the board
and I told the team.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.190
And what never surprised
me was that Endeavor

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.610
surpassed its growth targets
and that everyone stepped up.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.680
But here's what did surprise me.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.145
When I came back full
time-- Bruce I should say

00:28:14.145 --> 00:28:16.700
is six years cancer free.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.210
And when I came back to work,
two employees pulled me aside

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.660
and they said, you know
Linda, we always admired you

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.220
and we thought you
were superhuman.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.240
And not in a good way.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.889
This was in an unrelatable way.

00:28:30.889 --> 00:28:33.180
And they said now that we
know who you are as a person,

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.610
now that we've seen
you be vulnerable,

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.220
now we'll follow you anywhere.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.520
So the lesson for leaders
is less super, more human.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.070
I'm going to end there that
the last section of the book

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.300
is go home.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.650
I talk a lot about not
only work life integration,

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.770
but about creating
atmospheres where

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.292
people can do well and do good.

00:28:55.292 --> 00:28:57.750
Millennia;s in particular have
really led the way, I think,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.280
in showing why impact matters.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.710
But I really would love to
open it up to all of you.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.400
So thank you, and ready
to answer any questions.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:15.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just point
out that we have books for sale.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.730
The hardcover books are on
sale for $10 in the back room.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.750
So please, please have at it.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.166
LINDA ROTTENBERG:
And I would like

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:29.090
to point out that I worked
every day with Tao Suarez

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.790
on this book.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.410
He is now a Googler, but I just
want to personally thank him

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:48.949
for all his great work on "Crazy
is a Complement." [APPLAUSE]

00:29:48.949 --> 00:29:49.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.480
My name's Lindsay.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.220
LINDA ROTTENBERG: Hello.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.180
My dad's an entrepreneur--

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.390
LINDA ROTTENBERG: Yes.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.050
AUDIENCE: He's an inventor,
for lack of a better term.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.930
He's a chemical engineer, so
he has patents in his name.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.554
And I've always
admired him quite a bit

00:29:57.554 --> 00:30:00.090
for how he's able to build
something from nothing

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.420
over the last 30 years.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.780
I have very
different skill sets.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.840
And I think more about taking
ideas that are already existing

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.400
and making them a
little bit more fun,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.010
interesting, more
age appropriate.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.409
So I'd love to hear about
what types of businesses

00:30:14.409 --> 00:30:16.950
you've worked with where it's
more about tweaking an existing

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.570
idea and making it better as
opposed to what my dad does--

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.380
literally thinking of things
no one has thought of before.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.410
LINDA ROTTENBERG: That
is a great question.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.920
And I think that
many of us grew up

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.860
thinking if we weren't
the inventor type,

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.200
then we weren't entrepreneurs.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.652
We might be managers in
entrepreneural companies,

00:30:31.652 --> 00:30:33.360
but we couldn't be
entrepreneurs ourself.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.250
I've come to completely
change my view on this.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:40.240
And in fact, at one point, we've
gotten to 1,000 entrepreneurs

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.740
at Endeavor.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.040
And they were so
diverse not only

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.134
in the industries
they were working in

00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:47.050
and their backgrounds,
but in their approaches

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.930
as leaders and their
strengths and weaknesses.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.930
And yet they were all
trying to model themselves

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:51.900
after Steve Jobs.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.260
And I was like, but
this isn't working.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.510
You have different strengths
and different weaknesses.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.050
So I worked with Bain &amp;
Company for three years

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.709
on an entrepreneur
personality test.

00:30:59.709 --> 00:31:01.500
It's really a personality
test as a leader.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.416
You can go download it
at lindarottenberg.com,

00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:05.330
a shortened version.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.950
And what we realized, we came
up with four personality types.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.220
These are different
from my species.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.300
So the rocket ships
are people who

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.600
really care about
efficiency and metrics

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.490
and taking things that work
and making them even better.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.810
The stars focus on brands
and they're more personality

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.610
driven, often more in the arts.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:30.680
Transformers often take older
businesses and modernize them.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.420
And they're really interested
in both the mission

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.960
of the new businesses, but how
you transform these old school

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.440
products and services.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.270
And then the diamonds are more
of the classic inventor types.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.260
And each of these
personalities, as I said,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.600
has the ability to be the
leader and the entrepreneur,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.330
but who you surround yourself
as a team, as advisors,

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.440
and as mentors does change.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.550
So I would encourage you,
take this personality test.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.295
We have a longer version if
you're really interested.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:05.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.290
I guess my question is is
I think a lot of people

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.560
sit and they think of an idea,
and then they think oh, someone

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.090
probably has done this.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.410
Someone probably knows
better about this.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.304
Who am I to do this?

00:32:17.304 --> 00:32:18.720
And I guess what
kind of advice do

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.830
you have for one getting a sense
if you should be doing that

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.510
to how to just go
through that process?

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.090
LINDA ROTTENBERG: The greatest
ideas, I've come to believe,

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:33.547
do not die in the marketplace
or in the laboratory

00:32:33.547 --> 00:32:34.630
or in the conference room.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.160
They die in the minds of the
people who have them and never

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.160
get them off the ground
for exactly that reason.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.890
I think today more than ever
before with crowdsourcing

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.550
and crowdfunding, we have ways
to get early feedback that's

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.880
not from those
family and friends

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.250
earlier than ever before.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.320
And so I really encourage
people to test that out.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.955
Because I think that the
great thing about crowdfunding

00:32:56.955 --> 00:32:59.080
and crowdsourcing is it's
not just about the money.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.680
It's whether people
actually are motivated

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.670
to say I need that product,
I need that service.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.650
And I think that with
social media even

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.580
using other social
networks, there's

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.630
ways to get that
instant feedback.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.140
But what I would say is it
goes back to that permission.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.430
And that the biggest barriers to
getting going-- it's not money,

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.880
it's not the
structural impediments.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.489
It's people holding
themselves back.

00:33:24.489 --> 00:33:26.030
And you'll find out
soon enough, it's

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.430
all about execution at the end.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.580
And what I always say is
the marketplace tells you

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.090
soon enough, just don't hold
yourself back initially.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:32.780
Thank you.

00:33:36.229 --> 00:33:37.020
AUDIENCE: Hi Linda.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.100
Thanks for coming.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.740
So you talk about--
I mean, you've

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.160
met a lot of entrepreneurs
through Endeavor.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.500
And I guess the question I
have is regarding survivorship

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.250
bias in terms of you see
a lot of entrepreneurs

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.690
who have essentially been
very successful, or at least

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.930
successful to some degree.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:59.420
Do you ever think about in
terms of encouraging us all

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.330
to be entrepreneurial,
there's always that factor

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.960
that I feel like
sometimes we ignore.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.250
And that's the doubt
in our minds, right?

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.780
That's what holds
us back sometimes.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.354
And do you address
that in the book?

00:34:12.354 --> 00:34:14.020
And your thoughts
about that in general.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.770
LINDA ROTTENBERG: In
terms of only talking

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:16.854
about the success stories?

00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:17.603
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:34:17.603 --> 00:34:18.210
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:18.420
LINDA ROTTENBERG: Yeah.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.190
I mean, I think
that's why I spend

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.940
so much time talking about
people hitting walls, talking

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.210
about whether it's the chaos
which often is external,

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:30.560
but sometimes is internal
with our own screw ups,

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.469
to this white board
of common mistakes

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:35.489
people have at that
scale-up moment

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:39.610
when they actually go flat
or actually start crashing.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.210
One of the things that
we talk about a lot

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:47.239
are the mechanics of the deal or
the distribution or the demand.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.580
I've seen oftentimes
it's actually

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.489
relationships between and among
founders that kill things.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.590
I always say Endeavor 101 is
how to fire your mother-in-law

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.190
and still show up
for family dinner.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.230
And talk about getting
start up pre-nups

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.860
when you start with
friends and family.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.030
Things like to
that other question

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.446
where people don't
know themselves

00:35:04.446 --> 00:35:07.240
and they don't properly
assess their own strengths

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.730
and weaknesses as
an entrepreneur,

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.146
and they don't
surround themselves

00:35:10.146 --> 00:35:11.200
with the right people.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.580
So I go very much into
detail of not only people

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.490
from unexpected
backgrounds to make them

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.730
more diverse and
relatable and accessible,

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.680
but also all of the
stumbling blocks

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.190
that entrepreneurship
is not just

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.140
this linear path to success.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.180
We often are told that and it
seems like the instant rags

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.990
to riches.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.460
I think more of us need
to talk about the problems

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.770
and the struggles.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.710
And not only the
external struggles,

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.450
but the internal
emotional ones as well.

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:38.350
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.240
LINDA ROTTENBERG: And
back to the question

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.360
about crowdfunding.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.480
IBM and some other companies are
starting internal crowdfunding

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.080
platforms for skunks.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.060
So people are actually getting
feedback-- so they all get $100

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.870
and they can actually
put their money

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.950
based on which of
their peers ideas

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:57.200
they actually think
will likely work best.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.530
I love that idea too.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.105
Just getting a
sense of will people

00:36:00.105 --> 00:36:01.480
put their money
where their mouth

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.690
is to know which ideas tend
to have takeoff potential.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:05.937
Yes?

00:36:05.937 --> 00:36:08.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for your comments, Linda.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.030
I can't wait to read the book.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.210
I was curious if you could
talk a little bit more

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.020
about the group of
guys in Argentina

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.450
I think that you said made
it through the first round

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.560
and you turned them down
because of perceived arrogance,

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.410
but then the second time
around something clicked there.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.780
In the context of
your story about how

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:29.450
you approached that
other investor and said,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.700
you're lucky I didn't
ask you for $10 million.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.720
I'm asking you for $200,000.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.584
Which could be
perceived as arrogant,

00:36:35.584 --> 00:36:37.250
but it's really
confidence and believing

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.940
in yourself and those things.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.840
But theres, I think
with all people,

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.740
maybe women
especially in business

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.680
and in the
entrepreneurial world,

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.912
there's a fine
line to walk there.

00:36:48.912 --> 00:36:50.370
LINDA ROTTENBERG:
A great question,

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:51.920
and I will answer
it in two ways.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:57.310
With the Globant
boys, they just seemed

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.110
to have had everything
figured out.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:02.110
And we thought would
they even take advice?

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.140
I think that was
the question we had.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.560
And I'm so proud of them.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.980
And they say that it's a
defining moment-- there

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.630
were four founders--
they all four met,

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.600
they wept, and then
when they found out

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.070
they were rejected
the first time.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.350
And they met and
they decided we're

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:16.980
going to go through
this process again.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.479
And I will tell
you, in part because

00:37:18.479 --> 00:37:20.590
of that story and the
success they've had,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.130
but how impactful it was
to actually face rejection

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.720
and have to come back and
change their own approach, now

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.070
20% of the entrepreneurs
Endeavor selects are

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:34.780
rejected the first time and come
back, which is pretty amazing.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.560
With regard to women,
so one of the things

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.420
I hear a lot is, well, people
have these connections.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.150
When you go in Silicon Valley,
there's a sense only 8%

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.440
of female led companies
are venture backed.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.870
And since we're not part of
the club, and what can we do?

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.760
And what I always
say is that there's

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.642
the dark arts of
entrepreneurship

00:37:52.642 --> 00:37:54.350
that they don't teach
in business school.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.250
And many people of
all genders use,

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.142
but I found particular
I used and some

00:37:59.142 --> 00:38:00.850
of my favorite female
entrepreneurs used.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:04.660
And I'll tell one story,
and it is of stalking.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.710
Let me say, stalking is an
underrated start-up strategy.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.240
And I used to trap people
in confined spaces.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.740
But my favorite story is a woman
named Josephine Esther Mentzer.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:20.270
And she grows up in a Hungarian
Jewish family in Queens.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:24.380
And she grows up very poor,
but aspires to luxury.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.335
So she sees a woman at a beauty
salon with this nice blouse

00:38:27.335 --> 00:38:29.130
and says, where did
you get that blouse?

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.850
And the woman looks at her
and says, what does it matter?

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.440
You could never afford it.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.290
And Estelle, as she's known,
Josephine, she gets so mad

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.090
and she says, I'm
going to have it all.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:40.980
I'm going to have the luxury.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.063
I'm going to have the art.

00:38:42.063 --> 00:38:45.900
And she realizes that her uncle
John is this struggling chemist

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.460
who can't sell these products.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.210
So she goes and
literally stalks people

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:52.210
outside of Salvation Army
meetings and in the elevators

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.861
and says that her all purpose
cream can solve their wrinkles.

00:38:54.861 --> 00:38:56.360
They don't think
they have wrinkles,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.180
but nonetheless she does this.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.980
And she builds up a
nice little business,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.330
but she does not want
to sell in drugstores.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.600
She covets luxury.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.840
She wants to sell at
Saks Fifth Avenue.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.790
So she starts
stalking the buyer.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:08.860
But he's like, I'm sorry.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.401
There's this unknown
brand and you're

00:39:10.401 --> 00:39:11.530
this unknown entrepreneur.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:12.530
No way.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:13.564
And she says, all right.

00:39:13.564 --> 00:39:15.980
I've got to do two things,
I've got to get more strategic.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.930
So first she changes her name.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:19.460
So it was Josephine
Esther Mentzer.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.780
She changes it to Estee and
takes her married name, Lauder.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.350
And the next thing she does
is at the Waldorf Astoria,

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.640
there's this charity
luncheon and she gives away

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.110
these lipsticks in these
metallic sheaths, which are

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.920
this big step up from plastic.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.900
And the women get one
free one and ask her

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.130
where they can buy another.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.390
And she says, oh, why don't
you try Saks down the street?

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.790
And as the buyer
then says-- there

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.840
was a line that forms
from the Waldorf Astoria

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.460
all the way to
Saks Fifth Avenue.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.110
And the next day,
he places an order.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.855
So yes, stalking is
underrated start-up strategy.

00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:55.430
AUDIENCE: Hi Linda.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.390
Thank you for your talk and
thank you for that story.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.200
Actually, my team
calls on Estee Lauder

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.860
and we actually want to try
and remind the Estee Lauder

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.700
business to be a little bit
more like the founder today,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.860
because it's gotten so big.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.240
So we're like, how can you
be a little bit more nimble

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240
in today's world?

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.490
LINDA ROTTENBERG: You have
to go back to the founding.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.470
AUDIENCE: The DNA of--right.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.386
LINDA ROTTENBERG: In
fact, GE when it came out

00:40:15.386 --> 00:40:18.680
of the financial crisis, they
went back to Thomas Edison

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.640
and said, we're
builders, not bankers.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.430
Because GE Capital had become
such the face of the company.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.260
They had to go back to
their founding days.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.390
AUDIENCE: So it's
like staying true--

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:28.480
LINDA ROTTENBERG:
Good on you, exactly.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.662
AUDIENCE: --to who you are
throughout the process.

00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:33.432
A question about your
management style.

00:40:33.432 --> 00:40:35.390
So the example you just
gave about your husband

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.590
when he was sick--
and thank goodness

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.700
that everything's great there.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.410
That was clearly
a moment where you

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.840
had to say, OK, what's
super important to me,

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.320
and probably turn over the reins
of the business to other people

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.050
you trust.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.090
What are other moments
in your experience

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.990
maybe after that in
the last six years

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.570
that you've had to also say not
just for significant moments,

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.360
but just in the
day to day to help

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.800
other leaders within your
organization stand up

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.742
and find their own voice
and their own ground?

00:41:05.742 --> 00:41:06.700
LINDA ROTTENBERG: Yeah.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.910
it's partly about giving
people a space to grow,

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:13.260
and partly knowing your own
strengths and weaknesses

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.970
and realizing that not everyone
is motivated like you are.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.680
So I'm someone who-- I
don't care about titles.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.244
I don't care about
vacation days.

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:22.410
I'm like, you get your work
done, it doesn't matter.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.964
And I realized after a while,
it actually mattered to people.

00:41:24.964 --> 00:41:26.380
There are people
who wanted rules.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.550
I was like, you want rules?

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.890
Rules are meant to be broken.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.320
But no, they wanted rules.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.820
And our president,
Fernando Fabre--

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.320
I was very unsuccessful
in getting a COO

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.360
because I recruited
from Nike and Disney,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.490
and I thought people wanted
more corporate people.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.030
And it turns out
they wanted someone

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.140
who had the DNA of Endeavor.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.867
And I ended up hiring
three years ago,

00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:48.450
three and a half
years ago, the person

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:51.010
who is now our president,
Fernando Fabre, who

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:54.160
had been seven years our
managing director in Mexico.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.160
And I noted that any
time anyone in the world

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.410
had a problem with
me, they went to him.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.890
I was like, all right.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.015
Let's just make this
official and why don't you

00:42:00.015 --> 00:42:00.681
come be the COO.

00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:02.990
He was like, I'm not
doing that failed title

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.930
with these two failed COOs.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:06.820
You make me president,
and I'll move.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.300
So el presidente
now sets the agenda.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.907
And it's been so nice, and we
respect each other so well.

00:42:15.907 --> 00:42:17.490
But having those
complementary skills,

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:22.090
there are some people who
really need the structure

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:22.860
that he wants.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.320
There's some people
want-- and I'm

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.800
freed up to give the
love and the inspiration.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:33.030
And I think it goes back to
knowing yourself and realizing

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:36.340
to get going, it's all
about you and your idea.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.950
But to go big, it's
about co-creation.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.070
And to go big, if it
remains all about you,

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.340
you're not getting very far.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.970
AUDIENCE: So that
actually set me

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.220
up perfectly for the question
that I was going to ask.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.780
Which is you do a brilliant
job demystifying that there

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:57.700
is a single archetype
of an entrepreneur,

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.260
and really breaking it down into
the different flavors of that.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:06.280
And I think probably one of
the things that I experience

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.320
and I see talked about
and in talking to people

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:17.510
is it's a very sort
of solo archetype,

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:19.890
the original entrepreneur
is, that I'm doing it myself.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:20.530
It's my idea.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.590
I'm creating it on my own.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.119
But you mentioned the concept
of surrounding yourself

00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:28.660
with the right people that will
complement your skills, which

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.204
I think is really important.

00:43:30.204 --> 00:43:31.620
And especially at
Google, we're so

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.860
fortunate to work amongst
brilliant, talented

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.030
individuals.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.740
So I'm curious to get your
take on your own companies,

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.090
the Endeavor companies.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:45.260
Have you experienced
people coming in

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.280
and, for lack of a better
word, hoarding the idea

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.929
and you sending them back and
saying listen, great idea,

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:54.470
but go surround yourself with
people who could make it happen

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.720
or to refine it.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.820
LINDA ROTTENBERG: Yeah.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.340
Entrepreneurship is
not a solo sport.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.950
And I think not only
are there studies

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.930
that many of the most
successful companies

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:09.590
are run by pairs or trios
of founders, not just one.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.950
I should say also the
two fastest growing group

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:15.490
starting businesses today
are baby boomers over 55

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.640
and actually women
are now starting

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.529
to launch companies at faster
rates than ever before.

00:44:21.529 --> 00:44:23.570
So back to you don't need
to be a boy in a hoodie

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.030
to be an entrepreneur.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.700
Here's the thing I will
end on because it's

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.450
so emblematic of what I've
learned at Endeavor, which

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:34.800
is not only in companies do
you need to surround yourself

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.010
with this group of people
that are the co-creators,

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:40.050
not only do you
need not just one

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.471
mentor, but a circle of
mentors, but the process

00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:44.970
of entrepreneurship
itself, Endeavor

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.990
is now looking at
what makes cities

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:49.760
conducive to entrepreneurship.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.590
And it is not top down
regulatory changes.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.340
it is not creating incubators.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.860
It is not creating VC firms.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.880
It is successful entrepreneurs
mentoring, investing in,

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.090
and inspiring the
next generation.

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:09.070
So what we've done in Argentina,
in Istanbul, in Amman, Jordan,

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.590
now we just released yesterday
a tech map of New York,

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:16.090
are what happens when successful
entrepreneurs pay it froward.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:19.430
And, in fact, you see
this incredible effect

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:23.160
of them going and angel
investing and mentoring.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.090
And that's how
entrepreneurship breeds.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:26.548
So one of the things
we're doing is

00:45:26.548 --> 00:45:28.880
saying this is happening
very well in many places,

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.200
but mainly in tech and
mainly with the guys.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.840
So back to the women question,
back to the non-tech question.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.550
We're saying if
you're in retail,

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.990
if you're in food and beverage,
if you're women, if you're

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.050
an older person, do this.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:41.550
Give back.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.800
Spend part of your time
mentoring and angel investing,

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.030
because that's actually
the way that an ecosystem,

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.220
that a community of
entrepreneurs is created.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:52.930
Thank you.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:54.180
Thank you all.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.730
[APPLAUSE]
