00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.002
NARRATOR: In the South
Pacific, Lieutenant

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.973
Richard Nixon's air base has
been bombed for a solid month.

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:07.974
[gunshots]

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.443
[screaming]

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:14.948
After one raid, Nixon counts
35 bomb craters within 100

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.783
feet of his air raid bunker.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.953
Must've had a tremendous
transformative effect

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.222
on Richard Nixon
realizing what it

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:31.531
truly means to be out in the
open, to have nowhere to hide.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.933
[explosion]

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.202
Have no defenses.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.604
[vomiting]

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.973
And that's part of
the World War II

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:43.576
experience for Richard Nixon.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.678
He knows what combat is.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:49.082
And later as commander-in-chief,
he's going to relive

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.216
those-- those moments.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.755
You're tired,
you're exhausted.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.958
And so of give back to a
place where you can just

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.029
relax and have something as
simple as a hot meal makes all

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.097
the difference in the world.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:07.000
[music playing]

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.003
Nixon becomes a very
popular guy in World War II,

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.771
for the first time in his life.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.474
Nixon was not a
naturally happy person,

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.176
but he seems to have
been about as happy

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.778
as he could get in wartime.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:22.682
He opens Nix's
Snack Shack, and he's

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.585
able to give guys coming
back from the front

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:31.825
a little taste of home,
hamburgers and beer.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.793
[laughter]

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.262
I was about the
most popular officer

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.631
in the South Pacific because
of that hamburger stand.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.265
They were pretty good.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.673
You could draw a parallel
between Richard Nixon's Snack

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:50.844
Shack and his later politics.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:54.214
His going for things that
he knows are popular,

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.784
and that will win him political
points, get him into office,

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.453
and keep him in office.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.155
He's wheeling and
dealing a little bit.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:07.861
He's able to horse trade,
to swap Japanese rifles

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.195
for a bottle of whiskey.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:15.568
He bends the rules in
order to get this stuff,

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.470
and bending the
rules seems to work.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:23.710
He was now one of the guys.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.980
He would play cards, and
in particular, poker.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.684
My technique was to play
it very close to the vest.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.586
I knew when to get
out of the pot.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:38.291
I didn't stick around when
I didn't have the cards.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:41.861
I didn't bluff very often.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.162
[laughter]

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.064
He's shrewd.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:49.035
He makes about $10,000,
which in-- in modern dollars,

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.603
is more like 100,000.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.072
It's a lot of poker money.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:57.577
Nixon is able to use it later on
to fund his political campaign.
