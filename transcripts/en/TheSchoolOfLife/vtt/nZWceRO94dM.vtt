00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.320
Cinema is the most prestigious cultural
activity in the modern world.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.200
It is for us what theater
was in the age of Shakespeare,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.600
or painting was in
the days of Leonardo DaVinci.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.400
The art form with the biggest impact,
the largest budgets,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.080
and the most widespread audiences.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.560
Collectively, we recognize that film has
an astonishing power to induce emotion.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.880
But it would sound weird to stop and ask
what film was really for,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.046
what purpose it serves in our societies,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.360
and why we spent
so much time in its presence.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.080
We don't generally think of films are serving
any very strenuous or serious cause.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.920
We ask for a lot of nice
but not terribly lasting things of films,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.320
to while away the hours
of a long flight,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.560
to keep the family together on the sofa,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.920
to give us a bit of a thrill.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.760
This is a great loss for us
and for cinema itself.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.200
We should try to pin down more accurately
what films actually do for us,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.960
then make sure we're reliably making
and finding our way to see the best,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.400
that is, the most useful kinds of things.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.159
We would ideally accept that film,
like all the other art forms,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.320
best reveals its power, when we
conceive of it as a kind of therapy.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.920
Let's consider five key problems and
how films can help us with them.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.800
We're understandably prone to self-pity.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.920
We get ground down and frustrated
by the problems life throws at us,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.720
and we tend to react by
getting ever more stern and serious.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.960
Certain films can beautifully
address this natural tendency,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.880
when they show us people not
too different from ourselves,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.120
in difficult situations,
except very much unlike us.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.840
These films play our pains for laughs.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.760
They seek the absurd side,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.480
the exact things that really great
with excessive seriousness.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.600
At their best, there's nothing trivial
about these comedies at all.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.560
They take on the momentous task

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.600
of sweetly etching us towards being
slightly nicer people to live around.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.959
2. We're not careful enough

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.040
Sometimes in life,
an action that seems quite small,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.760
goes on to have enormous consequences.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.640
You tell a little lie.
You steal a tiny bit.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.400
You’re a bit dishonest with someone.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.240
You get a bit lustful and
carried away just once,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.120
and then from this, catastrophe ensues.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.760
Films can help us by speeding up time,
and showing us in a matter of hours,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.360
fearsome result of what we might
originally thought of as small failings.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.320
Film can push the consequences
to the maximum.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.320
By witnessing horror and disaster

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.680
it can make us want to
be the kind of person,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.440
who is a touch more forthright,
and little more honest and moral,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.840
readier to face an unpleasant moment now
and (thereby) head off a distant disaster.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.240
We leave the cinema, less inclined to be
self-righteous about the failings of others

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.680
scared for ourselves and more
respectful towards things we hold dear.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.040
It might sound odd,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.319
but it's usually very healthy and helpful,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.520
to feel that one's life is a bit special,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.249
deserving of admiration and respect,
a little glamorous.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.600
But very often the opposite is the case.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.000
Glamour lies elsewhere, in the lives of
the famous in swankier parts of town,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.800
in activities and jobs
far removed from our own.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.760
Film has an enormous power to glamorize.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.200
It can put in front of our eyes
delightful images, many meters in size,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.440
shot an extraordinary colors,
vivid and immediate.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.080
Because so many films
glamorize the wrong things,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.840
we used to thinking that an element of
alienation and corruption is a generic,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.080
rather than incidental danger of cinema.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.520
But in fact, film is well able
to show us the less obvious,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.840
but real charms of everyday life.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.440
Whereas the worst sort of films
eject us back into our lives,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.640
full of longing and disenchantment,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.320
the best ones leave us ready
to re-engage with circumstances,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.480
with which we had unfairly grown bored.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.520
Cinema can help us love and
appreciate what we already have.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800
It's not entirely our own fault.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.960
The media is to blame for much of it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.040
Because it tells us about categories of
people we want nothing to do with,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.080
places that seem frightening, bizarre,
unremittingly depressing.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.920
We going to think we're not at all
interested in people in Iran or Venezuela.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.440
Our disenchantment make it expressed as
racism, arrogance, or just plain coldness.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.160
Ultimately, what we suffer from is
a denial of our common humanity.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.800
Cinema can perfectly compensated for
this withdrawal of emotional energy,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.680
by showing us the appeal of
people far away,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.920
we'd otherwise be
completely uninterested in.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.080
With the highest artistry,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.720
we're reminded of an obvious
but so easily forgotten fact.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.720
Our membership of the family of humanity.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.959
We've gone so far down
the track of teaching ourselves

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.040
about the importance of
gentleness and compromise.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.200
Many of us have unwittingly develop
problems around courage and self-assertion.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.279
Decent people have learned so well
to suppress their own appetite for a fight,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.640
their own desire for victory.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.120
But in a world where
conflict is unavoidable,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.400
good people sometimes need to strengthen
their willingness to face down opposition,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.760
not always to compromise and play it safe,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.840
but to take risks, to get out and fight,
to relish victory,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.880
and to be a bit more ruthless in the
service of noble and deeply important ends.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.200
Sometimes, it's not enough
just to be right.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.720
You also need to win so some of us
might well benefit from seeing films,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.000
that tell tales of heroism to follow
someone who has to navigate the world,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.680
kill a dragon, outwit some baddies.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.200
The film shouldn’t ideally leave us just
in awe at the daring of another person.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.480
It should do that for most valuable thing.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.320
Educate us by example,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.040
so that we too become just a little more
heroic and brave where we need to be.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.160
Cinema, as we currently know it,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.600
is not a million miles away from
doing wonderful things.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.040
But in order to help with
the real business of living,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.360
we need this hugely compelling
and powerful art form

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.440
to set out in a more determined
and systematic way

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
to offer us the help we really need.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.279
The way we categorize films should
ideally get a little bit more subtle.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.600
Rather than say something was
merely a thriller or comedy,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.320
we'd put the accent on what these genres
might achieve for their audiences.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.440
Instead of suggesting that one needs to be
above a particular age to watch a film,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.880
the government classification board
would see its primary task is

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.280
that of helping a film to reach
the audience it could best help.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.240
Thus a film might be rated A,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.120
meaning that it was regarded as being
particularly good at getting us to

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.280
address and cope with anxiety.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.960
Or it could have an MC rating,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.560
meaning that it was of benefit to
those experiencing marital conflict.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.039
Films can do so much for us.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.200
They better direct
our feelings of sympathy.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.360
They offer comfort for
our unmanageable fears.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.567
They correct an unworkable sense
of what is normal.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.440
They edge us towards good conduct.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.640
They caution, and arm us
against our folly and vices.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.760
We should, as society, be ready to
see them as more than just entertainment.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.600
They are, at their best, guides to life and
pieces of spectacular applied philosophy.
