so people are not getting less news

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240
so people are not getting less news
 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.520
so people are not getting less news
quite the opposite i think i think

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530
quite the opposite i think i think
 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.650
quite the opposite i think i think
they're getting more news i think this

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660
they're getting more news i think this

golden age you get you get you get more
you get it quicker you get it cheaper so

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
you get it quicker you get it cheaper so
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.650
you get it quicker you get it cheaper so
what could be bad and I would argue that

what could be bad and I would argue that
 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.960
what could be bad and I would argue that
for the consumer nothing is bad for the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970
for the consumer nothing is bad for the
