00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.940
In the last video we defined
our random variable x as the

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.710
number of heads we get after
flipping a coin five times,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.690
and it's a fair coin.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.160
And then we figured out the
different probabilities that

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.980
the random variable could
take on different values.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.570
Let me rewrite them all here.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.650
The probability that we
get exactly one head or

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.175
zero heads-- actually,
let's start there.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:23.300
The probability we get zero
heads, and that's the same

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.800
thing as getting five tails--
we figured out was 1 out of 32.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.960
The probability of getting
1 head we figured

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.350
out was 5 over 32.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.540
The probability of getting 2
heads-- probability that our

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.320
random variable is equal
to 2, what was that?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.300
I think it was 10/32.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.250
Yeah, it was 10/32 or 5/16.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.730
10/32 which is equal to 5/16.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.360
The probability that we get
three heads, that was actually

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.830
equal to the same thing, 10/32
which is equal to 5/16 .

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.640
And that made sense because
the probability of getting 3

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.700
heads is the same thing as a
probability of getting 2 tails.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.890
And the probability of getting
2 tails should really be the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.760
same thing as the probability
of getting 2 heads.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.220
And then finally, or almost
finally, the probability that

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.990
we get 4 heads, that was equal
to 5/32, which also makes sense

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.460
because the probability of
getting 4 heads is the same

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.760
thing as the probability
of getting 1 tail, right?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.190
And 1 tail should be the same
thing as 1 head, so that's why

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.430
these numbers are the same.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.810
And then finally, the
probability that we get all 5

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.750
heads, which is the same thing
as getting no tails, is 1/32.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.620
The probability of no tails
is the same thing as the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.060
probability as no heads.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.210
So let's draw this.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.190
Let's draw our probability
distribution.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.610
OK, let me draw the x-axis.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.700
That's not thick enough.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.230
I'll do it a different color.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.130
All right, and just let
me try draw the y-axis.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.130
Almost there.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.310
All right, so what are the
different values that we care

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.500
about for our random variable?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.020
Notice, these are all
discreet values.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.930
They're all particular finite
numbers that we care that our

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.970
random variable can take on.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.680
And that was actually a
function of our definition of

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.100
the random variable, right?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.720
This random variable, number of
heads after 5 flips-- you can't

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.010
have an infinite number
of values here.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.070
Your value can either be 0
through 5, and it can't

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.450
be a non-integer even.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.800
But the important thing to
realize that there's a finite

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.460
number of values that this
random variable can take on and

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.890
that's why we have a discreet
probably distribution.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.520
All right, so the probability
that it takes on-- let me just

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:11.050
draw 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.130
This is for our
random variable, x.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.710
So this is the number
of heads in 5 trials.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.510
Let me draw the
high points first.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.250
So let's see, the high points
are-- they're all right there.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.000
10/32.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.560
That's the probability of 2
and 3 and they're the same.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.260
Let me draw little bar graph.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.520
So 2 and 3; let's just say that
this is 10/32 right there.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.100
I'll draw them the highest
because those are

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.040
the highest values.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.120
2 and 3 both hit 10/32.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.110
Actually, let me draw it
a little differently.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.890
Let me make it so they
touch each other.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.920
So let's say 2 is there,
and then we draw 3.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.295
And 3 is also there.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.330
There you go.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.070
All right, what's the
probability that you get 1?

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.130
That was 5/32, so
that's 1/2 of these.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.280
These two should be
the same height.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.420
So that's 5/32.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.350
Should be like that.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.200
That's the same thing
as getting 4 heads,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.740
so that's like that.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.680
Let's assume that
this 4 is down here.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.510
The probability of
getting either 0 or

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.710
5 is the same thing.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.330
That's 1.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.870
So that's going to be
1/5 of this height.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.650
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.485
Let's say this last
one is for 5.

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:34.690
The drawing is the
hardest part.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.930
That's going to look
something like that.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.470
All right, and so this is for 5
and this is for 4 right here.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.150
And this right here
is 10/32 or 5/16.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.870
This is 5/32.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.820
And this right here is 1/32.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.850
What I have just drawn is
a binomial probability

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.710
distribution.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.010
It's a particular
instance of the binomial

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.420
probability distribution.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.180
And actually, as you get to
kind of an infinite number of

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.210
values, and once we get to the
continuous, this'll approach

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.510
the famous bell curve that
you hear about where

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.580
things actually start
looking like a bell.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.260
Or it'll start
looking like that.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.500
And we'll do some-- maybe I'll
get Excel out and I'll do it

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.090
where I start saying-- instead
of saying, the number

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.470
of heads in 5 trials.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.040
If I did this as the number of
heads in 5 million trials,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.630
these bars would get very, very
close together and you'd start

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.500
seeing them approach this thing
that looks like a bell curve.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.800
And this is a very
important distribution.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.600
One, because it actually
describes a lot of

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.820
random processes.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.610
But it's actually very
important to statistics

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.190
generally because a lot of
times in statistics you don't

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.630
know the underlying mechanism
that's generating your results

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.470
and you just assume that
there's just a bunch of

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.270
random stuff going on.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.340
You just add up a bunch
of random events.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.440
When you're adding up random
events that's like counting

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.550
the number of heads.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.470
So you assume that a lot
of things have-- well,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.900
in the discreet case, a
binomial distribution.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.920
And then, in a few videos
from now I'll show you the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.350
continuous cases, which is
the normal distribution.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.430
And this is really important
to realize because sometimes

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.550
people make that assumption
about certain things and the

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.960
biggest one-- and this is
probably the most negative

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.540
repercussions, especially in
this type of financial

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.940
environment.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.160
Well, they'll assume that some
process has a binomial or a

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.220
normal distribution where
it really doesn't.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.140
Because if you assume that
something has a distribution

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.340
like this you start saying,
oh, well the probabilities at

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.745
these ends are really low.

00:06:39.745 --> 00:06:42.810
But what if the distribution
is something like this?

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.920
And I'll do more work on this.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.340
I don't want to get too
advanced too fast.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.360
But the general idea, it's
really important to understand

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.520
the assumption you're making
when someone says, oh, we

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.680
assume it's a normal
distribution.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.970
We assume it's a
binomial distribution.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.650
But with that said, that's
a little bit of a nugget

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.360
of why this is important
going into the future.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.820
But just to kind of review
a little more what we've

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.270
already studied, let's
think about this.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.940
Why is this called a
binomial distribution?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.820
Well, if you think about it,
when you flipped 5 coins or

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.320
when you had 5 flips of the
same coin-- each arrangement,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.075
I'll pick an arbitrary
arrangement of heads and tails.

00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:22.530
Each circumstance of heads and
tails, I guess I could call it.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.290
You know, that's one
of them, 5 flips.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.480
Each of these have exactly
a 1 in 32 probability.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.710
In fact, there's exactly
32 ways I can draw some

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.800
combination of heads
and tails here.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.580
So each of those have a
1 in 32 probability.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.840
And what we essentially did in
the last video when we said,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.650
OK, what was the probability
of getting exactly two heads?

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.290
We essentially said, OK, how
many of these circumstances, or

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.810
how many of these-- I guess we
could call it-- how many of

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.130
these permutations had 2 heads?

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.600
And we counted them up and we
said, 10 of them have 2 heads

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.010
and that's why the probability
was 10 out of 32.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.630
And the way we figured
that out is for example,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.760
if we said, 2 heads.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.920
We said, OK, 1 of 5 flips could
be the first head, and then 1

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.910
of 4 flips could be
the second head.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.440
And then we don't care about
order, so we don't care if flip

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.770
1 was a first head and flip two
was a second head or was

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.510
the other way around.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.380
So we divide by 2, and we
said that this was the

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.900
same thing as 5 factorial.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.570
Actually, let me do
it color coded.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:31.130
This part is the same thing as
5 factorial over 3 factorial.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.520
And then, that's actually the
same thing as 2 factorial

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.290
because 2 factorial
is 2 times 1.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.890
So in general, let
me write this down.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.540
The probability that x
equaled n-- and this is

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.820
for the x that I defined.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.130
The random variable, the number
of heads I get in 5 flips of

00:08:50.130 --> 00:09:02.100
the coin-- it was equal to 5
factorial divided

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.430
by n factorial.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.050
In this case it was 2, 2 was n.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.730
We said was the probability
that we get exactly 2 heads.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.430
Times 5 minus 2 factorial.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.990
And I encourage you to review
because it really is important

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.400
to get an intuitive
feel of this.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.890
I encourage you to review
the videos I made in the

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:31.680
probability playlist on
binomial coefficients, and on

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.720
this flipping of coins type of
probability problems because I

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.140
go a little more in detail in
the actual intuition of this.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.580
But if you watch those or if
you have a little bit of

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.490
experience with this, you
would recognize that this is

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.980
the binomial coefficient.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.340
And actually, I even have a
video why it's called the

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.830
binomial because these
coefficients show up when you

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.380
actually multiply binomials.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.600
Binomials are just things like
if I just have x plus why and I

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.450
start multiplying it by itself,
take it to different powers,

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.380
the coefficients of these tend
to be-- well, they are

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.080
the same as these.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.270
And I give you a whole
video on why that-- well,

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.420
that's why that works.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.180
And so this is why
it's even called the

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.990
binomial coefficient.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.210
And why this is called the
binomial distribution.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.060
But another way of writing
this, the shorthand

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.250
is 5 choose n.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.340
And they say that because
what were we doing?

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.810
We said we had 5 flips and
we were choosing 2 of

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.510
the flips to be heads.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.830
Or, in this case, we have 5
flips and we're choosing n

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.870
of the flips to be heads.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.110
So this will tell you how many
of the different permutations

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.820
satisfy our condition.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.570
And then we say, well,
what's the probability

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.230
of each of those?

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.020
It's times 1 out of 32.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.340
So this is why it's called
a binomial distribution.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.790
Each of the values of
probabilities for each of the

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.720
random variable values-- you
can figure them out by using

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.200
your binomial coefficients.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.420
Anyway, I just realized
I'm out of time again.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.340
And don't worry, I'm going to
do a couple of more examples

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.690
with this because I really want
you to get the hang of the

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.330
binomial distribution before we
move into the normal

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:01.980
distribution.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.631
See you soon.
