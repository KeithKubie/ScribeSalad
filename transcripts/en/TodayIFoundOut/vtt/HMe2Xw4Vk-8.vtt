00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:16.600
Parkinson’s disease 
is a movement disorder characterized by tremors

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.110
or shaking, with this particular symptom of
the progressive disease resulting from dopamine

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.949
generating cell death in a part of the substantia
nigra region of the brain . The disease was

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.730
named after James Parkinson, a doctor, who
wrote about it in 1817 in his 66-page paper,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.710
An Essay on the Shaking Palsy.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.500
While his essay was important in the study
of the disease, it had been around for a very

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.750
long time, with recorded instances of it going
back pretty much as long as humans have been

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.360
writing things down.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.899
Parkinson had urged other doctors to get involved
in researching the disease in order to find

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.460
a cure, but his paper didn’t really start
to make its rounds until 1861.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.650
That was when Jean Martin Charcot, a French
neurologist, separated the disease from other

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.059
neurological disorders and named it “Parkinson’s
disease.”

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.449
James Parkinson himself led a rather interesting
life full of varied pursuits.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.119
He was born in 1755 and was steered toward
a medical career early on by his father, who

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.119
was a surgeon.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.789
It is believed that he studied at the London
Hospital Medical College and earned a diploma

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.799
from the Royal College of Surgeons.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.880
He started working in his father’s practice
and later took over when his father died in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880
1794.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.399
However, although his work in medicine was
what led to Parkinson being remembered today,

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.639
it was not his only area of interest.

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:32.829
He was also interested in chemistry, palaeontology,
geology, politics and social reform.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.490
He published radical political pamphlets under
the name “Old Hubert” and was a strong

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.859
critic of Prime Minister William Pitt’s
government, which he thought wasn’t doing

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.399
enough for the under-privileged people in
the country.

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.849
Given his political ideals and frustration
with the government, it might not be surprising

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.359
to learn that Parkinson is thought to have
been involved in the “Popgun Plot.”

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.419
He had joined a secret society called the
London Corresponding Society for Reform of

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:57.899
Parliamentary Representation.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.880
As the name suggests, the members of the society
advocated for better representation of the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.289
people in parliament, and also didn’t live
in a world where acronyms were a thing.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.000
(Previous to the mid-20th century, while abbreviations
were prevalent in text, pronouncing them as

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.170
words was not something people did.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.269
In fact, according to linguist David Wilton,
“There is only one known pre-twentieth-century

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.900
[English] word with an acronymic origin and
it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.129
The word is “colinderies” or “colinda”,
an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.830
held in London in that year.”)

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.349
In any event, five members of the society,
including Parkinson, were implicated in the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.620
plot to use an air-gun to shoot a poisoned
dart at King George III at a theatre.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.890
As an assassination plan, it doesn’t appear
to have been a very well-thought out one—so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.550
many things could have gone wrong.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.230
However, they never got a chance to find out
if it would have worked or not.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.550
The men were arrested before the attempt could
be carried out.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.060
The others involved in the plot included John
Smith, a bookseller; George Higgins, a chemist;

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.970
and Paul Thomas Le Maitre and Thomas Upton
(no relation ;)), watchmakers.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.560
All of them were taken in for questioning
by the Privy Council and spent some time in

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.560
jail.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.019
However, there wasn’t a lot of direct evidence
of their plan and the charges against Parkinson

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.920
and the others were eventually dropped.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.769
All that said, some historians believe that
the plot may not have existed at all.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.390
Instead, they posit that the government had
circulated a rumour about it in order to have

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.349
an excuse to put restrictions on anti-government
organizations.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.310
Pitt had already passed into law the Treasonous
and Seditious Practices Act and the Seditious

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.360
Meetings Act.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.319
The Two Acts, as they became known, basically
boiled down to “saying anything against

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.400
the government is now treason.”

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.430
The London Corresponding Society in particular
spoke out against these acts, believing they

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.010
infringed on their right to protest the government,
which may be why Parkinson and the others

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.010
were targeted.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.120
While the Privy Council did not have any direct
evidence against Parkinson for his involvement

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.760
in the plot, through questioning about his
activities with the London Corresponding Society

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.170
they were able to learn about his radical
political writings under the name “Old Hubert.”

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.109
After this incident, the number of articles
by Old Hubert dropped off dramatically, and

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.239
Parkinson turned more and more toward writing
essays about medicine and, later, nature and

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:04.999
geology
