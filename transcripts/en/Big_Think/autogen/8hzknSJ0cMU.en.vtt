00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.410
We decided to install SportsVU cameras because
they gave really enhanced data but they were

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.380
being installed individually by certain select
teams.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.360
And we thought that it should be available
to the league as a whole.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.789
Those teams weren’t that happy about it
but the tradeoff was they now got the data

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.910
as all teams did from 29 arenas rather than
from just the few that had it.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.480
And that has worked out very well for us.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.050
If you want to have four trillion facts you
can go to NBA.com/stats and the SAP HANA program

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.899
will give you all of those statistics.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.970
You’ve got the SportsVU statistics.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.190
You’ve got a high speed arena network that
brings the video back from every arena for

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.190
replay.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.971
But once it’s there for replay it can be
diced and chopped and sent out, Tweeted, you

00:00:57.971 --> 00:00:59.940
name it.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.150
So we’re, you know, the age of analytics
is upon us and we wanted to be ahead of it.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.330
And that’s like an example of things being
available to us that weren’t available before.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.250
Pre SportsVU – a decade ago we were primitive
compared to where we are now and I think in

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.710
another decade we’ll look back and see how
primitive we are now but we’re so much further

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.659
advanced because I’ve been wearing my venture
capital hat.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.560
I’ve been looking at some applications in
sports.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.570
It’s amazing and it’s like not amazing.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.829
You know and you can stop the camera and look.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.270
At this moment that player in that position
if he shoots he’s a 60 percent shooter.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.670
If he moves three feet to his right or his
left or down court he becomes a 40 percent

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.670
shooter.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.750
You know the ability to know so much about
your team and every other team and about every

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.620
player current and future is very much going
to make big data a much more relevant player

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.060
in all sports and including the NBA.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.969
It’s currently at the stage where every
team has two or three or four or five or six

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.620
people dealing with data.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.879
In some cases in the last couple of years
they didn’t know what to do with it.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:43.110
And in many cases the coaches will say well
it’s, you know, it’s good to have but

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.549
you’ve got to have your instincts as well.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.550
I think ultimately it’s going to affect
the substitutional patterns.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.459
There’s going to be a coach, assistant coach
on the bench that’s going to be looking

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.799
at the video of the game, everything else.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.840
And you’re going to know exactly – at
the end of the game your opposing team is

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.239
going to go to this player 82 percent of the
time for that shot, let’s defend him.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.150
And in some ways the coach has to understand
and will and they do understand because they’re

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.209
smart and they’re adaptive.

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.040
It’s one thing to say player X shoots 50
percent but if he shoots 60 percent from the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.389
left and 40 percent from the right you better
get him the ball on the left.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.699
And you don’t know that unless you use the
data to tell you that.
