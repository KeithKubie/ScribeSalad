00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.830
So we have our object diagram started,
and

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.950
right now these objects
are just floating around.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580
We haven't really talked about
how they might be interconnected.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.220
So let's add some connections, or if
we're going to use the more formal term,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.590
we'll say let's add some relationships.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.400
Relationships that we're going to add
are going to be ones that we've borrowed

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.530
from UML.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.180
Those are the contains relationship, and
the kind of, or kind of relationship.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.230
And these are also known by other names,
for

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.060
instance contains might
be known as part of,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.689
kind of might also be known as a type
of, and there's other variations too.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.220
So what do these mean?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.640
Let's start with
the contains relationship.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.610
Like it sounds, a contains relationship
is representative of when an object

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.960
contains another object.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.790
If we think about the world object, it
contains a robot, it contains an alien.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.550
There's a background.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.800
It also has a dialogue bubble and
the badge here,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.240
but we're going to leave those out for
now.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.920
So in our diagram, let's create some
relationships between the world and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.580
the robot, the alien,
and the background.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.370
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.810
move some things around just
to make some extra space.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.730
And to represent
the contains relationship,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.450
we'll draw arrows from the world object
to the objects that it contains, and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.070
label them as contains relationships.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.310
Pay close attention to
the direction of the arrows.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.930
For these relationships, it's
pointing from the world to the robot,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.480
to the alien, and to the background.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.380
And the reason that it points in
this direction is it allows us to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.980
read the relationship by
just following the arrow.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.580
Now we could also say
that the app contains

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.480
each of the objects in this diagram,
but if I'm going to add an arrow for

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.630
every single object in our diagram,
it could get a little hard to follow.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.940
To keep our diagram simple we just
want to add the contains relationships

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.600
from the app to the most
high level objects.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.500
By high level, I mean objects that are
bigger in the sense that they have more

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.380
complexity about them.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.640
For instance, the world object is at
a higher level than the alien object

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.520
in a sense that it probably has more
functionality contained within it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.730
Another way to think about it is that
the world probably plays a bigger role

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.620
as part of the app than the alien does.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.850
In general you want to keep this going
from the most high level object,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.940
like in this case the Alien Adventure,
to the lower level objects.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.000
So, for instance,
an Alien Adventure contains a world,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.770
a world contains a robot,
robot can contain a badge, and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.100
we can add a relationship for
that later.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.025
Now, the distinctions that
we're making here and

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:35.030
these relationships that we're adding,
again they're completely up to you.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.340
Where I'm using a contains relationship
between the world and the alien,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.410
you might use something else, or might
not even have a relationship at all or

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.070
where I'm labeling this as a contains
relationship I might not even have that.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.417
I might even remove alien adventure
because the world is kind of the most

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:54.670
[INAUDIBLE] object.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.170
By the title here we know that we're
talking about the alien adventure app.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.020
But again,
it's just personal preference.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.140
You can do whatever you want to.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.100
So moving on,
let's talk about the other relationship.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.220
The kind of relationship.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.890
This is one of my favorites.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.210
It used to describe objects
that have similarities and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.450
it also involves a little
bit of abstract thinking.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.690
For instance, let's think
about the alien and the robot.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.740
They’re actually pretty similar.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.920
The robot and the alien can animate.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.140
We saw that the robot could move
across the screen and the alien's

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.030
animating right now and they’re
both able to speak to each other,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.180
so in a sense they’re a little
bit like actors in a play.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.680
Now this is the abstract part.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.140
The aliens and
the robot are like actors in a play.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.760
Then why not add an object to our
diagram that represents an actor.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.080
I mean that sounds pretty good to me.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.330
An actor is an object
that can be animated and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.300
participates in discussions.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.450
And just like we said, both the alien
and the robot are kinds of actors.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.970
And that's how we'll add
this kind of relationship.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.890
We'll start by adding
an actor to the diagram.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.970
And then we'll add relationships
from the alien to the actor.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.730
Because an alien is a kind of actor and

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.760
from the robot to the actor because
the robot is a kind of actor.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.880
And I hope you've noticed that for

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.140
these kind of relationships,
the direction of the arrows again.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.290
We're going from the alien to the actor,
so it reads very naturally and

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.760
alien is a kind of actor.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.970
And we can take this one step further.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.740
We can simplify our diagram and
say that the world contains actors,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.260
and then get rid of the arrows that we
have from the world to the robot, and

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.260
from the world to the alien.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.430
So I'll give you just
a second to let that soak in.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.060
The world contains actors, and
the actors can be robots or aliens.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.850
And the world also
contains a background, or

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.900
that's what we have so far.
