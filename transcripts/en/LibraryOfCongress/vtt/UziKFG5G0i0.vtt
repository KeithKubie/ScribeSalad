&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
I'm Jennifer Cutting,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.150
Folklife Specialist at the
American Folklife Center.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.760
It's September 20th, 2018

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.620
and we are here a few hours
before our big concert tonight,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.170
which is the American Folklife
Center's Homegrown series

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.220
special Archive challenge
sampler concert that's happening

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.480
tonight at 7:30 in the
Coolidge Auditorium and one

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.240
of the artists we have with
us is Elena &amp; Los Fulanos.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.910
Elena Lacayo is with
us here in the studio

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.980
for just a short
little interview.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.280
How are you doing Elena?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.580
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: I'm great.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.880
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Your
sound check sounded great.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.180
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Thank you.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.480
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Looking
forward to hearing you guys.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.790
I guess the first
question I want to ask you,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.110
you're the only Spanish
language performers we have

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.650
in tonight's lineup.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.300
Where did you grow up and
when did you start singing

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.600
and playing?

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.040
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: So I was
born in the U.S. I was born

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.930
in New Orleans, but my
parents had just gotten here,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.760
it was the '80s and Nicaragua
was going through a Civil War,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.520
which is where my
parents are from.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.930
And in '92 when the -- well,
the war ended kind of in '90,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.040
most of the conflict and
in '92 we moved back.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.900
So I was about eight years old
and we moved back to Nicaragua

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900
and lived there from
eight to 18.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.510
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Where in Nicaragua?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.810
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: In Managua.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.110
My family is from Leon mostly

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.160
but we spent the
time in Managua.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.650
And I started -- I've
always kind of played music,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.850
I've kind of dabbled in it.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.060
I don't have any
official training really.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.000
I took a weird path
to music in the sense

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.700
that I never really
liked lessons.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.740
I really didn't -- I felt
like they ruined music for me

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.390
for better or worse and so I
never was trained formally,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.050
I just kind of like
learned on the side.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.100
Kind of in secret actually
because I didn't want people

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.260
to know that I played and
then have me play for them.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.560
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Ah.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.620
Did you have anyone who kind
of showed you a few chords?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.920
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.540
My dad showed me some mariachi
stuff, you know, taught me how

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.260
to play like, "Happy
Birthday" and then he wanted me

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.320
to learn all this mariachi
stuff, which I wasn't interested

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.820
in at the time and
then I had, you know,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.480
my friends from high
school or in middle school

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.660
that were playing like
Nirvana and stuff.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.120
So that was my start and then I
started writing music probably

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.450
at the end of high
school with a friend.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.150
But I had very few songs
until I was maybe 22.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970
I had already graduated college

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.140
and then I started writing
more songs in D.C. actually,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.140
when I had moved here, and then
I just, you know, I kept playing

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.570
and people kept supporting
it so then I formed my band

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.170
and we've been together
for about six years now.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.610
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Is it a staple lineup?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.480
Has it been the same
lineup for all six years?

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.780
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo:
Well, it's D.C. so no.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.080
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Right.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.440
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Well, at first
I started playing actually

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.420
with some of my buddies who
were in the punk scene here.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.940
So that's kind of
more where we --

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.230
you know, that was kind of
these scene that I knew.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.230
There's not a ton of -- I
mean there's a growing --

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.850
a small but growing
scene of Latino musicians

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.150
that make their own music.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.770
I mean there's plenty
of musicians that kind

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.780
of reinterpret other people's
music and in traditional styles.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.000
But in terms of writing original
music I think we might be,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.940
I mean among just a few
bands, and so but Danny,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.900
Danny who is playing with
us tonight, Danny Herrera,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.410
he's an original member.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.710
He started playing with
me a long time ago, 2011.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.290
And he grew up in
L.A. in Pacoima,

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.260
California where Ritchie
Valens was from, and he grew up

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.870
and totally immersed in mariachi
and son jarocho culture.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.140
And so actually we're going
to have the opportunity

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.180
to showcase some of
his talents in that,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.150
which we haven't been able
to do as a band before.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.450
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
That's great.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.580
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: So he's
going to do Zapateale today

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.390
with the tarima, which is a
wooden stage where people kind

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.700
of stomp and it's a percussive
instrument in son jarocho.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.170
And actually, funny enough,
he's going to be doing a rhythm

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.380
that men don't typically do

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.210
because the rhythm we're doing
is more like a [inaudible],

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.020
there's kind of different
words that are associated

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.630
with the rhythmic styles
and so on, jarocho.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.810
And that's typically a women's
dance and so he's been trying

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.860
to learn it in time for
it and we were like,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.070
That's cool we're
bringing, you know,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.730
breaking stereotypes
it's fine so.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.900
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And you're
known for social justice,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.890
music on social justice themes.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.190
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo:
Yeah absolutely.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.960
Yeah, that's one of
the things that we do.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.870
I mean when I first moved
to D.C. I cam to work

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.170
on social justice issues.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.670
First I worked for the Nuns
that are now known as Nuns

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.500
on the Bus network and then I
fell into working on immigration

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.130
and immigration reform.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.570
And I did that for
a number of years

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.020
until I stopped to pursue music.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.770
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
you pay a lot of benefits.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.520
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Yeah we play
a lot of benefits and a lot

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.030
of our songs are, you know,
social justice themed.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.590
So you know, we wrote a
song about immigration

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.170
and we have kind of
like a movement song

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.070
for recent political
events and stuff like that.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.820
And I've been very
involved in and you know,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.670
this is actually
one of the songs

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.940
that we're playing is
a bilingual version

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.150
of This Land is Your Land
and part of the reason

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.830
that we selected it is because
I've actually been playing it a

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.870
lot when I go I often get
asked to play at rallies

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.580
or different actions here
in D.C. The biggest ones

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.960
that I played were
against the Muslim ban,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.360
the so called Muslim ban
when that was going on.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.990
And one of the songs that I
found to be really resonate all

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.430
of the audience is "This
Land is your Land",

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.060
which is fundamentally
a social justice song.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.120
When it was originally
written Woody Guthrie wrote it

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.430
because he was a
migrant himself.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.270
Internally he was
originally from Oklahoma,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.940
moved to California and
apparently faced a lot

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.380
of discrimination for that and
so he wrote this song to show

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.440
that this country is
actually a welcoming place.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.530
And so I think that
it's really --

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.830
the reason it resonates is

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.830
because that sentiment is felt
again and again, unfortunately,

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.640
but also the sentiment that
we want to push back on kind

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:58.070
of like xenophobia, or you
know, unwelcoming sentiments.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.340
And so it was one of the songs

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.050
that when we were doing all
those actions I thought people

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.810
most resonated with.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.680
And So I really loved the --

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.380
so I'm doing a kind
of a combination,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.570
Zonas de Mexico version, which
is a group that I actually saw.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.260
I actually saw them
for that concert.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.870
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: For
that concert they were here.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.790
Zonas de Mexico ensemble
played here

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:25.880
for Hispanic American heritage
month in September of 2015

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.480
and during the concert they
did Esta Tierra Es Tuya.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.780
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Yes.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
also this song appears

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:39.180
in a much earlier form in our
collections in a manuscript

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.740
in a little mimeographed
bunch of papers,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.350
which is called Woody
Guthrie's Ten Songs.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.080
And it's in the Woody
Guthrie manuscript portion

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.180
of the Alan Lomax collection.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.480
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Cool.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.780
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: So
you're actually doing a song

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.390
that appears probably more times
in our collection that that

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.910
but we have it in manuscript
and then we have the recording

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.690
of "Zonas de Mexico" doing it.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.720
So it's kind of a double whammy.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.390
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Yeah, and
that's why I love the song.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.220
I mean it just resonates.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.520
Everybody knows it.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.820
Everybody feels good about it.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.630
But a lot of people
don't know about the kind

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.290
of the justice background
that the song has.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.170
I don't remember exactly how it
goes in English but, you know,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.320
the general translation of the
-- I know it more in Spanish

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.550
but there's one verse that says,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.740
"When I came upon a big wall
there was a sign there it said

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.140
'No Trespassing' but on
the other side it didn't

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.440
say nothing."

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.250
And Zonas De Mexico does
it and they kind of make it

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.940
about the border, which
is what I really like.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
They restore that verse.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.180
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Right, they
bring it back and we're going

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.890
to do that verse today as well.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.520
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: So one
of the songs that you chose

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:56.030
from our collections you kind
of all ready knew and that made

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.660
that in a way easier to put
the work in on some other songs

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.630
that you didn't all ready know.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.030
So the two other songs
that you chose, one was --

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.980
I remember looking
at the catalog card

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.300
as you were listening to it,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.100
"El Presidente Wilson
me puso in Ordenanza."

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.400
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Yeah.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.700
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
I remember you saying,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.120
"Well I kind of like this one."

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.010
What about that song
sparkled at you?

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.320
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: I just thought
like, what is this about?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.350
This is a song to an
American president in Spanish.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.850
You know, I thought
that was, you know,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.010
it had to have an
interesting story.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.970
And so as you indicated
it's a really old archive.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:43.380
It's from 1934 and
it's basically

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:49.190
about the Tejano
experience of going through

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:55.270
and getting recruited to
be in the draft and a lot

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.840
of people deciding that going
to Mexico is a better idea

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.040
than going into the draft.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.340
And so --

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.320
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
this recording is from John

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.420
and Alan Lomax recording
in Cotulla, Texas.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.930
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Oh
is that where it is?

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.410
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: In 1934

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.920
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: I couldn't -- I
was trying to look up the place

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.810
and I couldn't figure it out.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.110
Cotulla.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.410
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
it was the man who sang

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.440
in our field recording was Jose
Vallo and he played the guitar.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.040
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Now
what did you do with it?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.330
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Well the guitar
part is kind of a Cumbia rhythm

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.190
and so we're like,
"Let's just dress this up

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.910
and make this a full Cumbia."

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.140
And so you know the
base them "boom, boom,

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.440
boom, boom, boom" you know?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.690
And we put it in a key
where I could sing it.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.690
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Of course.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.780
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: And we
put some fiddle licks in it

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.410
and we just kind
of built the song

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.710
and it was actually
really fun to do.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.390
So it was a really
cool experience for us

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.200
but we still stayed true to
like the, you know all the words

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.920
that -- well, I mostly
understood all the words.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.480
There was a couple that I was
like, "Well just put this word

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.920
in here because it makes sense."

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.200
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: But that's
the same thing that happens

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.140
if you hear a song
that someone sings

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.510
and you don't understand
the words.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.810
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.110
And that's how songs
evolve of course.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.410
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Right.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.710
&gt;&gt; So it was really
cool to bring

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.230
to a song from, you
know, 1934 back.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.530
You know?

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.830
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Yeah.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.130
And you were saying that
you probably not a lot

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.430
of people had heard it, right?

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.030
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: No, in fact
nobody has translated it before

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.330
you did.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.630
And you've made a translation

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.660
for us that's now
going into our files.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.220
So see you're going to live
in the archive forever.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.520
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Fancy.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.820
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Not only
with your performance tonight,

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.130
with your translation

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.500
of "El Presidente Wilson
me puso in Ordenanza."

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.820
Which means?

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.390
&gt;&gt; President Wilson, I
guess he drafted me --

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.860
he put an order out --
he sent me an order.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.160
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: OK.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.460
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo:
He's drafting me.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.760
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
And the next song

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.350
that you have chosen
to do, "Cenzontle"?

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.700
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo:
Yeah, Cenzontle.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.770
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: That was in
our collections as a performance

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.210
from the Home Grown
Concert Series performed

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.490
by Los Angeles Chicano
band [inaudible].

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.090
And they also were here

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.720
for Hispanic American
Heritage month.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.680
But they were here in 2011.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.820
And so tell me what about
that song attracted you

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.950
and then what you did with it?

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.250
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Woo.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.300
Yeah, well that song
is really cool.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.750
I mean [inaudible] is a group

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.870
that I have actually been
interested in for a long time

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.780
but I've actually not put any
effort or time into listening.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.590
I've always -- you know, when
you have the list of groups

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.930
that you want to listen to and
they definitely were up there

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.730
and I definitely --
when I started --

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.550
I decided kind of that
I wanted to do a song

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.690
from [inaudible] partly
because they had the same kind

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.990
of instrumental lineup.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.920
And also because thematically
they do a lot of similar things

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.220
than what our band is --

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.140
you know, they're very justice
oriented and they're based

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.220
in Son Jarocho, which is a
rhythmic pattern that I'm not

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.520
that familiar with
but I was like,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.290
I'm willing to grow in this way.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.470
And so Danny being the kind of
the person that knew the most

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:06.140
about the style of music taught
me the strumming pattern,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.310
which I'm doing my
best to do on guitar

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.220
and we basically are
going to do it similar

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.150
to how they're doing
it in the recordings,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.060
which it's a complicated song.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.660
It's not the easiest song
in the world to learn

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.370
but I was really excited
about the challenge

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.070
and the band was at well.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Is that one
that you did during sound check?

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.540
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Yeah,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.840
that's the first one we
did during sound check.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.140
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Yeah,
oh that sounds great.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.440
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo:
Yeah, thank you.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.040
And so Danny as I mentioned,
Danny is going to be dancing

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.730
on the tarima for that
part and that's going

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.750
to be really exciting
portion for that.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.450
So we're all kind of
pushing ourselves in a way.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.720
You know, this has been a really
great project for our band

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.230
because we don't tend
to do a lot of covers.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.680
We don't tend to interpret
a lot of people's music.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.710
That's more, you know, Danny
is definitely he has another

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.310
project where that's the
majority of what he does.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.060
I'm more of a song writer that
tries to interpret my own stuff.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.620
And so having the challenge
of like not only kind

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.960
of academically going into
archives and finding stuff

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.480
but also interpreting things

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.630
that I didn't right has
been really interesting

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.600
and a cool way to
grow as an artist.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.570
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Well that's
why it's called a challenge.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.120
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Yeah, it
definitely was a challenge.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.430
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
you've stepped up to the plate.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.730
You've stepped up to the plate.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.300
I'm really looking forward
to hearing the full versions

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.370
of all of these songs.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.890
I want to thank Elena
Lacayo for being with us

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.490
at the Library of
Congress tonight.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.790
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo: Thank you.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.090
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: For
the Archive Challenge

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.390
Sampler Concert.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.690
&gt;&gt; Elena Lacayo:
Yeah, thank you.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.990
Thanks for having me.
