00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:01.578
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.578 --> 00:00:03.738
is a bunch of examples to show us that

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:05.503
a lot of the properties
we've been dealing with

00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:07.243
in arithmetic, the distributive property,

00:00:07.243 --> 00:00:09.427
associative property,
commutative property,

00:00:09.427 --> 00:00:11.772
that these apply just as
well to negative numbers.

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:14.117
But with that said, it is
good to actually see it used

00:00:14.117 --> 00:00:15.975
using negative numbers,

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.461
or see these properties applied

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.851
just to make sure that we
understand what's going on.

00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:23.544
So these exercises, these
are all from Kahn Academy.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:24.310
Oops.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.750
So this first one says,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.561
which of the following
expressions are equivalent

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.696
to negative two times the
quantity five minus three?

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.041
Now you could, of course, just figure out

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.968
that five minus three is two and then

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.617
multiply that times negative two

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:38.010
and you would get negative four.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.191
And you could see which of
these is equal to negative four.

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.373
And that would be fair, but
the whole point of this video

00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:45.323
is to understand that
look, maybe I could apply

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:47.344
the distributive property here.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:48.853
So let's do that.

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:51.407
So what I could do is I could
distribute this negative two.

00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:53.658
I could multiply it times five

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:56.005
and then I could multiply it by,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.442
I could either do it as it's going to be

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:01.368
negative two times five plus

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:03.248
negative two times negative three.

00:01:03.248 --> 00:01:05.083
Or you could view it as
negative two times five

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:07.845
minus negative two times positive three.

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:09.727
Now let me write those two things down.

00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:12.577
So you could do this as negative two

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:14.544
times five,

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.239
negative two times five

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:19.160
plus

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:24.976
negative plus negative
two times negative three.

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:28.329
You could view it that way.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.475
Or you could view it as negative two,

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.326
negative two times five

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.418
minus

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:37.718
minus

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:38.948
and if I'm putting a minus here

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:40.643
then I'm gonna view this
as a positive three,

00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:42.594
that we're subtracting a positive three.

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:43.515
So minus

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.396
negative two times positive three.

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:48.230
Notice I either wrote the negative here

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.160
and wrote a positive here,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.436
or I wrote the negative here
and made this a positive three.

00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:52.666
But these are going to be equivalent.

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.035
Either way I've distributed
this negative two.

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:56.358
Notice I have a negative two,

00:01:56.358 --> 00:01:57.635
negative two.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.679
And what are these going to be equal to?

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.368
Well, negative two times
five is negative 10

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:06.110
and then,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.106
and then negative two times negative three

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:10.661
is positive six,

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.053
or over here negative two
times three is negative six,

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:16.279
but then we subtract it so
it's just gonna get positive,

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.039
you're gonna get positive six either way.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.493
This right over here is positive six

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:23.368
and this over here,
subtracting a negative six

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:25.644
would give you positive six.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.757
So you get negative ten plus six.

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:30.194
And that's this choice right over here.

00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:32.215
Which of course does
evaluate to negative four,

00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:34.930
which this expression does evaluate to.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.392
This one up here evaluates to negative 16.

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:40.341
And of course I won't select
this because I found an answer.

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.774
Let's do several more.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.956
Which of the following
expressions are equivalent

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:49.344
to negative S times T times S?

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:51.619
Select all that apply.

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.500
And here we can't just substitute,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.964
we can't just evaluate it and see,

00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:57.007
oh what do these evaluate to.

00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:58.887
We need to do a little bit of manipulation

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.768
of these variables.

00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:02.718
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:02.718 --> 00:03:04.879
One, we could change the order in which

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.643
we multiply these things.

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:08.710
So we could view this as

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.984
negative S, that's that,

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:14.142
let me write it a little bit neater.

00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:15.783
We could view it as

00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:21.166
negative S times S,

00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:25.502
times S times T.

00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:29.010
Times, oops, let me do
that in a different color,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.719
times S times T.

00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:33.857
Times T.

00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:36.319
And do any of the choices look like that?

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.728
Well almost.

00:03:37.728 --> 00:03:39.377
Instead of saying negative S times S,

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:41.374
this says S times negative S.

00:03:41.374 --> 00:03:43.348
And because multiplication, once again,

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.113
I'm not a big fan of using the word

00:03:45.113 --> 00:03:46.135
because it sounds complicated,

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:47.806
but it's commutative.

00:03:47.806 --> 00:03:50.638
A times B is the same thing as B times A.

00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:52.798
So I can rewrite this as,

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:53.791
I can rewrite this,

00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.598
I can swap these two and write this as

00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:57.472
S times,

00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:02.367
S times negative S times T,

00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:04.781
times T.

00:04:05.757 --> 00:04:07.268
Times T.

00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:09.937
All I did is I swapped these two.

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:12.724
This negative S and this S.

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:14.164
I just swapped them and I got exactly

00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:15.690
what I have right over here.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.244
Now let's just make sure
that this one does not apply

00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:21.612
and maybe the easiest way
is to try to simplify this.

00:04:21.612 --> 00:04:22.889
And the best way I could think about that

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.071
is by distributing this S.

00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:26.969
So if I distribute this S,

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:28.899
what I'm going to get,

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.385
this is going to be equal to

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:34.216
S times T, which is ST.

00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:35.948
Or I could even, I can write it like this.

00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:38.503
I could write it S times T, like that.

00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:41.428
And then I have minus S times S,

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:44.609
so minus S times S.

00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:46.832
I could write it that was
or I could write minus

00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:49.202
S squared if I want to.

00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:50.897
That's the same thing as S times S.

00:04:50.897 --> 00:04:52.383
But this is very different.

00:04:52.383 --> 00:04:53.706
This is very different.

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:56.168
Here I'm just taking the
product of three variables here,

00:04:56.168 --> 00:04:57.747
I have two different terms,

00:04:57.747 --> 00:04:59.836
taking the product of two variables here

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:01.182
and then the product I guess you could say

00:05:01.182 --> 00:05:03.203
I'm taking S squared or
I'm taking S times S.

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:04.341
So this is not,

00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:06.568
this is not the same thing.

00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:09.495
Which of the following
expressions are equal

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:12.025
to negative X times,
and then in parentheses

00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:13.535
negative Y times X?

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:15.602
And I forgot to mention
it, but like always,

00:05:15.602 --> 00:05:17.621
pause the video, try to
work them out by yourself

00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:19.155
before I do them.

00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:21.282
Alright, select all that apply.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.234
So let's just try to
manipulate this a little bit.

00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:27.113
So once again, multiplication,
it's associative.

00:05:27.113 --> 00:05:30.374
I could, so it's negative X times,

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.693
times negative Y

00:05:32.693 --> 00:05:34.433
times X.

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:37.011
So, the way it's written here,

00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:39.073
I could do these first, that's essentially

00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:40.558
what's written over here.

00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:41.417
Or it's associative.

00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.856
Instead, I could do these first.

00:05:43.856 --> 00:05:46.178
And the reason why I find this interesting

00:05:46.178 --> 00:05:47.617
is a negative times a negative

00:05:47.617 --> 00:05:49.127
is going to be a positive.

00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:51.069
So this is going to be the same thing,

00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:54.042
this thing over here is
going to be the same thing

00:05:54.042 --> 00:05:56.017
as positive X times positive Y.

00:05:56.017 --> 00:05:58.060
Negative times a negative is a positive.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.986
So you're gonna get positive X times Y

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:03.092
and then you're multiplying by an X again.

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:05.880
Multiplying by an X again.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.993
Now the other thing we
know about multiplication

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:09.037
is it's commutative.

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:11.546
We can change the order
in which we multiply.

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:13.751
Because I don't see this quite,

00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:16.097
I don't see this going on over here yet.

00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:17.350
So let's see, if I change the order,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.440
if I put the Xs, if I
multiply the Xs first,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.159
I could write this as,

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.159
I could write this as X times X,

00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:29.417
X times X times Y,

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:31.950
times Y.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.413
All I did is I swapped these two.

00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:36.687
Once again, I can swap the
order when I'm multiplying.

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:39.357
And I don't quite see
this yet, but X times X,

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.399
that's the same thing as X squared.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.257
This thing right over
here, that's X squared.

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:45.081
So this is going to be X squared,

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.658
X squared times Y, which is exactly

00:06:49.658 --> 00:06:51.586
what we have over there.

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:53.744
Now what does this one evaluate to?

00:06:53.744 --> 00:06:55.603
Now this one actually
evaluates to a number.

00:06:55.603 --> 00:06:57.390
Because regardless of what X you pick,

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.782
X minus X, that's going to be zero.

00:06:59.782 --> 00:07:01.756
Zero times anything is going to be zero.

00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:05.169
So this thing is going
to be equal to zero.

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.769
So this is different than
what's going on over here.

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:09.735
So I definitely would not pick that.

00:07:10.712 --> 00:07:12.430
Let's do one more.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.870
Which of the following expressions

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.748
are equivalent to A times
negative 10 plus 11?

00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:19.443
Well once again, you know the instinct

00:07:19.443 --> 00:07:20.256
when you see something like this

00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:22.135
well I'd love to distribute that A,

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:23.506
it's just sitting there.

00:07:23.506 --> 00:07:24.389
So let's do that.

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:28.962
A times negative 10 would
be negative 10 times A,

00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:30.610
or negative 10A.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.228
And then A times 11,

00:07:34.047 --> 00:07:35.435
so it's gonna be plus,

00:07:35.435 --> 00:07:37.942
A times 11 is the same
thing as 11 times A,

00:07:37.942 --> 00:07:40.753
which we could write as 11A.

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:42.262
Now which of these choices are that?

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:44.948
Negative 10A plus 11A.

00:07:45.623 --> 00:07:48.247
So this is negative 10A plus 11A,

00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:49.756
so this one looks right.

00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:51.074
Now what about this one?

00:07:51.912 --> 00:07:53.257
Well here they just swapped the order.

00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:56.067
If you put the 11A first,
you could write it this way.

00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:58.197
If you write the 11A first,

00:07:59.476 --> 00:08:00.699
we could write

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:02.558
11A

00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:04.464
and then we have,

00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:05.531
instead of saying it negative 10A,

00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:07.644
we just say minus 10A.

00:08:07.644 --> 00:08:08.874
Once again I just took,

00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:10.803
all I did is I took

00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:13.310
this thing and I put it

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.354
out front.

00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:17.118
So these two things are
actually equivalent.

00:08:17.118 --> 00:08:19.763
So I would select that one as well.
