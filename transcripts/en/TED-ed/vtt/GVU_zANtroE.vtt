00:00:07.384 --> 00:00:12.824
You breathe in about 17,000 times per day.

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:15.024
It's a process you rarely think about,

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:20.252
but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated
effort is playing out.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.653
Your vital organs,

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:22.513
the gut,

00:00:22.513 --> 00:00:23.233
brain,

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.033
bones,

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:24.863
lungs,

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:25.585
blood,

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:26.538
and heart

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:28.785
work together to sustain your life

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:32.943
by delivering oxygen
to tissues throughout your body.

00:00:32.943 --> 00:00:34.783
Most of our cells need oxygen

00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:39.214
because it's one of the key ingredients
of aerobic respiration.

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:43.422
That's the process that produces
a molecule called ATP,

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:47.557
which our cells use to power their
many incredible functions.

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:53.065
But getting oxygen throughout our
bodies is a surprisingly difficult task.

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:57.255
Gas enters cells by diffusing in
from their surroundings.

00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:01.866
And that only happens efficiently
over tiny distances.

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.885
So for oxygen to reach the cells
within our bodies,

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.605
it needs a transportation network.

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:11.905
This is where our 20 trillion 
red blood cells come in.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:18.444
Each one contains about 270 million
oxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin,

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:21.974
which is what gives blood its scarlet hue.

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:25.018
To make these cells, the body uses
raw materials

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:28.395
that become available from
the food we eat.

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:32.275
So in some ways, you could say
that oxygen's journey through the body

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.917
really begins in the gut.

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:38.891
Here, in an amazing display of mechanical
and chemical digestion,

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.496
food gets broken down into
its smallest elements,

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:45.917
like iron, the building block
of hemoglobin.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:48.636
Iron is carried through 
the cardiovascular system

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:51.776
to the body's hematopoietic tissue.

00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:54.926
This tissue is the birthplace 
of red blood cells,

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:59.146
and it can be found enclosed within
our bone marrow cavities.

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:01.748
The kidneys regulate 
our levels of red blood cells

00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:04.488
through the release of erythropoietin,

00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:08.527
a hormone which causes marrow
to increase production.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:13.677
Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million
red blood cells per second,

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:17.796
a number equivalent to the entire
population of Paris,

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:22.628
so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs
will have ample transportation.

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:25.247
But before oxygen 
can even reach the lungs,

00:02:25.247 --> 00:02:27.398
the brain needs to get involved.

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:29.414
The brainstem initiates breathing

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:31.998
by sending a message
through your nervous system,

00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:35.568
all the way to muscles 
of the diaphragm and ribs.

00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:37.719
This causes them to contract,

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.828
thus increasing the space
inside the rib cage,

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:43.717
which allows the lungs to expand.

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:46.958
That expansion drops your lungs
internal air pressure,

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.418
making air rush in.

00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:52.569
It's tempting to think of our lungs
as two big balloons,

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.928
but they're actually a lot more 
complicated than that.

00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:57.098
Here's why.

00:02:57.098 --> 00:02:59.638
The red blood cells in the vessels
within your lungs

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:04.583
can only pick up oxygen molecules
that are very close to them.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.678
If our lungs were shaped like balloons,

00:03:06.678 --> 00:03:10.629
air that was not in direct contact
with the balloon's inner surface

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.669
couldn't diffuse through.

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:19.759
Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures
that very little oxygen is wasted.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.421
Their interior is divided into
hundreds of millions

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:26.428
of miniature balloon-like projections
called alveoli

00:03:26.428 --> 00:03:28.750
that dramatically increase 
the contact area

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.270
to somewhere around 100 square meters.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.450
The alveolar walls are made of
extremely thin flat cells

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.471
that are surrounded by capillaries.

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:45.591
Together, the alveolar wall and
capillaries make a two-cell thick membrane

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:49.980
that brings blood and oxygen close enough
for diffusion.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.305
These oxygen-enriched cells are then
carried from the lungs

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:55.710
through the cardiovascular network,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.340
a massive collection of blood vessels
that reaches every cell in the body.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.710
If we laid this system out
end to end in a straight line,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.841
the vessels would wrap around the Earth
several times.

00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:11.170
Propelling red blood cells
through this extensive network

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.712
requires a pretty powerful pump,

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.142
and that's where your heart comes in.

00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:20.971
The human heart pumps an average
of about 100,000 times per day,

00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:25.811
and it's the powerhouse that ultimately
gets oxygen where it needs to go,

00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:28.712
completing the body's team effort.

00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:33.072
Just think - this entire complex system
is built around the delivery

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:36.292
of tiny molecules of oxygen.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:40.101
If just one part malfunctioned,
so would we.

00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:41.293
Breathe in.

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:44.573
Your gut, brain, bones, 
lungs, blood, and heart

00:04:44.573 --> 00:04:49.993
are continuing their incredible act
of coordination that keeps you alive.

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:51.653
Breathe out.
