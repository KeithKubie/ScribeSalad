00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.070
Things are a little trickier than this,
however.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.620
It is occasionally necessary, even when
modeling external visible behavior of

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.020
a device, to invent some
additional internal states.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.290
The most common example are timers,
such as what we saw earlier.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.950
A user can't really understand
how a clock radio works

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.580
without appreciating that there
are several internal timers working.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.220
See if you can come up with a list
of what internal timers are there.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.740
Okay, what timers do you have?

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.240
&gt;&gt; So,
the first one is the snooze timer.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.385
So as soon as you hit the snooze button,
then in 10 minutes,

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:37.318
the-
&gt;&gt; Times up to 10 minutes, sure.

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:38.700
What else?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.790
&gt;&gt; There is an alarm time.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.492
I think, or you know,
the alarms not going to go on forever.

00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:50.840
So there's like an internal, isnâ€™t there
a state for, our alarm has started and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.470
then at some point the alarm needs to
go off so its not playing forever.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.140
&gt;&gt; So, recall the original requirements
in which we said that the alarm can only

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.620
go for an hour, and so there has to be
a timer to time up to that one hour.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.
What else?

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.810
&gt;&gt; For the sleep, internally
when you are playing music and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.160
you have your sleep timer set.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.840
Is there something that kicks off?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.500
Usually you press sleep on,
right, or something like that?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.320
And then it'll run until it meets
the time you set for when the-

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.470
&gt;&gt; Well if you set the sleep timer.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.040
Then when you move your slide switch or

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.010
mode switch into radio or
alarm, I guess into radio,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.080
it's going to, normally if you hadn't
set the sleep time, it would go off.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.070
You wouldn't be hearing any radio.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.780
So, if you're sitting there and
move it to on, radio comes on.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.789
&gt;&gt; But if you move it to radio.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.700
&gt;&gt; Music
&gt;&gt; Music, music.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.720
Okay, it would normally go off.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.430
But if you have the sleep timer set,
it goes off after that amount of time.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.740
&gt;&gt; And then, another internal
timer is for your sleep timer.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.192
I guess I want to make sure I understand
correctly how the sleep timer,

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:10.360
like how it functionally works.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.390
So you press the sleep time, and
that's like, say you want to play for

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.190
30 minutes before it goes off.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.720
So to activate that, what mode do you
need to be in to start your sleep timer?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
there's two things going on here.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.180
Setting the amount of time
before the radio goes off and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.410
then actually causing that to happen at
night when you're ready to go to sleep.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.420
So, we know how to set the time
by hitting the sleep button and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.520
then setting some time there.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.430
Now, it turns out on this
particular clock radio,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.210
we've seen that the possibilities
are 12 hours and there's 60 minutes.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.430
But, this particular clock radio,
you can only set it for,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.950
I believe, up to an hour.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.530
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.640
&gt;&gt; So, you're really just
setting the minutes part of it.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.550
And, I haven't personally tried
this feature out, so I don't

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.200
what the internal logic does in the
situation where you say three hours and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.760
twenty minutes, even though it only
can do this sleeping for an hour.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.920
So, that's one thing that as an actual
developer, we'd have to decide upon.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.290
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Then there's the question of how,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.380
when you're going to bed at night,
this thing works, and what it is,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.210
is if you have set the sleep time,
if it's got an actual value

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.950
you've put in there,
when you move the mode switch into

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.360
radio you would normally
expect not to hear anything.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.960
But if you've got the sleep time
set then you would actually expect

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.270
the radio to continue playing
until that sleep time expires.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.540
So then, I guess,
just the internal timer for that.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.820
So as soon as you move
it into that mode,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.190
it goes up until you're
to that threshold.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.060
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.230
&gt;&gt; And then lastly,
we have this internal clock timer for

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.600
your actual display clock.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.630
&gt;&gt; So yeah, we're clocking
the minutes and hours as they go by,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.325
and so there has to be some timer
to do that particular thing.

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:19.411
So we can add these timers and
sub-machines,

00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:22.220
and when we do the results,
this is what you see here.
