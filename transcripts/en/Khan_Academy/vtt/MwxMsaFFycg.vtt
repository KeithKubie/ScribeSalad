00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:04.498
(upbeat piano and drum music)

00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:11.551
- Hi. My name is Paola,

00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.501
and I am a software engineer at Microsoft.

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:17.077
Let's talk about how the internet works.

00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:19.933
My job relies on networks being able

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.930
to talk with one another.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.774
But back in the 1970s, there was no

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.956
standard method for this.

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:29.821
It took the work of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.126
to invent the Internetworking Protocol

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:34.308
to make communication possible.

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:36.570
This invention laid the groundwork

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.975
for what we now call the internet.

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.045
- The internet is a network of networks.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:45.503
It links billions of devices
together all around the globe.

00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:48.706
Maybe you're connected with a laptop

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:50.903
or a phone through wifi.

00:00:50.903 --> 00:00:52.525
But then that wifi connection

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:55.716
connects to an Internet
Service Provider, or ISP.

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:58.363
And that ISP connects you
to billions and billions

00:00:58.363 --> 00:01:00.196
of devices around the world

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:02.123
through hundreds of thousands of networks

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:04.045
that are all interconnected.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.682
One thing that most
people do not appreciate,

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:12.142
is that the internet is
really a design philosophy

00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:16.108
and an architecture expressed
in a set of protocols.

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:19.629
A protocol is a well-known set
of rules and standards that,

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.417
if all parties agree to use it,

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:23.781
will allow them to
communicate without trouble.

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:28.799
How the internet actually
physically works is less important

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.761
than the fact that this
design philosophy has allowed

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:33.920
the internet to adapt and absorb

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.239
new communication technologies.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.464
This is because in order
for a new technology

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.650
to use the internet in some fashion,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.455
it just needs to know which
protocols to work with.

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:46.782
All the different devices on the internet

00:01:46.782 --> 00:01:48.489
have unique addresses.

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:50.865
An address on the
internet is just a number,

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:54.082
similar to a phone number,
or a sort of street address

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:56.248
that's unique to each computer or device

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.682
at the edge of the network.

00:01:59.314 --> 00:02:01.755
This is similar to how most
homes and businesses have

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:03.099
a mailing address.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.499
You don't need to know a person

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.829
to send them a letter in the mail,

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.344
but you do need to know their address,

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:10.141
and how to write the address properly,

00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.335
so the letter can be
carried by the mail system

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:13.886
to its destination.

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:15.854
The addressing system for computers

00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:17.724
on the internet is similar,

00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:20.645
and it forms part of one
of the most important

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.354
protocols used in internet communication,

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:26.235
simply called the
Internet Protocol, or IP.

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.072
A computer's address, then,
is called its IP address.

00:02:30.514 --> 00:02:33.222
Visiting a website is really
just your computer asking

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:35.299
another computer for information.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.627
Your computer sends a message
to the other computer's

00:02:37.627 --> 00:02:41.011
IP address, and it also sends
along its origin address

00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:43.673
so the other computer knows
where to send its response.

00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:47.895
- You may have seen an IP address.

00:02:47.895 --> 00:02:49.743
It's just a bunch of numbers.

00:02:50.043 --> 00:02:52.795
These numbers are
organized in a hierarchy.

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:55.685
Just like a home address has a country,

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:58.635
a city, a street, and a house number,

00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:01.242
an IP address has many parts.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.250
Just like all digital data,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.250
each of these numbers
is represented in bits.

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:09.985
Traditional IP addresses are 32 bits long,

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:13.540
with eight bits for each
part of the address.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.947
The earlier numbers usually identify

00:03:15.947 --> 00:03:18.653
the country and regional
network of the device.

00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:20.570
Then come the subnetworks.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.925
And then, finally, the address
of the specific device.

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:28.485
This version of IP
addressing is called IPv4.

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:30.968
It was designed in 1973,

00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:33.386
and widely adopted in the early '80s,

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:36.729
and provides for more than
4 billion unique addresses

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.527
for devices connecting to the internet.

00:03:39.797 --> 00:03:43.170
But the internet has turned
out to be much more popular

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.339
than even Vint Cerf imagined,

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.677
and 4 billion unique
addresses won't be enough.

00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:51.461
We're now in the middle
of a multi-year transition

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.793
to a longer IP address format called IPv6,

00:03:55.793 --> 00:03:59.545
which uses 128 bits per address,

00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:04.545
and provides over 340
undecillion unique addresses.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.009
That's more than enough for
every grain of sand on Earth

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.990
to have its own IP address.

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:14.869
- Most users never see or
care about internet addresses.

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:18.160
A system called the Domain
Name System, or DNS,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.065
associates names, like www.example.com,

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:24.050
with the corresponding addresses.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.185
Your computer uses the DNS
to look up domain names

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:30.206
and get the associated
IP address, which is used

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:33.099
to connect your computer to the
destination on the internet.

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.999
- [Voiceover] And it goes a
little something like this.

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.619
- Hey, hi there.

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:39.450
I want to go to www.code.org

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:45.011
- Yeah, well I don't know the
IP address for that domain.

00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:46.729
Let me ask around.

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:49.836
Hey, anyone know how to get to a...

00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:52.022
code.org?

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.347
- Yeah, I got it right here.

00:04:54.347 --> 00:04:57.270
It's 174 dot 129

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.184
dot 14 dot 120.

00:05:00.514 --> 00:05:01.842
- Oh, okay, great. Thanks.

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:04.096
Yeah, I'm gonna write that
down and save it for later

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:05.078
in case I need it.

00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:06.758
Hey, here's that address you wanted.

00:05:07.048 --> 00:05:08.574
- Awesome. Thank you.

00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:13.792
(piano flourish)

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:17.359
- So how do we design a
system for billions of devices

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:21.108
to find any one of billions
of different websites?

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:24.097
There is no way one DNS server

00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:27.413
can handle all of the
requests from all devices.

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:30.513
The answer is that DNS
servers are connected

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:33.816
in a distributed hierarchy,
and are divided into zones,

00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:36.915
splitting up responsibility
for the major domains

00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:40.899
such as .org, .com, .net, et cetera.

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:44.129
DNS was originally created to be

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.116
an open and public communication protocol

00:05:47.116 --> 00:05:49.871
for government and
educational institutions.

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.589
Because of its openness,

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.706
DNS is susceptible to cyber attacks.

00:05:55.247 --> 00:05:58.399
An example attack is DNS spoofing.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.724
That's when a hacker
taps into a DNS server

00:06:01.724 --> 00:06:04.450
and changes it to match a domain name

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.725
with the wrong IP address.

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:11.588
This lets the attacker send
people to one imposter website.

00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:13.364
If this happens to you,

00:06:13.364 --> 00:06:15.694
you are vulnerable for more problems

00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:19.783
because you are using that
fake website as if it is real.

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:25.597
The internet is huge, and
getting bigger every day.

00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:28.599
But the Domain Name System
and Internet Protocol

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.485
are designed to scale,

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:32.885
no matter how much the internet grows.
