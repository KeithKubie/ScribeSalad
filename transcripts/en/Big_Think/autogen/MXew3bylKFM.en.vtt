we've already shown that we can connect

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.510
we've already shown that we can connect
 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.690
we've already shown that we can connect
computers to neurons and we have neural

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700
computers to neurons and we have neural
 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.179
computers to neurons and we have neural
implants they're actually pretty small

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189
implants they're actually pretty small
 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.320
implants they're actually pretty small
this Parkinson's implant is pea-sized

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330
this Parkinson's implant is pea-sized
 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.820
this Parkinson's implant is pea-sized
it's placed actually in the body and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
it's placed actually in the body and
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.039
it's placed actually in the body and
then connected into the brain and you

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
then connected into the brain and you
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.450
then connected into the brain and you
can download new software to that

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
can download new software to that
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.859
can download new software to that
computer inside your body connecting

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
computer inside your body connecting
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.950
computer inside your body connecting
your brain from outside the patient

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960
your brain from outside the patient
 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.720
your brain from outside the patient
that's today another one of the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
that's today another one of the
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.519
that's today another one of the
exponential trends is that was shrinking

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
exponential trends is that was shrinking
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160
exponential trends is that was shrinking
technology it's actually a rate of about

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
technology it's actually a rate of about
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870
technology it's actually a rate of about
a hundred and three D volume per decade

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
a hundred and three D volume per decade
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.749
a hundred and three D volume per decade
so at that rate it won't be pea-sized in

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
so at that rate it won't be pea-sized in
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.229
so at that rate it won't be pea-sized in
twenty years it'll be blood cell size

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
twenty years it'll be blood cell size
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880
twenty years it'll be blood cell size
and we can send them in through the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
and we can send them in through the
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.240
and we can send them in through the
bloodstream and so ultimately we can

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
bloodstream and so ultimately we can
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.200
bloodstream and so ultimately we can
send these in without surgery but even

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
send these in without surgery but even
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.319
send these in without surgery but even
with surgery we can attack old more you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
with surgery we can attack old more you
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.040
with surgery we can attack old more you
know serious brain dysfunction which is

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.590
know serious brain dysfunction which is
already starting to happen the latest

the Parkinson's implant first was just

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
the Parkinson's implant first was just
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.080
the Parkinson's implant first was just
connected to one spot then two and then

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
connected to one spot then two and then
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.340
connected to one spot then two and then
four and now they're going for like

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
four and now they're going for like
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.460

hundreds of connections into the
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.850
hundreds of connections into the
neocortex so we see the same kind of

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860
neocortex so we see the same kind of
 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.620
neocortex so we see the same kind of
exponential ramp up but if you're really

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
exponential ramp up but if you're really
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.149
exponential ramp up but if you're really
going to continue to make progress you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
going to continue to make progress you
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679
going to continue to make progress you
have to basically understand how the

see its functioning are growing

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250
see its functioning are growing
 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.680
