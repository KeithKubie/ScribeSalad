00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.940
- Well, welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.430
Thank you very
much for coming out

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.280
in the slightly chilly weather.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.570
My name is Alyssa Goodman.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.700
And I'm the
co-director for science

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.770
here at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.650
And so I welcome you also
on behalf of Radcliffe.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.690
Some of you may have been
here earlier this year

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.160
for our annual--

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.310
well, last year now
for our Annual Science

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.770
Symposium on the Undiscovered.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.780
And the theme of
the undiscovered,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.550
for those of you
who were not here,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.850
has to do it's not completely
by accident or serendipitous

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.010
scientific discoveries,
but discoveries

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.100
that are made when you have a
plan for what kind of science

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.160
you want to do.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.480
But then you find something
you didn't exactly expect,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.490
but you are very prepared.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.970
And so Dan Kammen, who you're
going to hear from today,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.750
will talk about that kind
of work a bit in the context

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.610
of energy research
and potentially,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.000
hopefully, saving the earth.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.160
And so, it falls
to me to tell you

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.380
about Dan, which I will
do in just a minute.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.060
But also to mention
that there are

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.170
two more talks coming up well
within a week in this series.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.410
So, we have one on
Friday and one on Monday.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.240
And they both have
a life science bend.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.970
And the information is
on the Radcliffe website.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.700
And so if you haven't
registered for those, two more

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.120
talks in the undiscovered
series-- one Friday and one

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.320
Monday.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.140
I should also mention that the
first few rows here are filled

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.480
with people-- the reason I'm
wearing a name tag today,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.910
is that as another
activity at Radcliffe,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.090
we're having a two-day seminar,
small seminar on trying

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.290
to marry data science approaches
and climate research across all

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.580
fields--

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.096
law, business, economics,
earth science, health.

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:45.220
And we'll let you know how
that comes out hopefully

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.020
at another event in the future.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.180
But one of our participants for
that is my friend Dan Kammen.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.100
And so, Dan Kammen
and I first met

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.770
when we were both
graduate students here

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.930
in physics in the late 1980s.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.200
And-- yeah, Dan looks
younger than me, though.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.250
But anyway, so Dan, like I said,
we both got degrees in physics.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.589
And then Dan's path
diverged fairly quickly,

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.130
where he got more
and more interested

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.680
in energy and energy policy.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.490
So, he has also an undergraduate
degree in physics from Cornell.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.160
And then he went on and
did postdocs at Caltech,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.697
and came back to Harvard.

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:28.030
And then he went to Princeton
as an assistant professor.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.942
But for the last 20 years,
he's been at UC Berkeley.

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:33.400
And the list of
titles that Dan has

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.220
doesn't even fit on the page
that I have in front of me.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.180
So I just selected some to give
you some taste of what he does.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.390
He's currently the class of
1935 Distinguished Professor

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.900
of Energy, the chair of the
energy and resources group

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.860
there.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.330
He's also appointed
in the Goldman

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.640
School of Public Policy in
the Department of Nuclear

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.600
Engineering.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.330
He's the founding director of
the Renewable and Appropriate

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.330
Energy Laboratory, the
co-director of the Berkeley

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.640
Institute of the
Environment, the director

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.370
of the Transportation
Sustainability Research Center.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.570
I left some off.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.190
He's very lazy, as you can see.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.450
And he's founded
or is on the board

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.440
of more than 10 companies.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.990
And some of you may
remember his name

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.330
from the newspapers
and the news because he

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.230
has advised the Obama
administration, and the World

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.270
Bank, and extremely briefly the
Trump administration on energy

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.380
and sustainability issues.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.470
He also was the
coordinating lead author

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.740
for one of the IPCC reports,
the Intergovernmental Panel

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.000
on Climate Change.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.690
And you may remember that Al
Gore and the rest of the panel

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.480
won the Nobel Prize
for their work in 2007.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.730
So, because Dan
shared that prize

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.500
with so many other
authors in addition

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.750
to Al Gore, who
got half the prize,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.920
he told me I'm allowed
to call him a micro Gore.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.262
So, also you may have seen Dan.

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:54.970
When you see him, he
might look familiar.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.670
He's been on many, many
television programs.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.830
And in particular, he
hosted a six-part series

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.070
for the Discovery Channel
called Eco Opulus.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.237
And so, I'm going to stop
taking Dan's time away.

00:04:05.237 --> 00:04:07.570
And just say that I'm really
excited to hear him tell us

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.630
about an energy plan that
the earth can live with.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.550
And the plan is that
we'll hear from Dan.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.950
And then we'll take
questions at the end.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.149
And there'll be a
microphone in the aisle.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.890
And when you'd like
to ask a question,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.430
please do come to
the microphone.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.000
And thank you very much.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.024
And thank you for coming, Dan.

00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:28.872
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:34.520
- Well, thank you all for
being here on what for,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.730
now a Californian, feels like
a very, very cold evening.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.280
So, I really appreciate
everyone getting here.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.730
I have to say though that
I feel even more of attuned

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.880
with the undiscovered
path because you

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.830
can tell a fairly
good story about what

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.730
I've done afterwards.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.440
But at the time, I came to
Harvard to do cosmology.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.610
I actually transferred here.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.970
I won't get into that right now.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.050
But I got here.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.800
And then I got seduced
into studying neuroscience

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.650
and the evolution of the brain.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.160
And it's actually the
complex systems part

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.930
that I feel like has
been the most useful

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.846
in the work I've done.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:15.080
And I hope that that
kind of appears as we go.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.050
But it's a story you can
tell the ties afterwards.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.480
But I sure cannot tell a
coherent story at the time.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.400
It was a interesting
wander through a lot

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.080
of very nice, benevolent
neglect along the way.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.690
And so right now,
we're at a point

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.020
though when we need to do much
more than benevolently neglect

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.590
the planet.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.107
And so I'm hoping these will
tie together a little bit.

00:05:36.107 --> 00:05:38.690
I mean what I'll try to do is
to give a bit of an introduction

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.980
to my laboratory because
the way that it functions is

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.330
critical to the mixture between
basic science, applied science,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.780
and engagement with a variety
of non-governmental groups,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.090
and governments, and
others along the way.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.820
And I'll use that to really
look at how quickly the energy

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.310
system of the world
not only is changing--

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.600
not always for the better--

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.066
but the ways in which we
critically need it to change.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:03.440
And so this is
the part that will

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.000
bore the experts in the room.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.160
And I apologize
just a little bit.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.230
But really, to use
that to look at what

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.590
are we learning about how to
guide and steer innovation

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.670
for a decarbonised world.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.120
And that's really when I get at.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.140
What I find exciting is that
we, like all academics say,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.090
all hard problems
we haven't solved,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.090
we are waiting for the
younger generation to solve.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.920
And I do remember
when I felt like I

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.390
was one of those
younger generation

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.430
folks-- which I do not anymore.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.030
And right now, we
are at a point where

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.990
the 15-year-old Swedish
school children,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.390
and young 29-year-old
members of the US

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.730
House of Representatives,
and a variety of others

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.280
are absolutely doing
exactly what we say,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.060
in a very casual way,
those sorts of changes.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.320
So, I'll end with this call
for a just transition, which

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.930
is probably a more accurate
title than Energy Plan

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.340
that the World Can Live With.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.009
Because it's not clear
that the world is

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.550
going to be too
happy with the energy

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.020
plans that we are creating.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.120
So, I'll jump into our
lab for a second just

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.710
to give a feel for it.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.440
It's quite a diverse
group of individuals,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.110
lots of different
backgrounds and interests.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.477
And it's quite international.

00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:15.560
It's really quite diverse.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.720
And so, there's a
lot of approaches.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.480
Most of the people that find
their way to this energy

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.930
and resources group came
out of a STEM background.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.390
But increasingly, we have
people from philosophy,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.510
and rhetoric, and a variety of
other areas as part of the mix.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.640
And it's been
really heartwarming

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.410
to see the number
of people who feel

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.520
like they have a
huge input on how we

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.940
think about energy innovation.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.210
And it's not just the kind
of the material science,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.340
and physics, and chemistry
world that I sort of

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.600
assumed when I founded the lab
would be the main pieces of it.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.050
So, anything that I'll
talk about today--

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.640
the slides from today's
talk, the papers,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.710
and things that I'll
mention, the video clips--

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.170
they're all available on
the RAEL website, Renewable

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.970
and Appropriate
Energy Laboratory.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.510
And you do need to type into
Google more than just RAEL.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.010
Because if you just
put it in RAEL,

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.920
you will get the RAELians, who
claim to have cloned a human 10

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.210
years ago in Florida.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.550
Haven't heard a lot
from them since.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.430
So, my name, or Berkeley,
or something like that.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.500
And then the Twitter is
not vacation pictures.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.200
We try to post about
one tweet today.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.640
Today was a bit
heavy, for reasons

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.890
I'll get to in a little
bit, about the work

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.920
from the laboratory.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.850
So, RAEL has existed since
I moved from Princeton

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.770
to Berkeley 20 years ago.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.059
It's actually when John Holdren
had departed here to Harvard.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:37.240
And so there was a spot
available for an ex,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.262
or former, or something
sort of physicist.

00:08:40.262 --> 00:08:41.470
So, we've been working since.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.176
And the big project we worked on
for the first couple of years,

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:45.550
and Lisa mentioned,
was that I've

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.290
been part of the IPCC team.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.230
It actually started when
I was here at Harvard

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.680
under a NIGEC Northeast Regional
Center for Climate Change

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.550
fellowship in the 80s.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.300
And then in the 90s
who worked really hard

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.220
on a lot of the
climate assessment,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.380
detection of
climate change work.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.115
The big benefit was that
we got this wonderful--

00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:06.490
I got to share in
the Nobel Peace

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.650
Prize, which was wonderful.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.140
But I don't know how
critical it is here

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.994
at Harvard, but at Berkeley
getting the check is great.

00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:15.910
But as you know, if
you're part of a big team,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.860
you don't get the
Nobel Prize check.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.157
You get this nice plaque.

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:21.490
But you do get something much
more valuable at Berkeley,

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.590
and that is a parking space
with a big large "NL" on it

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.470
for Nobel Laureate.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.380
And I was really waiting
for my parking space

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.280
to impress my friends and
and sort of annoy my enemies.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.550
Nothing happened the first
year, 2007, 2008, 2009, nothing,

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.720
nothing, nothing.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.220
Finally, a couple
of years ago, they

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.470
said oh, we're going
to act on this finally.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.110
At Berkeley, there
were four members

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.120
of the IPCC team,
Inez Fong, Kirk Smith,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.030
Bill Collins we're all part
of the core team on campus

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.005
and the Lawrence Berkeley Lab.

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.380
And so we were told, yeah,
you're about to get the award.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.460
You're going to get
the parking space.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.990
And it's totally Berkeley.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.720
And they absolutely
delivered what they said.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.890
We got a parking space.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.760
Nobel laureate bike parking.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.890
And you got to read
the fine print,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.190
parking not reserved
for IPCC contributors.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.650
So the very few
times I go there,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.820
there's like 16 student
bikes in a huge heap.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.770
It looks like some sort
of twisted metal thing

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.820
from The Matrix.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.860
But it is very
Berkeley-specific.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.100
And so, Berkeley did us proud.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.660
Our lab is sort of generally
thinking as interdisciplinary

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.820
as possible, as we can
about climate issues.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.040
But we still come from
a technical perspective.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.202
And so every now and
then, our forays into--

00:10:39.202 --> 00:10:40.660
I'm not going to
call it economics.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.690
I don't want to
even claim that--

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.466
but sort of financial
engineering, I would describe.

00:10:46.466 --> 00:10:48.340
And so one of the things
that we came up with

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.390
was a way to finance energy
efficiency and renewables

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.600
something called PACE,
Property Assessed Clean Energy.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.230
It's basically pirating the
simplest idea out there,

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.840
that municipalities
around the United States

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.720
often lend money
to property owners

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.140
to underground transmission
lines and repair sidewalks.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.160
And so we borrowed this
idea, set up a company.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.420
16 states passed laws to
enable PACE financing.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.520
And it's worked relatively well.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.630
But it has a critical flaw.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.140
And that is, to get
municipal money,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.840
to invest in renewables and
efficiency, both things that

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.490
make sense, you have
to own property.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.600
And that means it is
inherently a regressive policy.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.600
It borrows money from
all of us to pay off

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.880
those who are better off
because they own something.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.640
And I'll come back at
the end to the halting

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.860
steps towards this
just transition,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.080
or a socially equitable version
of a change in this really

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.670
critical problem.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.950
Since then, our lab
has expanded the work

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.200
we've done with governments
around the world

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.430
to help them think through how
to do planning for an energy

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.420
transition.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.700
And this has really been
the most interesting feature

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.810
for me.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.330
My kind of complex
systems background,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.340
interest in basic
materials science,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.700
be it for new batteries,
or heat pumps,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.800
or whatever the
technology fuel cells

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.240
as we're looking at the time.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.890
But it's really
how to synthesize

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.000
that into complex enough
models, but also models

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.640
that can be translated
for work by governments,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.960
by nonprofit groups, by activist
groups, by the private sector.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.320
And I'll give a few
flavors of that as we go.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.540
And we've worked with a
whole range of governments--

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.940
I just put some flags of
a few of them up there--

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.950
in places that have made
interesting strides.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.590
And I should highlight
that, it may not be obvious,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.704
we hear a lot about China.

00:12:42.704 --> 00:12:43.870
And I'll come back to China.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.810
And we have Mike
Danielson and others

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.640
in the room who
have real expertise.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.580
But in terms of places like
Kenya you don't hear about,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.360
Kenya is, in some ways, the
Silicon Valley of East Africa.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.170
Morocco is the only
country that legitimately

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.000
went to the climate conference
this past December in Poland

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.820
and we're on target
to meet their 2050

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.320
goals-- the only country.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.800
And why it's in Africa,
it's an interesting story.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.380
And Malaysia has a
really interesting story

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.122
around decentralized energy.

00:13:16.122 --> 00:13:17.830
So, there are some
really curious leaders

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.210
emerging in this field.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.950
And that will get me into kind
of the core part of the talk.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.710
And that is we have to make
this great energy transition.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.990
But we are moving too slowly.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.060
And the things that
have caused some

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.350
of the most interesting and most
rapid progress, some of them

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.860
are obvious.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.890
But I will do sort
of a take on them.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:44.050
But even though I assume that no
one here who came to this talk

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.570
in the first place-- who is
in Cambridge, at Harvard, MIT,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.560
and various places--

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.530
needs any kind of a
primer on climate change.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:55.510
But we all have somewhere in our
family tree, that crazy uncle

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.000
or aunt, who doesn't
believe climate change

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.070
and has 9,000
arguments that they'll

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.720
trot out over
Thanksgiving dinner

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.720
until you pass out from
tryptophan poisoning.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.700
And it's their argument why
climate change isn't happening.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.540
And one of the interesting
aspects of that

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.210
is that the climate community
on the science and engineering

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.890
side is very dedicated to our
models and our increasingly

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.270
complex models.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.450
And while I'm as guilty as
anyone, one of the challenges

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.000
is to try to be able
to encapsulate climate

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.550
change in a model-free way.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.070
And you can look at a given
heat wave, or this, or that.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.260
But you can always say,
well, 80 years ago,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.500
100 years ago there was
a similarly bad event.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.500
And so, one thing
that I use and urge

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.670
anyone who has that sort of
troublesome aunt or uncle

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:47.080
in your family is
a wonderful NASA--

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.750
you can download this
from the NASA website.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.800
And what it's going to show,
in I think 28 seconds or so,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.250
is a series of synthetic
images taken each point

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:04.160
during one image per year when
the sea ice over the North Pole

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.720
hit its minimum.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.030
And that means it could
be late August or early

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.110
September, depending
on that coldest moment.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.330
And so, this is a critical
part of the story.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.414
Because these are simply images
taken, no modeling involved.

00:15:18.414 --> 00:15:20.330
And what you're going
to see is not only this,

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.150
but a graph and millions of
square kilometers showing

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.900
the amount of ice.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.870
And so, those of you who have
watched Chasing Ice and now

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.050
Chasing Coral, I highly
recommend both of those.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.820
But, you see, there's
some fluctuations.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.680
But starting out
in the late 80s,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.740
a little bit less than 7
million square kilometers of ice

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.610
at its minimum in
the late summer.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.410
There are some warmer
years, colder years.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.910
I think I debated Bjorn Lomborg
in '96 at a kind of a peak.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.020
But you see, we have, in a
very steady, secular way,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.020
lost about 50% of the ice cover.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.920
And for those of you who
have seen Chasing Ice know--

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.920
very graphically and it
should make sense physically--

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.120
you don't just lose area.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.320
You compact volume.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.630
So you're losing a
dramatic amount of ice.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.080
And again, in a
modeling-free way,

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.900
that's a pretty good slide
set to just play back

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.534
to that annoying
relative who insists

00:16:16.534 --> 00:16:18.950
that they're going to tell you
all the reasons why climate

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.690
change is due to other things.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.980
In my world view, though, one
of the hallmark events that I

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.160
think will go down in history
even though the recent history

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.380
we've seen has been
a little challenging,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.820
is the fact that
we've had so far 24

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.430
of these COPS, these Climate
Conference of the Party

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.450
meetings.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.570
But before the Paris one, this
is called the famous event

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.000
where we got this
wonderful agreement.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.450
In 2014, President Obama
and Premier Xi met.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.500
And they essentially said, this
189-country negotiation, this

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.530
is a pain in the blank.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.770
And we're just going to
do a two-party conference.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.670
After all, we are the G2
of messing up the planet.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:07.020
We are 40% of global energy
use, 40% of global pollution.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.960
If we come to an agreement,
it will really change things.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.099
And in fact, that's
exactly what happened.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.490
The agreement was
bizarrely asymmetric

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.740
from a political
science perspective.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.540
President Obama pledged to cut
emissions by a third by 2025.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.810
China promised to peak
emissions-- d emissions,

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.520
DT is equal to zero.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.330
But they didn't say if that
was going to be a 2% or 200%

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.860
over the current level.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.470
And of course, the US
has now backed off,

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.580
to put it mildly, the Clean
Power Plan that Obama proposed.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.510
China, on the other hand,
that gave itself until 2030

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.690
to peak emissions, is going
to peak emissions sometime

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.600
probably in the next
six to seven years.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.680
So China's going to meet its
target much earlier and much

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.760
lower than anyone forecast.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.820
And so, a really
interesting mix.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.870
Of course, these promises that
were made at the Paris Climate

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.090
Conference are things
that we've committed to

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.050
and haven't done yet.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.880
And that's part of the problem.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.210
But what happened is
that I then evolved

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.310
the work I was doing
from just at Berkeley

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.240
to a larger federal role,
first under Secretary Clinton

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.260
and then under Secretary Kerry.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.610
And so, we worked in a variety
of capacities, in my case,

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.440
as science envoy working with
North African, sub-Saharan

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.300
Africa, and East
African, and Middle East

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.130
countries on their energy plans.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.600
It was a wonderful time.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.450
At the end of it, you get
kind of a wonderful letter

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.790
from the president
thanking you for trying

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.790
to be a liaison
for good planning

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.950
and bringing science
to bear on the problem.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.070
But then of course, the US,
we had a little election.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.810
And that election
didn't go well,

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.870
certainly from my own
perspective on things.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.830
And so, it was time for me
to depart the administration.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.140
And I, at home,
said you know, I'm

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.560
not going to keep serving
under this new president.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.919
And my wife said, well
does that mean you'll

00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:01.960
be around the house more?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.470
Which I wasn't sure was a good
or bad thing from perspective.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.160
But my kids said, well, dad
if you're going to do it,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.890
there's only one way to do it.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.480
You have to tweet it out.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.379
And you have to tweet
it out in ways that I

00:19:11.379 --> 00:19:12.420
learned from my children.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.330
So, my younger child said,
well, if you're going to tweet,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.990
you have to tweet 6 AM
California time, 9 AM East

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.120
Coast time, middle
of the day in Europe.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.500
And you have to tweet
your message out

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.210
in a way that will have a
few interesting features.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.990
So, I tweeted out my message.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.170
I'm the son of a historian.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.501
And so I had quotes from various
presidents of both parties.

00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.000
I thought I was
being pretty clever.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.890
No one read the letter
at all because I

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.870
didn't have a little cross
tick embedded in my message.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.200
And that's when I started
to really listen to my kids.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.840
Not only should I do it
early in the morning,

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.120
but then my younger
daughter challenged me.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.070
Said, you have to have your
most famous friend retweet it

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.630
within a few minutes.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.010
So that got more tricky.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.320
I thought and thought,
who do I dare approach?

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.370
Who do I ask?

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:10.500
And so, I did ask my most famous
friend if she could retweet it.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.600
And she did.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.910
And, you know, by the
end of the first day

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.390
according to my daughter, I was
trending for nine nanoseconds.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.159
Taylor Swift, by the
end of the first day,

00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:22.950
it was just kind of an
interesting process.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:28.770
And so, that put me back
into my day job at Berkeley.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.310
And thankfully, a number
of other parts of the world

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.110
have moved on very steadily.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.060
It's really hard to
meet our climate targets

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.040
without the US engaged.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.050
Because if we look at business
as usual path for emissions,

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.040
if there is the
business as usual line,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.460
you can just see if the
US and China collectively

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.882
don't get their houses in order,
we are not going to make it.

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:53.340
There's lots of arguments about
how you can have the treaty

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.464
work, and blah, blah, blah.

00:20:54.464 --> 00:20:56.970
But in the end, these
two major players

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.580
are going to have to
really make progress.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.540
And what was agreed to in
Paris wasn't just fueled

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.270
by a lot of good wine--
although it helped.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.760
It was a remarkable
transition, and the idea

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.180
that we were on a pathway
in terms of billions of tons

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.630
emitted and in terms of the
temperature change we were

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.500
on a pace for, the
orange, or red,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.870
or whatever that
color up there is,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.250
that's what the commitments
made by the US, China, EU,

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.010
and everyone else were
going to shave off.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.260
Now, those are
pledges made in 2015.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.770
And as I said before,
only one country, Morocco,

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.820
is actually on pace
to get anywhere.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.510
So, talk is certainly cheap
and paper, apparently,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.220
is even cheaper.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.430
But that was what we all
committed to, shaving a degree

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.430
right off the top.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.210
And remember, we have
already warmed the planet

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.690
by one degree.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.600
So it's not that we have
two degrees of room.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.110
That was the negotiated,
we must cut our emissions

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.350
by 80% or more to
keep emission rise

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.660
less than two degrees
given that we've already

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.790
warmed by one degree.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.680
And so, we were there.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.330
And really, what
countries committed

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.840
to were the so-called national
commitments, the NDCs.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.340
And they add up to this.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.290
Some countries pledged to be
much more energy efficient,

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.030
some to do renewable energy,
others to protect forests,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.820
wetlands, a whole variety
of very eclectic things

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.050
were proposed.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.830
And the job of the
Conference of the Parties

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.100
is to really hold
us to that fire

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.270
and hold us to those targets.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.770
And right now we are
not doing so well.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.480
But the Paris climate meeting
also did something else.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.980
And that is the--

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.020
the red is what we committed to.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.930
But it was such an
enthusiastic meeting

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.530
that a very unlikely set of
some European, and the United

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.360
States, and many
developing nations

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.580
said this two-degree
number, that's not enough.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.030
We need to keep
emissions lower still.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.480
And one real failing of the
science community-- and I'm

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.850
as guilty as many
colleagues-- is

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.610
that we didn't go to
this Paris meeting

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.310
with models for how to
go much lower in hand.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.960
A few groups had them.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.300
And people trotted out
proposals that they

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.874
had written to agencies
that didn't get funded,

00:23:12.874 --> 00:23:14.290
or whatever else,
and to say well,

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.600
we were thinking
about going lower

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.390
than that 80% cut in emissions.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.090
Very few of the
academic community

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.960
was ready to step up while world
leaders got together and said

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.560
two degrees, that's the goal.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.340
But we're really after
one and a half degrees,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.250
the so-called High
Ambition Coalition.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.670
Because that sounds better
than Low Ambition Coalition.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.860
And in fact, what
happened was we

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.300
need to do everything
in the gray.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.470
Those are all additions.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.780
We need new science,
technology, in a whole variety

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.350
of areas, new policy mechanisms,
new behavioral tools.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.860
But six months after the
Paris Climate Accord,

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.390
my boss, Secretary Kerry
at the State Department,

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.030
led the US effort to
pass the so-called Kigali

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.610
Accords that were
signed remarkably fast

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.610
and then ratified right away.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.660
And those called for
about another half degree

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.150
to be cut largely
through refrigerants

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.010
and some industrial processes.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.320
But it shows you how
quickly this whole system

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.367
can change, at least on paper.

00:24:14.367 --> 00:24:15.700
And you have to make good on it.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.520
Now, you don't have to
be too technical to note

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.160
that if two degrees
requires getting emissions

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.300
very near zero, getting
to one and a half degrees

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.840
is going to require scenarios
that go carbon negative.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.140
And this has opened up all
kinds of dialogue around,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.240
do we invest in
geoengineering, do

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.460
we invest in
smarter agriculture,

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.670
do we invest in healthier
soils, rivers, ecosystems

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.310
so that the natural world
can suck carbon down?

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.890
So, there's a fascinating
and very complex

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.740
discussion about how
to actually do this.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.540
But it's a really
critical story.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.240
And so, if I stop
there, I would have not

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.342
done any of the details.

00:24:53.342 --> 00:24:54.675
But that's what we all promised.

00:24:54.675 --> 00:24:56.410
Of course, the US
backed out, which is

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.590
why I resigned my federal job.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.950
But what gave us hope
that you could get there?

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.770
And for me living
in California, it's

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.350
really this remarkable
story that if you

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.760
look at electricity use per
person in the United States,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.540
it's been rising
in California, not

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.290
so different than the
rest of the country.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.080
And of course where California
took that dip and the US

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.890
took that little hiatus,
that was the OPEC crisis.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.010
And the engineering-savvy
folks will say well, wait,

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.620
an OPEC crisis is about oil.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.560
But we don't run our
power plants on oil.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.870
We run on coal, natural
gas, nuclear power,

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.104
and some renewables.

00:25:37.104 --> 00:25:38.020
And so, what happened?

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.500
In fact, the economic slowdown
resulted in less demand.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.570
But the real thing that
happened, in my view

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.990
in California right during
that little plateau,

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:51.610
is that California set up a new
state agency to start planning

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.890
around energy
transitions modeled

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.530
very much after some work that
had taken place in Europe.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.390
The Energy Commission took off.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.780
And instead of seeing
electricity use

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.880
just simply rising per person--

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.340
and there were well
thought out arguments

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.160
that if you wanted to grow your
economy, energy use must rise.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.900
In fact, a sort of unfortunate--
very famous, but unfortunate--

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.290
economist, anthropologist at
the University of Michigan--

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.360
I won't name him, Leslie White--

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.440
he actually said that culture
evolves as the amount of energy

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.150
consumed rises.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.070
And in fact, you all
on the east coast

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:31.000
may have your doubts about
California in terms of culture,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.180
but by doubling
and tripling down

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.570
on residential, commercial,
and individual home

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.110
energy efficiency,
California stopped

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.580
electricity growth per person.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.600
And it has remained
that way for decades.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.460
There are some
interesting details

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.320
that are worth hashing out.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.500
But that's a remarkable process.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.510
Per capita we've leveled out.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.370
But of course, we have
a lot more capitas.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.020
And so we need more power.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.950
But that is a wholesale change
in terms of economic thinking.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.650
And it leads me to
one of the first kind

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.690
of undiscovered
observations for me.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.730
And that is, this kind of
data enables a whole bunch

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.380
of much more
interesting planning.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.330
But it also reveals
one of the problems.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.390
And that is that
while we know that we

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.940
need to meet this climate
target of reducing emissions,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.920
one of the far two general
observations for me

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.040
is that humans are
very, very poor

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.660
at doing any
decision-making that

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.400
doesn't seem to involve money.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.990
And when I was in
Princeton, I had

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.530
the office next to a now-Nobel
laureate in economics.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.090
He's not an economist.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.220
But we had huge problems
because on the Carter

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.820
there was Dan Kammen and Danny
[? Koneman ?] side-by-side.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.060
And we never got our own
mail or messages or anything.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.750
But he, among others in the
behavioral economics world

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.720
really went on to think, how
do we develop other metrics?

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.020
How do we think through how
we're going to assess features?

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.610
And the fact that
nature does not

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.450
care about money means this
whole dialogue is incredibly

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.210
difficult. That doesn't mean
that a carbon price alone

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.780
will solve our problems.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.230
But it's incredibly
difficult to get there

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.830
because what nature really
cares about is carbon emissions

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.350
and suck-down, so the net
flux of carbon and time.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.270
And unfortunately, we are
doing ourselves no favors

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.130
until we can find
a way to translate

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.500
nature's currencies
of carbon in time,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.820
and perhaps land use and
water into financial terms

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.890
or translate our financial
terms into money--

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.600
I mean, into these
natural units,

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.040
we're not going to get there.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.320
So as an example,
many places have

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.270
done strategies in California.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.270
We set a target for
20% of our energy

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.730
to come from renewables by 2010.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.280
We missed the goal
through a party, got there

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.540
three years late.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.780
Our next goal for 2020
was one-third of energy

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.160
coming from renewables.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.810
And we are already over that.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:03.000
California will probably in 2020
somewhere between 37% and 39%

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.530
powered by renewables.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.450
That is amazing in itself.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.080
And while every jurisdiction
has a different definition,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.640
California does not count
large hydro or nuclear

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.660
as a renewable.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.510
You can agree or disagree that's
just the bookkeeping California

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:19.560
chose to.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:25.830
Our 2030 goal was 50% powered
by renewables by 2030.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.710
But senator Kevin
de Leon and others

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.780
worked to pass a bill,
Senate Bill 100--

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.030
100% of our energy from
clean sources by 2045

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.240
and 60% by 2030.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.700
And California is
certainly on path

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:47.310
to meet that incredibly
lofty-sounding goal for 2030.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.090
Now, this leads me to not only
talk about these climate goals

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:54.060
that I've done most of the
talk so far about, but also

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.940
about the real
secret sauce in this.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.510
And that is that
a number of places

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.540
related to discussions that
have now led to the Sunrise

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.200
Movement, to the Green New
Deal, to a new bill that

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.340
now has Republican and
Democratic support--

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.800
sponsors at least-- in
the House and Senate,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.130
to start having a
revenue-neutral carbon price.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.350
All of these have led to
a much bigger discussion

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.320
not just about climate
change, but about equity.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.660
And I really want to sort
of hammer on that as we go.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.760
Because I actually
am amazed we've

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.930
gotten as far as we have without
making a more just version

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.612
of this transition possible.

00:30:32.612 --> 00:30:35.070
So, some of the things that
have happened in the California

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.140
process along the
way are interesting.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.830
Leading up to this, 10 years
ago we started with an effort

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.190
to say all new homes
built in California

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:48.120
after 2020 must generate as
much energy as they consume.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.740
So, some mixture of energy
efficiency and rooftop solar

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.110
is kind of the
poster child for it.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.610
But it could be heat pumps.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:00.600
It could be ownership share in a
wind farm not on your property.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.890
A whole variety of things
have gone into this.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.000
Which, when we initially
proposed this nine years ago,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.510
people thought
were impossible, it

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.550
has passed its
law in California.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:13.140
And now we get
construction companies

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.199
saying we only have 11
months to get to this target.

00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:18.990
And we say, well, you
could have come along

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.270
with the process and the
discussion ever since.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.210
And we're getting all
kinds of clever proposals

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.090
for what to do in a home
that simply can't have solar

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.970
on the roof because of trees
or a place like Pacifica

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.220
with a lot of fog.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.500
And we're finding
interesting proposals.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.610
Our equivalent of Star Market
in California, Safeway,

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.647
has now proposed they
would host solar.

00:31:41.647 --> 00:31:43.230
Your home doesn't
have it on the roof.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.330
But you have an ownership
share in that solar

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.980
they host on their building.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.790
And it's part of your property.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.160
So, there's lots of
things going on there

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.700
to sort of think through
how to do it differently.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.990
At the same time that we pass
this one, it is now law--

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.579
and it was considered a reach--

00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:00.870
there was an even bigger reach.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.520
We passed, at the same time,
that by 2030 office buildings

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.820
of indeterminate height have
to also be carbon neutral.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.960
Now, we know how to do this one.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.570
But we do not know
how to do this one.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.510
But in that go-along with
an innovative strategy,

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.890
California's actually
adopted this as well.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.680
So it's a really
interesting mix.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.380
Another version of
the story about how

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.950
do we convert our dialogue
to think not just about money

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.920
is something that several
places in the world

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.090
started to highlight.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.920
The California
version was to say,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.995
let's not just have a quota
system for clean energy.

00:32:36.995 --> 00:32:39.750
Let's also do it for our fuels.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.400
10 years ago we started
to work on this.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.670
Almost everyone
who thought going

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:48.502
to clean fuels for vehicles
were thinking biofuels.

00:32:48.502 --> 00:32:49.710
I was certainly part of that.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.570
I wrote a paper that was widely
used to set a standard for it.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.030
We went on 60 Minutes
and a variety of things.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.820
And that rule basically
said, phase out gasoline.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.220
Move to biofuels.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.240
Except that you have to
do the cradle to grave,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.780
the lifecycle analysis of
are those biofuels actually

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.590
sustainable?

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.260
Well, it turns out, of
course if your biofuel comes

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.020
from urban waste
from Boston, probably

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.730
it's a good thing
to use it for fuel.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.700
If it comes from cutting
down Amazonian forest to then

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.827
grow soy, not so good.

00:33:22.827 --> 00:33:25.410
And so, what California did was
adopt something called the Low

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.030
Carbon Fuel Standard.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.780
And it said that if gasoline is
our benchmark in terms of grams

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.120
of carbon per megajoule
we have to take

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.160
into account the source.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.380
And so, if you move
to Midwestern corn--

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.000
just look at the
blue for a second--

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.320
it's somewhat better.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.450
Sugar cane is
quite a bit better,

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.180
ethanol that's made from
dry materials are better.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.920
But none of them are home runs.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.850
They are a few percent better
than gasoline in lifecycle.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.750
They don't solve the story.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.390
And in fact, there's
a vicious debate

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.720
going on around the green, which
is called the Indirect Land

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.320
Use.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.920
And it's a very controversial
economic part of the story.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.850
But there are lots of fuels
that are unambiguously better.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.400
And so there is a
future for biofuels.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.199
But as we all know,
there's been a push

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:14.080
into electricity, which has
really changed the game.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.179
And I'll come back to
that in a little bit.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.190
So, when I mentioned
this timetable,

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.880
we need to get to roughly
80%, or 90%, or even

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.929
100% decarbonised, depending
how sort of optimistic

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:32.030
you are by 2050, that's
not the whole story.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.580
The other story is encapsulated
in this paper from which

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:39.710
Christina Figueres, who was the
chair of the Climate Process

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.290
and now she's head of the
European Climate Foundation,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.020
highlighted.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.620
And that is that every year
we go by with increasing

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.780
emissions, that's the tan line.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.280
Of course, it makes
our peak higher,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.409
so you have to reduce
emissions more.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.060
But that's not my worry.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.262
I believe we can beat this
down for the technologies

00:34:56.262 --> 00:34:58.220
we'll be talking about
in the next few minutes.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.400
The worry, though, is
that if we keep that 2050

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.580
goal as our serious
goal, which it must be,

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.420
then the slope of these lines
really becomes the worry.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.140
The blue line, or whatever
that turquoise color is,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:17.000
a 3% decarbonisation
sustained for decades.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.260
The rust-colored one is
4% and the red is 5%.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.650
And the problem is that we're
talking about not just one

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.340
or two years.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.510
We're talking about decade after
decade of sustained innovation.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.750
And the two
best-documented examples

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.580
are that California for about
seven years maintained 3%.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.100
And while China's
energy demand grew,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.100
they cleaned their mix so
dramatically that they also

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.780
averaged about 3%.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.350
But no places
averaged the 4% or 5%.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:53.060
And so, the longer we wait to
really start this in earnest,

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.630
the more the slope of this
line becomes the real challenge

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.260
in the process.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.830
And that's really the issue.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:03.230
And so, the other far too
general or sort of undiscovered

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.950
observation for me is that we
used to think of the energy

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.270
system as a supertanker.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.480
So it takes-- the
analogy is not only oil,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.540
but also takes miles
and miles to turn.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.780
But more and more, we need
to think about it somehow

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.860
as a supertanker
trying to be a startup.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.220
And how do we mix
the culture of this

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.740
is the biggest investment we
have in terms of infrastructure

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.700
on the planet?

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.466
And we need to change it
dramatically, quickly.

00:36:28.466 --> 00:36:29.840
So, in the last
10 minutes I want

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.610
to highlight some examples.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.350
And I'll do them
very quickly in terms

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.170
of some of the
waves of innovation

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.960
that have really given us some
tools for decarbonisation.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.260
The first one is my favorite
most complicated graph

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.637
in the world--

00:36:43.637 --> 00:36:45.720
maybe not the most complicated
graph in the world,

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.600
we'll leave that
for astrophysics--

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.390
but the most complicated
graph in my field.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:54.590
And that is a graph showing
the progress in solar energy

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.930
on the material science side.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.810
So, this incredibly
busy picture just

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:05.210
shows, for the traditional
big silicon cells

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:10.010
to smaller blue, the
crystaline ones, to thin film,

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.610
new emerging technologies to
the reds, new [INAUDIBLE] bytes,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.680
and quantum dots,
and organic cells.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.070
You're seeing the best
efficiency of a whole variety

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.220
of technologies with the
laboratory group that

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.190
held that record at the
time, and yes, the slope

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.910
of that line over time gives
you one metric of innovation.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.670
And thankfully, these newer
entrants coming onto the scene

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.050
have higher slopes.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.700
They're racing more rapidly.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.900
Very exciting.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.760
And it's this mixture of
technology push, new innovation

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.600
funded by governments, by
companies that gives us

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.050
a really diverse resource.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:52.380
Meaning, there's many
different solar technologies.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.589
Back when I started
this, when I started

00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:56.130
working on this a
long time back when

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.650
I did my first summer of work
at the US National Renewable

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.880
Energy Laboratory,
there was really only

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.200
in the purple and the blue
that were seen as competitors.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.560
Now all of these are looking
interesting candidates.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.610
That, plus increasing
manufacturing largely in Asia

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.217
and markets growing around
the world-- first in Japan,

00:38:14.217 --> 00:38:15.800
and then Germany,
and then California,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.040
and now many places--

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.170
have led to kind of
a famous picture.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:23.320
And that is this thing
called the Learning Curve.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.400
And this is loved by people
who think about applied energy.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.250
I think it's loathed by some
of my economics friends.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.820
But the idea here is, notice
this is a log-log plot.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.380
No apologies made.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:40.740
So, price on the y-axis and
order of magnitude changes

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.610
and production on the x-axis,
in log-log space you get

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:45.900
a so-called power law--

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.090
this is Moore's law--

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:51.180
where we see a very
steady decline.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.160
For most technologies
that are mass produced,

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.280
you get about a
20% drop in price

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.370
every time you double the
amount in manufacturing.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:04.730
If you trust it, you
can then forward price.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:05.960
You can give subsidies.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.120
You can give incentives
so that we manufacture

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.300
and deploy more,
banking on a lower cost.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.220
And solar has done
this remarkably well.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.940
So, when I started
working on this area,

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.130
solar was $0.40 to
$0.60 per kilowatt hour,

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.410
depending where you are.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:24.920
Now we have projects going in
initially in the Middle East

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.620
and now elsewhere,
solar at $0.03.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.240
People said that was impossible.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.930
Then in, first Saudi
Arabia, and then New Mexico,

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:36.020
and now Mexico, and now
Chile and the Atacama,

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.040
we have solar projects going
in for under $0.20 a kilowatt

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.530
hour, commercial cost.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.840
And this is just transformative.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.930
And that diversity of
technology I mentioned

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.810
means that there's all
kinds of amazing innovations

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:54.530
to come if we keep deploying
to give us demand pull,

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.210
and if we keep investing.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.900
In fact, right now there
are transparent solar,

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.330
there is solar that works
off of the indoor light,

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.850
so you can have solar on your
roof, general electricity,

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.760
recapture and solar
inside a building.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.830
We have thin and flexible solar.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.380
We have technologies that
are really interesting.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.210
We just hired a
professor at Berkeley,

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.670
and her specialty
is wearable solar.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.290
So, your jacket is solar.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.670
You can charge up devices.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.590
I mean, it's a
fascinating world.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.800
Almost none of it was
forecast some decades ago.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.520
So, these learning
curves are wonderful.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.432
They are heuristic.

00:40:27.432 --> 00:40:28.640
There is a debate about them.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.190
I'm writing a book right now
called The Learning Curve

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:35.400
to look at the mix of
technology push and aspirations.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.090
And if we look at them,
they're generally sloped.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.160
You can see the
photovoltaic, 1 PV.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.650
There's wind,
there's NOx controls.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.200
And then there's
this nuclear one.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.990
And that's a problem.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.595
So, if these are
learning curves,

00:40:50.595 --> 00:40:52.470
I don't know if you'd
call that an unlearning

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.300
curve, a forgetting curve--

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.080
I'm going to get in trouble.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.560
But that's the data for the US.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.580
Now, you might posit that the
next generation of molten salt

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.980
reactors, of traveling
wave reactors,

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.649
of small modular reactors
will change this entirely.

00:41:07.649 --> 00:41:08.190
And it might.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.380
And I am a professor
of nuclear engineering.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:14.010
But the actual data shows
that in the last few decades

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.370
of US installation, nuclear
prices have been rising.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.106
And that is a huge worry.

00:41:19.106 --> 00:41:20.730
In fact, I won't even
go into the story

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.104
of when nuclear
was first brought

00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:23.790
to the market in
the United States.

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.190
So, there was a campaign
to make nuclear attractive

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.230
to homemakers, women.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:33.660
That program had the
awesome name, Atom and Eve.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.820
I'm just going to move right
along past Atom and Eve.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.840
The new player on the world
of energy is in fact, storage.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.380
And storage, while it's
much newer in terms

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.170
of the diversity, has the
same interesting range

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.750
of learning curves, from lead
acid, batteries, and cars,

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:54.020
to nickel metal hydride,
to lithium ion batteries.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.600
And we spend a lot of
time with our colleagues

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.670
at Imperial College,
and Cambridge,

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.970
and elsewhere examining
these learning curves.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.450
And actually today,
storage is improving

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:08.060
as fast as solar ever did.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.160
And that brings me to the
last part of the talk.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.830
And that is that we now
work with governments

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.170
to build models of
their power systems

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.720
to think about what
investments in new transmission

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.900
lines, in energy storage,
in energy efficiency

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.240
will you need to reach
a variety of targets?

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.580
And so right now,
the green are places

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.870
where we have active models
in use by governments.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.420
And the blue are places where
we've promised and committed

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.880
to building a model
of the power system.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.560
And for the
electrical engineers,

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.260
this is a so-called
capacity expansion model.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.220
It is a beast in
terms of computation.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.270
I won't get into
any of that here.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.580
But we've had some really
interesting lessons come out

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.800
of this process.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.850
And the biggest one is that
as these new technologies have

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:56.240
emerged, we have
discovered a whole variety

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.130
of interesting new
ways to do things.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.960
So, for those who have
have been to Kenya,

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.540
this is the Ngong
Hills Wind Farm.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.570
This wind farm was the
first wind farm in Kenya.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.460
There's lots of good wind sites.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.980
It was placed here
because the Ngong Hills,

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.690
you can see them from Nairobi.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.340
And specifically,
you can see them

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.120
from the offices of
the state-run utility.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.070
And so, you can see
them in operation.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.840
There was real learning
and experience.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.990
And Kenya has now progressed
to be this incredible climate

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.680
leader.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.930
Of course, with some
investment support

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:28.310
by countries I won't mention--

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.110
United States and China--

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.020
there is now an effort to
build a coal plant in China.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.980
And so, we will see about that.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.340
The other interesting feature of
this history of mass production

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.800
and technology
innovation evolution

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.410
is that there are
lots of areas where

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:48.170
we didn't plan for solar to be
the opportunity that it's now

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.670
become.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:54.190
So, sub-Saharan Africa, a $25
billion dollar a year industry.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.590
Very expensive
over its lifetime,

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.170
but very inexpensive to
bring home a little lantern.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.030
But then you're
committed to buying fuel.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.120
Well, the range of
small solar products

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.630
that initially looked like just
glorified flashlights that then

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.020
became flashlights that
have built-in radios,

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.116
and flashlights that now
get better and better

00:44:14.116 --> 00:44:15.490
at a whole variety
of tasks, mean

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.860
that we've taken those
incredible costs decline

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:18.760
curves.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.210
And the fastest form
of new energy access,

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.450
not powering a whole home,
but device by device,

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.120
is now-- we call
Pay as You Go Solar.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.030
So this, is basically
you take the device home

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.950
with often no down payment.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.250
On trusted mobile money, you
make daily or weekly payments

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:37.060
online.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.680
You bring the device home.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.710
And the data science
and IT aspects

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.360
have just become fascinating.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.940
So, in a big project we
did with the World Bank

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:47.770
we studied this process.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:50.830
And as an example, this
was an initial sample

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.460
of 1,000 homes that had
these devices in them.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.130
And we looked at what people
were going to have to do.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:59.740
They were going to have to pay
about $0.50 a day on average

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:03.830
over a year to own the
devices I just showed you.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.570
So we started to gather the
payment histories of people

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.030
and look at the state of
charge of their batteries.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:12.520
And we observed oh, here's one.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.290
They're paying it off just fine.

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:16.960
But here's one where they don't
seem to be using it at all.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:22.450
So, we collected here were
those financial histories

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:26.080
of the 1,000 or so
dots on the graph.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.860
The blue ones are all
people who were paying off,

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.600
and at the end of
the year they paid

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.640
enough to own their device.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.530
The red ones are people who
started to pay, whatever else,

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:38.470
but ultimately
didn't pay enough.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.250
And the company that
provided it turned it off.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.290
And some of these
stories are just amazing.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:47.320
What we started to
do a few months in

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.390
was to send text
messages to anyone

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:50.770
whose device wasn't working.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.480
It said, can you
tell us what's wrong?

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.680
And they would text back
oh, yeah, it's not working.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.721
And we asked where it is.

00:45:55.721 --> 00:45:57.400
Well, it's actually
under the mattress.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.020
Well, you know, the solar
panels don't work well

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.070
under the mattress.

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:03.520
Or it's outside, but it's
covered with cow poop.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.040
And so we send
text messages back,

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.290
doubling the usage
rate in six months.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.520
And so they ramped up.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.100
We still had about 8% failures.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.490
But remarkably, ramped up.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:15.490
The demand rose.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.590
Companies began to
build other products.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.010
Now you can take
home televisions,

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.770
DC-powered refrigerators,
a whole variety of devices

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:29.110
to make the mixture of those
solar panels, and LED lights,

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.180
and little batteries work.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.920
And then there's big batteries.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.680
To meet California's
climate goal,

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.280
we used this model, this model
called Switch I mentioned,

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.852
to examine what would be needed.

00:46:40.852 --> 00:46:42.310
And we found in
California is we're

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.850
going to need a lot of storage
to come online, both long term

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.220
seasonal storage
like reservoirs,

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:51.580
but also storage that works with
you over the course of a day.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.970
And through that, we
wrote a requirement--

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:58.300
that now Germany
has copied as well,

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.160
and now Denmark is writing one--

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.600
where this is a new
type of battery.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.240
There's actually an
amazing professor

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.790
here at Harvard,
Michael Aziz who works

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.770
on one of these flow batteries.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.840
Unlike the several
thousand cycles

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.460
in your cell phone,
this flow battery,

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.420
it's a sulfuric
acid liquid battery.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.350
This one is powered by solar.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.620
And this has millions of cycles.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.530
And so, you can change
the story to remarkably--

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.570
and this was one of
these early installations

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.567
to provide storage under
the California grid.

00:47:28.567 --> 00:47:30.650
The other story of the
grid is really interesting.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.320
And that is as we install
more and more solar,

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.930
we go from a demand curve
from the middle of the night

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.380
that's pretty flat-- only
students are awake, we think--

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.140
and then the more
solar we install,

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.080
California's on a path to
have a million solar rooftops

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.620
by the end of next year,
which means roughly one 1

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.000
of 15 households.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.310
But when you install
more and more solar,

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:56.300
the net demand, or the demand
left over, gets hollowed out.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.330
So we now have a situation
where there's very little demand

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:02.690
that we forecast to be on the
grid during the afternoon.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.330
But everyone comes home,
and you turn devices on.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.730
So you get this
incredibly sharp ramp.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.500
And this is called
the duck curve,

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.940
where we will have this huge,
not only need for power,

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.470
but over this short
period of time.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.990
Well, another way to
look at that duck curve

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:21.290
is that every power
engineer over about 40

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:24.530
knows that peak demand
comes in the late afternoon

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.470
when devices are on
at home and office,

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.420
and on the hottest summer days.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.860
California now forecasts
our peak demand

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.040
will be at night in the
winter because of low solar.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.340
And so when you look at this
curve a little differently,

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.990
this is an excess of
green during the afternoon

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:48.640
that if you have storage such
as the commercial one I just

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.260
showed you or your
electric vehicle,

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.340
you could sell power back
and make that available later

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:54.840
in the day.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.330
And so we're seeing this
kind of remarkable thinking

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:00.790
about how to dual-use
your electric vehicle.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:03.730
And the economics, once the
vehicle prices are the same,

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:05.050
are remarkable.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:09.400
At three $3.50 a gallon, it's
about $0.14 per mile to drive

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.360
your car.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.650
But at rooftop solar, those
commercial rates, it is $0.01.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.540
So more than an
order of magnitude

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.690
cheaper to drive your
electric vehicle.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:22.930
Now, the vehicles themselves
need to be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:24.650
But we're getting
pretty close to that.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.410
And the last thing I'm going
to highlight at the end

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.618
is that we not only have
Tesla thinking they're going

00:49:28.618 --> 00:49:32.170
not only sell you all
cars, but electric trucks.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:34.870
And we have things
like charging lanes

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:38.320
where you inductively charge
as you drive down the road.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.940
And instead of
parking places where

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.760
you must pull in,
charging pads that

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.005
can be moved from car to car.

00:49:45.005 --> 00:49:47.380
So, instead of running out to
your car in the parking lot

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.240
at Google, or Amazon,
wherever else,

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.760
the charging pads just simply
move from vehicle to vehicle

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.020
to charge you up.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.240
And if we don't do
it, guess who will?

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:59.020
This is China's map not
only of the 2.3 million

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:05.080
EVs they have and the
279,000 charging stations.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.085
But on their national
map they also track

00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:09.460
the number of electric vehicles
in the United States, EU,

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.330
and Japan.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.000
So you can bet they are
thinking hard about how

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.296
to make this happen.

00:50:14.296 --> 00:50:15.670
Now, the last
thing I want to say

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:21.100
because I'm right at the end
is that one of the challenges

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.810
that I mentioned
the beginning is

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.820
that if we don't make
this transition one that's

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.090
much more inclusive, we make
our job impossibly hard.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:32.230
And the climate scientists,
clean energy engineers

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.600
like myself, I think
have done a terrible job

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.070
of making this inclusive.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.910
And of course, if you provide
subsidies for electric vehicles

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:43.810
or for solar, whether you can
justify those learning curves

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:48.910
or not, you are subsidizing
the rich with the poor

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.310
to put these technologies
in place, right?

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:53.020
And when you have
socialism for the rich

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.390
and capitalism for poor,
that is not a recipe

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.250
for an inclusive process.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:01.030
And so we've done a fair amount
of work to look at this story.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:04.150
And so we used a large
60-million rooftop data

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.100
from Google, did
a lot of machine

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.170
learning that I won't
get into the details,

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.330
to look at the roofs, to
track the solar panels,

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:15.830
to look where they are, and
to use census data to examine

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.510
which homes they're on.

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:19.124
And so the sad
part of the story--

00:51:19.124 --> 00:51:21.290
I'll just skip, I'll just
go to the conclusion right

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:22.040
at the end--

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.820
is that even when you
control for income,

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:31.980
solar is 30% to 40% more
prevalent in neighborhoods that

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:37.230
are white, Caucasian-dominated
and 30% to 70% less prevalent

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.250
in Latino and African-American
neighborhoods,

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.780
even when income
is controlled for.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.490
And so, if we don't think
about ways to do this better,

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.770
subsidies for
community groups, ways

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:53.310
that landlords and renters can
share the benefits of going

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:57.660
solar, we make this transition
incredibly difficult.

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:01.260
We make this story about a green
transition near impossible.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:05.370
So, I'm going to leave you just
at the end with the last part

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:09.780
of the story that came out
of not only the IPCC and then

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.460
the climate
conference in Poland,

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.890
but what has now becomed
discussed as this Green New

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:14.550
Deal.

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:15.925
So, one of the
things I was asked

00:52:15.925 --> 00:52:17.790
to do by Governor
Schwarzenegger was

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:22.050
to build a carbon footprint
tool, a calculator, that will

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:23.950
allow you to look at your data.

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:25.020
And so we did that.

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:28.220
We built versions that
are available for homes,

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.220
businesses, and schools.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.530
It's called
CoolClimate.Berkeley.edu.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.890
The data sets are wonderful.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:39.510
There's kilowatt hours used per
for each zip code on average,

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:44.610
natural gas consumption, goods
and services, transportation

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:46.390
and food.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.990
And at the end of the
day, what you discover

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:52.230
is that the ability
to think differently

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:53.320
is kind of remarkable.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.080
So the last page when
you go through one

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.840
of these online calculators,
this one that we built,

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.550
is that it tells
you your footprint.

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.746
That's the top part.

00:53:00.746 --> 00:53:03.120
But then this take action page
is the thing that's really

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.320
caught a lot of attention.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.730
When we release a new version,
we get like 100,000 hits a day.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.640
So, this take action
list tells you

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:15.540
all the things in our database
that you, the homeowner,

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:17.790
or school, or
business didn't do,

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.520
and what each one will
cost you or save you

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.500
in money in carbon terms.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:26.850
And so we have got this
sort of hilarious process

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.010
where people will
use the calculator.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.430
And they quickly go and look at
the most equivalent homes-- so,

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:34.350
this is called keeping
up with the Joneses,

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.260
where you look at I have
five people in my home,

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.150
it's a 3,000 square foot home.

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:40.770
And people look
down the database

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.710
to see what do other homes
that are equivalent to you,

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:47.700
both in terms of size, number
of people, geographic location.

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.620
And then go look at
what people did here

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.020
and look at the stories
about which of these things

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.560
people really took advantage of.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.850
And so, this process we now
do for all of California.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.950
We do it for Germany and Japan.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:02.130
And zip code by zip
code, this is actually

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.110
down to the parcel level.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:07.407
We see all kinds of
interesting dynamics

00:54:07.407 --> 00:54:09.240
in terms of people
learning from each other.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.420
And I want to end with
that one because one

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.760
of the critical things that's
emerged from the climate

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.680
process is that as fast or as
slow as we are in this process

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.080
is certainly a function
of new technology

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.080
and of innovative
policies-- hopefully

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.090
more progressive
than regressive--

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:32.580
but policies that find a way
to empower individuals to make

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.080
decisions, whether
the individual is

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.830
a homeowner, a school, a
business, or a municipality.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:41.220
And if we don't find a way
to really enable all of that,

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.100
we make this job of this just
transition in this energy

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.750
process near impossible.

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:47.370
So, I know I raced at the end.

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:48.930
But I wanted to
highlight the degree

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:51.060
to which this sort
of information system

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.650
has really changed the story.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:54.020
I would love to hear questions.

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:58.620
I'd also love to hear examples
of things that have worked

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:00.990
and not worked in
your own experience.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:04.380
Was it hard or easy to do this
or that, to weatherize, to buy

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.310
into this and that?

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.680
So, I hope that you'll
share some of those.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.750
And I want to thank you
all for coming tonight.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.612
Thanks very much.

00:55:11.612 --> 00:55:14.516
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.190
- Hi, and thank you for
your insightful talk.

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:35.210
And I would like to ask, since
we mostly focused on California

00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:37.610
and other countries,
what do you think

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:39.800
the challenge will
be for us to expand

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.310
to other states and
the United States?

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.780
- So, great question.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.500
We're actually in a better
spot than one might think.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.710
Over half of US states
have these clean energy

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:55.100
targets, these RPSs.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.800
President Trump did cancel
the Clean Power Plan

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.490
that I thought was a
wonderful piece of policy.

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:05.930
But we have seen coal
use drop dramatically.

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:10.340
So coal that was over
60% of US electricity

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.920
is now down to the 30% range.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.500
The entire value of
the coal industry,

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:20.300
the Capex of all US coal,
is under $50 billion.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.750
Meaning that Jeff Bezos and
Bill Gates could buy two of them

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.310
if they wanted.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:28.210
So, the idea that we
are wedded to coal

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:31.720
anymore is certainly
not part of the story.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.360
That opens up an interesting
next part of the story.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.717
And that is that in some
parts of the country--

00:56:37.717 --> 00:56:38.800
California as an example--

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.890
gas is the dirtiest
fuel possible.

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.500
And it's one we know
we need to phase out.

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.590
But in other places, the
biggest change they can make

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.270
is to move from coal to gas.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:56.080
And so, you get this
interesting mix state by state.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.170
The Clean Power Plan-- something
that I would recommend whoever

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.080
decides they want to get the
US back on track put back

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.780
into effect right away--

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:08.440
said each state needed to
decarbonise by a third relative

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.730
to its own baseline.

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.240
It didn't require states that
have started late to battle

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.270
with New York and California,
that started earlier on.

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.440
But it's given us a mix.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.590
And so, actually I think right
now we were in a good spot.

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:23.350
If we do get the Clean Power
Plan restarted in some form,

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:24.670
we'd really be there.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:28.690
And the sad part of the story
is that the Clean Power Plan

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:31.540
actually called for
$8 billion dollars

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.590
to be provided as retraining
and retirement money for people

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.000
in the coal industry.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.370
And the sad fact
is that I do not

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:42.970
believe the coal industry
will ever get as good an offer

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:45.040
as it got under the
Clean Power Plan, which

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.010
means that the retirements
that will ultimately happen now

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.980
are going to be uglier and
more painful for working class

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.890
Americans.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:56.630
And so, I think the US could
rapidly get back on this path.

00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.130
But I fear that unless we really
do get this kind of Green New

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:05.031
Deal mentality, we are going to
stick it to the least able to

00:58:05.031 --> 00:58:05.530
deal.

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:08.113
And that's the people who have
been in coal mines for so long.

00:58:08.113 --> 00:58:08.950
So, great question.

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:10.033
I'll go faster afterwards.

00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:11.820
Sorry.

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.090
- I'm going to take
you up on your offer.

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:19.230
This is the third iteration
of my solar backpack.

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:21.700
And I suspect I'm
the only person here

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.900
who is carrying solar?

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.960
- Nope, I am.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.460
- Good.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:39.940
What it is a $10 solar
charger and light,

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:41.040
and a piece of plastic.

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.890
And I use this as my headlight
on my bike as I bike home.

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:51.010
$10 retail, online,
anywhere around the world.

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:54.190
What one billion plus people--

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:55.060
- Without access.

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:55.990
- Without access.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:59:00.400
Retail price, $10 billion,
which is less than a day's worth

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.940
of what we spend on
the global military.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.050
Right?

00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:05.980
So, that's one thing.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.120
- I'm asking you to jump
to the question Just to--

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.452
I'm in agreement, but yeah.

00:59:09.452 --> 00:59:10.660
- I will give you a question.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.350
But I'll give you
another resource.

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:19.660
Geotherapy, right, which is
the marine carbon project

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:25.330
in one case, this is a way
to bring down the carbon out

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:26.950
of the atmosphere.

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:31.750
And Boston Cambridge happens
to be a hotbed of information

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:32.650
about this.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:37.000
But it's not happening
at Harvard and MIT.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:37.500
- OK.

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:43.100
- I had an entirely
different comment to make.

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.000
- OK.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.050
- I was wondering where the
long-term you thought it made

00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:53.060
any sense to change the
curriculum of free college

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:56.570
education-- and what stage
is not quite clear to me--

00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:00.980
to teach these things
for the long term

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.290
and teach the
teachers to produce?

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:04.790
- Right.

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:08.660
So, I mean, the
obvious answer is yes.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.430
And thankfully, Harvard has
one of the most innovative

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:17.000
professors of science education,
and that's Eric Mazur.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.070
And I have seen just
remarkable things come out

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.195
of the cooperation that
they and many other groups,

01:00:21.195 --> 01:00:23.030
but Eric's team
in particular, has

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.549
done to think about how to
integrate these programs.

01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:27.590
One of the most interesting
things at the climate

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:32.210
conference, and much of the sort
of attention to this incredibly

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:35.450
eloquent and powerful
Swedish 15-year-old

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:39.110
has been the real demand
for schools striking

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:41.450
over not getting
better climate action,

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:43.130
not getting better education.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:45.260
And when the kids in
schools are asking for it,

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.670
I mean I would say this is
kind of perfect territory.

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:49.880
And so, I would absolutely
think that's the case.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.190
You know, every science
museum, every school,

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:54.200
there's huge
opportunities to really

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.180
make this a core part
of the curriculum.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.900
So I'm hoping-- and there
are some really good efforts.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.150
But they are individual pockets.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:06.410
They have not become
the ubiquitous, better,

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:09.110
environmental and
science literacy

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:10.580
that many people
have called for,

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:12.950
and so Pedro Noguera, and Eric
Mazur, and a number of others

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.030
have been remarkable on this.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.365
But I think this is absolutely
critical to this process.

01:01:19.454 --> 01:01:20.370
- Thank you very much.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:21.930
Great talk.

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.120
Clearly you're doing
wonderful things.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.310
I do have a concern.

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.230
And I'm interested
in your insight

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:32.520
into whether locally green
policies in California

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.040
contribute to it being so
expensive to live there

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.140
that no one can move there.

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.420
So they all move to
Texas, where they're

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.880
forced to run their air
conditioner for nine months out

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.430
of the year.

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:44.760
To locally green
policies, is there

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.094
a risk that there's a net effect
that they're globally brown?

01:01:48.094 --> 01:01:50.010
- Yeah, so it's a really
interesting question.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:53.340
I mean, this is part of this
whole doing a just transition.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.180
And the story is not the same
in every single neighborhood.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.360
But the California
data, the data

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.670
from Portugal, the
data from Denmark

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:08.010
is very strongly indicating that
high residential prices are not

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.470
due to higher cost electricity.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:14.610
In fact, California has some of
the most expensive electricity

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:17.580
in the country but some
of the lowest electricity

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.460
bills in the country.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.140
And that's largely
because per kilowatt hour

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.700
is more expensive, but by being
very aggressive on efficiency--

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.640
as is true in Florida,
Wisconsin, New York,

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.880
it is not just a
California thing--

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.260
that overall story
has been a plus.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.570
And that leads me
to one other thing

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:38.120
that I cut out just because
I obviously ran long.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.540
And that is that the
data is unequivocal

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:45.830
that clean energy
technologies generate more

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:47.810
jobs than the fossil sector.

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:50.840
Now, that's not because
it is superior in any way.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.750
That's because if you're
building a new technology

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:56.780
base and one where you're
not paying for fuel,

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.830
it's not surprising you get
more jobs per dollar or RND

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.206
invested.

01:03:02.206 --> 01:03:03.830
It's that you're
building a new sector.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:05.480
But the fact that
you're not putting

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.240
a huge amount of the
money into the fuel

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.720
means that you're investing in
people and companies and IP.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.110
And so, we have incredibly
diverse data sets

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:18.020
that show hugely
larger job creation.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:22.490
And my worry is that places
like California that have really

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:25.190
doubled down on
it, where over 40%

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:28.520
of all US venture
capital in clean tech

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.520
goes through California, are
going to do well in this deal.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.850
But when-- I won't name
states, Mississippi--

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.760
and others that are not exactly
on the leading edge finally

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.550
decide to go there,
that green jobs dividend

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.530
will been eaten up by
those who went early.

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:45.620
And so instead of being
a penalty to go early,

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.820
there is a big benefit.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.780
But this has to
be more inclusive.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.570
California is less than
1% of global emissions.

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:56.030
And so green in California
but not spreading the policies

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:59.150
that we have, the
policies from Bangladesh,

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:02.300
from Kenya, from Denmark,
from places that are really

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.032
jumped way ahead,
from Morocco, means

01:04:04.032 --> 01:04:05.240
we're not going to get there.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:08.540
And so, I think we are
highlighting a key worry.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.550
But the places that
have acted actually

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:13.059
have done quite well in
the deal on that basis.

01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:15.350
California is too expensive
for a lot of other reasons.

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.570
That is everyone
chooses to live within--

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:20.390
myself included-- within
20 miles of the coast.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:24.470
And the key residential
hubs are also

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:26.810
the places for these
booms of new companies.

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:28.010
Housing prices are crazy.

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:30.410
We have graduate
students at Berkeley

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:33.980
on food stamps as a result
of unaffordable housing.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.870
But it's not due
to clean energy.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.449
The worry is proper.

01:04:38.449 --> 01:04:39.490
- I just have a question.

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:41.323
You were talking about
the Clean Power Plan.

01:04:41.323 --> 01:04:43.900
I was wondering what you think
about the Regional Greenhouse

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.540
Gas Initiative as
compared to that.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:52.180
- Yeah, so, you guys are
under a program as well.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.930
The challenge here has
been that while RGGI is now

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:59.590
improving a fair amount, the
carbon price is very low.

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:03.160
And the worry is that
if we had started

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.730
this process of launching
carbon prices early on,

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:09.940
a low price now that ramped
up very slow would be fine.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:14.200
And the contrast would be this
new, bipartisan bill introduced

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.890
in the House and Senate is one
that calls for the carbon price

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:20.890
to start higher than
California's current price,

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.450
which is about $12 a ton.

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:26.380
Start more like $20 and
go up $10 every year.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.900
And that reflects
how much we need

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.420
to move more quickly because
we've really delayed.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.700
And so, you know, RGGI is good.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.120
The ETS, which has also had
its ups and downs, figuratively

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.440
and literally, is
also a good thing.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.310
But I think that the
lesson we've learned so far

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.800
is that a carbon
price is critical

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.510
because we need to
have this dialogue

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.880
between financial
metrics and others.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.090
But the places that have
moved ahead globally

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:55.090
have not done so relying
on a carbon price.

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:57.610
It is one arrow in the quiver.

01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:00.490
It's silver buckshot,
as Al Gore likes to say,

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.860
it's not a silver
bullet unless the price

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.960
gets so high for which
the politics may really

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.980
become challenging.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.110
So it's a neat point.

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:11.160
- Thanks for coming
and speaking with us.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.350
A friend of mine,
an economics grad,

01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:17.330
is moved to Brazil to work on
deforestation in the Amazon.

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:21.020
And I'm hoping to join her and
learn a little more down there.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:25.340
So, on a micro level, what are
some strategies that can help

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.380
on the deforestation forefront?

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.855
And on a larger level,
the election of Bolsonaro

01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:32.761
is definitely a very
bad news for the Amazon.

01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:33.260
- Yeah.

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.770
- What can we do on that
larger level other than shake

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:37.640
our heads?

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:41.720
- Well, so there is no silver
bullet answer to that question,

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.220
right?

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.750
But I mean it is
interesting that Brazil

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:49.460
got a huge amount of early, very
positive press for investing

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.410
in sugar cane ethanol.

01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:55.730
And the early sugar
cane was largely

01:06:55.730 --> 01:07:00.560
on land that had been that had
pulled back from former rubber

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.760
production and others.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.840
But it's become so profitable
that sugar expansion

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.600
and related crops,
digging into the Amazon

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.110
has become a huge issue.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.010
And so when you look at
that graph I went over

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:16.700
in terms of the carbon
content of liquid fuels,

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.990
it's just striking.

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:22.190
If you really do use
bio waste, then there

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:24.170
is no environmental
penalty you should

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:26.997
add to that liter of biofuel.

01:07:26.997 --> 01:07:28.580
But if you're cutting
down rainforest,

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:32.450
it turns out that you would need
to run your ethanol production

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:35.930
for over 100 years to
pay back the carbon that

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:38.480
was standing in those
trees in the rainforest.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.020
And believe me, this is
not a happy conversation.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.860
So, if everyone in the front row
is a current food farmer that

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.470
decides to go into
biofuels and you decide

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:50.970
you're only going to
collect [INAUDIBLE] waste,

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:52.850
and so you have
no carbon penalty.

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:55.940
But Alyssa here
says, you know, I'm

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:01.340
going to convert my current
corn production into biofuels.

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.780
I'm going to do it sustainably.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.720
I'm going to bless it, I'm going
to-- all these /It's is going

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.510
to be great.

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:10.340
But someone elsewhere says well,
she's no longer producing corn.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.900
I'm going to get
into that business.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:15.710
And increasingly-- that's
in Indonesia, Brazil, Congo,

01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:16.790
Malaysia--

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:18.830
then you're cutting
into forests that

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:21.620
had a much better
value as forests then

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.830
as ethanol producers.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:29.330
This conversation does
not go well in Brazil.

01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:32.540
And I have-- sort
of my mentor is

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.279
the father of the
Brazilian ethanol

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:36.050
industry, an amazing figure.

01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:38.870
He was the host of the
Rio Climate Conference.

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:42.620
And this is an area where
we're on sensitive ground.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.800
And so finding a way
to lead with the facts

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.279
and the numbers is my physics
tribe way to do things.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.310
But this is a really
hard conversation.

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.980
And so, working in the area,
what you guys are supposed

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.479
to do is what I recommend.

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.170
But finding a way
to compare the life

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:01.580
cycle, to cradle
to grave analysis

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.170
is a critical part of it.

01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:07.330
But that is that's
a seed change,

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.270
and so we don't
have a lot of years.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.020
But that's a critical
part of the process.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.130
That's hard.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:18.200
- My question was
around corporate world.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.240
When the CDP put
out a report that

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.380
says that 71% of
carbon emissions

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.870
are being generated
by 100 companies,

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:29.810
and we're talking about
in this sort of countries,

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.420
and governments, and
things, what are you

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.029
or others in your field
doing to help educate

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:39.080
and these companies transition
away from this carbon emission?

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.750
- So, this is
actually an area where

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:44.882
my economics colleagues can give
much better answers than I do.

01:09:44.882 --> 01:09:46.340
And this is the
place where I would

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.580
argue that carbon pricing
can have the most value.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.399
The fact that carbon enters
our economy through us

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:53.960
through so few spigots--

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.460
you mentioned the
kind of, you know,

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.260
on the order of 100
companies-- that's

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.120
a remarkably small number.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.610
So arguments to regulate
carbon at the user end

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:06.440
may be the standard
policymaking tool.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.990
But doing it upstream
makes much more sense

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:11.630
in terms of of efficiency,
even if the increased price

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:13.100
gets passed down.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.290
The challenge, of
course, is that if you

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:18.260
increase the price for
production for those companies

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.320
and don't find a way to
give back to low income

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.990
people around the
planet, then your policy

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:26.240
might be for the
planet but it's not

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.370
part of this just or
equitable transition.

01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:32.600
And so, one of the features
that I'm hoping the dialogue

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.860
around the bill--

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.720
I really like the
bill in many ways

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.550
that's in front of
the House and Senate--

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:41.720
is to not just rebate
all of the revenues back

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.490
to all Californians equally--

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:45.320
I said Californians,
sorry about that--

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.480
to all Americans equally.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.490
But to actually
say no, we're going

01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:53.660
to give back an extra share to
the lowest income Californian.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:57.820
So, what I would do is a
hybrid of the Ocasio-Cortez.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.130
And that would be if you are
within 200% of the poverty

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:05.390
line, I would give you back
your share but also a share

01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:09.320
taken from the top
0.01%, and use that money

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.830
both to give back to
low income Americans.

01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:14.300
And a part that's
not in the bill,

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.070
there is no provision
to harvest money

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.040
from the bill for research.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.620
And I would argue if you want
to do this, you give back a lot.

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.870
But you also need
to hold a fund.

01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:27.530
And we've seen this work
President George Bush started

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:30.890
ARPA-E, the Advanced Research
Projects Agency for Energy,

01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:32.510
modeled after DARPA.

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:34.460
It's been phenomenally
successful.

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.880
But it's got a budget
of $300 million a year.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.930
And if you want to make
a dent here, you know,

01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:40.820
we need to at least get
to the level of what

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:43.030
the US spends on pet
food research, which

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:44.480
is over a billion dollars.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.830
And that's just to start, right?

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:48.320
So, great question.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.820
- Thank you for coming.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.570
