00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.030 position:56%
In addition to her many academic
achievements Dr. Tarzibachi has also

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.340
worked in governmental and
nongovernmental organizations

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.350
where she has worked to
foster gender equity,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.430
particularly in the field of sexual

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.680
and reproductive health
and education.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.620
This year she was awarded
a scholarship

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.860 position:56%
to conduct her postdoctoral research
at the University of Buenos Aires

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.900
and her current research focuses
on meanings about menstruation

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200
and menstrual management
technologies for women

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.380
of different ages and social
status in Buenos Aires.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.340
Additionally, Dr. Tarzibachi is
working on writing a book based

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.850 position:56%
on her dissertation, as well as a
documentary film on menstrual bodies

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.770
and new ways to talk about
menstruation with girls and boys.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.610 position:56%
Also just a heads up even though the
flyer said 2 to 3, we might also go

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.880
over a little bit until 3:30 today.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.440
So on a more personal note,
it is beyond gratifying

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.070
to see a scholar conduct research
here at the Library of Congress

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.280
and then come back to share
their incredible work with us.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.510 position:56%
So without further ado, please join
me in giving the warmest of welcomes

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.300
to Dr. Eugenia Tarzibachi as she

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.840
Menstrual Bodies, Gender, and the
Transnational Fem Care Industry

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.640
in the United State and Argentina.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.390
[ Applause ]

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.720
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi: Thank
you Meg and first of all,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.540
thank you all for being here,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.100
especially on this rainy
day here in Washington, DC.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.100
Let me spend just a couple of
minutes on the acknowledgments

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.130
because there are always many
people behind the accomplishment we

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.430
can achieve.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.070
So I especially want to thank
Megan Metcalf, Catalina Gomez

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.030 position:56%
and Mary Champagne because on behalf
of the Division of Social Sciences

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.410 position:56%
and Humanities in collaboration with
the Hispanic Division of the Library

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.310
of Congress they made
possible this presentation.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.990
So it's a great honor for me to
be here with you sharing some

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.040
of the results of my doctorate
of research, which was nurtured

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.600
by my work here this library
that I deeply, deeply love.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.590
This institution was
so generous to me

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.440
that this presentation here
is a gesture of my gratitude

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.270
for hosting me in many
short-time stays over the years.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.700
Here I found some contrary
studies of menstruation while

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.980
in Argentina there was none.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.310
My doctorate of research opened
a new area of study in the field

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.020
of feminist academic
research in Argentina.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.940
So I also want to thank
all the researchers

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.380
on menstrual cycle whose
previous work was crucial

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.130
and helped me arrive
to these results.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.860
I won't be able to give credit
to all of them given the format

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640
of this presentation, but
here on the screen are some

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.220
of the most important for me.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.140
I also want to thank the
Interdisciplinary Institute

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.890
of Gender Status of the
University of Buenos Aires

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.810
for hosting my doctorate
of research and also

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.980
to my mentors, Monica [inaudible].

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.360
I finally want to publicly thank
my sister, Elenora [phonetic],

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.430
who is here and her
husband, Indy [phonetic],

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.500
who hosted me in their
house with great love

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.130
and support all the
trips I made to work

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.010
on my intellectual inquiries
here at the Library of Congress.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.680
So let's get into what
gather us today.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.690
The presentation is titled as
Meg said, Feminine Protection,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.790
Menstrual Bodies, Gender and the
Transnational Fem Care Industry

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.980
in the United States and Argentina.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.960
This presentation highlights
some of the key findings

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.390
of my doctoral dissertation
that was titled,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.700
a genealogy of menstrual bodies
through feminine protection

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.510
in the technologies in the US and
Argentina between 1920 and 1980.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.140 position:56%
My doctoral thesis, in this doctoral
thesis I use the term genealogy

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.100
inspired by the work of
Michel Foucault trying

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.680
to understand discontinuities
in the discourses

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.420
about women's bodies
as menstruators.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.060
So to perform this reconstruction
I conducted a thorough analysis

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.240
from the 1920's to the 1980's as
it relates to the rhetoric exposed

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.290
in advertisements mostly
graphic of pads and tampons

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.200 position:56%
in the social context where these
images circulated in both countries.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.320
I review more than 400 ads.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.530
I also looked for the
most significant patterns,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.230
the educational materials
produced by the main companies

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.720
of this industry, and
the experiences of women

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.230
about the menstrual body,
as well as the meaning

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.410
that these modern technologies
represented for those who live

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.320
through the transition from
the rag, cloths and cotton

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.670
or reusable homemade products
to manufacture disposable ones.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.730
And as it relates to the
latter analyses and in order

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.210
to understand what happened

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:08.500
in Argentina I interviewed 30
Argentine women who were teenagers

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.910
and young adults during the 70's

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.470
when the tampon was
launched in that country.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.240
To retrieve equivalent at that time

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.790
in the United States I relied
on background research.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.140
I also conducted an interview with
managers of multinational brands

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.810
of feminine protection products
in Argentina and in the US.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.360
And I also interview
Argentine gynecologists

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.370
who were practicing
medicine in the 70's.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.520
The transnational dimension of
this study is aligned with the idea

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.850
of understanding the relations
between these two countries instead

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.890
of doing a comparison,
although sometimes we know

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.820
that it's unescapable.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.050
I supposed this study

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.750
in transnational feminist cultural
studies, a tradition started

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.290
by Caplan and [inaudible] in 1994.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.170 position:56%
You may wonder why did I concentrate
in the relation between the US

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.160
and Argentina and I cannot
say that the emergence

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.610
of femcare industry was initiated
in the US, but the main companies

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.660
and brands that introduced
the innovation of disposable

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.160
and manufactured pads and tampons
in Argentina were Americans.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.970
That is why the counterpoint
with the US was crucial.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.200
These companies disseminated
the disposable pads and tampons

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.730
in steps first the pads, then
the tampons from the upper

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.750
and middle social sectors
to medium and low

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.630
and from the center
to the [inaudible].

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.040
This means from the central
to the [inaudible] countries

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.340
and from the central

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.140
to the [inaudible] areas
inside the national borders.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.360
Such has been the consolidation
of this industry internationally

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.030
that as [inaudible] said, its
annual earnings at the beginning

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.430
of the 21st century were around
$17 billion in global sales

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:09.390 position:56%
and this is still expanding mainly
by the growth of emerging economies.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.430
Currently in the United States
the four major companies competing

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.030
in this market are Proctor
and Gamble, Kimberly-Clark,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.910
Johnson &amp; Johnson and
Playtex products.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.010
All by Playtex are the ones

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.480
that developed extensive
multinational corporations

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.020
and in Argentina, Johnson &amp; Johnson
ranked first in the local market

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.840
of pads and tampons since the
early 30's with introduction

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.580 position:56%
of modest past brand to the present.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.580
So as I mentioned, in my research
I focus in the period of time

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:53.550
between 1920 to 1980, I wanted to
include the whole period of time

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.530
in which the pads and tampons
where launched in both countries.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.320
In this presentation I will
be extending that genealogy

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.140
of menstrual bodies to
the present to introduce

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.790
and close this lecture today.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.390
The reason for that is
that those discourses

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.960
on women's menstrual bodies are
unstable and in dispute nowadays.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.040 position:56%
Also because what is currently going

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.430 position:56%
on only can be deeply understood
considering what happened during the

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.600
20th century.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.230 position:56%
So I want to start this presentation
describing three current public

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.350
situations that took
place in Western societies

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.350
and went viral in social media.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.880
Each of them in different
ways expose

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.200
that in the 21st century
what is popularly known

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.420
as the menstrual taboo
is not only still alive,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.640
but also is regulating
women's bodies

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.940
and [inaudible] in the shadows.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:55.570
So the first situation was in
August 2016, the Olympic Games.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.440
Fu Yuanhui, a Chinese competitive
swimmer got the fourth place

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.740
in the competition.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.830
She apologized to her team

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.520
because she could not do
her best performance given

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.640
that she had her period the
night before the competition

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.880
and she had menstrual cramps.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.200
Let's hear from her about
the emotion of shame

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:20.270 position:56%
that so intimately constitutes the
corporeal experience of menstruators

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.800
in our societies and particularly,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.560
in traditionally masculine
fields such as sports.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:11:00.060
[ Foreign Language Being Spoken ]

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.250
Okay, so this disclosure
seemed to be a revelation

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.950 position:56%
as if it was a novelty that
[inaudible] as the majority of women

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.450
in reproductive age do
menstruate every month and continue

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.660
with their regular activities.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.500
So let's move on to the second
analyzer also related to sport.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.600
However, this one could
be considered as part

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.700
of the current menstrual activism.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.880
This is important because
what you will see

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.070
in this situation is social also
an emotional self-evaluation,

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.080
but the opposite emotion
to shame, pride.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:43.370 position:56%
So the second situation was in
April 2015 in the London's marathon.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:48.120
Kiran Gandhi had a choice
to skip her first marathon

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.480
because of her period or run
the marathon and she decided

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.370
to run the marathon and
practice free bleeding

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.970
for sisters who don't have tampons.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:03.920
This is the image of
the end of the marathon

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.060
and she was criticized
as being disgusting.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:15.550 position:56%
The third situation in March 2015
Instagram removed twice this picture

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:21.220
from the photographer Ruby Kaur
for considering it offensive.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.240
This picture was part of an
essay on a visual rhetoric course

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.550
at the university she attends.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.230
I will read the answer
[inaudible] to Instagram

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.890
by the end of this presentation.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:39.850 position:56%
So what I would like you could
remember of these three anecdotes is

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.330
that the public reaction

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.830
to what these women disclosed
are proportional to the success

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.930
of the process that accord
during the 20th century and in

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:54.440
which the femcare industry
had a significant protagonism.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.370 position:56%
The idea that I would like you could
gently keep in mind until the end

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.810
of the presentation is that
with the efficient concealment

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.240 position:56%
of the menstrual body what was
better concealed under the discourse

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.450
of women's liberation
was the menstrual stigma.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.790
In other words, we can say that
the menstrual closet a concept

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:21.600
that I borrow from Iris Marion
Young was better locked and hidden.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.640
So next in this presentation I will
try to show you that the disposable

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.160
and manufactured pads and tampons
which were massively launched

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.770
in the United States and
Argentina at the beginning

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.190
of the 20th century were far more

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.580
than innocent modern technologies
of menstrual management.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.150
Let's remember that before
the commercialization

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.320
and massive consumption
of industrial pads

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.450
and tampons each woman
had to handle what to do

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.260
with its own menstrual blood every
month and women weren't allowed

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.370
to do many activities during
menstruation like taking cold baths

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.650
or doing energetic movements.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.420
In the US and in Argentina what
women usually used were cloths,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.910
rags and cotton.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:12.450
Sometimes they'd [inaudible] to
hold their homemade pads in place.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.670
The massive dissemination
and consumption

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.620
of these products helped
women gain a sense

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.640
of self-control over
their own bodies.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.030
They also helped them manage
menstruation in a standardized

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.190
and practical way with
increasing comfort

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.340
and at a less emotional cost.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.900
Furthermore, they increased the
productivity of women's bodies

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.620
at different levels by letting
them perform a socially acceptable

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.750
feminine body before others

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.800
and remain active every
day of the month.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.500
So the question is
how they did all that.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.430
And the answer is by normalizing
the menstrual body gradually

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.330
under the idea of a feminine
body for which menstruation was

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.420
under control the processing
played two major tactics.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.940
The first one and most fundamental
was effectively conceding not

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.010
suppressing all the evident
traces of menstruation,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.100
even its consideration of abject

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.040
by letting women be more
productive every day of the month.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:22.210
This meant a decreased anxiety
related to the subservience

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.540
over the evidence of the
existence of a menstrual body.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.150
Manufacturing of disposable pads
and tampons helped women avoid

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.560
in a more efficient way the sting,
the smell, the visual traces

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.270
of a homemade pad and
also they were disposable.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.130 position:56%
So women did not have to worry about
finding a place to hide the product

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:47.690
for store it or where to dry
them without being seen by men.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:52.100
And finally the improvements in
terms of comfort made women get rid

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.810
of the permanent self-awareness
about the menstrual condition

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.420
without suppressing menstruation.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.780
That's why I conceptualize by using
the Freudian concept of denial

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:08.190
as technologies of effective denial
of the menstrual body traces.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.650
The second major tactic
was the following.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.790
The industrial patent tampons
were disseminated alongside a new

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.230
legitimized way of thinking
and talking about menstruation,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.010
which was supported by the
biomedical modern knowledge.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:30.460
This new way of doing, thinking
and talking about menstruation

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:35.270
that this industry disseminated
transnationally displaced gradually

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.870
the traditional knowledge
of women about menstruation.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:45.080
The work of [inaudible] and
Elizabeth Kisling were crucial

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.150
to understand what
happened in the US.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.180
The dissemination of industrial
patent tampons transnationally

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.570
helped women disidentify with
that old-fashioned menstrual body,

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.180
but by being commanded
by traditional practices

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.980
around menstruation could not
hide properly all the traces

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.750 position:56%
of menstruation and remained passive

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.940
or inhibited during
the menstrual period.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.640
And finally, the powerful
connotation of the disposability

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.380
of the blood and the
products was helpful

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.320
for that disidentification process.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.380
It had resonances with the
metaphor of an abject body,

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.120
an old-fashioned menstrual body
that could also be discarded.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:32.530
However, the [inaudible] menstrual
body was kept alive under wraps.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:37.940
So in conclusion, industrial patent
tampons were and are far more

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.680
than technologies of
menstrual management.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.540
I will show you that
they are a prism

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.230
to understand how its transnational
dissemination and consumption

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.780
in the US and in Argentina produce
a new disciplinary practice towards

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.530
women's bodies that
normalize menstruation.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:01.080
In a long-term basis this new
disciplinary practice not only

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.940 position:56%
conceal menstruation in a more
efficient way and provided a new way

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.910
of thinking, talking and
managing menstruation.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.990
In a broader perspective they also
reproduced traditional narratives

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.560
about gender and helped to
conceal the menstrual taboo

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.340 position:56%
or a stigma while maximizing women's
productivity every day of the month.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.500 position:56%
I would love to share many really
fascinating details and complexities

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.610
of this process, but as
I don't have enough time

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.250 position:56%
for that this afternoon I will focus
on the portrayals of women's bodies

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.210
as menstruators in the
transnational discourses

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.830
that the femcare industry
used to disseminate the pads

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.180
and the tampons as
feminine protectors.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.170
I will focus on the two main
ways to do this dissemination

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.110
which were [inaudible],
the advertising

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.120
and the educational materials

00:18:52.120 --> 00:19:00.620
in both countries between
1920 and 1980.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.880
So let's first make some
sense about the title

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.760
of this dissertation
or this presentation.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.590
This image is just one of
the first advertisements

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.170
of Kimberly-Clark's brand of
feminine pads called Kotex.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.800
And it is very simple,
but it is revealing.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.970
I selected it because its main
[inaudible] is explicit and crucial

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.450
to understand the culture and
construction about gender related

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.700
to the menstrual condition of
women's bodies that the market

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.300
and that the feminine
protection rhetoric has sustained

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.550
for almost a century through
the technologies in question.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.090
Women lose because they menstruate.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.100
That is to say that women
lose blood and the also lose

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.210
in the social field because of
their natural deficient bodies not

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.240
because the cultural corporeal
idea of Western societies

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.040
that is a non-menstrual
idea like male bodies are.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.250
I want to bring here
Elizabeth Cross [phonetic]

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.160
about the continuous transcriptions
that the Western culture made

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.760
about women's [inaudible]
as a seepage.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.410
According to Cross, women's
bodies were socially constructed

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.010
as some uncontrolled
chaotic fluidity,

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.570
a content with no solid container.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.010
Since the beginning
of the 20th century

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:32.350
that rhetoric reinforced a
particular metaphor about women

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.270
as victims of their
natural weak, vulnerable

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.560
and problematic bodies
even that they menstruate.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.950
Menstruation was portrayed as an
enemy opposed to the social equity

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:51.130
of women that is why the patent
tampons were feminine protectors.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.760
So I won't talk much about the
euphemisms that the industry used

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.050
to refer to menstruation
or the products

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.850
at the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:04.250 position:56%
I won't even talk about the
[inaudible] to refer to menstruation

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.520
that is already a fact that
many research studies have

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.990
already concluded.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.410
What I would like to do now
is to unfold the metaphors

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.620
of menstrual bodies
reproducing the history of pads

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.030
and tampons advertisings in the US

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.440 position:56%
and Argentina using the menstrual
taboo to conceal not only the blood,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.420
but the menstrual stigma itself.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.020
So let's take a look at the story

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:37.200
of the feminine protection
rhetoric in the advertisements.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.320
I organized what you will see
in a chronological timeline,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.790
so we will be traveling from the
20's to the end of the 70's back

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.330
and forth between a
central country like the US

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.130
to a peripheral one like Argentina.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:59.490 position:56%
From the analysis it can be observed
that the masculine protective power

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.380
of pads and tampons over women
worked very close to the sanitation

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.930
of the menstrual body
considered dirty

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.960
until the 50's capitalizing
the hygienist discourse.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.750
And from the 60's on the feminine
protection work in solidarity

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.340
with the liberation of women

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.470
from an oppressive menstrual body
capitalizing the culture and power

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.020
of the women's liberation movement.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:34.000
So in the first period,
what I call the first period

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.180
of feminine protection I will
be showing you the anachronistic

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.100 position:56%
feminine protection rhetoric divided

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.930
into these two periods
in both countries.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.500
The first one goes from the 20's
to the 50's and the protection

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.590
of this chaotic vulnerable

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.690
and problematic menstrual body
was linked with its sanitation

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.880
because that body was
also considered dirty.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.900
This period coincided with the
release of the first generation

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.090
of both products in the US and
just the modern sanitary pads

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.380
in Argentina.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:17.740
In this period we will see images
like this one, a woman in panic

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.610
because she was discovered
by others as menstrual.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:27.150
We can understand the particularity
not only as a commercial strategy

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:32.460
that worked explicitly around
an ashamed and dirty body

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.250
that could not integrate
into the society.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:40.190
This portrayal can be understood as
a reflection of an ongoing process

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.360
of disidentification from that
old menstrual body that used

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.040
to fail in the concealment.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.090
That process was not complete
yet, disposable tampons

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.700
and pads were still
massively consumed.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:00.140
This is another example of
an Argentine advertisement.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.120
It says scared, no
more uncertainties.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.560
Modess the safe sanitary napkin.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.650
So the second period of feminine
protection that coincided

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:18.570
with the second generation of both
technologies started in the 60's.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.330
By a second-generation of these
products, I mean the innovation

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:28.270
of the adhesive and later different
sizes and wings in the pads.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:32.000
And the second generation of
tampons in the US meant tampons

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.240
that could expand longitudinally
not radially and also the tampons

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.230
with no applicator with [inaudible]
that were unnecessary, etcetera.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.570
In Argentina the innovation
of the tampon

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.640 position:56%
as a menstrual management technology
was systematically presented

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:55.220
in society through advertisements
from the late 60's and 70's.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:00.480
Approximately 40 years later
than here in the US and the one

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:08.900
that is most consumed
in Argentina is the OB,

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.950
the [inaudible] tampon
with no applicator.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.460
So let's also remember that
the tampon as a technology

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.630
of vaginal penetration
awakened many social

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:24.260
and individual anxieties
related with women's sexualities

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.040
and is a very interesting
analyzer of the social regulation

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.440
of women's [inaudible] in
each of these countries.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.090
During this period, the
protection of the chaotic

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.980
and vulnerable menstrual body
was linked with the liberation

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.040
of women considered as
objects socially oppressed

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.170
by their own natural
menstrual bodies.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:51.000
In these periods we can't
register anymore the representation

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.570
of an ashamed woman that could be
discovered by others as menstrual.

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:02.330
This advertising strategy coincided
with a process of disidentification

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:07.520
of that old menstrual body that
was started to be consolidated.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.220
So this is just a general
classification of two periods

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.320
to clarify different metaphors
of menstrual bodies according

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.440
to really big tendencies
that I could find.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.720 position:56%
Protection, hygiene and freedom were
three signifiers that work together

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.800
and acquire different accents
due to the historical context.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.910
They were a stable
[inaudible] of meanings

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.000
that the femcare industry used

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.040
to portray women's
bodies as menstruaters.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.940
So with these new modern products
the [inaudible] oppressed during

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.380
menstruation that prevail
at the beginning

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.610
of the 20th century
started to be fractured.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.240
So let's start with
the first period.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.430
You will see highlighted in yellow
the word protection or references

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.190
to safety and in blue the
word hygiene or sanitation.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.390
And given the time
constraints I will go

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.740
over each relevant ad fairly
fast, but there are many,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.290 position:56%
many interesting about each of them.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:15.280
I will spend just a
couple of minutes

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.800
on these foundational
images published in 1921

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.640
in the Ladies Home Journal.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.700
This is the first ad of Kotex
pads which used the discourse

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.210
of patriotism to launch the
brand and the technology

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.910
into the American market
after the First World War.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.940
In this ad what was used is
an analogy between the pad

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.210 position:56%
as a protector of a vulnerable woman
that menstruate and the soldiers

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.600
who were fighting to
protect the American nation.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:54.970
A feminized entity as it was
under the threat of a war.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.890
And also menstruation is along
with the idea of the enemy.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.490
The word protection you will see

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:04.050
that it doesn't have a strong
presence in this first ad,

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.520
but [inaudible] connotation
of this image is

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.430 position:56%
around the feminine protection given
by a masculine and American figure.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:18.070
The ad says to save a man's
life science discovered Kotex.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.800
And this ad led us to a keynote.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.190 position:56%
You may know that the feminine pads
designed to manage menstruation were

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:31.510
as many other modern
technologies a consequence of war.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:35.050
This is one of the products created
for the war that after the end

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.140
of the war had a civilian use.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.750
The [inaudible] higher
absorbent material and cheaper

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:46.750
than cotton was produced by
Kimberly-Clark in 1915 due

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.900
to the rising prices of the cotton
after the American Civil War.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:56.100
So Kimberly-Clark used to sell it
to hospitals as surgical dressings.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.600
In 1917, when the US entered

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.210 position:56%
into the First World War the
company started to sell this product

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:04.460
to the American army
and the Red Cross.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.680 position:56%
And after signing the amnesties in
1918, the Army canceled the contract

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.680
with Kimberly-Clark and
[inaudible] and many fabric

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.410
that produce it were remaining
as a potential business loss.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.600
So Kimberly-Clark decided
to capitalize both actives

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.930
and transformed the
cellucotton into a feminine pad.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.390 position:56%
As [inaudible] said in their book on
Kimberly-Clark the only one factor

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.200 position:56%
that could persuade a businessman to
think about the menstrual condition

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.500
of women at the beginning

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.470
of the past century was
a potential profit loss.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.320
It is also said that the idea of
this derivation of the cellucotton

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.460
into the feminine pad came from
the American fund of wounded women

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.200
to Kimberly-Clark saying that the
nurses of the American army used

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.860 position:56%
to improvise the use of cellucotton
surgical dressings as feminine pads.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:05.100
So they call it Kotex referring
to cotton-like texture.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.210
Now the text will have
some sense to all of us.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.990
I will just read some parts.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.790
Our boys were falling wounded
in the battlefield of France,

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.120
army doctors were calling
for an unlimited supply

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.720 position:56%
of antiseptic surgical dressing that
will be more absorbent than cotton.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.590
The government said can you give us

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.630
such a surgical dressing,
we could and did.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.930
[Inaudible] men working

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:37.320
in a feverish pace built a great
plant here near the forest district

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.650
of the north and a wonderful
surgical dressing was produced.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.790
Hundreds of thousands
of pounds were shipped

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:49.020
to our war hospitals
to save men's lives.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.630
Many a sorely wounded
soldier has reason

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.590
to thank American scientific
inventive genius

00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:00.730
to this great practical discovery,
a permanent peacetime utility.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:04.220
Now that the war is over we
are devoting this great factory

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.730 position:56%
to peacetime usefulness we have
called this wonderful product Kotex,

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:13.420
Kotex Texture and before long Kotex
will be available in restrooms,

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:19.620
dry goods, departments and
drugstores all over the country.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.380
So the cost is almost nothing,
our plan was to be able

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.180
to fill a war need, enormous
production was demanded,

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.290
we will keep that production
up and keep down the cost.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.440
Kotex are cheap enough
to throw away.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.040
So this is a foundational beginning

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.470
of the transactional feminine
care rhetoric to advertise

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.420
in this case pads without
mentioning not only menstruation,

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.320
but neither the product
they were advertising.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.850
So let's move on in
this first journey.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:32:01.070
Next, let's take a look at
this ad published in 1927

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.600
by Johnson &amp; Johnson
in the Syracuse Herald

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.840
to presenting society
it's feminine pad modest,

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.470
a derivation of the word modesty.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.200
At that time Johnson &amp;
Johnson started to compete

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.640
with Kimberly-Clark
for market share.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.640
It says a personal word to women

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.090
from Johnson &amp; Johnson we ask you
what a modern hygienic convenience

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.880
should be like and you told us.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:31.730
Then we experimented, our 41 years
in making Red Cross cotton gauze

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.810
and surgical supplies helped us.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.060
So Modess [inaudible] comfortable,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.800
it gives absolute protection,
it is easily disposable.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.000
Modess is the truly modern
hygienic convenience designed

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.060
for the active modern woman.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.410
Modess is all you need
to say ready wrapped

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:57.390
at most drugstores
designed by women for women.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:01.400
So there is a story also behind
this ad because Johnson &amp; Johnson

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:08.760 position:56%
to release this brand they hired a
PhD in psychology Gilbert [phonetic]

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.090
that a study how was
the best [inaudible]

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.030
for the five senses of women.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.130
So after that study they
released this brand.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.600
And there is a beautiful
paper made by [inaudible]

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.700
about this [inaudible] report.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.610
So the aim of this new product
was more comfort for woman,

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.800
but also better concealment
of the product.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.200
The allusion to the active modern
women that needed a new way

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.250
to manage menstruation
will remain a staple.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:49.000
In 1928 Kimberly-Clark launched in
the Saturday Evening Post many ads

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.200
like this one in a new campaign

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.160
that portrayed upper
class women using Kotex

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.120
as a sign of social distinction.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.270 position:56%
Kimberly-Clark made a rhetoric shift

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.070
from the previous ad
Kotex protection

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:09.190
and hygiene was no more a
matter of national convenience,

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.930 position:56%
it was a sign of social distinction.

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:16.240
So this one says, this
ends the worries

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.290
of full-time hygienic methods

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.260
by providing protection
but is absolute.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.870
And this other one
says, the safe solution

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:29.120
of women's greatest
hygienic problem which 8

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.370
in 10 better class
women have adopted.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.310
So you will see from now on
until the 60's approximately

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:40.970
that the menstruation was portrayed
as a problem, a feminine problem.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.750
So let's move to this image.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.120
I picked this advertisement
published in 1933

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.950
in the New York Times
by Kimberly-Clark

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:59.530
because of this insistence of the
protection and the equalizer effect

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:03.240
between men and women that this
new technology was pretending

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.290
to bring about for women.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:11.080
Let's remember that the right for
women to vote as men did was passed

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:19.700
in 1921 and that is another
milestone of the American history

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.000
that was capitalized by the
first ads of pads and tampons.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.920
It says now great advance

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.740
in sanitary protection
equalizer Kotex gives [inaudible]

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.560
greater protection.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:39.030
And now we arrive to another
memorable advertisement

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.490
of this story.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:46.240
It is the one that introduced
the tampon Tampax in 1936.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.820
The quality of the image
is not good at all.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.380
I can tell you that there
are many women represented

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:57.930
in action riding horses, playing
tennis, using swimsuits thanks

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.380
to the protection that
could be worn internally.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.700
This technological innovation
was portrayed as revolutionary

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.400
for women corporeal
experience as menstruators.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.760 position:56%
And it was because it gave a step
forward not only in the habilitation

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.790
of doing many activities
that require water

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.770
or any energetic movements

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.540
because the leaking
threat was better solved.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.380
Furthermore, the menstrual
management technology itself could

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.920
not be seen by anyone
else than a woman.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:38.180 position:56%
So tampons were launched as a way
to remake woman's tortured existence

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.870
with this new way to
fixing their deficient body.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.940
But they released Tampax with a
nicer translation than what I did.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.330
They said, welcome to this
new day for womanhood.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.630
This summer you can experience
the comfort and unassurance

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:56.240
of [inaudible] you have
never known before,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.000 position:56%
sanitary protection worn internally.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.500
Or this other advertisement
that says women's world remade.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:11.790
So around the same year that
the tampons were launched

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.090
in the American market.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:18.090
In Argentina Johnson &amp; Johnson was
started at least in advertising

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.100
to release the feminine pads.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.410
These ads published in a feminine
magazine that still exists

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.190
that is called Para Ti, For You,

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.540
are part of the first ads
of Modess brand I found.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.270
As you can tell in the image on the
left they used the representation

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:42.710
of the woman with a very
short masculine haircut called

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.010
[foreign language].

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.470
The equalizer effect of
men and women by the use

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:52.160
of this menstrual management
technology was connoted here too.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.750
It says something like every woman
needs Modess, the sanitary napkin

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.800
that will give you the most perfect

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.560
and absolute protection during
the days of indisposition.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.550
This is a traditional
way of referring

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.930
to menstruation in Argentina.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.770
Get a box of Modess in
any pharmacy or a store

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.870
and you will prove why Modess
gives a complete protection,

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:20.620
a product of Johnson &amp; Johnson
Modess this modern sanitary pad.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:26.960
The image in the middle of the
slide also showed upper class women

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.840
under a title that says
the modern solution

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.440
of a known feminine problem.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.920
Notice the same insistence on
the consideration of menstruation

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.660 position:56%
as a hygienic problem of female
bodies that could turn into a crisis

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:46.710
because of what they referred as
an accident during those days.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.250
And the third ad used
the image of a nurse,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:54.260 position:56%
the only one feminine representation
of medicine at that time to declare

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.480
in the title, a new chapter in
feminine hygiene with this safe

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:04.340
and comfortable system, Modess
the safe sanitary napkin.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.590
[Inaudible] with the modern
way to manage menstruation

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:11.670 position:56%
of the modern woman in contrast with
the old-fashioned methods and women

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.970
that were prisoners

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:16.960
of the problematic menstrual
body was strongly emphasized

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.950
in the Argentine advertisement
of the novelty of this product.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.310
Let's take a look at
these in the first ad

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.830 position:56%
of national pad brands in Argentina.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:38.160 position:56%
The ad on the left, at the left of
the slide used a title that resounds

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.910
with some other ads
we have already read.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:46.690
How the modern woman
solves her hygienic problem.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.920
The ad of the right side of
the slide showed a dialogue

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.340
between Luisa, an old-fashioned
woman, and the modern woman.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:00.210
The modern woman who is
seated in the chair says,

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:03.650
how outdated you are
Luisa that is not a reason

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.690
for not going to the party.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.960
What you have to do is try
[inaudible] sanitary napkin

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.010
that is a solution for our problem.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:16.370
This national brand called
[inaudible] combines the word

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:20.530
sanitation or health and napkin.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:25.630
The slogan was [inaudible]
the modern sanitary napkin.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:33.140
And this one this ad, I love this
ad because this is an isolated ad

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:37.870 position:56%
of a tampon on the 30's in Argentina
or at least it's the only one

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.210
that I could find in my
review published in 1939.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.960
It disappeared very quickly
from the domain of advertising

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.800
and I could not find any
other ad of this technology

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.870
until the 60's in Argentina.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.560
This advertising reveals
something that was not possible

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.350
yet for Argentine women in the
late 30's probably given the more

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.870
conservative context
over women's bodies

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:08.420
and the smaller local
market compared to the US.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.960
It was a national brand of
a tampon named Absorbol,

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:19.790
the name is a homophone in Spanish
of the English word absorb all.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.780
As you can tell again,

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:27.410
the Anglo-Saxon origin was an
important source of legitimacy

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.760
of these products in Argentina.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.370
So let's move on to the
ads introduced in the 40s's

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:38.030
and the 50's they present
many, many interesting stories.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.660
In those years the use of
feminine pads became products

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.510
of massive consumption
here in the US while

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.980
in Argentina the companies
were still trying

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.960
to target the middle class woman.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.220
And in both countries the
increasing participation of women

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:58.760 position:56%
in the workforce as blue-collar
workers was represented into the ads

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.830
to portray these technologies
as a way

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.560
to help women be active
every workday.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.810
They continued using the
representation of menstrual women

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.910
as a desirable object
for the [inaudible]

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.460
by concealing properly their
properly their menstrual condition,

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.130
but also they were able to
be economically productive,

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:23.040
not only as consumers
but as active workers.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.980
There are differences found in
the way they portray women working

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.990
in one country and the other due

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.840
to particularities of
its social context.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.990
In the US where women had to occupy
men's work position when they were

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:44.060
in the battlefield during the
Second World War women workers were

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.750
portrayed with traditionally
masculine [inaudible] like overalls

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:51.220
and slacks or poses open legs.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.730
In Argentina, they
continued being represented

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.730
with the traditional feminine
clothing like blouses,

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:02.140
skirts and dresses and with all
the traditionally feminine gestures

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.360
like crossed legs while seated.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.080
Let's take a look at the images.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.220
As you can see in the
ad published in 1942

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:17.210 position:56%
in Women's Home Companion the figure
of the traditional feminine woman

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:22.760 position:56%
who is the fan of her husband's
furlough while his sword is pointing

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:29.050
her sexual organs is balanced with
a masculinized [inaudible] worker.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.860
Both had to keep going
during menstruation.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.460
The Tampax ad in the middle
says those modern girls

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.070
as never before need
Tampax showing a giant woman

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:43.920
as a result of a low angle shot.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:49.820
She's standing with her legs open
saying slacks, slacks, slacks.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.050
The [inaudible] of this word
refers not only to the trousers,

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:58.100
but also to a loose part, something
like a loose part of our bodies

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.790
that was [inaudible] by the tampon
to become solid and hermetic.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.290
Let's remember here
the ad women lose

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.000
and the consideration
of women as a seepage.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.420
Finally the image on the right
represented again the blue-collar

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:18.020
workers and Tampax as
an ally of capitalists

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:23.970
to reduce female absenteeism
during menstruation.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:30.050
And in the meanwhile ads like
this one were published in 1945,

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.220
the modern way to think
about those days.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:40.530 position:56%
Physical educators now stress
normalcy for this time of the month.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:49.170
As you can see in this ad, this
was part of the very strong process

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.480
that had the intention of deepening
the portrayal of menstruation

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.230
as a completely normal
biological process.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.990
This is a very -- there is a
very interesting story mentioned

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:05.220
by some authors like [inaudible]
who refer to how in the US,

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.660
particularly in the
US the normalization

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:15.610
of menstruation was intense during
the World Wars time period and how

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.510
after the war the [inaudible]
of women

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.050
because of menstruation
was highlighted.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.120
The psychological distress
related to hormones

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.580
like the menstrual tension
created by Grover Frank in 1936

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.510
or the PMS created
by Katharina Dalton

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.870
in 1952 are an example of that.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:42.050
This can be understood as
a way of displacing women

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:47.190
out of the workforce to let the man
occupy again their places at work

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:51.070
since they were coming
back from the war.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.210
Aligned with this phenomenon
you can see the return

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.970
of the traditional
feminine stereotype of women

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:05.640 position:56%
in the campaign Modess because the
Johnson &amp; Johnson released from 1948

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:11.390
until the brand Stayfree
was launched in the 70's.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.930
So let's move to what happened
in these decades in Argentina.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:21.370
There were not as many
representations

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:23.830
of women working in Argentina.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.430
There are some examples of them.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:28.290
The lowest class status

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:31.920
of the workers portrayed
[inaudible] not only in the types

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.770
of jobs they were performing,
but also in the main [inaudible]

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:39.510
of the ad of the left
slide of the slide.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:44.110
The buttons of your
suit are more expensive.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:49.750
The other two ads showed
[inaudible] women at the store.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.230
There were also secretaries
at the office

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:55.620
in other ads I didn't select
it for this presentation.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:58.170
But the topic of the absenteeism

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:03.230
that pads could prevent
remain unmentioned.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:07.340
The pads for workers
were portrayed as an ally

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:13.730
to perform the idea feminine
beauty also during menstruation.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:18.610
So during the 50's there were less
workers in the ads and more sense

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:21.860
of women's menstrual
bodies being active

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.850
and impeccable housewives
like this one.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:32.760
These said -- oh sorry, it says
will you be a good housewife

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.320
and it's like a test.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.580
If you answered yes to the
second question, then you will be

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.560
in this case a good housewife.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.730 position:56%
It's like a campaign, there are like
five, it's a set of five images.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.570
For example in the box, sorry
this is a little bit more.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.790
In the box number two it
says, do you buy things

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:56.190
because they are cheap without
worrying about its quality

00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:01.640
or number two, do you prefer to buy
many little things products instead

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:05.880
of depriving yourself of
modest safe protection.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.330
Or in box number four, do
you allow your discomfort

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:14.470
to deny your loved ones of your
good mood and collaboration.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:19.550
Or number two, do you know how
to take advantage of the comfort

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.250
that Modess provide
and leave your life

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:26.950
under its safe protection,
just say Modess.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.390
Other ads are like this one,

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:40.940
traditional [inaudible] women
dancing in love with men

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.810
without concerns with the
safe protection of Modess.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:49.820
Modess is simply not cotton its
absorbency power is far superior.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.490
Modess especially designed for
being invisible under the light

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:57.030
of stress, just say Modess.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:00.810
So let's move to the second
period of feminine protection.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:05.860
Now we will highlight
the words protection

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.990
in yellow and freedom in green.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:14.370
This rhetoric is very much like
to what we could appreciate

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:20.810
from the last decades of the 20th
century until 2000, colorful ads.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:24.100
Women under the water during
menstruation, the presentation

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.070
of new brands referring to freedom.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:30.740
And a second generation of
pads and tampons in the US

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.660
and also the presentation
of the tampon

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:37.650
in Argentina are the main
characteristics of this period.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:41.590
I agree with Shelley Parker in the
[inaudible] that we can register

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.600
in the advertisements of pads

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.930 position:56%
and tampons while the women's
liberation movement was taking place

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:50.840
in both countries.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.670
This shift goes from the
rhetoric of the sanitation

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:57.020 position:56%
of the menstrual bodies they told
you considered dirty to the rhetoric

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.020
of women's liberation
of menstruation

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.660
as an internal enemy for women.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.800
Just keep in mind that in
Argentina during the 60's

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.480
and the 70's we had many
dictatorship governments.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.740
Let's take a look at the
ads of the second period.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.910
Nothing holds you back, this
is an ad of Tampax published

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:21.350
in 1968 in Family Circle.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:26.740
It says whenever you go, whatever
you do, you are confident,

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.930
comfortable, carefree
with the cool, clean,

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.280
fresh protection of Tampax tampons.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:38.890
This is modern sanitary protection,
the kind that belongs to the young,

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:40.790
the [inaudible], the alive.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:44.820
It even makes you feel
more a part of the party.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.940
You get total freedom with Tampax.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:57.240
Or these two between 1974 and 1976,
these new brands of pads introduced

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.490
by Kimberly-Clark and Johnson
&amp; Johnson were released.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.660
They highlighted the word
freedom in their own names.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.830
New freedom displays Kotex
and Stayfree displays Modess.

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:18.550
They had of course, this new
generation had the adhesive backing

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:21.380 position:56%
as the one that we know in our days.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:25.760
As you can tell, teenagers
were a clear target for tampons

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:31.050 position:56%
in the 70's why swimsuits had a very
strong presence in advertisements.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:40.110
This is like the new aesthetics
of the 60's and the 70's.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:46.560
And in Argentina for example,
this ad published in 1976

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.920
in Revista Clarin, it's a
very traditional magazine.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:57.070
This ad is a national
brand of a tampon

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:59.920 position:56%
in Argentina that was called Suavix.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.780
The ad says Suavix for
women's liberation.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.510
The text talks about menstruation
as one of the last taboos

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:11.320
and the visual connotation
of menstruation related

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.520
to an empty nest, can
you see it right there?

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.500
It's interesting because it refers
to the hegemonic way to think

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.940
about menstruation as an
indicator or a trace of a body

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.980
that is [inaudible] that spoiled
its reproductive potential.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.580
It's an empty nest.

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.160
If we have time we will see one
of the ways this interpretation

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.860
of menstruation was disseminated.

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.570
There are some tampon
ads of national brands

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:45.420
in feminine magazines during the
70's, but after the OB tampon

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.710
of Johnson &amp; Johnson was
released they disappeared

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:51.310
from the domain of advertising.

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:58.760
Well this is the second ad that
present the OB tampon in Argentina.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:07.650 position:56%
You can tell that there are women
in bikinis running out from the sea.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:12.060
And the last stop in
this first journey

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.980
through the feminine protection
rhetoric is the comparison

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:19.430
of the simultaneous first ads to
present the OB tampons in the US

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:24.560
and Argentina and I have to thank
here to David Linton for putting me

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.800
in contact with Robert Wainer,
who managed the public relations

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.710
of OB brand for Johnson &amp; Johnson
in the 70's here in the US.

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:38.630
And kindly shared with me the
first OB American campaign

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:41.920
of OB tampons for TV.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.010
This is a fixed image
just I captured that image

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:48.450
that is the end of the advertising.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:50.720
I would like to show
you the different ways

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.970
in which this technology
was presented

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:57.760
in the ads making a [inaudible]
use of women's liberation discourse

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.890
that was contemporary and
also the political use

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:04.020
of the dictatorship
discourse in Argentina

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.760
that among other things
censored feminism.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.920
During this period
that goes from 1976

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:18.120
to 1983 Argentina suffered
its cruelest dictatorship

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.670
of its whole history.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.120
The state terrorism used the
doctrine of national security

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:28.820
against an internment enemy and the
discourse of the total protection

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.550
to disappear and kill
30,000 men and women due

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:36.250
to their ideological
conventions about social justice.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:42.930
So in the US the OB tampon was
presented as a feminist technology

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.220
because of three main things.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.450
The first one is that
it had to be inserted

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.700
into the vagina with our own hands.

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:54.970
Let's remember that the discourse
of the women's health movement here

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:59.000
in the US used the symbol of the
speculum as a way to call for women

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.400
to explore their genitalia in 70's.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:08.930
Second of all because they portray
an androgynous woman riding a bike,

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:13.030
running in a park, and using
very, very loose clothing.

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:17.530
And the ad [inaudible] of
medicine as a figure of legitimacy

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:20.350
that they refer to
a gynecologist woman

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.800
as being the creator of OB tampons.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.060
This denoted that women could
be professionals as men and also

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:31.920
that come essence of
women's experience

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.570
of menstrual bodies could
understand better women's needs.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:39.910
On the contrary, in Argentina
the OB tampon was presented

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:43.440
as a feminine technology,
not a feminist one.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.510
Using the discourse
of women's liberation,

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.890
but in a very different way.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.080
It was the first ad of a
menstrual management technology

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.540
that showed the inside
of woman's genitalia.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:56:00.490
I don't know if you can tell
right there in the left side.

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:06.900
Let me see if I can
point it with this, yeah.

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:16.070
Right here this is the inside of
the genitalia, woman's genitalia.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:22.160
But they showed that image in a
very pragmatic way just to show

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.430 position:56%
where the tampon had to be
inserted exposing that a [inaudible]

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:29.180
about women's anatomy was needed.

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.150 position:56%
The clitoris of course, was omitted.

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:37.300 position:56%
This ad still used the discourse of
the figure of the masculine medicine

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:42.270
that they refer to the approval of
this tampon by male gynecologists

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:44.320
to legitimize the tampons.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:50.260
And the ads portrayed a sexy
woman moving with no restrictions,

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.820
but in the position of
objects of male desire.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:59.660 position:56%
The ad says, tampon OB of Johnson &amp;
Johnson asks the feminine protection

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:04.550
you use would allow you
to pose for this picture.

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:09.180
In both cases that's appropriated
feminism in a politicized way

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:13.600 position:56%
to promote technology that could
hide more efficiently all the traces

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.390
of menstruation.

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:19.500
And something else was found in
the ads of OB tampons in Argentina

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:23.290
where the society was invented
as a told you in a great

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:29.490 position:56%
and social anxiety that is reflected
in these women's body's portrayal.

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:33.640
The discourse of the feminine
total protection to make reference

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:38.300
to a bleeding that had to be hidden
had a strong resonance with the one

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.860
that the dictators used

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:44.610
to legitimize the aberrations they
perpetrate during what they called

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:48.260
the dirty war to free Argentina.

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:53.540
So what I tried to show you
until now at a glance is

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:57.780
that the feminine protection
rhetoric

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:03.150
that the so-called femcare
industry used was a constant

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:07.330
and it was transnational until our
days with some twists according

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:12.370
to specific social context
where they were presented.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:15.650
These negative connotations
about menstruation

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:19.410
by giving a technological
fix to that object

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:22.600
and the [inaudible] menstrual
body in order to allow women

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.130
to maximize their productivity
every day of the month.

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:31.580 position:56%
But at the same time it wouldn't be
fair with the feminine care industry

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.140
if we don't say that the
companies also worked

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.130
around the positive connotation

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:41.960
about menstruation given its
relation with the female fertility.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.100
They highlighted this aspect
in the educational materials

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.800
where they continued
reproducing traditional narratives

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.890
about gender while doing its
[inaudible] on this new modern way

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:58.200
to manage and behave, think
and feel about menstruation.

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.210
Let's remember here that
the [inaudible] departments

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:05.990
of the companies started their
work at the 40's here in the US

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:09.430
and around the 60's in Argentina.

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:14.000
There are many educational
pamphlets and films here in the US

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.920
from the 40's, but I just found
one pamphlet in Argentina produced

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.590
by Johnson &amp; Johnson
at the end of the 60's.

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:26.190
So let me show you one
educational material,

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:29.890
a memorable one is the
story of menstruation

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:33.860
that Kimberly-Clark asked
Disney to produce in order

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:37.030
to disseminate its products
between the youngest.

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:40.700
It was released in 1946.

00:59:52.510 --> 01:00:14.170
[ Music ]

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.840
&gt;&gt; Why is nature always
called Mother Nature?

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:22.630
Perhaps it's because like any
mother she quietly manages so much

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:28.640
of our living without our
ever realizing there's a

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.940
woman [inaudible].

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:34.490
You wake up with no
more conscious planning

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:35.790
than we used in [inaudible].

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:41.530
Mother Nature controls many of
our routine bodily processes

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:46.150
through automatic control
centers called glands.

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:48.300
The story of menstruation
really begins

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.120
with one particular gland
it's located here at the base

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.320
of the brain and it's
called the pituitary gland.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.800
In our childhood years this
pituitary gland concentrates

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.460
on producing growth hormones.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.010
Busy little messengers which
circulate through the bloodstream.

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:10.550
They order the various bones
and tissues to get growing.

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:15.420
And as a girl grows up and
[inaudible] to dolls to books

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.110
that means her body is
obeying the orders issued

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.460
by the pituitary gland.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.720
Of course, these orders
vary among different girls,

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:29.210
some girls grow short, some
tall, some heavy and some slight.

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:35.200 position:56%
But there comes a time somewhere
between the ages of 11 and 17 though

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.280
about 13 is average when
the pituitary must turn part

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.820
of its attention to maturing
the body which it has grown.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:48.610
So it starts sending out a new
type of hormone, a maturing hormone

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.180
and that is when menstruation
begins.

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.310
When these maturing
hormones start coming

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.930
down through the bloodstream
to the ovaries.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:05.630
The ovaries themselves are
glands about the size of almonds.

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:09.620
And locked within each
ovary are thousands of eggs.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:13.960
Although these eggs are too small
to be seen by the human eye any one

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:19.300
of them has the possibility of
someday becoming a human being.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.450
Near the ovaries are
the fallopian tubes,

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:26.640
short canals which lead
to the uterus or womb.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.850
This hollow pear=shaped organ
opens into the vagina which is part

01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:34.980
of the birth canal and
is the external opening

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.730
for this whole group of organs.

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:42.310
So as you see, there is a
continuous passage from each ovary

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.940
through the fallopian
tubes, uterus and vagina

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.850
to the outside of the body.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:52.330
These organs function
in a continuous cycle.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:55.330
The pituitary gland
starts the process

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.570
when it sends its maturing hormones

01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:01.080
down through the bloodstream
to the ovaries.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.970
Now one of the ovaries passes on
an order of its own the uterus.

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:10.720 position:56%
It tells the cells which make up
the lining of the uterus to multiply

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.960
and fill themselves with
watery fluids and blood.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.370 position:56%
This begins the buildup, a thickened
lining of somewhat velvety material.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:25.050
At the same time an ovary has
been maturing an ovum or egg

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:28.860
which is magnified here
so that we can see it.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.050
About once a month one of these
tiny eggs passes out of the ovary

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:36.560
and finds its way into
a fallopian tube

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.440
where it moves along
toward the uterus.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.510
If the egg is impregnated, which
happens when a woman is going

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:48.430
to have a child, the egg
will stay within the uterus.

01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:51.320
Then the thickened lining
will provide nourishment

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.900
for the budding human being through
the early days of its development.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:59.430
However, most eggs pass
through the fallopian tubes

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.650
without being fertilized.

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:05.080
When this happens there's no use
for that potential nourishment

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.090 position:56%
in the buildup lining of the uterus.

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:11.930
And so in a few days it
passes from the body.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:15.710
This is the flow which
we call menstruation.

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:17.090
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi:
And we move forward now

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:19.620
because this is what
I wanted to just

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:25.370 position:56%
to take a look, you can take a look.

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:29.490
And now the [inaudible]
towards femininity.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:33.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Of course a girl may be irregular
during the first year or so,

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.710
but after that when her system
has settled down into a routine,

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:42.620
her period should always be about
the same number of days apart

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.660
and last about the
same length of time.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:50.700
Try not to throw yourself off
schedule by getting overtired,

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.750
emotionally upset or catching cold.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:57.260
And if your timing goes seriously
wrong or you are bothered

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:02.420 position:56%
with severe cramps or headaches, you
should have a talk with your doctor.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:06.110
Of course, you'll want to
keep a personal calendar.

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:10.420
Mark the first day of each period
and check to see that there are

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.020
about the same number
of days between periods.

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.540
It's not only a useful
record of past performance,

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.930
but it comes in handy when
you have to plan ahead.

01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:23.230
This calendar appears

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:27.280
in an interesting booklet
called very personally yours.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.580
This booklet has been prepared

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:32.870
to enlarge upon what you
learned from this brief film.

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:36.510
Among other things the
booklet explores that old taboo

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:39.520
against bathing during your period.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.830
Not only can you bathe,
you should bathe.

01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:46.630
Because during menstruation
your perspiration glands are

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.630
working overtime.

01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:55.180
Just be careful to avoid either
very hot water or very cold water.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.970
In fact, it's not a good idea
to anytime to shock your system

01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:01.350
with extremes anymore

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:04.480
to let yourself get
chilled or to catch cold.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.700
And as for the old taboo against
exercise, that's nonsense.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.160
Exercise is good for
you during menstruation.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.340
Just use common sense.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.630
When you come to think of it,

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:22.750
most of your daily routine
is on the mild side.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:27.260
It's going to extremes that's
wrong and to be avoided.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.820
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi:
Look at this, look at this.

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.820
&gt;&gt; To most girls the menstrual
period should bring no

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.820
severe discomfort.

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:37.240
Some girls have a little less
pep, a feeling of pressure

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.810
on the lower part of the body,
perhaps an occasional twinge

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:45.160
or a touch of nerves, but
don't let it get you down.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:50.690
After all no matter how you feel,
you have to live with people.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:52.570
You have to live with yourself too.

01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:56.460
And once you stop feeling sorry
for yourself and take those days

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.420
in your stride, you'll
find it easier

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:02.070
to keep smiling and even tempered.

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:05.510
You can do practically
everything you normally do.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:12.310
[ Music ]

01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:15.610
Provided you take common
sense care of yourself.

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:22.330
Exercises to relieve cramps are
illustrated in the booklet try them

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.690
with the guidance of
a qualified person.

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:26.390
You may find they help.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:30.900
And do something about that slouch.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:36.030
Sloppy posture is just as bad
inside as it looks outside.

01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:38.940
So stand up straight and
let the organs function

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.340
from the position that
nature intended.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:48.290
One way to help them function
normally is to avoid constipation.

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:52.670
Your reproductive organs lie
between the rectum and the bladder

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:54.520
and their external opening.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.350
And constipation will disturb the
relationship between these organs.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.020
So you'll find it worth your
while to drink plenty of water,

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:08.350
eat plenty of fruit and to
include cereals and eggs

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:12.480
and leafy vegetables in your diet.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.030
And incidentally, it's
smart to keep looking smart.

01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:22.110
That well-groomed feeling will give
you new poise and lift your morale,

01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:27.200
especially when it's backed up with
year round fresh air and sunshine

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.660
and plenty of rest and sleep.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.500
Because the best possible
insurance against trouble

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:37.060
on those days is healthy
living every day.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:40.240
And that's the story.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.970
There's nothing strange nor
mysterious about menstruation.

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:50.870
All life is built on cycles and
the menstrual cycle is one normal

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:54.860
and natural part of
nature's eternal plan

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.510
for passing on the gift of life.

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:09.850
[ Music ]

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:11.570
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi:
Okay, it might be funny

01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:15.900
but this was reproduced
in the majority

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.410
of the educational materials
with some [inaudible]

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:21.750
of course, but until the 80's.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:29.230
So as Iris Marion Young pointed
out before, such an insistence

01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:32.260
of the normalcy of
menstruation is an indicator

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.990
of its pathological consideration.

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:39.040
But let's go back to the positive
connotation of our menstruation

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.510
as the one that is
generalized today,

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:44.840
the educational materials
for the youngest.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.850 position:56%
That was crucial to complete the
normalization of the menstrual body.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.310
The positive connotation

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:53.460
of menstruation was
portrayed like this.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:57.500
First of all, menstruation was a
sign of the welcoming to womanhood.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.310
The traditional monism becoming a
young lady or [foreign language]

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:08.570
in Spanish helped to hide what
is a gender identity construction

01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:11.760
within the [inaudible] norm
as a natural derivation

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.680
from the pretended
abstractive reality of the body.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.160
And in the place when menstruation
was explained in a scientific way

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.140
from a medical perspective
reproducing a gender binaries

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.670
through the figure of
a natural sexy body

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:32.520
with particularly reproductive
organs and hormones

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.480
that allows the biological
reproductive capability

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.130
of female organisms.

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:40.450
We can continue unpacking
the re-inscription

01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:42.300
of traditional narratives

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.990
about gender following the
brilliant work of Emily Martin.

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:50.630
On the one hand menstruation
was explained using the feminine

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:55.880
stereotype of a passive egg that
slowly comes down to the encounter

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.790
of the masculine stereotype of an
active sperm that conquers the egg.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:04.570
Something really interesting
in these materials produced

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.300
in both countries between
the 40's and the 80's is

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:12.160
that the sperm was never seen in
the imagery that they provided.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.990
On the other hand menstruation
was noted as a waste and natural

01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:21.800
and [inaudible] chance to be
pregnant and be a mother someday

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.220
as if motherhood was the
correct destiny of a woman

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.650
because of her natural body.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:31.160
I have to say here that
menstruation can also be explained

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.450
within those scientific terms.

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:39.720
For example, as a defense from the
pathogens transported by the sperm.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.530
The biologist Margie
Profet had a very,

01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:45.820
very interesting paper
on this topic.

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.450
Furthermore, the educational
materials did something else,

01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:52.110 position:56%
they represented an idea menstruator

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.640
in introducing many other
disciplinary practices towards the

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.850
body apart from concealing
menstruation

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:00.280
with feminine protection products.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:05.240 position:56%
The idea menstruator was a desirable
and modern feminine young woman

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.950
from the perspective
of the masculine gaze

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.780
and the strong presence
of the mirror

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.380
in these materials is a strong
connotation of that gaze

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:15.310
that was portrayed as starting

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:19.370
to regulate the feminine
existence since the menarche.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:22.830
So let's take just a quick look
at the presence of the uterus

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:27.820 position:56%
of course embedded in this narrative
about the reproductive capability

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:31.940
of women's bodies and the mirror
in some of these materials.

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:39.260
This was published in 1952 and
it had new editions in 1959

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.420
and 1961, You're a Young Lady Now.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.660
It was a pamphlet produced
by Kimberly-Clark.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:51.000
There you can tell that the image
of the mirror is a constant.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.130
In Molly Grows Up it was
another film produced

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:57.090
by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1953.

01:12:57.090 --> 01:13:00.720
There you have the teacher that is
explaining almost the same thing

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.210
that we saw in the
story of menstruation

01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:06.560
about the body's menstruation
related

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.280
to the reproductive capability
of women's bodies and then Molly

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:17.540
in front of the mirror when she was
just about to have her menarche.

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:22.570
This is another pamphlet,
It's Wonderful Being a Girl,

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:29.720
published in 1986 produced by
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the same thing.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.820
And this is the only one material
that I told you that I found

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:36.980
in this period in Argentina it
was called Learn to be a Woman,

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:41.010
A Confidential Message
are Female Teenagers.

01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:43.990
This was a pamphlet
produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:49.400
and one really interesting thing
is that the imagery of the uterus

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:56.340
and the internal part of
women's genitalia is not seen

01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:59.310
in these educational
materials in Argentina.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:02.860
So it also [inaudible] make
sense with the advertisements

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:09.130 position:56%
of OB tampons that there was a
[inaudible] that was still remaining

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:15.800
in Argentina for woman,
for women sorry.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.020
And there is a short, but very
powerful paper on this written

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:25.250
by a Dacia Charlesworth
that applied perfectly well

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:30.740 position:56%
to characterize the idea menstruator
in this educational materials.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:35.670
In her study of American
pamphlets from 1959

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:42.100 position:56%
to 1998 she summarized exceptionally
well that the idea menstruator had

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.210
to be a mother someday, had to
use the proper scientific names

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:50.950
when discussing the menstrual
cycle, has to discuss menstruation

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:53.970
with another woman and
trusted adults only,

01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:58.540 position:56%
but will not be confident when
discussing menstruation with others.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:02.210
Although she doesn't feel her
best she will not use menstruation

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:04.830
as an excuse for behaving badly.

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:08.500
She will know that menstruation
should be kept in secret.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.920
She will practice using feminine
protection products before the

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.430
need arise.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.470
She will be willing to
engage in bodily [inaudible]

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:21.590
and she will use the various
feminine protection products

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:24.600
mentioned in the pamphlets.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:29.150
It's interesting because if you
analyze these materials you could

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:34.270 position:56%
tell that in the US until the end of
the 50's they just recommended pads

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:39.260 position:56%
for teens and by the end of the
50's they started to suggest the use

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:42.060
of tampons for teenagers too.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.540
On the contrary in Argentina,

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.960
by the end of the 60's
the educational material

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.200
that I found was still
suggesting just the use

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.640
of pads for young women.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.830 position:56%
And I have to say here that the
companies had a great work in trying

01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:01.910
to eliminate social and personal
fears over tampons as something

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:05.890
that could make woman loose
something really valuable

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:11.410
for our society such as virginity
or they could incite masturbation.

01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:13.600
And I could add one
more characteristic

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.290
of the idea menstruator
[inaudible] standard

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:19.870
of how normal menstruation
should be --

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:22.830
doesn't apply for her
particular case,

01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:26.650
the idea menstruator
should go to the doctor.

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:30.770 position:56%
Finally, the educational materials
of the companies did one more thing,

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:34.030
they prohibited some
activities during menstruation

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:36.300
that today seem to be ridiculous.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.380 position:56%
Some were very similar as what
traditional knowledge used to advise

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:43.570
for example, not taking
a bath or a cold bath

01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:45.180
or doing energetic movements.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:50.930 position:56%
And while the decades passed by they
eliminated all those prohibitions

01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:53.410
and that seemed to
coincide with the moment

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:56.970
in which the tampon became
suggested for teenagers.

01:16:56.970 --> 01:17:01.750
So I tried to show you
how the normalization

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.800
of the menstrual body
during the considerable part

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.490
of the 20th century helped

01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:11.250
to maximize women's body's
productivity while re-inscribing

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:15.130
traditional gender narratives
in many different levels.

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:18.340
And as a result of these new
disciplinary practice towards

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.720
women's bodies not
only all the traces

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.820
of menstruation were concealed,

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:26.360
but the menstrual stigma
was better concealed too.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.550
So this will present a historical
interest [inaudible] frame

01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:31.630
that allows to understand
why this way

01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:34.860
of menstruating is
currently in dispute.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.470
I would refer to this point
to close my presentation

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.820
because it opens new
questions for further research,

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.460
the pursuit to continue
[inaudible] work

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:48.990
about women's menstrual
bodies to the present.

01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:52.520
And there are some new
narratives around menstruation

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.940
in the femcare industry of
central countries and I have to say

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.460
that none of this is
happening in Argentina.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.570 position:56%
They still maintain menstrual stigma
because they are advertising pads

01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:06.610
and tampons to efficiently
conceal menstruation,

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:10.110
but they are deepening the
rhetoric of women's empowerment.

01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:13.610
A couple of examples
are the following.

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:18.050
The first one an ad of Always
brand, a Procter &amp; Gamble brand

01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:21.190
for the American market
shows a generational change

01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:24.640
in the experience of being
a woman towards what we can

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.300
call self-confidence.

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:30.190
But menstruation you will
see is never mentioned.

01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:33.960
Let's take a look, this
campaign is called Like a Girl.

01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:43.560
&gt;&gt; Hi, okay so I'm just going
to give you some actions to do

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.350
and [inaudible] the first
thing that comes to mind.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:48.510
Show me what it looks
like to run like a girl.

like to fight like a girl.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.840
Now throw like a girl.

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:17.860
&gt;&gt; My name is Dakota
and I'm 10 years old.

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:21.510
&gt;&gt; Show me what it looks
like to run like a girl.

01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:26.040
[ Music ]

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.180
Throw like a girl.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.100
Fight like a girl.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:35.610
What does it mean to you
when I say run like a girl?

01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:36.910
&gt;&gt; It means run [inaudible].

01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:42.430
&gt;&gt; So do you think you
just insulted your sister?

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:47.690
&gt;&gt; No, like yeah [inaudible]
girls, but not my sister.

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:50.160
&gt;&gt; Is like a girl a good thing?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.360
&gt;&gt; Actually I prefer [inaudible],
it's a bad thing or good thing.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.900
It sounds like a bad thing,

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.970
it sounds like you're
trying to humiliate someone.

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.230
&gt;&gt; So when they're in that
vulnerable time between 10

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:05.760
and 12 how do you think it
affects when somebody uses

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.610
like a girl as an insult?

01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:12.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think it definitely drops their
self-confidence and really puts them

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.320
down because during that
time they're already trying

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.190
to figure themselves out.

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:22.930
And when somebody says you hit like
a girl it's like well what does

01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:25.910
that mean because they think
they're a strong person,

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:29.140
it's kind of like telling
them that they're weak

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.700
and they're not as good as them.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:43.520
&gt;&gt; And what advice do you have to
young girls who are told they run

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.170
like a girl, hit like a girl, hit
like a girl, swing like a girl?

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:49.110
&gt;&gt; Keep doing it because
it's working.

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:55.930
Somebody else says that running
like a girl or kicking like a girl

01:20:55.930 --> 01:21:02.220 position:56%
or shooting like a girl is something

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.020
that you shouldn't be
doing that's their problem

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.320
because if you're still scoring

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.620
and you're still getting
the ball all the time

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:08.920
and you're still being
first you're doing it right,

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.220
it doesn't matter what they say.

01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.520
I mean yes, I kick like a girl
and I swing like a girl and I walk

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.820
like a girl and I wake
up in the morning

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.120
like a girl because I am a girl.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.420
And that's not something
that should be ashamed of it,

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.720
so I'm going to do it anyway.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.020
That's what they should do.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If I asked you to run like a girl
now would you do it differently?

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.620
&gt;&gt; I would run like myself.

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.420

also [inaudible] win the race?

&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi:
Rewrite the rules.

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:47.170
So the second one is another
body form from UK and it talks

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:51.770
about a blood that should not
hold us back, but it is related

01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:57.200
with the pain and the effort of
practicing a sport professionally

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.910
and menstruation again
is still a metaphor.

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:08.890
This campaign is called blood.

01:22:08.890 --> 01:23:18.830
[ Music ]

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:21.340
Live fearless.

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:25.280
So this is what is new under the
sun the femcare industry rhetoric

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.370
to refer to menstruation
in advertisements.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:32.890
But in addition new technologies
of menstrual management started

01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:36.360
to have a strong presence
in the market from the end

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.980
of the 20th century and the
beginning of the 21st century.

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:45.760
On the one hand new reusable
products such as the menstrual cup

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.500
or pads made of fabric that
you can use, wash and reuse,

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:55.770
the panties that include sort of
a fabric pad such as [inaudible].

01:23:55.770 --> 01:24:00.460
They pretend to break the menstrual
taboo, but they are still trying

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:05.000
to guarantee the efficiency
in avoiding the leaking.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.040
So I use quotes in the word new
because as you probably know,

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.540
some of them are not new at all
and especially the menstrual cup.

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:18.760
Here you can see that there are
many patents of menstrual cups

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.930
in the 30's here in the US.

01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:28.230
These technologies are supported by
discourses related to ecofeminism

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:31.630
and some others that relate
menstruation with positive,

01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:37.320
powerful, very essential
connotations of women's organisms.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.490
These technologies are a real
reaction to the menstrual taboo

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:45.680
that the femcare industry
perpetrated under the rhetoric

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.570
of liberation not only for
concealing menstruation,

01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:55.350
but also because all the unhealthy
issues related with dioxins

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:58.960
or dioxins and other
toxic substances found

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.160
in pads and tampons.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.710
The most renowned episode
was related

01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:09.130
with the toxic shock syndrome
in the late 70's here in the US,

01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:12.800
but there are still many
studies in the US and Argentina

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.050
that nowadays finding
toxic substances

01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:19.050
in industrial pads and tampons.

01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:23.660
And just related with the
unhealthy issues of pads

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:28.190
and tampons there are also new
tampons made of organic cotton

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:33.670
and some new brands, technologies
like tampons with vibrators

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:37.180
to relieve the menstrual cramps.

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:41.530
On the other hand other
significant industry,

01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:43.900
the pharmaceutical one started

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:48.440
to commercialize massively
last generation contraceptives

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.360
that suppress the menstrual cycle.

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.570
They are supported by minor
medical discourses that believe

01:25:54.570 --> 01:26:01.140
that menstruation is unuseful and
even harmful for women's health.

01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.440
[Inaudible] you may know him,

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.830
is one of the biggest
exponents of this discourse.

01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:10.220
These contraceptive methods
are advertised in the US

01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:14.410
as a convenient way to get rid of
the burden of menstruation not only

01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:18.330
as a way of avoiding very
important health issues related

01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:20.800
with the menstrual cycle.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.960
And from the results of my
research my hypothesis is

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.830
that the femcare industry
helped women disidentify

01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:30.980
with the menstrual body
during the past century

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:35.710 position:56%
and help the pharmaceutical industry
go for a more radical solution,

01:26:35.710 --> 01:26:37.800
the menstrual suppression.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.620 position:56%
On the one hand the femcare industry
needs women to bleed as much

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:46.660
as possible and on the other side
the pharmaceutical industry needs

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.430
women to feel blood
as an inconvenience.

01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:52.450
Finally some words about the field

01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:56.020
of menstrual activism very well
understood by Chris [inaudible]

01:26:56.020 --> 01:27:01.430
as a part of a third
wave of feminism.

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:05.330
Menstrual activism tends to
support the reusable methods

01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:06.710
that portray menstruation

01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:09.620
as a positive experience
of women's bodies.

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:12.110
And they work to do many things,

01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:16.830
including getting menstruation
out of the closet.

01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:20.250
All the social media reactions
related to what I showed you

01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:23.900
at the beginning of these
presentations, I mean the practice

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.310
of free bleeding, the
social exposure of leaking

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:32.970
or just the disclosure
that women menstruate

01:27:32.970 --> 01:27:36.020
in certain territories
traditionally masculine,

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.000
such as sports can be read
as signs of a well-nurtured

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.320
and still alive menstrual stigma.

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.860
In the 21st century we can say

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.330
that we made great advancements
in the feminist agenda.

01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:54.190
The gender equity is still
incompletely conquered,

01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:58.950
the lethal violence against women
is facing them in the more privacy,

01:27:58.950 --> 01:28:02.350
genital, productive
and subtle violence

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:06.640
like the symbolic violence
toward women as I described it.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:09.350
And the most interesting
part of the story is

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:13.040
that that violence is concealed
under the look of a discourse

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.600
of women's liberation
or women's empowerment.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.840
So I would like to end
my presentation saying

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.970
that feminism is not a
bad word, we need feminism

01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:26.720
which is not an anti-man
movement as the media

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:29.680
and some common sense
thinking like to portray it.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.920
Feminism is a way to understand and
expose social inequalities related

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.820
with sex gender system in
all its intersectionality

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:41.160
with different forms
of social oppressions.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.640
This is to say that if
feminism is a bad word,

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.030
it's an essential bad word.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:51.050
And we need more feminist research,
but we also need to take it

01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:54.240
out of the [inaudible] of the
books and the scientific events.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.400
We also need action
and concrete change.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.100
So as I said, I would like
to finish with the voice

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.630
of [inaudible] her
public answer to Instagram

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:08.060
after they censored her
image of menstrual leakage.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:14.040
And I'm paraphrasing Ruby Kaur
as if Instagram was just a voice

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:18.400
like any other voice of the society
that thinks that symbolic violence

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.710
against women is a minor issue.

01:29:21.710 --> 01:29:25.030
She said, thank you
Instagram for providing me

01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:29.350
with the exact response my
work was created to critique.

01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:32.480
You deleted my photo
twice stating that it goes

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:35.010
against community guidelines.

01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:38.200
I will not apologize for not
feeding the ego and pride

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.820
of misogynist society that will
have my body under an underwear,

01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:48.490
but not be okay with a small
leak when your pages are filled

01:29:48.490 --> 01:29:52.680
with countless photos and accounts
where women so many who are

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:58.340 position:56%
under age are objectified, pornified
and treated less than human.

01:29:58.340 --> 01:29:59.640
Thank you.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.510
Thank you so very much.

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:10.890
[ Applause ]

01:30:10.890 --> 01:30:12.190
Okay.

01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:13.770
&gt;&gt; Megan Metcalf: Do you feel
like answering questions?

01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:15.070
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi: Of course.

01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:21.050
&gt;&gt; Megan Metcalf: Does anybody have
questions they would like to ask?

01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:23.460
&gt;&gt; I'm proud to identify

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:29.420
as the professor Kiran Gandhi
[inaudible] in my classroom.

01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.720
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi: Wow.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:35.830
&gt;&gt; A symbol and she's supposed
to be here tomorrow night.

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:37.270
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi: Wow.

01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:39.380
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] excuse me on
Tuesday night [inaudible].

01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:44.040
One of the things I
notice in your excellent,

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:49.580
outstanding presentation is
how often women are scolded

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:54.230
to make sure they are pleasant,
good-tempered, in a good mood

01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:59.190
for others and we assume for men.

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:04.880
My first reading of the
image about, you know,

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:11.910 position:56%
women save men's lives I didn't know
it was about the use of cellucotton.

01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:15.820
I assume that ad was
that women stayed

01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:18.470
on the production lines longer

01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:23.400
because they had hygiene products
and, therefore, helped win the war.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:29.140 position:56%
I feel like almost every image
comes back to managing your symptoms

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:33.110
to make life more pleasant for men.

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:35.550
Do you want to comment on that?

01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:36.850
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi:
It's interesting

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:42.490
because maybe it's the male
gaze, it's not just men right

01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:46.730
and it's not performing on
ideal femininity for men.

01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:52.250
Actually you get like not a
very nice reaction when you talk

01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:54.990
with women and you say
something like this.

01:31:54.990 --> 01:32:00.320
They'd say I don't dress
for a man for example,

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.960
some women don't like to hear that.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:06.390
I think that the intersection

01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:13.450
of the male gaze it's a strong
cultural [inaudible] that I tried

01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:17.880
to show something related
with this in this study

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:22.530
that has sexually Foucault
in the base.

01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:30.830
I don't know if I answer what --
well it's like a reflection right.

01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:32.510
Yeah, I would say something
like this,

01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:34.260
it's like the male
gaze surveillance.

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:48.120
&gt;&gt; I'm interested to know what
you think about the [inaudible].

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.070
&gt;&gt; Eugenia Tarzibachi:
Oh yes, it's interesting.

01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:54.020
I think that New York is
already doing that right.

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:58.080
I think that it's great because.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.150
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:33:00.150 --> 01:33:05.740
Well in the 70's there was
written a very nice essay

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:13.090 position:56%
about what would happen if men
could menstruate from Gloria Steinem

01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:18.040
and she said that pads and
tampons would be free probably

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.850
between many other things.

01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:24.890
Well actually I think that
it's an interesting initiative

01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:30.550
because this is one of the things
that we are asked to perform,

01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:35.810 position:56%
we are asked to conceal menstruation
to perform an idea of femininity,

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:40.650
so at least they should get rid
of the tax from the products.

01:33:40.650 --> 01:33:45.040
So I think it's a good initiative.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:49.520
But it's also good to
disseminate, to disseminate --

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:53.100
well what is happening
with the toxic substances

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:58.640
that they are still found
in pads and tampons.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:04.910
I am not sure of how
dangerous they are

01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:08.680
that I read many current
papers on that.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.820
So I don't know if the
industry has enough strength

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:19.030
to hide those results
of these studies.

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:23.780 position:56%
But I think that it's a good
initiative, but at the same time I'm

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:28.480
like a little bit worried
about these findings.

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:32.870
Probably the menstrual cup
is the best technology,

01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:37.970
the more innocuous technology.

01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:45.180
Well and some other thing that I
would like to add to that answer is

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:50.160
that for example in Argentina we
have a public national program

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.420
of reproductive health.

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:57.730
And we have like had big variety
of contraceptives that are free

01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:03.520
for women, women from
low social status.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:08.830
And they don't have any technology
to manage menstruation and actually

01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:10.790 position:56%
when we have like a natural disaster

01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:14.650
in Argentina probably here it
happens the same way I am not sure,

01:35:14.650 --> 01:35:18.040
but in Argentina they
don't give women menstrual

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.250
management technologies.

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:25.790
I think that it's so well hidden

01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:28.970
that they forget about
women's needs.

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.340
&gt;&gt; Megan Metcalf: All right,
I guess that wraps this up.

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:40.640
