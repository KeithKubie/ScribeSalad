ANDY GRANOWITZ: Hi.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.560
Andy Granowitz here, developer
advocate for Google Analytics.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.090
Today I'm going to talk a
little about setting up Google

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.040
Analytics for the first time.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.840
Google Analytics is known for
being straightforward to deploy

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.062
on your website or app.

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:17.520
And although this is true,
there are a few important things

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.360
to consider when
you install Google

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.250
Analytics for the
first time to make

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.580
sure you get the most out
of the powerful features

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.900
that Google Analytics offers.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.587
The most basic
measurement track--

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:29.670
measurement is going to
be pageview or screen view

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.370
tracking on web and
app, respectively.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.500
For most websites, setting
up pageview tracking

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.539
is straightforward.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.330
Add the Google Analytics
JavaScript snippet

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.140
on every page, and
Google Analytics

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.300
will count each time
the page is loaded.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.690
This is a little bit more
involved on mobile apps.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.400
But once you set up
screen view tracking

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.790
using iOS or Android SDK,
the results are very similar.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.940
Google Analytics will measure
a lot by default, even

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.070
with this basic setup.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.000
For example, with just page
or screen view tracking,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.650
Google Analytics
will automatically

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.160
allow you to analyze the
session duration, time

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.470
on specific pages or screens;
geo-information, like city

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.240
and state; technology data,
like mobile device or browser;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.410
user flow between
pages or screens;

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.960
and where users are coming
from, like search engines,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.620
social networks, referrals
from other sites, and so on.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.000
So there's a lot that's
captured automatically.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.560
But with some customization,
Google Analytics

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.320
can capture user
interactions that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.030
are unique to your site
or app and that are really

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.810
important to your business.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.540
Google Analytics offers many
different customizations

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.880
for many different
use cases ranging

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.935
from measuring e-commerce to
how long resources take to load,

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.310
but there are
three that I'd like

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.120
to highlight when
first getting set up--

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.520
events, custom dimensions,
and campaign tagging.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.170
Events are used to measure
interactions within a given

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.530
page, in other words,
anything that is not

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.930
a page load or a new screen.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.250
But keep in mind that you don't
need to measure everything.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.110
Think about what are the most
important user interactions

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.850
and plan to measure those.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.660
This will prevent data
overload when doing analysis.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.540
Custom dimensions.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.140
As we discussed,
Google Analytics

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.660
captures a lot of
data by default.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.620
But often, the most
important information

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.824
is very specific
to your business,

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:23.490
making it difficult
for Google Analytics

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.500
to measure without a
little help from you.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.040
With custom dimensions,
you can send custom data

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.160
to Google Analytics,
which will automatically

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.970
get correlated with
all of the other data

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.480
that Google Analytics collects.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.890
For example, when signing
up for your newsletter,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.850
if the user has the option
to identify their industry,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.910
you may want to pass this
information as a custom

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.060
dimension.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.240
Another example might be when a
user signs up for your service,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.207
whether they signed up
for the 30-day trial,

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:52.165
a standard membership,
or a premium membership.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.020
The final customization
that I'd like to talk about

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.780
is campaign tagging.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.989
Google Analytics looks
at the HTTP refer

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.530
and does its best
to figure out where

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.300
your traffic is coming from.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.710
But when you run custom
campaigns, like through an ad

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.380
network, or if you're
doing some email marketing,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.310
or, really, any
other medium, you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.590
can use the Google
Analytics URL Builder

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.840
to add query parameters
to the URL you're

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.420
promoting to your users.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.250
When users click on that link,
the parameters you've added

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.710
are automatically recognized
by Google Analytics.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.010
So in your reports, you'll
be able to find out exactly

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.050
which campaigns brought
users to your site or app

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.390
and what they ultimately did.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.250
One special case.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.230
If you use AdWords,
I strongly recommend

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.180
that you link Google Analytics
and AdWords accounts.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.430
By doing so, your AdWords
campaigns will automatically

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.470
get tagged with
campaign parameters,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.850
and a lot of other
valuable data will

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.010
be imported into your
Google Analytics account.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.380
In addition to this deep
integration with AdWords,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.930
Google Analytics
can also integrate

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.770
with other Google products, such
as AdSense, Webmaster Tools,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.830
AdMob, and more.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.580
Be sure to find out
if there's an easy way

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.246
to connect Google
Analytics and whatever

00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:08.080
technologies you are using,
whether they are Google or not.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.740

customizations and more,
