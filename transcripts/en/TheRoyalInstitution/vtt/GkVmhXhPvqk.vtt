00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.340
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.300
Today I want to talk to you
about Chromosome Two.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.650
And to do that, I've
come to Dublin Zoo.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:37.200
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.430
So you can probably see some
chimpanzees here behind me.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.660
And one of the most surprising
discoveries in modern genetics

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.360
was that these animals, which
really do look quite different

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.760
from us physically, are, at
the genetic level, almost

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.840
indistinguishable.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.395
About 98% the same.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:57.150
 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.810
However, there are some
distinguishing

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.680
characteristics.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.520
And one of these is that whereas
we have 23 pairs of

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.610
chromosomes, chimpanzees
have 24.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.990
So we're going to look at what
happened with that extra

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.240
chromosome.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:20.860
 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.940
OK, so here we have some human
chromosomes and some

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.630
chimpanzee chromosomes.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.720
And we can do a quite simple
analysis of this, which is we

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.570
can just line them up against
the matching DNA.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.990
So when we do this, what we
find is that one human

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.610
chromosome lines up exactly
with one chimpanzee

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.600
chromosome.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.850
And this works throughout the
whole genome, that is except

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.930
for Chromosome Two.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.280
Because when we look at human
Chromosome Two, it lines up

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.190
with two chimpanzee
chromosomes.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.410
And this is the same for
gorilla and orangutan.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.210
One human Chromosome Two lines
up with two chromosomes in the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.470
other species.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.670
So what we know is that these
two chromosomes fused to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.270
create human Chromosome Two.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.960
This then created a genetic
incompatibility between the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.360
two lineages, a permanent
separation,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.105
a point of no return.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:21.060
 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.740
So actually, this is a really
significant event in the story

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.990
of our genome.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:56.401
