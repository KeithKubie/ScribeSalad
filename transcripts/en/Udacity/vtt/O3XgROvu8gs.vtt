So, a negative x coordinate is to the left of the origin. And a negative y

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:08.342
coordinate is below the origin. Can you match the following points to the

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:12.964
appropriate places on the graph? Write the letter in the corresponding box. For

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:17.503
example, if you think this point is letter c, you would write c in the box. Good

00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:17.853
luck.
