We know that B of t is in the form P times e to the rt. In the problem, we

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.020
found out that P equals 1,000, and r equals negative one half, or negative 0.5.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.684
Let's plug those numbers in. That gives us the equation B of t equals 1,000 e

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:21.340
to the negative 0.5t. Let's take a look at what this graph looks like for this

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.194
function. The graph for this function looks like this. The horizontal axis

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:30.718
represents t, the number of hours that have passed. And the vertical axis

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:34.990
represents B of t, the number of bacteria that are remaining. We can see we

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.329
have a nice exponential decay curve.
