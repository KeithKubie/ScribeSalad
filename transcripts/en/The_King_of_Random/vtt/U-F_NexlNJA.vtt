00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.949
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to escape from professional double-locking

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.289
handcuffs, without using anything but a standard
office paperclip.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.240
Start by biting the small end of your paperclip
so there’s a little dent at the top near

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.540
the end, then unfold the side of the clip
to make a little handle. Hold the clip between

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.530
your 3rd and 4th fingers, and guide the head
of the paperclip into the keyhole, then use

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.760
the meaty part of your thumb to turn the makeshift
handle, and free your hand. Once you have

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.520
one hand loose, it’s really easy to get
the other one freed up as well. And in just

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.199
a few seconds, you’re out.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.520
Now let’s take a look at how this works
mechanically. If we peek inside the cuffs

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.290
you can see there are triple stranded ratchets
that allow the cuffs to close in one direction,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.590
but lock up and prevent the bar from opening
the other way.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.180
When we insert a paperclip and turn inward,
you can see it catches on the ratchets and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.660
pushes them down out of the way.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.470
And by disengaging this mechanism, there’s
nothing holding the cuffs together anymore,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.710
so they literally, fall right open.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.890
Now the direction you turn the paperclip really
depends on which keyhole you’re working

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.610
on at the time. But as a rule of thumb go
in the top edge of the keyhole on the thin

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.079
side of the cuffs, then turn toward the wide
end of the cuffs to open them.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.709
Now it’s a little more challenging to pick the
lock if you’re the one wearing them, especially

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:11.539
if they’re the hinged kind like these, but
with a little practice you can still gain

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.069
your freedom within seconds.

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.469
Now obviously handcuffs aren’t the most
complicated of locks, but that doesn’t mean

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.179
you should ever try escaping from the police.
If you do, it’ll actually make your life

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.770
a lot more difficult, so it’s just better
to respect the law, and stay out of trouble

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.329
in the first place.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.359
But on the other hand, if you ever get kidnapped,
held hostage, or abused, it’s important

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.099
to have options. And there’s one more option
you need to know about, in case your handcuffs

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.740
have been double-locked.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.609
The sides of these cuffs have two little pins,
and when they’re pushed all the way in,

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.919
they lock the handcuffs in place so they can’t
be opened or closed. Professional handcuffs

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:47.689
are made this way to keep the ratchets from
cinching up and causing nerve damage to prisoners.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.189
And it also makes lock picking a little more
difficult.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.329
Look closely at the keyhole when the pin is
pushed, and you’ll see the double-locking

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.289
mechanism slides into place at the bottom.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.209
You’ll need to disengage the double-lock
first, by turning the paperclip the other

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.279
direction, until you hear it click. Then go
ahead and open the cuffs the same way as before.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.299
That’s all there is to it.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.530
Well know you know how to use a humble paperclip,
to escape from heavy-duty, professional grade

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.440
handcuffs. Just make sure you use your head,
and only use this technique, for entertainment,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.240
or to bust loose from the bad guys. Well that's it for now.  If you like this video, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
