00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.230
But not everything is a big data problem. There are lots

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.990
of cases where you can use a traditional system to store, manage

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.380
and process your data. So the first thing you need to

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.810
decide, is do you really have big data? To make that call,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.239
we need some sort of definition of what big data means.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.040
Which of these would you consider to be big data? You won't

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.820
be graded on this. Just give it your best guess. Would

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.550
you consider the order details for purchases at a single store to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.680
be big data. Or all orders across

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.370
hundreds of stores nationwide. Say, an individual's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.420
stock portfolio. Or all stock transactions for

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.290
the New York Stock Exchange for a year.
