00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.377
There's an organism 
that changed the world.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:13.678
It caused both the first mass extinction
in Earth's history

00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:16.547
and also paved the way for complex life.

00:00:16.547 --> 00:00:17.518
How?

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:21.670
By sending the first free oxygen
molecules into our atmosphere,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.139
and they did all this
as single-celled life forms.

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:26.779
They're cyanobacteria,

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.676
and the story of these simple organisms

00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:31.553
that don't even have nuclei 
or any other organelles

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:34.859
is a pivotal chapter 
in the story of life on Earth.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.489
Earth's atmosphere wasn't always 
the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.079
3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere
was mostly nitrogen,

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.211
carbon dioxide,

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.510
and methane.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.662
Almost all oxygen was locked up 
in molecules like water,

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:50.599
not floating around in the air.

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:53.460
The oceans were populated by
anaerobic microbes.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.501
Those are simple, unicellular life forms
that thrive without oxygen

00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.630
and get energy by scavenging
what molecules they find.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.472
But somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago,

00:01:04.472 --> 00:01:06.510
one of these microbial species,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.830
probably floating 
on the surface of the ocean,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.011
evolved a new ability: photosynthesis.

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:15.592
Structures in their cell membrane
could harness the energy from sunlight

00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:20.301
to turn carbon dioxide and water
into oxygen gas and sugars,

00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.992
which they could use for energy.

00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:26.881
Those organisms were the ancestors
of what we now call cyanobacteria.

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.413
Their bluish color comes from 
the blue-green pigments

00:01:29.413 --> 00:01:31.594
that capture the sunlight they need.

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:36.092
Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria
a huge advantage over other species.

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:37.992
They could now produce their own energy

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:40.991
from an almost endless supply 
of raw ingredients,

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:43.182
so their populations exploded

00:01:43.182 --> 00:01:47.552
and they started polluting the atmosphere
with a new waste product: oxygen.

00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:52.087
At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was
soaked up by chemical reactions with iron

00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:53.914
or decomposing cells,

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.722
but after a few hundred million years,

00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:59.672
the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen
faster than it could be absorbed,

00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:02.033
and the gas started building up
in the atmosphere.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.979
That was a big problem for the rest
of Earth's inhabitants.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.743
Oxygen-rich air 
was actually toxic to them.

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:08.631
The result?

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:13.971
About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass
extinction of virtually all life on Earth,

00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:16.273
which barely spared the cyanobacteria.

00:02:16.273 --> 00:02:19.353
Geologists call this
the Great Oxygenation Event,

00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:21.862
or even the Oxygen Catastrophe.

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:23.314
That wasn't the only problem.

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:26.914
Methane had been acting as a potent
greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm,

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:32.925
but now, the extra oxygen reacted with
methane to form carbon dioxide and water,

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:34.665
which don't trap as much heat.

00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:36.294
The thinner atmospheric blanket

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:39.944
caused Earth's first, 
and possibly longest, ice age,

00:02:39.944 --> 00:02:41.765
the Huronian Glaciation.

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.896
The planet was basically 
one giant snowball

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.123
for several hundred million years.

00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:48.045
Eventually, life adjusted.

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:51.365
Aerobic organisms, 
which can use oxygen for energy,

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:54.897
started sopping up some of the excess
gas in the atmosphere.

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:57.015
The oxygen concentration rose and fell

00:02:57.015 --> 00:03:01.095
until eventually it reached 
the approximate 21% we have today.

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:03.875
And being able to use 
the chemical energy in oxygen

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.826
gave organisms the boost they needed
to diversify

00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:09.215
and evolve more complex forms.

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:12.417
Cyanobacteria had a part 
to play in that story, too.

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:14.195
Hundreds of millions of years ago,

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:18.738
some other prehistoric microbe
swallowed a cyanobacterium whole

00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:21.556
in a process called endosymbiosis.

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:26.036
In doing so, that microbe acquired
its own internal photosynthesis factory.

00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:29.006
This was the ancestor of plant cells.

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.136
And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts,

00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:35.328
the organelles that carry out 
photosynthesis today.

00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:39.467
Cyanobacteria are still around
in almost every environment on Earth:

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:40.307
oceans,

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:41.205
fresh water,

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:42.016
soil,

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.167
antarctic rocks,

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:44.359
sloth fur.

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.398
They still pump oxygen
into the atmosphere,

00:03:46.398 --> 00:03:51.037
and they also pull nitrogen out to
fertilize the plants they helped create.

00:03:51.037 --> 00:03:53.217
We wouldn't recognize life on Earth
without them.

00:03:53.217 --> 00:03:54.437
But also thanks to them,

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:56.598
we almost didn't have 
life on Earth at all.
