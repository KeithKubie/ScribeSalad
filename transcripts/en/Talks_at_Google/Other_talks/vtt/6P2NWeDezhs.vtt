00:00:02.074 --> 00:00:03.990
CATHERINE KAPUTA: --not
even the Google brand.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.630
And that's a very powerful
brand, as you all know.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.600
It's one of the most admired
companies in the world,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.140
voted most innovative company.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.320
No, we're not going
to talk about Google.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.840
We're here to talk about the
most important brand you'll

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.600
ever market, brand you.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.060
And virtual branding
and social selling

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.740
is especially
important for sellers,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.640
for sales professionals
to really understand.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.290
Because if you don't leverage
it, as powerful as Google is,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.510
you won't be leveraging things
that your competitors are

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.140
leveraging.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.530
You won't be leveraging things
that your clients and prospects

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.950
are using.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.150
So it's important, when
you think about it,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.510
to build a brand for yourself
online as well as in person.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.260
Social selling and virtual
branding on LinkedIn

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.600
can help you do that.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.860
If you want to
expand your network,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.333
shorten the sales cycle,
LinkedIn can help you do that.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:08.340
Before we start, let's look at
an interesting story of a sales

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.360
person who transcended
the old world of selling

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.900
and is very successful now
in the new world of selling,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.040
Barbara Corcoran,
who is a salesperson

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.709
in a different area than yours.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.250
And Barbara has an
interesting story.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.240
She moved to New
York in her late 20s.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.440
She had 22 different jobs,
cycled through them all, more

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.880
than I even had, and started
out, went to New York City,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.310
and established a real
estate brokerage business

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.620
with her boyfriend.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.945
And after about six
months, she figured out

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:51.550
he was having an affair
with his office secretary.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.660
So she says, I'm out of here,
and they divvy up the assets.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.840
She gets $1,000, and she
goes to start her own firm.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.360
As she's leaving,
he goes, you'll

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.840
never be able to
make it without me.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.669
And she starts her own company.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.600
She calls it the Corcoran Group.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.460
And at this time, this
was the mid 1980s,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.820
and it was a time that there
wasn't a lot of information

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.320
about residential real
estate prices in New York.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.040
It was a very secretive world,
and it was run by wealthy women

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.480
in mink coats that had keys
to all the best apartments

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.560
and kept all the
information very secret.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.890
And so Barbara saw this
hole in the marketplace,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.980
and she thought, I'm
going to fill that hole.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.220
Her new firm, in its first year
it just sold 11 apartments.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.430
So she added up the sales
prices of all 11 apartments,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.380
divided by 11, and came up with
$242,000 as the average price.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.630
And she wrote a report that she
called "The Corcoran Report."

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.410
And she made 60 Xerox copies,
sent them to 60 reporters

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.230
at "The New York
Times," and it landed

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.640
on the front page of the real
estate section of "The New York

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.200
Times."

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.500
The lead sentence was,
according to Barbara Corcoran,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.750
expert on high-end real estate
in New York, blah, blah, blah.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.210
So overnight she
went from a nobody

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.310
to somebody that
had a brand, that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.100
had a visibility
as a strong leader.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.620
Then for her second issue
of "The Corcoran Report,"

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.990
she thought, gee, I'd
like to expand my network.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.120
I'd like to have wealthy
people endorsing me.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.530
And when you think of a very
famous person in New York

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.440
real estate that you would be
proud to have endorse yourself,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.430
who comes to mind
in the '80s who's

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.194
still very prominent today?

00:03:54.194 --> 00:03:55.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.985
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:56.814
But also--

00:03:56.814 --> 00:03:57.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.438
CATHERINE KAPUTA: No,
Donald Trump is it.

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:00.610
Donald Trump is it.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.590
So she wanted Donald
Trump to endorse her.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.970
So she calls his office, and
she says to the secretary,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.000
I'm doing the second
issue of "The Corcoran

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.620
Report" on the most expensive
residential buildings in New

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.070
York City, and I'd like
to interview Mr. Trump.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.030
And the secretary
goes, Barbara who?

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.660
And she says, well, there was
a feature in "The New York

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.160
Times."

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.920
So she said, he's very busy.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.660
I really can't set
up an appointment.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.940
And then she said, oh, that's
too bad, because according

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.100
to my calculation--
at that time he

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.870
was advertising Trump
Tower in the 1980s,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.990
and he was advertising it as the
most expensive building in New

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.810
York City-- Trump Tower
is not number one.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.680
She gets a meeting with
Donald Trump telling him

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.130
he's number two.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.730
So she has the meeting
with Donald Trump,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.060
and he says to her, here's how
to calculate the average sale

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.560
price.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.454
And of course she
knew that there

00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:08.870
were other ways of calculating
it and that by most of them

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.410
his building was
the most expensive,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.370
but she let him convince her.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.380
And then he said to her
at the end of the meeting,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.250
you know, I'm running a
major ad campaign right now

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.320
on Trump Tower, and
I'll put in each ad

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.690
that it's the most expensive
residential building according

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.320
to "The Corcoran Report."

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.710
So then she became
even more successful

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.750
because she had Donald
Trump's endorsement.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.440
So one of the things that I
want to leave you with this

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.570
you want to attach
an idea to yourself.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.650
My first rule of
branding is you want

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.020
to attach an idea to yourself.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.205
Barbara attached an idea that
she was a real estate expert.

00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:54.790
And she had very
little experience,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.410
but she attached
that idea to herself.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.900
It was a different idea,
because at that time

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.880
no one was filling that
place in the marketplace.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.640
So you want to attach
a different idea.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.740
In a sea of goldfish, you
want to be a green fish.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.530
You want to attach
an idea that's

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.840
authentic, that's something
that's true to you.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.480
And you want to
attach an idea that's

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.076
relevant to the marketplace.

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:20.700
Anyway, here's my
Donald Trump picture.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.150
This is Donald Trump's
reaction when he found out

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.720
that he wasn't going to be
the number one building.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.220
And so he ran this ad
campaign, the most expensive

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.140
residential building
in New York City,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.350
which leads me to my
second rule of branding.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.400
You want to network.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.900
You want to network
for influential people.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.160
Marketers always
know the best way

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.460
to sell yourself is to get
other people to do it for you.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.260
Then in the mid 1990s
during another slump

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.230
in the real estate
market in New York,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.310
Barbara Corcoran
read that Madonna

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.710
was looking for an
apartment in Manhattan.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.447
And at the time she didn't
have any celebrity clients.

00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:08.530
She wanted to have them,
but she didn't have them.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.230
She read that Madonna was
looking for apartments.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.400
So she called all the
news stations and said,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.890
I have a point of view on
what apartments Madonna should

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.880
be looking at, and so she
got on the evening news,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.200
and she was introduced as
the broker to the stars.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.560
As I said, she didn't have
any celebrity clients.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.250
But as a result
of that interview,

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.990
she got a call the next day from
Richard Gere's agent saying,

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.560
Richard Gere wants to find
an apartment in Manhattan.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.280
Do you think you
can meet with him?

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.280
She said, you know what?

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.730
I think I can fit
it in, which leads

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.360
to my third rule of branding.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.120
It's all about perceptions.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.440
Branding is all
about perceptions.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.720
It doesn't matter who's better.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.340
It's really what
perceptions are.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.140
When I was a kid and people
would make fun of me,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.780
I'd go crying to my mother.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.230
And she'd say, forget
about what other people say

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.410
and what other people think.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.880
What's important
is what you think.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.850
But it's not true.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.100
It is important what
other people think.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.690
That was bad advice.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.600
And branding and
virtual branding

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.250
is about building positive
perceptions for brand you.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.420
And really branding
is about what

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.039
you do to the minds of other
people by what you're saying.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.390
And that leads to my fourth
principle of branding.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.260
You always want to be
expanding into new markets.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.100
How has the market changed?

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.850
One thing that's going on in
the whole technology area,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.760
according to Gartner 80%
of marketing tech decisions

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.280
will be made by lines
of business by 2016.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.240
So there's a lot of
technology buyers

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.980
that aren't just
traditional IT guys that

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.620
are going to be part of it.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.530
So thinking of new markets and
how to present yourself well

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.040
in those new markets.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.890
So then flash forward.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.462
Barbara sells her
business for $70 million.

00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:12.350
You see on "The Shark Tank" now.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.110
She's sort of brought her
brand into modern world.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.820
She's very active on
LinkedIn and television,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.230
other social media.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.960
And it was interesting, because
she wrote a blog a couple weeks

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.870
ago that she did a mailing
to her clients and prospects.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.640
And she said I got more calls
about this marketing campaign

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.350
than anything else I did.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.260
And what was interesting
wasn't what was in the package.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.330
It was the stamp that I used.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.310
She was pretty well-known.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.490
It's not something we
can do and get away with,

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.570
but she did a stamp with her
picture on it from [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.090
and it got everybody
talking, which

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.880
leads to my next
principle of branding.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.900
You want to think outside in.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.870
You want to think
of what reaction

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.940
do I want to get
from buyers, and what

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.630
do I have to do to
get that reaction.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.020
So if you want to get
in "The New York Times,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.325
you need to provide information.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.040
Or if you want to be
quoted by the media,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.030
you want to be providing
fresh information that no one

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.970
else has provided them with.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.780
If you want to get
endorsed by Donald Trump

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.870
and you don't know
him, you need to think

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.030
of what is his mindset?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.365
How can I get him
to take the call?

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:36.240
So you want to think
of who is my market,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.650
and what do I have to
do to reach that market?

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.540
And my sixth
principle of branding

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.580
is you want to
disguise your message.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.210
The branding world is all about
commercials that they really

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.310
go into a really detailed
explanation of what

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.750
the product is or
what the service is.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.910
It's really all about
image, how the brand

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.020
makes you feel, the kind of
people that use that product.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.520
So it's much more effective
to sell your story,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.740
to wrap your brand
in a story, so

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.520
to tell stories and
do interesting things

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.760
that clients and prospects
are interested in.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.270
And so here's Barbara today.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.950
This is her LinkedIn profile.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.670
She's an Influencer on LinkedIn,
so she's one of the bloggers

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.290
that they feature
along with Jack

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:32.020
Welch and other well-known
people, which leads me

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.450
to my seventh rule of branding.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.000
You want to use LinkedIn to
build brand and increase sales.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.770
Here's an interesting statistic.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:47.600
64% of all corporate website
traffic comes from LinkedIn.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.170
So it's a very powerful
area to build your brand,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.390
because so many people look
at things there and then go

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.460
to visit a corporate website.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.050
Facebook is decreasing.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.450
It was 30%.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.390
Now it's about 17%.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.850
And Twitter is in
the teens as well.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.940
But it's really
dominated by LinkedIn.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.230
It's got 180 million
members, but it's

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.660
a very, very powerful
force for buyers.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:22.400
So all of the changes that have
happened in the sales world

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.410
and in the marketing
world have come

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.210
about because of
the internet and how

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.830
it's transformed everything.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.900
And we're all familiar with the
marketing funnel, the old way

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.070
of marketing and selling where
at the top it was a funnel.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.920
There were a lot of products.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.840
That's when
advertising took place.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.490
And then it narrowed
down as people

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.250
went through the sales process.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.260
And then there was a lot of
activity at the other end,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.460
whether it was point of
purchase or one-to-one sales.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.900
Today the image is a
double-ended focus funnel,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.240
because clients and
prospects have access

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.790
to so much information.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.820
They educate themselves a lot.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.720
So it's push-pull marketing
that's taking place.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.350
It's not just people
pushing their message out

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.830
but also clients
pulling the message in.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:16.730
One of the research studies show
that 57% of the sales decisions

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.720
are made by clients,
are made by prospects

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.180
before they even call somebody
to find out more information.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.460
So what's the mindset
of top social sellers?

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.910
There's been some studies done.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.790
Almost 90% of them use
LinkedIn as the focus,

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.750
because that's where the fish
are that they want to get.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.710
They put a lot of attention
into doing their profile.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.150
Over 40% rate their
profile as well done.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.380
So they take the time to
write a very good summary.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.930
They focus a lot on the
headline, the visual, their job

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.450
experience.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.270
Instead of just a
couple of sentences,

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.650
they really tell a story.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:03.430
They talk in terms of framing
it almost like a business

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.560
presentation-- here
was the challenge.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.240
Here's what was accomplished.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.540
Here were the obstacles--
when they do it.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.930
About 70% of them say they
spend six hours a week,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.830
roughly an hour a
day, on LinkedIn.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.290
So they really spend
time using LinkedIn.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.950
They use more
capabilities of LinkedIn

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.710
than other sellers,
the top social sellers.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.530
About half use the paid
version of LinkedIn.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.530
Half don't use the paid
version, but half do.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:41.610
And 45% claim they
get more opportunities

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.860
by using LinkedIn as well.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.950
And here's five reasons
why top social sellers

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.590
are leveraging social.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.200
One is that it opens
doors to other areas.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.320
So other lines of business
that you may be interested in,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.570
LinkedIn opens the doors.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.850
In the old world of
branding that I talked about

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.300
with Barbara Corcoran, it
was very hard to get it.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.040
You had to be a
very clever person,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.580
like she was, to
get media attention.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.100
Today LinkedIn
gives you a platform

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.240
to build your brand
on the profile.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.180
Also it's the modern
way of doing business.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.420
A lot of tech sellers tell
me that the smaller clients

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.710
that they're going after, after
they meet, even with the CEO,

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:31.310
they'll get an email wanting
to connect on LinkedIn.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.380
So it's really kind of a
modern way of doing business.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.620
And it really paves the way
to the C-suite and the things

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.390
that you really want to do.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.810
And a lot of top
social sellers really

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.590
claim that it helps them not
only build their prospect pool

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.340
but also shorten the sales time.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.990
So what is social selling
and how do you do it?

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.990
Four components of social
selling, number one is brand.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.910
You want to build your brand.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.340
Number two is you want
to find the right people,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.100
you want to engage
them, and then

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.252
you want to build
relationships with them.

00:16:09.252 --> 00:16:10.210
So let's break it down.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.790
Let's look at step one,
building your personal brand.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.660
An important thing to realize
is a weak online footprint

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.160
says you're a weak brand.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.142
When people look at your
profile and not much is there,

00:16:26.142 --> 00:16:29.370
they're going to make the
assumption that you're not

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:34.100
as strong as someone that has
a strong profile that utilizes

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.140
the 2,000 characters in
the summary, that tells

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.370
an interesting story, that has
a lot of activities going on.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.880
So it's a key thing
you want to do.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.650
And also pull strategies
where clients and prospects

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.740
are attracted to you really
require a strong brand.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.700
They're not going to
go to a brand that

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.690
doesn't look like
it's substantial.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.670
That's true in
the product world.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.690
It's also true in the
world of personal branding.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.950
So how do you figure
out what your brand is,

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.510
and how do you figure out
how to build your brand?

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.609
In the marketing
world, the first step

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.730
is we do a brand audit.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.390
And part of the brand audit
is doing a SWOT analysis,

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.394
looking at your strengths
and your weaknesses.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.880
The neat thing about
the SWOT analysis

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.579
is it forces you to
look at the marketplace.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:28.410
What are the opportunities
in the marketplace?

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.360
And what's changing?

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.700
What are the threats?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.780
What should I be worried about?

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.170
And when you do
the SWOT and when

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.080
you think of your strengths, you
want to frame your strengths.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.020
So that strength, how is
that demonstrated in things

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.600
that I've accomplished
in my career?

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.870
You want to demonstrate it.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.540
Because of this
trait, I accomplished

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.540
x relative to others.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.160
So you really want
to frame it so

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.420
that people can understand it.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.750
A big thing we do
in the brand audit

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.530
also is look at the competition.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.260
Who are our competition?

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.040
What is their sales message?

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.520
What are their tactics?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.430
So you really want to
have a gauge of what

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.820
your competitors
are doing as well.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.450
And what it's all leading up
to is defining your value.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.400
What is your unique
selling proposition?

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.320
And what you try to
do in all of this

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.830
is you're looking for
your differentiator.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.940
What's different about your
brand compared to others?

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.100
And you want to be able
to answer these questions.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.110
What qualities make you
different, even better

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.520
than others?

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.020
Unlike others in my field,
I-- fill in the blank.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.660
The value you bring to a
business situation is x.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.350
So let's just take
a couple of minutes.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.630
I'd like everyone to pair up
with the person next to them

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.190
and answer these questions,
just whatever comes to mind.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.907
You really want to be able
to own your value in terms

00:18:57.907 --> 00:18:58.740
of building a brand.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.060
So let's just take a few
minutes, each partner, and just

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.360
brainstorm with each other
and answer these questions.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.490
Can I get some sharing?

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.340
What qualities
make you different?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.330
This is the word that
worries people, even better

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.600
than other people.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.574
Anyone willing to share what
qualities make you different?

00:19:20.574 --> 00:19:21.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:22.866
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:19:22.866 --> 00:19:24.859
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:26.650
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah,
this is a good one.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.840
Unlike others in my field.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.340
It's very important
you answer that.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:29.700
OK.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:31.292
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:33.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're not
recorded, just so you know.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:33.790
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.000
What's my motivation?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.500
Let's see--

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.750
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Your career.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.630
AUDIENCE: Unlike
others in my field,

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.782
I have not only worked quite
a great deal on the enterprise

00:19:44.782 --> 00:19:46.365
side-- so I spent
15 years with Delta,

00:19:46.365 --> 00:19:49.440
and I spent some
time with UPS as what

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.180
we would call a customer
now-- and now actually I

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.270
sell solutions to
people like myself.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.700
CATHERINE KAPUTA: And what
advantages does that give you?

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.116
AUDIENCE: It gives
me good insight

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:02.080
on the things that are pitfalls
for a lot of enterprises when

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.510
salespeople come calling
and knocking on the door.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.270
So you can say,
hey, I understand

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.600
what your challenges are.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.120
I understand what you're
trying to accomplish.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.917
And I also understand
you looking at me

00:20:12.917 --> 00:20:14.750
in a way of just a
salesperson, but I'm here

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.610
to actually help and
help in these manners.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:18.490
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.490
So it's not selling
so much as helping.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.240
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.130
CATHERINE KAPUTA: So
he understands that.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.315
And having been a client myself
for many years on Wall Street,

00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:26.940
a big problem with
a lot of salespeople

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.560
is they're selling too
much and not helping.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.399
And you're under
a lot of pressure

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:32.690
when you're on the client side.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.730
So salespeople that
help is very key.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.050
Other people willing to share?

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.230
Is this a confident crowd?

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.055
Hello, yes.

00:20:42.055 --> 00:20:44.180
AUDIENCE: I think I'm a
pain in the ass in the most

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.940
professional way.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.250
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.580
AUDIENCE: We support out
a lot of different sales

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.210
organizations.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.510
So trying to get your agenda
and get your stuff done,

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.330
I think that's one
of the qualities that

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:51.770
makes me different.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.353
I don't think everyone
agrees with it,

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:54.560
but I'm just being honest.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.330
CATHERINE KAPUTA: The thing
is no brand is for everyone.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.070
But you want to
stand for something.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.611
And a lot of people
are going like it

00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.630
because it's refreshing.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.400
When you say something like
that and everybody laughs,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.700
they think, oh, wow,
I can trust this guy.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.260
Anyone else willing to share,
unlike others in your field?

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.010
OK.

00:21:21.462 --> 00:21:21.962
OK.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.310
AUDIENCE: Unlike
others in my field,

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.270
I've helped large enterprises
adopt different technologies

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.030
migrating from
older legacy systems

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.982
to cloud-based technologies.

00:21:35.982 --> 00:21:38.190
CATHERINE KAPUTA: And how
do you get them to do that?

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.950
Because they must be worried,
like it's too radical a shift.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.865
Will my company be
able to take this?

00:21:44.865 --> 00:21:46.490
So how do you deal
with those kind of--

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.906
AUDIENCE: It's more focused
on the people and the business

00:21:48.906 --> 00:21:50.936
process change versus
the technology,

00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:52.435
so helping make
sure they understand

00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:54.559
that the people will
get a benefit from it

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:56.100
and the company will
benefit from it.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.700
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.283
AUDIENCE: And the
technology is really

00:21:58.283 --> 00:21:59.560
just the underpinnings below.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.833
I'm trying to help them
see the value of that.

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:02.708
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:03.645
OK, great.

00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:05.270
All right.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.810
So in the branding world, the
first thing you want to do

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.720
is you're looking
for your brand idea.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.320
You're analyzing to find
your USP, your Unique Selling

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.350
Proposition.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.670
There are some strategies
that a lot of brands use.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.830
So I'm going to just focus on
a couple of those strategies.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.036
And in the branding world,
when you have a product

00:22:23.036 --> 00:22:24.660
you explore different
ones, because you

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.076
don't know which
is going to work.

00:22:26.076 --> 00:22:30.080
For example, when Volvo was
introduced in the United States

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.700
they were exploring a number
of different strategies.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.030
One was this attribute
strategy around safety.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.910
They were also exploring
an attribute strategy

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.650
around durability.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.890
One of the other strategies
they were exploring

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:51.275
was a heritage strategy, made
in Sweden, Swedish engineering.

00:22:51.275 --> 00:22:53.270
That didn't test too
well because Americans

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.180
go, Swedish engineering, duh.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.610
But anyway, safety won out,
but it was an argument.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:04.780
So let's explore a couple of
common positioning strategies

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.200
for brands that people can use
as well, and one is the expert.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.670
Being an expert in a certain
area of business and standing

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.980
for that with clients can be a
very, very powerful strategy.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.700
Here's Warren Buffett.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.430
What's he an expert in?

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.910
Finance and investments.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.670
And so he owns that position.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.550
You really trust him.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.860
They call him the
Oracle of Omaha.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.390
And a tactic of an expert, if
you're positioning yourself

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.250
as an expert, is
white papers, writing

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:39.310
articles, trend reports, having
a point of view on the market

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.360
because you're an expert.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.310
That was Barbara
Corcoran's strategy,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.840
thought leader in your niche.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.170
Industry events you're an
expert at as a panelist

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.950
or as a speaker.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.780
So it can be a very
powerful positioning

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.560
strategy for brands.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.730
Another positioning strategy
is attribute positioning,

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:05.360
and this is the most popular
positioning strategy of brands.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.720
It's looking at the category.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.440
What attributes are
important in that category?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.260
Which attributes aren't
owned that I could own?

00:24:19.515 --> 00:24:21.310
I talked before about Volvo.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.120
They did an attribute
strategy around safety.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.530
They made the car
more safe because they

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.410
were doing that strategy.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.500
So it wasn't like
the chicken and egg.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.370
This was an idea.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.970
No one owned safety.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:37.340
It was important group
of people in the market

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.950
that it was very powerful to.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.780
So looking at the car
category, who owns ruggedness?

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.130
Who would you say,
in terms of cars?

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.580
That's another attribute.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.500
AUDIENCE: Jeep.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.100
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK, Jeep.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.380
If you look at
prestige, who owns that?

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.874
That's another attribute.

00:24:52.874 --> 00:24:53.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.230
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK, Mercedes.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.830
So in the car category,
you see that a lot,

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.570
looking at an attribute,
looking at an adjective that's

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.860
available, and owning
that attribute.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.010
And that can be very
powerful for people,

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.200
owning a particular attribute.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.630
If you're in sales, it
could be a trusted adviser.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.360
You want to own an
attribute that's

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.930
important to your
audience, so it's

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.510
a different positioning
than expert.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.410
And the tactics here
are a little different,

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.490
because you really in
attribute positioning

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.820
go after endorsements,
recommendations.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.270
If your attribute is customer
service or client attention,

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.930
you want to have a lot
of clients recommending

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.620
you and mentioning your
attribute so that people really

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.120
get that.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.820
And that's a part of your
summary in your profile

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.690
is telling that story.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.790
You want to have success
stories with your client that

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.770
demonstrates your attribute.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.070
You want your articles
that you write

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.300
to reinforce that attribute.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.560
So you do everything the
ties that altogether.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.160
Another common
positioning strategy

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.240
is leadership positioning.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.050
Every category, we look
for leaders, the number one

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.770
seller in the category.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.840
And it's true in any area.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.280
In sales you can be the leader
overall in sales at Google.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.680
You could be the leader in
a particular product area.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.140
You could be a
leader in a region.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.320
And as a leader part
of your tactics are

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.590
you want to win awards
that you mention,

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.240
success stories for your
clients, because you're

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.060
a leader and you tell
those kind of stories.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.130
You have metrics.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.780
Your sales numbers were x, y, z.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.270
You were the number one
producer, increased business,

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.900
or whatever your
metrics are going to be.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.190
The thought leadership of the
expert that we talked about

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.110
is really on that
narrow expertise area.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.290
The thought leader of a
leader is a much broader kind

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.380
of positioning.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.880
And it's very powerful
because a lot of people

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.020
are very attracted to doing
business with the leader.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.320
Can't make any
mistakes if you choose

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.550
the big leader in an area.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.935
So it can be a very, very
powerful positioning strategy.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.000
For every leader, we have
the against position,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.740
which is the opposite
of the leader.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.930
I also call it the
maverick positioning.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:26.390
For every Bill Gates, there's a
Steve Jobs who is the opposite.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.550
Steve Jobs is a classic
maverick positioning.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.270
Here I have Richard Branson.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.470
He's the CEO of a major company.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.190
He doesn't look
like the normal CEO.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.898
That's the thing.

00:27:35.898 --> 00:27:39.060
You want to go against the
grain, look very difficult.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.560
You do the opposite of
what the leader does.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.250
The leader is doing x, you do y.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:49.000
You position the leader,
they're big and fast and slow,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.830
and I'm nimble and
smart and innovative.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.400
So it's a very, very
different kind of positioning.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.090
Often it goes with
contrarian viewpoint.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.970
If you're doing articles, unlike
what the majority of people

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.380
are doing, I believe
you should be doing x.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.550
So it's a very different kind
of refreshing but different kind

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.280
of idea of what
people should do.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.740
This kind of person
is a change agent.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.190
A big part of it is
being very innovative.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.660
So if the market
is going this way,

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.180
you want to have
ideas that are very

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.270
innovative in a different way.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.340
And all of these ideas, I think,
can be something that you use.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.300
So I also want you
to take a few minutes

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.017
and explore them with the
person next to you where

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:41.100
you see yourself, if you
were to position yourself

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.766
in one of these.

00:28:41.766 --> 00:28:45.970
An expert, what are
you an expert in?

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:49.680
And poof, here's why
I'm an expert in that

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.160
or how I could promote that.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.840
Attribute positioning, the
attribute I want to own is y

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.460
and why I'm good at that and
how you would demonstrate that,

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.430
proof of that, certain
things that you've worked on

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.027
to demonstrate that.

00:29:07.027 --> 00:29:07.943
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.770
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Well, the best
advertising is word of mouth.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.760
So the best
advertising is always

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.235
what other people say about you.

00:29:22.235 --> 00:29:24.350
You want them to
both be the same.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:28.640
But partly what your clients
and prospects are going to say

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.120
is what you're communicating
with them to say too.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:31.835
It's amazing.

00:29:31.835 --> 00:29:35.550
A lot of advertising research,
what you say about a brand

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.580
is how people start
seeing the brand.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.860
So it works both ways.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.500
But you really
want to get always

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.580
in any category other people
talking about you, in terms

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.640
of how you position yourself.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.940
--and then this against
or maverick position.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.300
So let's take a few
minutes and just explore

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.600
these different positions
that we talked about,

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.350
the expert position,
the attribute position,

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:02.070
owning an important attribute
in the category, this leadership

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.172
position, or the
against position.

00:30:04.172 --> 00:30:06.630
Where do you see yourself, just
to do a little exploratory?

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.600
Who sees a good
fit for themselves

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.100
with the expert position?

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.880
And what are you the expert in?

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.610
Can we get some sharing?

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.250
Who sees themselves
as an expert?

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.850
What's your area of expertise?

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.350
OK.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.150
We need to mic here.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.090
OK, great.

00:30:28.774 --> 00:30:29.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Here you go.

00:30:33.354 --> 00:30:34.520
CATHERINE KAPUTA: It's open.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.870
It's open.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.160
AUDIENCE: OK, so expert.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.077
I lead an industry
team, and I'm also

00:30:41.077 --> 00:30:42.410
the head of the retail industry.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.380
So this is the
role of the people

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.110
on our team for
various industries

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.980
that publish white
papers, articles, develop

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.004
a point of view, all
that kind of stuff.

00:30:51.004 --> 00:30:52.170
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK, great.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.460
AUDIENCE: So that's
what our team does.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.580
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.740
Any other people see
that as a good fit?

00:31:00.656 --> 00:31:01.156
OK.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.904
Who else?

00:31:05.904 --> 00:31:09.440
We had somebody over here.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.171
AUDIENCE: Luis?

00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:11.670
Go Luis.

00:31:14.436 --> 00:31:16.870
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.670
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.515
I'm supposed to be
an expert on retail.

00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:22.390
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.450
AUDIENCE: I'm still
developing these skills.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.240
But I was thinking
that I can definitely

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.020
do a better job on LinkedIn
and other social networks

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.954
to promote my image.

00:31:31.954 --> 00:31:32.954
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

00:31:32.954 --> 00:31:34.912
Right.

00:31:34.912 --> 00:31:36.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that is true.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.490
Yeah, we've been
talking about this.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.865
AUDIENCE: Business
transformation

00:31:38.865 --> 00:31:43.184
for the largest, most complex
customer to move them into--

00:31:43.184 --> 00:31:44.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.055
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:48.230
Say that into the mic,
because that's great.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:50.280
Because retail is very
international now.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.400
All these companies, retailers
that were just in one country

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.105
are expanding.

00:31:55.105 --> 00:31:56.180
So tell us--

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.971
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we were
talking about this.

00:31:57.971 --> 00:31:58.800
Yeah.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.720
I definitely have
some skills that I

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.620
could enhance in my profile.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.060
The first of them is my
international expertise,

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.215
because I am from Europe.

00:32:07.215 --> 00:32:08.090
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.805
AUDIENCE: So I've been
working in Europe but now

00:32:09.805 --> 00:32:10.440
in the States.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.404
So that's important, that
it's special and unusual.

00:32:14.404 --> 00:32:16.070
CATHERINE KAPUTA: No,
it's very special,

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.430
because you have a lot
of information and ideas

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.997
that other people
want to know about.

00:32:21.997 --> 00:32:22.830
AUDIENCE: And also--

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:23.755
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:23.755 --> 00:32:24.760
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.635
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:32:25.635 --> 00:32:26.580
Tell me that part.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
I've been working

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.960
in some special opportunities,
like really, really unusual

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.580
in the cloud business--

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.455
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:38.775
AUDIENCE: --like moving
big financial organizations

00:32:38.775 --> 00:32:40.400
to the cloud and
these kinds of things.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.233
So I have that in my
profile, but I probably

00:32:42.233 --> 00:32:44.244
can enhance a bit of it more.

00:32:44.244 --> 00:32:45.170
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:45.670
OK, great.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.930
AUDIENCE: I think
everybody in this room

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.450
is an expert, being that
we come from Google.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:59.955
We work differently
than anybody else.

00:32:59.955 --> 00:33:02.332
We also have access to
Google X and everything else.

00:33:02.332 --> 00:33:04.790
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Well, part
of what you're saying, though,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:10.520
is really this against
position, the maverick position,

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.090
because this is a
change agent position.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.132
So part of what Google
stands for in my mind

00:33:16.132 --> 00:33:17.590
and I think a lot
of people's minds

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:24.210
is this change agent
that's creating new worlds.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.860
Lists of the most
innovative companies

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.220
in the world, usually
Google's number one.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.720
So you've got that going.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.530
So that's not an expert
so much as-- it's

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.540
very hard to be a change agent.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.790
Companies want change
agents, but there

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.992
aren't that many people that
are that kind of thinker.

00:33:40.992 --> 00:33:42.450
So that's a very
powerful position.

00:33:45.449 --> 00:33:47.990
Attribute positioning, who felt
there was a strong connection

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.948
there for attribute
positioning for themselves?

00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:52.860
OK.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.110
And what's your attribute?

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.660
AUDIENCE: I think I've ended
up as a trusted adviser.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.150
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.480
That's a very powerful
one for salespeople.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.520
And tell us why
you're thinking why

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.574
you own that, why
you want to own that

00:34:08.574 --> 00:34:10.850
and why you do own it, examples.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.960
AUDIENCE: I'm managing
salespeople now

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.889
and no longer selling.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.850
And I think it comes from
selling for a number years

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.719
at big and small companies,
running my own company,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.670
and having an
expensive education

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.150
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.300
AUDIENCE: Now I ended
up as a trusted adviser

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.320
on the team and elsewhere.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.195
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:30.590
OK.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.469
That's a great story.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:35.389
OK.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.520
AUDIENCE: We have
an internal way

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.880
to endorse people that
is called Peer Bonus.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.260
It has also a financial
impact, but a small one.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.219
So I had this idea when
I was listening to you

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:59.650
to use former people
that have given me

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:00.730
peer bonuses in the past.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.300
So I can contact them and
say, hey, why don't you

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.912
please endorse me in LinkedIn?

00:35:05.912 --> 00:35:06.912
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

00:35:06.912 --> 00:35:07.410
Right.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.035
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:08.035 --> 00:35:10.520
CATHERINE KAPUTA: It's very
important to reach out and ask.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.960
Anyone else for attribute,
a different attribute?

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.250
Leadership?

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.440
A leader in some area of sales?

00:35:22.664 --> 00:35:23.330
No leaders here.

00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:27.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.540
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.456
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:30.453 --> 00:35:31.328
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:35:31.328 --> 00:35:34.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
about leadership.

00:35:34.385 --> 00:35:35.260
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.040
Give an example.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.100
For example, I did a
paper on or an article on.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.227
You want to be able to
tell a story about it.

00:35:42.227 --> 00:35:43.060
So bring it to life.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.726
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:43.726 --> 00:35:46.380
So I wouldn't say
I'm an author, but I

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.880
do promote a lot of articles
about thought leadership,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:57.260
leading positions, big data,
transformational technologies,

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.275
customer case studies.

00:35:58.275 --> 00:35:59.150
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.650
OK, great.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.030
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK, mavericks.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.700
Any mavericks?

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.360
People like that
position for themselves?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.390
And how it fits in?

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.160
It's a strong
position, and I think

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.670
Google owns it, in general.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.590
I think that's the viewpoint
people have of Google.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.492
OK, great.

00:36:18.492 --> 00:36:20.450
AUDIENCE: I assume that
there's a lot of people

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.325
in this room who fall
into this category just

00:36:22.325 --> 00:36:23.940
because, as you
mentioned earlier,

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.020
we're all trying to do something
a little bit different here.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:26.680
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.990
AUDIENCE: And I
think that we all

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.170
bring a very diverse
background, and a lot of people

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:31.690
here were at the
top of their fields

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:36.400
in a really diverse set of
companies or organizations.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.550
And so they take those types
of contrarian viewpoints,

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.647
and they really use it to
leverage let's stop and think.

00:36:42.647 --> 00:36:44.480
Just because something
is the way it's been,

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.360
does that mean it's
the way it has to be?

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.084
I think that people in this room
are exceptionally good at that.

00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:49.546
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

00:36:49.546 --> 00:36:50.045
Right.

00:36:50.045 --> 00:36:52.110
And innovation's an
important driver.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:52.610
All right.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.600
So what we're doing with
all of this exploration

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.980
is trying to come up with
our USP or Unique Selling

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.080
Proposition, what
makes us different.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.320
And it's our selling idea.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.900
So the next thing
we want to look at

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.580
is packaging your brand.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.160
You want to think of
your LinkedIn profile

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.895
as an ad for brand you.

00:37:12.895 --> 00:37:16.340
Who's your target audience
for your LinkedIn profile?

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.110
What are those people like?

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.680
What are your keywords?

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.910
What's your story?

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.510
You want your whole profile to
work together and tell a story,

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.110
tell the story you want
to tell about yourself.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.390
What's your visual
identity as well?

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.590
Here's an example of a client.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.560
Again, you want to think
of LinkedIn profile

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.350
as an ad, good picture, good
headline, strong summary

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.307
of yourself and your experience.

00:37:43.307 --> 00:37:44.890
And if you don't
think visual identity

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:48.580
is important, in two
seconds or less people

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.870
take you in, whether
they meet you in person

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.100
or look at your
LinkedIn profile.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.030
Two seconds or
less, they take you,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.790
and they figure out
what you're all about.

00:38:00.869 --> 00:38:02.910
Malcolm Gladwell wrote a
book, "Blink," about it.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.784
In the blink of an eye,
we take something in.

00:38:04.784 --> 00:38:07.570
The interesting thing
about visual identity

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:12.180
is what social scientists
call thin slicing.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.930
They're remarkably accurate,
and they're very sticky.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.410
They stick with us.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.060
So that's why you want to
think about first impressions

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.600
and the impression that your
virtual brand gives as well.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.930
They did studies at a
number of universities

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.980
showing students a two-second
video of a professor

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.800
before they took a
course with him or her,

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.610
and then they gave them the same
questionnaire five months later

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.150
after they took a course.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.620
And they found that
that two-second slice

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.070
that they saw of the
professor and what

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:46.910
they wrote in their evaluation
was almost identical with what

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:50.340
they wrote after being in that
person's class for five months.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.940
So these snap impressions
are very powerful.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.970
They're very
powerful for people.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.360
The other thing that's
important about visual identity

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.400
is there's a beauty premium.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.750
And the branding world
knows about that.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.000
That's why we spend a lot
of time in the way something

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.640
is packaged.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.990
Something that's well packaged,
you can charge more for it.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.930
People in tests,
they think there's

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:17.180
more volume in it just
because of its packaging.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.020
It may or may not be true.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.700
And the same is
true with people.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.180
There was a study done
called "The Beauty Premium"

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.570
by two professors, one
a Harvard economist

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.130
and one a Wesleyan economist.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.640
They named it "The
Beauty Premium,"

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:36.640
and they did a big study looking
at people and people that

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.890
packaged themselves well.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.590
And we can all package
ourselves well,

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:46.190
because interesting
looking is very attractive.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.660
The people that
packaged themselves well

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:53.820
were hired over people that were
less attractive or packaged.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.230
And it had a halo effect.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.810
Because someone
looked good, people

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:02.560
thought they were smarter than
people who didn't look as good.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.510
And it had a whole halo effect
on a whole range of values,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.620
including being kinder and
more productive and worth more,

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.020
et cetera, et cetera.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.070
So you want to think of
how you package yourself

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.470
and here virtually on LinkedIn.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.180
I know you've all gotten your
pictures taken at Google,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.080
but you want to think of
the whole look of that.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.940
And the picture's important
because LinkedIn's research

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.720
shows that your profile is 11
times more likely to be read

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.100
and looked at if
you have a picture.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.930
The other thing we talk
about in the branding world

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.820
is having a visual
hook for your brand.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.670
Twitter has its bird.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.550
Every brand tries to
have a visual hook

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:49.610
so that it hooks in the
brand in the minds of people.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:53.880
And on LinkedIn, you can use
rich media in your summary.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.212
You can use it in your
Experience section

00:40:57.212 --> 00:41:00.690
and in your Education section.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:04.500
Here's an example from
a colleague that I know.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.270
She has an ebook, and there's
a picture of the ebook.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.900
She's got a little mini
slide presentation.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.350
You're not going to put your
slide presentation that you

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:16.120
would give to a
client, but you could

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.640
do five slides that are trends.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.830
Because a lot of people
are visually-oriented.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:25.180
So you could do things like that
that give your profile a very

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.800
rich, robust look
rather than just text.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.260
You could have a speaking video
or if you were at a conference,

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.240
a short clip that
people can see.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.594
Trend reports, other
things like that, you

00:41:38.594 --> 00:41:40.510
can have right there on
your LinkedIn profile,

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.390
put a nice cover on it.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:48.720
So it gives your profile a
strong visual hook as well.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.490
So in terms of branding, when
we're packaging the brand

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.220
there's the visual identity,
which is very powerful,

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.090
also the verbal identity.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:42:00.800
And the first critical
verbal identity decision

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.610
we make in branding is the name.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:03.870
What are we going to name it?

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.930
Google has a great name.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:08.630
It has meaning to it.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:12.130
It's an unusual name,
the double O, the two Gs.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.180
A lot of people copied
the double O thing

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.010
with Google's success.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.972
But names are important
for people too.

00:42:19.972 --> 00:42:22.940
In Hollywood, for years
they changed their names

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.300
to make a more attractive name.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.840
I sometimes ask people,
would Marilyn Monroe

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.820
be the icon she it is today,
the beauty icon she is today

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.950
if she had kept
her original name?

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.664
Does anyone remember
her original name?

00:42:38.664 --> 00:42:39.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.788
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Norma Jean.

00:42:40.788 --> 00:42:43.110
Is Norma a pretty name?

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.454
What do you think?

00:42:44.454 --> 00:42:45.260
AUDIENCE: It's my
daughter's name.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.700
CATHERINE KAPUTA: It's
your daughter's name.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.570
It's a pretty name.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:54.830
Well, there was a study
done of two women that

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.940
were viewed as
equally attractive,

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.420
and then there was
the same picture

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.140
shown to another group
asking about attractiveness.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.660
The only change that was
made was half the pictures

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.690
had Elizabeth on them, and
then half had Gertrude.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.310
Guess who wasn't
attractive anymore?

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:15.820
Yeah.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.300
So names can hurt you.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.430
The other name you want to
think about from a branding

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.980
perspective is how do
you label yourself?

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.120
What do you call yourself?

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.670
That can help you
or hurt you too.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.970
And we don't take our own name.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.250
We don't give ourselves
our own names.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.610
But the fact of the
matter is unusual

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.930
names are a real
benefit on the internet

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.730
because you can own
your name, and you

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.272
want to try to own
your name, dot com.

00:43:42.272 --> 00:43:43.010
Own your name.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.570
LinkedIn slash your name.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.690
It's easy to change that.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.850
But another important name
is how do you label yourself?

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.390
How do you describe
what your job is?

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.990
And that can help you or
hurt you was well too.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:00.080
There was a study done
showing people clips

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.850
of a video of a
professor, same clip.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.890
Half of them labeled it
as humanistic psychology

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.140
professor.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.920
And then the other group
saw the same video clip

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.950
with the label
statistics professor.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.037
What do you think they
said about the professor

00:44:19.037 --> 00:44:20.745
when the label was
humanistic psychology?

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.850
More interesting,
thoughtful, he'd

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.424
be fair in grading,
blah, blah, blah.

00:44:28.424 --> 00:44:30.590
What do you think they said
when he was a statistics

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:31.860
professor, the very same clip?

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.730
AUDIENCE: Boring.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.920
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Boring.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.640
And he'd be a tough grader.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.950
I don't like him.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.160
Very same thing.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.380
So you want to think of
how do you label yourself.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.160
Some companies, it's hard to
tell what somebody does when

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.180
you read their job
title, so you want

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:50.110
to translate that in
your LinkedIn profile

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:53.480
so the target audience,
the prospects you're trying

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.280
to reach can understand
what it is you do.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.470
The other thing we think
about in the branding world

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:05.290
as we talked about a visual
hook is having a verbal hook,

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.710
owning a word.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:08.470
Volvo we know.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:09.620
Who owns Search?

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.750
So we think of owning a word,
a phrase, a name, a story.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:18.760
What's her phrase?

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.530
AUDIENCE: Lean in.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.613
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Lean in.

00:45:20.613 --> 00:45:24.640
She could have named her book
"The Woman's Guide to Success."

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.940
but that wouldn't have been
as smart from a branding

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.540
perspective, because
she gave it a name that

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:33.950
could be a mantra, that could
be calling, a rallying cry,

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.310
just like Google has
become a name for Search.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.480
Let's google somebody.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.280
So owning a word
is very powerful.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.030
And writing that
book with that name

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.870
made her a mega
business celebrity.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.477
She may have been well-known
at Google when she worked here,

00:45:51.477 --> 00:45:53.810
and she may have been well-known
in certain communities,

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.350
but now she's a global star.

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:00.030
So it's very powerful.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.810
And you want to think
of what your word is

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.806
and what your phrases are
and use them in your profile

00:46:04.806 --> 00:46:06.305
and in your
conversation, because it

00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:09.410
can be a very powerful
positioning idea.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.910
All right.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.170
So let's explore couple
of ways of approaching it.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.660
I know you've been
working on your profiles.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.140
I'm going to talk about
three ways of approaching

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.890
the headline for your
LinkedIn profile.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.100
One way to go is a
keyword headline.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.650
Think of keywords
that people would

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.820
use to find somebody like
yourself that you want

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.890
to own in the minds of others,
so global executive, supply

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:38.830
chain operations, Six
Sigma black belt-- it's

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.030
a little in more
tangible experience--

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:44.640
ROI, outperformance,
strategic leader.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.710
So these are all
keywords that somebody

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.920
might look for in
finding this person

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.840
or finding somebody
like them so they

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.260
would come up and
search on LinkedIn.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:58.650
Another way of going is a
power statement headline,

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.680
helping companies translate
business goals and ideas

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.930
into operational reality
and positive ROI.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.960
This is the same person I was
doing the keyword headline

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.300
for I wrote a power
statement headline for.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.470
And another way
to go is a hybrid.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.900
So maybe begin with
a power statement

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.910
and then have your keywords
so that people can find you.

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.890
I have a little handout here
that I'm going to pass around,

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:32.480
and it has an exploration
of these three headline

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.850
approaches-- So if you
can take one and pass

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.610
them along-- and also
a section to write down

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.660
the keywords that you
own or want to own.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.400
So take one and pass them down.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.640
I'll pass some over here.

00:47:52.335 --> 00:47:53.720
I've got some extra ones here.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:02.520
So look at what
your keywords are.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:09.470
And when you're thinking of
keywords, try to be expansive.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:14.170
So have as many keywords that
might be useful for your brand.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.574
This is just page one
we're going to look at.

00:48:17.574 --> 00:48:19.490
And so the first thing
you want to think about

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:26.610
is this section number
two, the keyword headline,

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.520
the power statement,
the hybrid headline.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.490
And the headline on
a LinkedIn profile

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.050
is very similar to a tweet.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:41.560
It's 140 characters, roughly,
so it's like a long sentence.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.850
So explore what would
work best for you.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.610
How can you improve
your LinkedIn headline

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.970
so that it's a stronger
statement about who you are?

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.580
And some people
add some elements

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.830
to it that are interesting,
like humanitarian

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:00.150
at the end or something like
that, that dimensionalizes them

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:01.070
in a different way.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:04.450
So you want to look for ways
to stand out and be different.

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.950
So let's focus just
on page one here,

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.850
defining who your
target audience is.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:16.390
And I want you to look at it a
little bit as a psychographic

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:20.060
of your audience, so not
just certain kinds of people

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.070
you're pitching.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:22.730
You can define them
in job function.

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:24.600
But also what's their mindset?

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.340
What's on their mind?

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.230
And then put together
your headline

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:33.750
that would most appeal
to that target audience.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.600
And let's begin exploration
of your keywords,

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.870
the different keywords
you'd want to own.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:40.480
Any sharing of headlines?

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:40.980
Somebody?

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.087
OK, great.

00:49:42.087 --> 00:49:43.003
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:47.825 --> 00:49:52.290
That headline, I think,
is terrible, personally.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.720
But I wrote "transformation
consultant to the Fortune 500."

00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.056
Is transformation
a hackneyed term?

00:50:00.056 --> 00:50:01.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
consultant's a stretch.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.650
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
What do people think?

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:04.250
AUDIENCE: I think the word--

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:05.280
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
consultant's a stretch?

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.113
AUDIENCE: --consultant
is a stretch for you.

00:50:08.654 --> 00:50:10.070
AUDIENCE:
Transformative dictator.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.794
AUDIENCE:
Transformative dictator.

00:50:12.794 --> 00:50:14.460
AUDIENCE: We were
calling him Hollywood.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.880
AUDIENCE: You were giving him
crap about being a wiseass?

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.690
Holy mackerel.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:22.900
Is that a hackneyed term?

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.600
CATHERINE KAPUTA: I
don't think it is.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.950
And I think one of the
things that research shows

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:30.410
is that there's a
move to new buzz words

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.490
and that it's important
to use some of them,

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:35.670
because people are
going to be using them.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:38.850
You don't want in your headline
hackneyed stuff, obviously,

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:40.120
but I think it's good.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.250
What do other people think?

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:43.083
You've got to think of
your target audience.

00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:47.170
Because it makes me think,
if I were to read that, wow,

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.390
what are the transformations?

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:49.460
Do I know about them all?

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.620
I'd like to learn
more about that.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.220
Nobody else is saying that.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.970
So to me it's
different and relevant.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:02.410
AUDIENCE: I would think about
how you're transforming,

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:06.379
by being innovative,
disruptive, creative.

00:51:06.379 --> 00:51:08.420
What are the things that
you're doing differently

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.461
in those transformations?

00:51:09.461 --> 00:51:11.980
Because to your point,
we sell this every day,

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.320
so it's probably feeling
that fatigue of that word

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.320
transformation.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:15.560
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.300
But where do you put
that other information?

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.216
I would think that doesn't
go in the headline.

00:51:19.216 --> 00:51:20.957
I would put it into the profile.

00:51:20.957 --> 00:51:22.790
CATHERINE KAPUTA: The
most important message

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.340
should be in the
headline, because people

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.256
aren't going to go on.

00:51:25.256 --> 00:51:27.400
But then after that, it's
the summary, particularly

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.899
the first two paragraphs because
they're all above the fold.

00:51:29.899 --> 00:51:32.297
They're all on that initial
screen people going to see.

00:51:32.297 --> 00:51:34.630
And then they'll scroll down
if they like what they see.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.756
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:51:34.756 --> 00:51:36.227
So how long should
the headline be?

00:51:36.227 --> 00:51:38.060
CATHERINE KAPUTA: It
can only be on LinkedIn

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.540
like 140 characters.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.380
It's like a tweet.

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:40.960
AUDIENCE: Twitter?

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:41.784
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yep.

00:51:41.784 --> 00:51:42.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:45.552 --> 00:51:47.010
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
I have statistics

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:48.384
that show that
the way they do it

00:51:48.384 --> 00:51:50.300
is headline, visual,
and then if they

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.509
like that they read the summary.

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:54.050
And then if they
like that, then they

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.640
go on to look at other things.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.925
So that's kind of the flow.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.330
All right.

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:08.180
So then you get to the summary
part of your profile, which

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:12.540
is your brand story told
in a narrative format.

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.820
You want to give
examples, not just

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.010
talk about functional
responsibilities.

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.500
But think from a
client perspective

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.347
of interesting things you've
done and the benefit to them.

00:52:23.347 --> 00:52:23.930
Give examples.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:31.150
Here's a profile, again, dealing
with different experience.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.730
One of the things
to think about too

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.190
is to creatively use the
Publications and Projects

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.650
section, because
that's a section where

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:39.810
you can have links.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.560
So you can have links
to a landing page

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.800
or links to a
website where people

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:48.420
can read articles
and things like that.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.620
So again, it's a way
to create interaction.

00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.580
And the whole thing
about social media

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.870
is this whole idea of
creating-- and we'll

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.470
get more into that
later-- interaction

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.940
so people are
interacting with you.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.960
Here's the LinkedIn
profile checklist.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.470
You want, ideally, to have a
customized URL with your name

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:11.060
on it, a good picture,
strong headline they conveys

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.210
your USP that connects
with your target audience,

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:18.340
a summary, your career
story with a client benefit.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.422
And that takes some
time to put together.

00:53:20.422 --> 00:53:21.880
And that's something
you might want

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.220
to mold as new things happen in
your industry and environment

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.151
to change it.

00:53:26.151 --> 00:53:26.650
Question.

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:27.566
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:43.390
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
All the statistics

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:47.870
I've seen on LinkedIn shy
away from doing anything other

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:49.260
than a headshot.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.090
But you want a headshot that
communicates well with people,

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:56.490
that you look friendly, you look
interesting, you look smart,

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.100
somebody they want to work with.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:01.660
But there's a lot of negative
statistics about group shots

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.670
or vacation shots
or things like that.

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:05.790
And it's a small picture.

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.870
The picture area isn't
that big on LinkedIn.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.910
AUDIENCE: If you're going
to be different, right now

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.230
every single person here has
the same stinking picture

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:17.790
of a blue background,
and it just kind of looks

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.540
a little-- I don't know.

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.410
Just when I see someone
in a context of presenting

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:28.764
or I see someone with a picture
of their spouse or someone,

00:54:28.764 --> 00:54:31.055
I don't know, it just makes
me think they're different.

00:54:31.055 --> 00:54:32.487
It humanize them a little bit.

00:54:32.487 --> 00:54:33.820
But I don't know the statistics.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:34.770
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
That's one of the things

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.429
about using all
these other things,

00:54:36.429 --> 00:54:38.220
so if you have a video
or things like that,

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.060
because it humanize the brand.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.920
So if you have a little speaking
video or things like that,

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.560
it humanizes the brand.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.200
I think having
everybody in the company

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.910
look the same isn't
smart and also

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.630
doesn't really
connect with Google.

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:53.220
Because Google is
different, right?

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.360
But the group thing, people
want to see your face,

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.230
but a different kind of look.

00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.730
All right.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.560
We're going to take
a five-minute break.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.730
This is the end of part one.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:08.130
So we're going to get into how
do you find people on LinkedIn,

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.544
how do you engage them, how
do you build relationships.

00:55:10.544 --> 00:55:12.710
So we'll get into the
nitty-gritty of social selling

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:13.590
next.

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.180
--a passive strategy.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.290
You're going to put
your brand online,

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:24.020
and people will read it.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.450
But we also want to talk about
you don't want to stop there.

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:31.630
How can I use LinkedIn for
social selling and branding?

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:35.620
So what kind of
actions can you take?

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.330
And so step two,
we're going to talk

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.090
about is finding
the right people,

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:44.090
how to use LinkedIn to
find the right people.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:47.110
We've all heard of 6
degrees of separation.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:51.640
Well, on LinkedIn and
Facebook, it's 4.74 degrees.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.180
They did a major study globally.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.830
Facebook got a lot
of attention with it.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.300
Even reaching people
in remote Siberia,

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.410
they got there in
less than five hops.

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:06.590
So it's really a way
to connect easier

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:10.250
with more people
using the internet

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:13.030
and using LinkedIn
and social media.

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:16.290
And the way I see it
in terms of a network,

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.790
there are four key
networks that you

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.790
want to think of developing.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:24.680
Your strategic network
includes mentors, sponsors,

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.600
people that you know
that connect you

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.110
with a lot of other people,
what Malcolm Gladwell

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:30.330
calls connectors.

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.400
And that group also is allies.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.020
Reid Hoffman, the CEO
of LinkedIn, in his book

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.670
"The Startup of You"
talks about his network.

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:43.030
And he's got this
band of brothers,

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:46.700
allies, guys at
different companies,

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.600
non-competitive that
are friends with him,

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.860
and they all text each other
with ideas and text each other

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.300
try this or try that.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.856
So they've got a group of
peers getting information

00:56:58.856 --> 00:57:01.230
that you can't really get from
a mentor or a sponsor, who

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:03.320
are generally more
senior people.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.680
He's got this band of allies.

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.790
And in this strategic
network, these

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.640
are people that have
strong career impact

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.810
and also have strong
relationship strength.

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:14.650
So they're all
people on LinkedIn

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:18.790
and that would be
first-degree connections.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:21.870
But another very important
network is this core network.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:25.050
Again, it has very
strong career impact.

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:28.710
These are people that are your
colleagues at your company,

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:32.710
at Google, but also people in
the industry, your clients,

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:35.010
and prospects.

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.182
And some of them will be
first-degree contacts.

00:57:37.182 --> 00:57:39.640
Some of them will be people
that are second-degree contacts

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.570
that you don't know that well.

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:44.390
And one of the goals that
you want to do on LinkedIn

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:48.040
is move more people
from second-degree

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.550
to first-degree contacts.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.800
Because when they're a
first-degree contact,

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.380
you can have unlimited
messaging with them, et cetera,

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.750
and you have access to
who their network is.

00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:59.400
So that's sort of
part of the strategy

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:03.030
is moving more people into
first-degree contacts.

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.880
Now another group that's
an important network

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.180
is what I'm calling soft links.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.600
These are people that
you don't know well.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.590
But they can be
valuable just the same,

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.810
because they're
often useful when

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.869
you have a particular target
in mind or things like that.

00:58:18.869 --> 00:58:20.660
So they're people that
you don't know well.

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.390
And then bottom
right, I'm calling it

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:23.860
a grassroots network.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.190
These are people that are
close family and friends.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:30.390
Again, not high career impact,
but very strong support system

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:32.680
just the same.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.435
Sure.

00:58:33.435 --> 00:58:34.351
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:45.060
What about the idea of knowing
or be able to speak for anyone

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:49.000
you're connected to or
being willing to endorse?

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.525
So do you want to
connect to people

00:58:50.525 --> 00:58:52.150
whom you don't know
well enough to know

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:53.910
if they're high quality?

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:54.910
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:57.310
People have different
philosophies of that,

00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:00.290
and I'm curious what
you people find works.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:02.440
I think it's kind of
divided down the middle.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.720
We're going to look at some of
the habits of super sellers.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.030
But there are
people that are very

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:10.810
open networkers
and accept anyone.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:13.690
And you can endorse anyone.

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:18.340
You put your skills and
expertise on LinkedIn,

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.090
and people can endorse
you in those categories.

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:25.160
But also on LinkedIn, other
people can see your profile

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.700
and put new skills and
endorse you in them.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:32.470
And a lot of people that endorse
me, I don't know who they are.

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:35.550
So maybe-- I don't know.

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:38.580
It's kind of a
philosophy, and I think

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.650
the jury is still out
what the way to go is.

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.230
And as I say, super sellers,
they're kind of divided down

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:49.570
the middle from people who only
build a network that's really

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:51.480
what I'd call genuine, i.e.

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.480
people that they know, whereas
other people are more open

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.150
about it, figuring that
maybe I'll find a connection,

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:02.130
I'll find a way to connect
and it'll be useful to me.

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.050
Yes.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:03.726
OK.

01:00:03.726 --> 01:00:08.956
AUDIENCE: Not to be a
maverick [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:08.956 --> 01:00:13.769
but I think with a harder
question to your same point

01:00:13.769 --> 01:00:15.185
about people who
are endorsing you

01:00:15.185 --> 01:00:17.185
who you don't know who
can't speak to your skill

01:00:17.185 --> 01:00:20.195
set, why-- I'm from
the East Coast too,

01:00:20.195 --> 01:00:22.150
so it's a bit different.

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:25.010
I struggle with taking
LinkedIn as a credible source,

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.250
because you can sort of
make up what you are.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:28.510
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.190
AUDIENCE: What's your response?

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.269
CATHERINE KAPUTA: You
take what as a-- I

01:00:32.269 --> 01:00:33.560
didn't understand the question.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.380
AUDIENCE: Well,
just the whole idea

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.890
of people that you don't
know endorsing you.

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:38.960
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.850
AUDIENCE: So why should
we take it seriously?

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.910
We can make up like
what it says we do.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:46.190
CATHERINE KAPUTA: LinkedIn
introduced endorsements

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:48.700
last year, because
the fact of the matter

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.530
is not a lot of people
write recommendations.

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.390
And a recommendation
is something

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:54.600
you have control over.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.700
A recommendation doesn't get
posted unless you like it

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.560
and agree to it and say yes,
and then it gets posted.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.700
And you generally ask
people to recommend you,

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.600
or you recommend them, and
they offer to recommend you.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.800
The endorsements they did
because all you have to do

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.450
is click on the plus
button next to a skill,

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.070
so it's very easy
for people to do.

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.670
But you don't have control over.

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:18.972
So yes, do I think
people in the know

01:01:18.972 --> 01:01:21.240
don't take endorsements
that seriously

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.760
because they know that?

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.350
But other people
might look at somebody

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:30.360
and they see 50 endorsers in
each of these key categories

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.730
and think, oh, well,
this person's somebody.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.550
But yes, people in the
know know that endorsements

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:36.810
aren't that real.

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:38.750
So that's what
matters a lot more

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.102
is getting recommendations.

01:01:40.102 --> 01:01:41.018
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:46.337 --> 01:01:47.337
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.930
AUDIENCE: I endorse all
of my executive customers

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:55.210
as a nicety.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:56.570
And it goes a mile.

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.815
It's amazing.

01:01:57.815 --> 01:02:00.665
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:00.665 --> 01:02:03.674
I think it's easy for a
lot of people [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:03.674 --> 01:02:06.094
There's a little bit
more poetic license

01:02:06.094 --> 01:02:08.514
in saying what your job is.

01:02:08.514 --> 01:02:11.902
But I struggle with [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:15.017 --> 01:02:16.100
CATHERINE KAPUTA: I agree.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.230
There's no quality control.

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:19.350
But I also think not
only is it a nice thing

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:22.690
to do to clients or
prospects, but I also

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:25.150
think that when you look
at somebody's profile

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:27.030
and they have a lot
of endorsements,

01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:32.180
whether you know that
anybody can do it, you think,

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.490
well, they're somebody
versus somebody

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:36.120
that has almost nothing.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.410
You have to realize people
make these snap judgments.

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:44.100
But yes, I think people in the
know know that endorsements,

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.430
you have no control over
it, and a lot of them

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.360
are from people who knows
why they're doing it,

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.412
but they're doing it.

01:02:51.412 --> 01:02:52.328
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:04.460
They may see value in evaluating
you based on what's out there.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.414
So even if you don't
see it, you have

01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:07.580
to realize that you may be--

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:07.810
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Can I tell you?

01:03:07.810 --> 01:03:09.880
I think this is a key point.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.634
I agree with him.

01:03:10.634 --> 01:03:11.800
I think this is a key point.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.880
A lot of people aren't
going to realize

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.770
that any Tom, Dick,
and Harry can do that.

01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:19.047
But look, oh, this person's
been endorsed a lot.

01:03:19.047 --> 01:03:21.130
They're going to think
you're better than somebody

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.920
that hasn't been endorsed a lot.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.001
So I don't--

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:24.917
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.160
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Absolutely.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:29.830
Absolutely.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:31.002
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:31.002 --> 01:03:32.252
CATHERINE KAPUTA: No, exactly.

01:03:32.252 --> 01:03:36.476
AUDIENCE: So a good example is I
was endorsed by my optometrist.

01:03:36.476 --> 01:03:37.850
It kind of caught
me by surprise,

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:41.350
because he's a good friend of
mine, and he endorsed me for--

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.850
AUDIENCE: He spends
a lot of money--

01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:43.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.649
Well, no.

01:03:43.649 --> 01:03:44.800
He actually--

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.550
CATHERINE KAPUTA: He
wants you to come in.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:48.160
AUDIENCE: He is on Google Apps.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.780
AUDIENCE: He is on Google Apps.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.190
But as far as him endorsing
me for a specific data

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.440
center or a cloud
skill, I'm not really

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.840
sure what that value might be.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.630
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Can
I tell you, I have--

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.756
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I need
glasses to be a visionary.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:03.340
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Can I tell you,

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.410
I have a number of
people like that

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.368
too that I know who they
are and I'm wondering,

01:04:06.368 --> 01:04:09.470
why are they even bothering,
because they don't know me

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:10.170
professionally.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:15.280
But some people, they like
to do it, and that's it.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.071
But I think ultimately
it's a positive,

01:04:18.071 --> 01:04:20.570
because there are enough people
that are going to look at it

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.060
and think, this person
is better than somebody

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.740
that doesn't have many.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.020
But what really counts
is recommendations,

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.530
so somebody taking
the time to write

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:33.760
a few sentences about you.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.670
That really counts,
particularly if it's

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:38.480
a high-level endorsement
too, that they

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.860
have a good title
at the client side.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.862
That works wonders, because
the other potential clients

01:04:44.862 --> 01:04:46.820
and prospects are going
to say, oh, this person

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.550
spent the time to
write a recommendation.

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:51.720
That's what's really
going to count.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.220
All right.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.650
So what the power
of LinkedIn is is

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:56.080
the power of the second degree.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.440
It's this whole area.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.540
It's not who you know
but who do they know.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.950
So that's the big
thing that LinkedIn

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:04.640
gives you is this
ability to look

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.110
at the network of your
first-degree contacts

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:09.660
and who do they know.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.840
And again, kind of forming what
I said Reid Hoffman's big thing

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.710
is, this band of brothers,
people that help each other.

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:20.780
Oh, I know so-and-so
there, I can introduce you

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.280
to that person, and vice versa.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.220
So the big thing is
the old way of doing

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.090
business is who do
I know at Company X?

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.450
The new way is who
does my network know

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.270
and how can I
leverage that knower?

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:39.500
The whole thing's
about LinkedIn.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.880
And I think a smart way to
network is this whole idea.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.480
You want a broad network,
because a lot of business

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.600
can come from people
that you don't

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.140
know that well or maybe
aren't that prominent.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.770
So you want it broad, but
you want it selectively deep.

01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:56.740
You can't be deep
with everybody.

01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.620
But you want to be with the
kind of clients and prospects

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.180
that you're going after,
because more people that

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.210
fit that bill will know
other people like themselves.

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:09.950
So that's why that
strategy is important.

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.890
And also this statistic
that I have here

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:16.390
is a new research study showing
that there are 5.4 decision

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:20.020
makers involved in each
B2B decision process.

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.380
So you want to influence
the other people that

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.230
are part of that
decision process as well.

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:27.650
And so LinkedIn can
be a very good vehicle

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.150
for helping you do that.

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:32.560
So how do top social
sellers use LinkedIn?

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.454
About half of them sign up
for the premium product.

01:06:36.454 --> 01:06:37.870
How many people
here have premium?

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:39.730
I guess you all do, right?

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:40.420
OK.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:40.920
OK.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.690
So it's divided down
the middle here.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.090
What are people's opinion
that have the premium?

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:50.300
What do you think of it?

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.720
Sales Navigator, who's using it?

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.625
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:54.625 --> 01:06:55.500
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.930
You want to pass the thing over?

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.430
The advantages that
you see from it.

01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.930
OK.

01:07:03.334 --> 01:07:04.375
AUDIENCE: I have premium.

01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:07.190
And I don't know if Julia
does, the director of media

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.850
and high-tech, as well.

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:11.940
Because we've been doing some
enterprise-wide industry,

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.300
thought leadership kind
of things on LinkedIn,

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.900
and there's so many
things that you

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.010
can do that I wasn't even aware
that you can do with creating

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:22.210
contact lists directly
from other companies,

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.590
just continuing to drill down.

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:25.890
It's almost like a pivot
table that you drill down

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:28.530
until you get to the person
that you want to get it.

01:07:31.059 --> 01:07:32.850
Plus you get limited
on the number of mails

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:33.810
that you can send.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:34.780
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.280
AUDIENCE: Inviting
contacts, there's

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.821
just too many
limitations when you're

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:40.105
trying to do something
across-- at least for me--

01:07:40.105 --> 01:07:40.730
the enterprise.

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:41.730
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:44.104
So it gives you access
to third-degree con-- OK.

01:07:44.104 --> 01:07:44.770
Another comment?

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.811
AUDIENCE: You need an
enterprise license, though,

01:07:46.811 --> 01:07:48.170
because it's pricey.

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:50.690
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:53.800
LinkedIn made a killing
on the recruitment market,

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.510
and their whole
focus now is sales.

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:58.600
And it's pricey.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.442
Get all your sellers
on that monthly thing--

01:08:02.442 --> 01:08:03.900
AUDIENCE: One thing
I was hoping we

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.640
would get from you is
the settings in LinkedIn

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.970
are very complex.

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:09.560
When you said
endorsements, the reason

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.976
I think people endorse you--
and John mentioned it to me--

01:08:11.976 --> 01:08:14.910
is so that their feed shows
that they endorsed you.

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:16.640
Basically, it helps
their own feed.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.098
AUDIENCE: And then
all the settings

01:08:19.098 --> 01:08:22.374
that you have around privacy and
what degree of people can see,

01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:24.874
I was hoping maybe you would
share some of those [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:24.874 --> 01:08:26.029
CATHERINE KAPUTA: I'm
going to get into that.

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:27.100
Yeah, I'm going
to get into that.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:27.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:28.100
One more thing.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:31.920
So a lot of it's been focused
on discovery and access.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.700
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.069
AUDIENCE: Not to be
arrogant, but the brand takes

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:39.410
us quite a ways,
if you'd imagine.

01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:42.140
And one of the things I'm
looking to also understand

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.990
is if we have contact, an
establish relationship,

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:48.210
how can we better utilize
some of these tool

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:53.430
sets to influence that decision
beyond just meeting new people

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.689
to influence and sell through.

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:55.124
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:08:55.124 --> 01:08:55.560
OK.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.029
I'm going to be getting
into some of that,

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:58.479
so we can go into
that and then talk

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.700
about more when we get there.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.254
But anyway, top social sellers,
about 50% of them use LinkedIn.

01:09:04.254 --> 01:09:05.420
You get a lot of advantages.

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.970
You get premier search filters.

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:12.800
You get access to third-degree
contacts, Leader Builder

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.300
system.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.500
There's also this team
link that you can find out

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.679
who other people at
your company know.

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:21.720
And that's something that
you have to opt in for.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.939
So in the privacy,
have to sign up for it.

01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:25.800
And if you don't
sign up for it, you

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.960
can't see likewise who other
people in your company know.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.621
So they kind of
penalize you for that.

01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:31.537
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.420
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah,
but you get all of who

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.420
viewed your profile.

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.649
Because if you don't
have the premium product,

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:43.649
you just see, like, five, and
the rest they don't show you.

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:44.870
It's a blank face.

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.550
So if you did
that, you'd see all

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:49.140
who's viewed your profile,
which could be interesting,

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:53.479
because it could be prospects
looking at your profile

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:55.390
or competitors, et
cetera, et cetera.

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:58.175
So you see all the names of
who's looked at your profile.

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:05.650
AUDIENCE: The idea of creating
specific industry groups

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.729
on LinkedIn--

01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:08.520
CATHERINE KAPUTA: I'm
going to get to that.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.561
I'm going to get to that.

01:10:09.561 --> 01:10:15.290
But there are a lot
of ways-- How many

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.991
groups do people belong to here?

01:10:17.991 --> 01:10:18.490
A lot?

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:19.480
A ton?

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.420
You can do 50.

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.500
So how many belong to 50?

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.000
OK.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.550
A lot of you belong to 50.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:29.640
And how many people here
have set up their own group?

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.850
OK.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:31.350
On LinkedIn.

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.432
OK.

01:10:32.432 --> 01:10:33.640
We're going to get into that.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.306
I'm going to get into
that, because it's

01:10:35.306 --> 01:10:38.170
a strategy that
certain sellers do.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:41.810
And what they often
do is look at groups

01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:44.390
that have their prospects
and have their clients

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.890
and join that group.

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:49.660
When you join a group, you can
see the list of other members,

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.230
and you can message
them directly.

01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:56.750
But what sellers do if
they have a niche market

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.810
is they start their
own group that's

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:04.200
related to the other group
with a different twist,

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.870
and then they reach out
to the people in the group

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.270
to join their group.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:11.040
And there you've got
your own little forum

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.680
for communicating with
people on an ongoing basis.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.980
But it has to have a little
different twist to it.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.320
And also, you might want to have
a little small group of people

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.250
that are maintaining it,
because it takes some time

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:27.000
to put in articles yourself
and get conversation going

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.470
and invite people to join.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.410
But certain sellers
have used it,

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:32.680
and it's a very
powerful strategy

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.290
because you've got
people in a group,

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.220
and you're positioning
yourself as the thought

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.420
leader of that group
by being part of it,

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.750
by starting the group, and
keeping a discussion going.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:46.090
And people have found it as
a very good tool for building

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:49.740
business, converting, building
stronger relationships.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.020
So it's looking at
what kind of group

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:56.270
would your prospects or
clients be interested in that's

01:11:56.270 --> 01:12:00.530
not out there, and who are those
people joining those groups

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.031
and inviting them to join yours?

01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:03.530
Yes.

01:12:06.234 --> 01:12:07.900
AUDIENCE: One of
things that on the team

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.440
we've been talking about is
how do we move from an outreach

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.500
where we do a one-touch
or kind of a campaign type

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.830
to more of a continuous
conversation with prospects,

01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:16.110
right?

01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:17.990
It would be interesting to
hear how we can actually

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:19.281
used LinkedIn to continue that.

01:12:19.281 --> 01:12:21.274
Because I think
even after a sale

01:12:21.274 --> 01:12:23.690
and once we're in an account,
that continuous conversation

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:24.960
piece is really important now.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.050
It's a differentiator.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.990
Typically, the past has being
campaign, outreach, and step

01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.590
away.

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.890
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:30.290
Yeah.

01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:31.270
I'm going to get into that.

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:32.853
And that's a key
thing to think about.

01:12:32.853 --> 01:12:35.100
Because having been
on the client side,

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.700
one of the problems is a lot
of people sell you something

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.100
and then they disappear.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.600
So there's kind of the romance
period, and then they're gone.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.620
And clients kind of resent that.

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.570
So it's very important to
have a vehicle for doing that.

01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:50.440
And I'm going to go over
some ideas on doing that.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.250
You can do that
with a group too,

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:55.070
having a group that carries
on the conversation.

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:56.950
But there's a number
of ways to do that,

01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:59.090
so I'm going to get into that.

01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.638
OK.

01:12:59.638 --> 01:13:00.554
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:10.890
I know when I see a certain
number of whatever you want

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:13.150
to call it, activity,
coming through on my feed

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:15.520
from a particular
person-- I know

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.040
of one individual in
particular that posts

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.290
nothing but endorsements,
nothing but recommendations,

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:22.010
nothing but articles
over and over

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:24.837
and over again every single day
to the point where I don't even

01:13:24.837 --> 01:13:26.920
think they do anything
other than look at LinkedIn

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.700
all the time.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.004
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.420
AUDIENCE: Is there is there a
tipping point where you lose

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.570
credibility because all you're--

01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:33.040
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Oh, I think so.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.010
AUDIENCE: --doing
is using LinkedIn?

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.968
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:13:34.968 --> 01:13:37.350
AUDIENCE: And where is the
philosophical balance of using

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:41.690
this for a real tool versus
using it as a Facebook

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:43.460
alternative, and then
it carries no value,

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:44.880
and you devalue
everything you do

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.110
because you're in it so much?

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.940
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.650
I think we all have
somebody like that.

01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:55.280
And I think that you've got to
think of branding and a brand.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.870
You want to build an
image for yourself,

01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:59.390
you want to build
a conversation,

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:01.110
you want to build
engagement, but you

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.390
don't want to be annoying.

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:05.300
And if you're annoying, nobody
wants to do business with you.

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.310
It's just like any brand.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.960
So I think there's a
fine balance there.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.259
Is there are a number?

01:14:11.259 --> 01:14:12.550
I think you have to sense that.

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.580
But yeah, there's certain
people that I get updates

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.627
from every day and that
endorse a million people

01:14:17.627 --> 01:14:18.960
and all this stuff goes through.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.430
You could block those
people, by the way.

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:23.494
But it's annoying.

01:14:23.494 --> 01:14:24.910
And so you have
to think about it.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:26.850
Yes, LinkedIn can
work against you.

01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:30.040
But I think also there's a
danger not using LinkedIn

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.720
because your clients
are using it,

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.530
your prospects are using it, and
your competitors are using it.

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:39.290
So you want to use it to build
a positive image for yourself

01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:41.997
and build positive
relationships and nurture them,

01:14:41.997 --> 01:14:43.330
but you don't want to be a pest.

01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:47.940
And some people, I wonder
where's the day job?

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.510
Because it's so annoying.

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:52.120
So it's a fine balance, and
you have to figure that out.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.000
What's a good amount
of communication?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.050
And a lot of it is
based on this whole idea

01:14:57.050 --> 01:15:02.440
of who is your target audience
and what kind of relationship,

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.260
what kind of communication
would be effective with them.

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.212
And if you're bombarding
people, then you

01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:09.170
devalue the whole thing,
and you're a nuisance,

01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:11.720
and they don't want to
do business with you.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.220
All right.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.380
So what do top sellers
value in terms of LinkedIn?

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.540
Researching people
and companies is

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.500
by far the dominant one,
this whole idea of leveraging

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:26.160
second-degree contacts
and who they know.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.870
There's more detailed ways
to connect on LinkedIn.

01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:34.730
You can leverage your
company's contacts.

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:39.360
There's stories of articles
written about this that they

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.230
found out through LinkedIn that
an admin person's uncle was

01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:46.480
a CIO at a company,
and they wouldn't

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.320
have found that
connection otherwise.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.280
So there's a lot of
things that can help you

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.250
with maintaining
relationships, and we'll

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:54.760
get into more detail
in a little bit.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.770
Electronic word of mouth.

01:15:56.770 --> 01:16:00.060
Word of mouth is the most
important kind of advertising,

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.200
getting other people
to advocate for you.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.190
And LinkedIn gives you
vehicles for doing that.

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:09.950
The most-used features are
who has viewed my profile.

01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:14.000
71% of the top sellers, that's
their most used-feature.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.790
People you may know, groups,
direct messaging is also cited.

01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:22.780
Top sellers in terms
of LinkedIn groups

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:27.690
tend to belong to 30 groups,
whereas 36% overall just belong

01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:29.540
to 9 or 9.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.110
A lot of them join
alumni groups, too,

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:34.392
which I've found
to be very helpful.

01:16:34.392 --> 01:16:35.850
There's something
about people that

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:39.974
went to the same school that
will help you in ways that I

01:16:39.974 --> 01:16:41.640
haven't seen with
other kinds of things.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.340
So that can be an
important one too.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:47.690
Target industries,
obviously, functions.

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:49.450
They work the Members page.

01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:51.370
They start looking at
who the members are

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:56.000
and how they can work that to
build relationships with them.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.750
They join groups strategically.

01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:00.590
They look at who their
hot prospects are,

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:03.880
what groups are they
in, join those groups,

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.310
and trying to be part
of the conversation

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:08.190
and build a
relationship that way.

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:12.906
And if that person posts
questions, responding to them

01:17:12.906 --> 01:17:15.280
and getting a sense of what
they're interested in through

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.590
means as well.

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:19.790
You can follow conversations
of interest on groups.

01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:22.630
You could set up
a follow for that.

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:29.060
So here I'm isolating six
search secrets of super sellers,

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.310
according to research
that's out there.

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:34.050
One, they use the
Advanced Search feature

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:37.370
to establish winning
search parameters.

01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:41.120
They save that search
and create alerts

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.080
so that when anything
changes within that group

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.280
that they've targeted they get
an automatic update about it.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.630
So it's an easy way to
see who's new to that that

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:53.040
meets those parameters that
weren't on the list before,

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.380
et cetera.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.865
Browse the network
of your network.

01:17:57.865 --> 01:18:02.130
You can do this with
first-degree contacts only.

01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:06.310
And they have a feature that you
can do this automatic introduce

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:07.147
with LinkedIn.

01:18:07.147 --> 01:18:08.730
But I think what a
lot of people don't

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:12.100
realize is when you use
that the recipient sees

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:16.130
the email that you wrote to your
first-degree contact as well

01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:21.670
as the message that
you're writing to them.

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:24.560
So I think it's smarter to
really pick up the phone,

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.040
and if somebody's a
first-degree contact, send them

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.010
an email directly
and say, I see you're

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:32.770
a first-degree contact
with so-and-so.

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:36.710
And make it a positive thing,
not I want to sell to them,

01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:41.280
but we've sold similar
product to another company

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.100
that really I think they'd be
interested in learning more

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:47.660
about, and do you
feel comfortable

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.070
introducing me personally?

01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:51.820
It's much better if there's
a personal introduction

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:58.550
through email rather than using,
I think, the LinkedIn device.

01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:00.720
Number three is you
want to check out

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.740
viewers of this profile also
viewed and people similar to.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.610
Now this is something
that top super sellers do,

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:09.660
and it could give you
ideas of other people

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.010
that could be good
leads for you.

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:14.430
Likewise, check out who's
viewed your profile.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.480
Super sellers also do
active company searches,

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.610
advanced search by
name or by parameters.

01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:25.700
And when you do a
company search like that,

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.500
it'll list the people
that you're first-degree

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.510
connected with, the top five.

01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:35.080
You can follow a
company, and you

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:38.290
can view people who viewed
this company also viewed.

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:42.770
So it's an easy way to
keep track of all of that.

01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:46.480
Super sellers also use
Groups strategically.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:50.400
They join groups that
prospects have joined.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.660
They join groups of people that
have access to top prospects.

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:58.540
So if you have a CIO
target or a C-level target,

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:01.820
you can join groups
that suppliers

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:06.360
belong to or media people
or customers of theirs

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.490
to build relationships and
then move to the next level.

01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:12.880
You can check the
group's About section,

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.420
and it'll tell you who
what kind of members

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:18.840
are in the group, how
active the group is,

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.160
the seniority of
them, the location.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.510
And then, as I said, there's
a group of super sellers--

01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:26.250
and we'll get into
more detail later--

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:30.910
that formed their own group to
sort of develop their thought

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:34.010
leadership and also
develop relationships.

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:36.610
And a key thing that
super sellers do too

01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:38.450
is they're easy to reach.

01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:40.110
They're easy to find.

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.900
They have a lot of
keywords in their profiles,

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.720
so they're easy to find.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.100
Their title is something
that people can understand,

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.205
or they changed their title so
people understand who they are

01:20:51.205 --> 01:20:53.990
and what their function is.

01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:56.940
You can easily put contact
information in your profile,

01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:57.440
if you want.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.560
You can put your direct
email address, if you want,

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.500
so that you're easy to reach.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.470
So step one is you want
to build your brand.

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:10.260
Step two is you want to find the
right customers for yourself.

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.540
And step three is
about engagement.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:15.790
So how do you engage these
people and get a dialogue going

01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:18.089
and build a relationship?

01:21:18.089 --> 01:21:19.880
And the first thing
you want to think about

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.710
is who is your target audience?

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:27.820
So that point I was making
earlier, who is your audience?

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:31.460
What reaction, what action
do I want them to take?

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:34.910
And what do I have to
do to get that reaction?

01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:39.420
And having been a corporate
person in the marketing

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.280
area, the CIO target,
in my opinion,

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.100
is very different
from the CMO target,

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.560
if you're branching out
into these other areas.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.660
And according to Gartner, 80%
of marketing tech spending

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:53.630
will be in LBOs in
two years' time.

01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:56.000
So it's an audience
to think about.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.880
A lot of tech
companies are going

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.620
after other areas
of the C-suite.

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:06.840
And the CIO, in my experience
working on Wall Street,

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.120
they were more risk-adverse
than marketing people,

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.610
and they didn't want
to see a lot of change

01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:16.500
and upset the system, a
much more traditional kind

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.990
of person, so a
different kind of sell

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:22.900
than a CMO who is always charged
with what are you doing next,

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.420
what kind of
exciting new things.

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:27.820
Or the CEO was always
calling [INAUDIBLE], oh, I

01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:30.154
talked to this other
CEO at this company,

01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:31.320
and this is what he's doing.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.370
Have you thought of trying that?

01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:36.250
So it's always
what's new and what's

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:41.400
innovative to bring in new
customers for the company.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.780
And now so much of the
marketing is technology-based

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:48.225
because of the whole
importance of the internet

01:22:48.225 --> 01:22:53.380
and digital media and the whole
importance of social media.

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:56.780
If I'm going to be judged on it,
I want to control the budget.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.960
So that's why so much is
moving into marketing and LBOs.

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.030
Right now a lot of it
is smaller business,

01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:05.014
but I think it's
going to be growing.

01:23:05.014 --> 01:23:07.430
And a key thing you want to
think about in this whole area

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:11.210
of how do you engage your
target audience is you

01:23:11.210 --> 01:23:13.300
always want to be
connecting with them,

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.250
not annoying them, but
connecting with them

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.310
in a meaningful way.

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:18.530
But a big thing
in branding today

01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:21.900
is emotional branding,
understanding

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:25.110
what your clients and
prospects are thinking about,

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:28.360
what their problems are,
what their mindset is,

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:32.250
and connecting with that
in an emotional way.

01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:35.410
Much more powerful
than rational arguments

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:38.446
are connecting with
people emotionally.

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:39.820
Just think when
you meet somebody

01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.920
that you have a mutual
friend in common.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.640
There's quick rapport that's
established because you

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.220
both have this bond with
somebody you both know.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.200
I'm doing this
whole always series.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.420
So you always want
to be connecting.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:57.580
You always want to be
tracking competitors.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.780
This is a new thing that
LinkedIn introduced about two

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:08.990
weeks ago, and it's a new tool,
tracking companies on LinkedIn

01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:11.390
and how important
different companies are.

01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:15.600
And here it shows you've got
some 500-pound gorillas here

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:22.090
on LinkedIn, Microsoft,
IBM, Oracle, HP, Google.

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:25.060
This was done by
looking at the target

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.584
audience of these companies.

01:24:26.584 --> 01:24:28.250
And this is a high-tech
one, and they've

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.790
done it for every industry.

01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:32.060
So you can see
the companies that

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:35.720
are spending a lot on
content on LinkedIn,

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.120
that have a lot of employees,
that are engaged on LinkedIn.

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.180
They just posted this
a couple days ago.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.730
So what they're trying
to do, obviously,

01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:53.860
is to get the companies that
aren't as strong on LinkedIn

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:59.470
to get a stronger position, get
more of their people involved

01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:02.750
with LinkedIn, to also get more
involved with corporate ads, et

01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:03.500
cetera, et cetera.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:07.350
So it measures all of that, all
of the people at a company--

01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:08.520
yes.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.440
CATHERINE KAPUTA: No, no.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.210
That was my point.

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:14.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:14.190 --> 01:25:16.260
We heard a rumor
a little while ago

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:19.700
that if you link with
somebody-- for example,

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:22.670
if I link with somebody
from Microsoft--

01:25:22.670 --> 01:25:26.250
can they then see everybody I'm
linking with from that point

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:27.450
on?

01:25:27.450 --> 01:25:28.540
What do they see?

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.520
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yes.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.150
Yeah.

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:32.000
Yeah, you're a
first-degree connection.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.360
Yes.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.147
Yes.

01:25:34.147 --> 01:25:35.980
AUDIENCE: So I heard
that they were actively

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.802
doing that to see who
we're connecting with.

01:25:37.802 --> 01:25:38.606
AUDIENCE: Of course they are.

01:25:38.606 --> 01:25:39.310
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:40.400
AUDIENCE: So what
should we do about that?

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.470
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Then
you can't connect--

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.470
AUDIENCE: Don't connect
with anyone from Microsoft?

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:43.428
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:25:43.428 --> 01:25:44.710
But they will see that, yes.

01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:46.030
They will see that.

01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:48.030
And yes, you can
see LinkedIn has

01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:53.280
been a big strategy
of Microsoft and IBM

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.475
and these other companies.

01:25:54.475 --> 01:25:55.391
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:57.372 --> 01:25:58.330
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:59.246
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:59.246 --> 01:26:00.544
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yes.

01:26:00.544 --> 01:26:01.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:02.020
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Yeah, so you've

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.500
got to think about who the
first-degree connections are

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.522
going to be.

01:26:05.522 --> 01:26:07.980
You've got to think about who
your first-degree connections

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:11.470
are going to be, because
they would have access

01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:14.190
to your network.

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:14.840
Right.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:20.550
And this is important, because
from an advertising standpoint

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.820
visibility for a brand
is very important.

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.340
Google has a
fabulous reputation,

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:30.560
but this shows you
that you're being out

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.460
communicated on
LinkedIn vis-a-vis

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.460
some of your major competitors.

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.060
And it's important because
in the branding world

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.710
we measure visibility.

01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:42.520
We measure spending.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.910
We measure attitude and
awareness of different brands.

01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:48.680
And generally the brands
that spend the most

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.470
are the most well-known.

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:53.630
And there's a real premium
to being well-known,

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:56.480
because if you're well-known
as a brand people think

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.050
you're better than a brand
that's not as well-known.

01:26:59.050 --> 01:27:01.720
Now these are all equally
well-known companies.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.440
But people, they're
getting more messages

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.230
from some of your
competitors, and so that's

01:27:07.230 --> 01:27:10.290
why all of you being
involved in a bigger way

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:11.790
is going to help
that score as well.

01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:17.480
And the other thing, you
can follow companies.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:20.790
And I think you should follow
your company, obviously,

01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:21.960
but your competitors.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.410
You can see here there's
more people following Google

01:27:25.410 --> 01:27:28.590
than are following Microsoft,
in spite of all their spending

01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:31.160
and activity on LinkedIn.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.680
And this is part
of the new report

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.606
that LinkedIn is giving out.

01:27:35.606 --> 01:27:37.099
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:37.099 --> 01:27:38.057
CATHERINE KAPUTA: What?

01:27:38.057 --> 01:27:39.054
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:39.054 --> 01:27:40.220
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Oh, right.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.350
She and I connected.

01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:42.274
She and I connected.

01:27:42.274 --> 01:27:43.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:46.730
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:47.230
Right.

01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:47.874
Oh, really?

01:27:47.874 --> 01:27:48.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:49.110
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:50.780
No, she was telling
me about that.

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.500
Yeah, right.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.478
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:27:53.478 --> 01:27:57.270
And by the way, for Patricia,
not only did she and I connect,

01:27:57.270 --> 01:28:00.150
but then she introduced me
to somebody, a friend of hers

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.090
at another company.

01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:05.021
So she made that
little gift to me,

01:28:05.021 --> 01:28:06.520
so that I think
that was very smart.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.080
But yeah, it shows new people
who you're connected to,

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.165
new people that you're connected
to, et cetera, et cetera.

01:28:13.165 --> 01:28:15.290
AUDIENCE: I think a lot of
people following Google,

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.833
though, are looking for jobs.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:17.326
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:19.210
AUDIENCE: That's probably why
our numbers are much higher.

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:20.030
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Mm hmm.

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.990
I think it's consumer.

01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.864
I think you're right.

01:28:21.864 --> 01:28:23.050
Yeah, I think it's consumer.

01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:27.500
And I think that it has such a
powerful brand with everybody.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:32.210
But really for young people,
it's the place to work,

01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:35.760
innovative, et
cetera, et cetera.

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.700
And I have to say, your image
lives up to your billing,

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:40.300
walking through this
building myself.

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:44.050
So it's true.

01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:46.710
So you always want
to be on trend.

01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:50.410
And a new thing that
LinkedIn is doing

01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:52.750
is this Trending Content tool.

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:55.340
So it tells you can
do each industry.

01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:59.410
And what are the hot topics in
the auto industry on LinkedIn?

01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:02.300
What are the hot topics
in the retail industry?

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.760
What are the hot topics of
CMOs, et cetera, et cetera?

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.220
The most read and passed
along and stuff like that.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:15.200
A big question is, how do you
keep an ongoing relationship?

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:18.580
Well, you want to
be posting articles

01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:20.490
on things that are on-trend.

01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:22.990
You want to be on-trend,
the latest ideas.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:27.900
So you want to have a pulse of
what people are interested in.

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:29.950
And LinkedIn now has
a tool, as I said.

01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:30.930
It was just introduced.

01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:31.190
OK.

01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:31.773
Question here?

01:29:35.801 --> 01:29:38.300
AUDIENCE: So one thing we've
talked about is being on-trend.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:42.090
But what value do you see
for not following the trend?

01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:44.640
Because I always see on
my on LinkedIn 10 people

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.814
post the same article.

01:29:45.814 --> 01:29:47.480
And to me, that's a
lot less interesting

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.600
than the one person
who posts something

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.867
that's a little different.

01:29:50.867 --> 01:29:52.575
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Well, I agree with you.

01:29:52.575 --> 01:29:53.330
here's the thing.

01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:56.620
In branding, the first
person to post on a topic

01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:59.140
kind of gets the
benefit, because they're

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:01.740
the leader, the
first out of the box.

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:04.260
There's a tremendous
premium for being the first.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.822
That's another
positioning strategy

01:30:05.822 --> 01:30:06.780
that I didn't get into.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.530
But being the first can
be-- but all the follow-ons.

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:13.202
What you want to do is be
on-trend with a difference,

01:30:13.202 --> 01:30:14.410
with a different perspective.

01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:19.660
So you don't want to
be rehashing old news.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.970
But say it with
the different twist

01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:24.710
on it, a different
interpretation.

01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:29.240
A big thing that clients are
interested in the B2B market

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.730
is your thought process, how
you think about something.

01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:34.720
And Google already
has this image

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:38.650
of super innovative,
the latest thinking.

01:30:38.650 --> 01:30:41.010
So you want to talk about that.

01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:44.060
The trend is blah, blah,
but this isn't really

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.370
the way things are going
to go because of this.

01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:48.950
And take people to
the thought process.

01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:53.070
That really captivates clients
and prospects, in my view.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.617
I'm saying be
on-trend, but you have

01:30:58.617 --> 01:30:59.950
to have a different twist to it.

01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:02.340
You have to have the
Google perspective that's

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:06.440
going to be smarter and a little
different than the hoi polloi.

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.690
So that's what you want to do.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.870
Always be relevant.

01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:15.700
And another thing, you can slice
and dice this content report

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:19.800
that LinkedIn is cranking
out by the C-suite.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.710
What are the most read
and passed along articles

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:23.720
that they're doing?

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.960
And so this is kind of
a quick read to see--

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.760
and it's very different than
the auto industry and et

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.800
cetera, et cetera.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.450
It can be very
helpful giving you

01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:37.886
an idea of a dialogue to have
and a conversation to have.

01:31:37.886 --> 01:31:38.802
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:50.159
How do we know about these
new things in LinkedIn?

01:31:50.159 --> 01:31:52.200
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Well,
I just found out about it

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.160
on the LinkedIn publicity.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:59.170
But it's being given to
your marketing department,

01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:01.320
so your marketing
department has it.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.635
AUDIENCE: They're failing us.

01:32:02.635 --> 01:32:03.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.191
CATHERINE KAPUTA: I don't know.

01:32:05.191 --> 01:32:06.939
I don't know your
marketing area.

01:32:06.939 --> 01:32:08.230
Because I was researching that.

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:14.920
I found this because it's new
and they're publicizing it.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.070
And as I said, they're
really going after the sales

01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:21.100
marketplace, so they're
developing a lot of tools.

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.830
Because I know people
in recruitment before,

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:26.710
and they just love the LinkedIn,
and they made tons of money

01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:27.920
off that.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.690
But they're providing
some very useful tools.

01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:34.540
They publicized a lot
of this on the internet,

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.820
but they're giving the
detailed-- they're not

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:40.215
giving the exact scores except
to the specific companies,

01:32:40.215 --> 01:32:41.590
but they're giving
these reports.

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:45.360
But marketing has got
to be providing you

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.850
with this kind of information,
because it's very valuable.

01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:51.440
Because they're slicing
and dicing it by C-suite,

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.390
by industry, by other functions.

01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:55.950
So it can be very, very useful.

01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:56.866
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.170
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Because they're

01:33:01.170 --> 01:33:02.880
giving it to the marketing
people right now.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.310
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:04.330
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
They just launched it

01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:05.810
two or three weeks ago.

01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:06.860
They publicized it.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:10.420
That's where I got
these charts from.

01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:12.970
They just launched it
in March, open launch,

01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:15.070
but they're giving it to
the marketing department.

01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:19.360
So you have to get it from them.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.846
Always be up-to-date.

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:22.970
And here's another feature.

01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:27.040
You can customize what the feed
is that you get on your updates

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.700
so that you only get
certain kinds of things.

01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.360
You can indicate the
kind of information

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.110
that you want to
receive when clients

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:39.359
are changing their profile or
linking up with a sales rep

01:33:39.359 --> 01:33:40.025
at a competitor.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.690
Because you don't want
necessarily everything there,

01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:47.720
or else you've just got
too much information.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.240
It's not that useful.

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.140
But you can make it so
you're up-to-date on who

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.350
the people, the clients,
and the prospects

01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:57.080
that you're following
any news to them that

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.500
might be useful for you.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.000
You always want to be helping.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.920
Really social selling is more
about helping than selling.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.570
And so a key thing people
are looking for on LinkedIn

01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:12.970
is really useful stuff.

01:34:12.970 --> 01:34:15.030
And there's
research, if you look

01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:20.920
at what works in
direct mail or works

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.620
online in terms of
what's passed along.

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:31.040
The number one thing
is useful information.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.500
Here's what other people
are doing, important

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.530
new trends infecting
your industry.

01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:39.620
So useful information is
what people are looking for,

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:42.570
particularly if it's new and
different that they haven't

01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:44.300
seen a million other places.

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.920
Another thing-- and I'm sure
you've gotten emails like this,

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.880
and it works in the direct mail
area and the direct marketing

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.830
selling products as well as
with people-- is a teaser.

01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:59.320
I forgot to tell you something,
or I have some surprising news,

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.490
or something like that.

01:35:00.490 --> 01:35:03.120
People tend to open emails like
that because they're curious.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.350
What's inside here?

01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:05.430
So it gets opened.

01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:10.760
A personal twist,
thinking of you,

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.590
here's a solution
to your problem,

01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:14.580
people tend to open
those kind of emails.

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.720
You want to think of that.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:21.910
So it's really not selling so
much as useful information.

01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:24.220
Always be inviting.

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.270
I invited Chris.

01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:26.520
He accepted.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.530
But after you hook
up with somebody,

01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:32.560
you get a notice
view Chris's profile.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.550
You can click and view his
network, et cetera, et cetera.

01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:40.280
So it always be inviting
people that you want to know.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.540
And I bet there's a lot of
people that you know well,

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.200
colleagues from past companies.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.090
And LinkedIn has
a lot of devices.

01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:52.410
And I have a link at the
end of a detailed ebook--

01:35:52.410 --> 01:35:55.360
because some of it's
complicated-- that details how

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.970
to do every little function you
might want to do on LinkedIn.

01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:02.450
So you always want to be
inviting the right people

01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:05.860
and inviting people that
could be your allies,

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.927
not necessarily people
that work in your industry,

01:36:08.927 --> 01:36:11.510
but they could be other people
that could be part of your band

01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:14.930
that you help each other
with ideas, et cetera.

01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:16.930
And so what works in
a LinkedIn invite?

01:36:16.930 --> 01:36:19.150
They have a default one.

01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:21.650
I'd like you to join
my LinkedIn network.

01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:24.410
But what a lot of people say
is they want it more personal

01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:27.560
and are more likely to accept
if you make a personal.

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.840
Great meeting you at the
conference the other day.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.640
Love to link.

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.180
I think we have a lot of similar
interests, blah, blah, blah.

01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:40.370
So just short
couple of sentences.

01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:42.280
As I say, I believe
in endorsing.

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.670
You want to endorse people,
and it's an easy way

01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:47.940
to do clients and prospects.

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:51.400
And as I say, I
think, even though we

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.450
know that anybody can do it and
what the value of some of it

01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:58.230
is, it looks good
on your profile

01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:02.370
that you're a person that
people think well of.

01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:04.420
You always want to
be recommending.

01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:06.570
And the best way to
get a recommendation

01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:10.420
is to write somebody
a recommendation.

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:14.070
And you can ask people if
they could recommend you.

01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:18.790
Leave them an out, if they
have time, something like that.

01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:21.740
Remind them of a
shared experience.

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:24.595
I think it helps with a lot of
people, because a lot of people

01:37:24.595 --> 01:37:27.197
find writing onerous,
is to say, remember

01:37:27.197 --> 01:37:28.280
we worked on this project?

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:31.850
And kind of give them the
copy so it's kind of a draft

01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:33.530
so it's easy for them to do.

01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:36.680
But the recommendations
count a lot for people,

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.069
if you're going after a lot
of clients and prospects.

01:37:40.069 --> 01:37:40.985
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:37:54.092 --> 01:37:55.050
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:55.800
I think this is--

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:37:59.154 --> 01:38:00.820
CATHERINE KAPUTA: I
think this is great.

01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:05.550
I think that you should
go after everyone who's

01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:07.730
written an evaluation
of you and ask them.

01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:10.730
And kind of give them draft
copy, because a lot of people

01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:11.950
are inundated with work.

01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:14.870
So kind of give them draft copy.

01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:18.230
People that you worked on
a project together with,

01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:21.730
remind them what the project
was and how the team worked

01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:24.330
and the results and
sort of draft something.

01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:27.280
People you worked together
with at other companies.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.460
You want to have a robust list
of people that are recommending

01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.370
you, because it's going
to help you sell in.

01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:35.310
Because people think,
wow, these people

01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:38.530
took the time to write
a recommendation.

01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:42.190
That's really worth something.

01:38:42.190 --> 01:38:44.350
You always want to be
liking and commenting,

01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:47.490
particularly if clients or
prospects are posting something

01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:48.400
on the internet.

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.160
And it's just like Facebook.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.630
It's very easy to do.

01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:54.510
But again, it's
touching someone.

01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:57.690
Also, I'm going to talk
later about touchpoints.

01:38:57.690 --> 01:38:59.350
But in the branding
world we think

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:03.630
about touchpoints, every place
a brand and a person touch.

01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:06.840
And the whole game is to
increase the touchpoints,

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.710
to also have them
all consistent.

01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:11.910
You don't want to have a bad
voicemail message that you

01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:15.350
sound harried and a very
professional website.

01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:19.050
You've got to have
it all work together.

01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:22.110
But all that's valuable.

01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:25.955
Always be connecting via Groups.

01:39:25.955 --> 01:39:28.330
One of the things that's good
about a lot of these groups

01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:29.520
is you can find the pain points.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.160
There's always people
asking questions.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.610
Does anyone have ideas on
how you solve this problem?

01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:39.380
So answer questions, ask
questions, answer questions.

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:43.690
That can be a very good vehicle
for that kind of thing too.

01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:45.800
And as I said earlier,
be easy to reach.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.370
But Groups can be a
very interesting way

01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:52.060
to get to know people
that they could

01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:55.590
be potential clients and
prospects or allies of yours

01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:57.590
to help each other.

01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:58.940
Always be repurposing.

01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:02.660
I had this conversation
with somebody earlier.

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.990
Everything that I
write a blog post on,

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:12.230
I do several different tweets on
it with different facets of it.

01:40:12.230 --> 01:40:14.720
Somebody was saying if
I've posted an article,

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.910
should I also blog about it?

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:19.700
Yes, but write it a little
differently, a little different

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:22.450
headline, change a
couple sentences around.

01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:24.820
Not everybody saw
the article, so you

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:28.550
want to use all these
different channels.

01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:31.860
If you have a slide deck
that's resonating with clients,

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:34.670
think is there a way to make
five slides out of it that

01:40:34.670 --> 01:40:36.570
would be OK in a public deck?

01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:38.590
Because your competitors
could see it as well.

01:40:38.590 --> 01:40:40.790
But you're looking
at your prospects.

01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:44.420
And a lot of people are
very visually-oriented,

01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:45.850
and there's a lot
of research that

01:40:45.850 --> 01:40:50.790
shows that when you tell
a story with visuals

01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:53.120
people remember it much
more than if they're just

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.430
reading an article.

01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:57.290
So that's why a slide
thing with pictures

01:40:57.290 --> 01:41:02.200
and a couple of sentences
can be very, very effective.

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.630
And I threw the top five
trends to transforming

01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:07.840
retail or an infographic.

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.000
If you have a
complicated report,

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.590
you could do an infographic
on it, things like that.

01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:14.060
You want to think creatively.

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.760
But everything I'd
repurpose into at least

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.530
four different ways or more.

01:41:20.530 --> 01:41:24.000
And you always want to
be linking and tracking.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.040
IBM got a lot of attention
with this social media campaign

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.580
that they developed for
their web-based services

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.272
which they weren't
selling that well.

01:41:33.272 --> 01:41:34.730
It wasn't going
that well for them.

01:41:34.730 --> 01:41:39.079
So they decided to do a social
media approach on LinkedIn.

01:41:39.079 --> 01:41:40.620
And I don't know
what their base was,

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:43.260
but they claim in
the articles about it

01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:47.480
that they increased sales
400% with social selling link.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.880
And they linked it
to a landing page,

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.010
so they were able
to track easily

01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:56.550
what resources people
were clicking on

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:58.230
and what was working,
and then they

01:41:58.230 --> 01:42:00.802
made sure things
were followed up.

01:42:00.802 --> 01:42:05.850
And there's another
study by HubSpot looking

01:42:05.850 --> 01:42:09.870
at their clients and that
LinkedIn generated the highest

01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:13.940
visitor lead conversion
rate, 2.74%, which

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:17.420
is a pretty good conversion
rate compared to Twitter

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.970
and Facebook, which
were all under 1%.

01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:25.920
So this idea of using LinkedIn
and linking it to a landing

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.765
page where you can track leads
and then follow up on them

01:42:29.765 --> 01:42:30.890
can be very, very valuable.

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:37.070
So we talked about
step one is brand,

01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:39.530
step two is finding
the right people,

01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:44.890
step three is engaging
them, and step four

01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:46.640
is building relationships.

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:50.320
You want to build
relationships with people.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.250
And a big thing in relationship
building in the branding world

01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:58.600
and branding effectiveness is
what we call brand likeability,

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:01.050
building the
brand's personality.

01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:04.360
And whatever the product is, we
write a personality statement

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.907
for the brand as if
it were a person,

01:43:07.907 --> 01:43:10.490
because it makes it easy for all
the different creative people

01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:12.090
that work on it.

01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:14.360
And I always say
brands are like people,

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.810
and people are like brands.

01:43:15.810 --> 01:43:19.740
And they measure a brand's
likeability with a Q Score,

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:23.750
and it measures both products,
in terms of likeability,

01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:24.920
and people.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.250
All the celebrities
have a Q Score.

01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:31.530
And the celebrities
with the highest Q Score

01:43:31.530 --> 01:43:33.670
make more money in
movie contracts.

01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:36.090
They get asked to
endorse things.

01:43:36.090 --> 01:43:39.350
And the likeability,
the Q Score can go down.

01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:44.440
I'm sure Oscar Pistorius'
Q Score is underwater now.

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:49.590
And after the Olympics last
summer, he became very famous

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:53.840
and had received a
number of endorsements.

01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:59.322
So I'm going to test your
ability to judge a Q Score.

01:43:59.322 --> 01:44:01.280
Let's look at a few famous
people, and tell me,

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.013
who has the higher Q Score?

01:44:05.791 --> 01:44:06.708
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:44:06.708 --> 01:44:08.040
CATHERINE KAPUTA: You know what?

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.180
The guys say Angelina.

01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:10.537
But who's got the higher--

01:44:10.537 --> 01:44:11.120
AUDIENCE: Jen,

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.570
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Jen
has the higher Q Score.

01:44:13.570 --> 01:44:15.494
Why is she more likable?

01:44:15.494 --> 01:44:16.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:44:16.410 --> 01:44:16.630
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:44:16.630 --> 01:44:17.370
Less provocative.

01:44:17.370 --> 01:44:17.870
OK.

01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:21.590
So she's more like the
girl next door, right?

01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:22.420
What else about--

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.806
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:44:23.806 --> 01:44:25.680
CATHERINE KAPUTA: She
wasn't the other woman.

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:26.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:30.420
CATHERINE KAPUTA: She's
a sympathetic character.

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:31.840
She lost her guy.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:32.340
She is.

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:33.200
But you know what?

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.730
It's funny,
likeability, we're going

01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:37.590
to get into the factors
of that in a second.

01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:39.170
Anyway, let's look at two guys.

01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:40.800
Who's got the higher Q Score?

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:41.792
AUDIENCE: Tom Hanks.

01:44:41.792 --> 01:44:42.290
AUDIENCE: Tom Hanks.

01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:44.476
CATHERINE KAPUTA: And why
is Tom Hanks more likable?

01:44:44.476 --> 01:44:45.392
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:44:48.150 --> 01:44:49.610
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah.

01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:51.590
And likability's
important for people.

01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:53.920
That's a key thing
as a salesperson.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.640
Likeability and brand
personality are very key.

01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.580
And what are the
factors in likeability

01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.360
from a branding perspective?

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:05.090
You want to be attractive
but not too attractive

01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:06.510
that people hate you.

01:45:11.216 --> 01:45:14.400
You want to be similar
so people feel, gee,

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.580
I can relate to that person.

01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:19.400
That's somebody I can imagine
having a glass of wine with

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.190
or a beer with.

01:45:20.190 --> 01:45:24.980
So the similarity principle
is very powerful for brands.

01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:28.340
The empathy principle, I
think the person feels and can

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:31.520
feel my pain and I
can understand them.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.820
So the empathy
principle is important.

01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:36.060
And also the
familiarity principle,

01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:38.440
I'm aware who this person is.

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:41.230
People like things that are
more familiar, it turns out.

01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:42.760
So that's one of
the reasons why you

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.620
want to build your
profile as well.

01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:50.540
And Hanks seems very authentic.

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:53.148
You like the guy.

01:45:53.148 --> 01:45:53.740
All right.

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:59.300
So in building relationships,
you want to always be clicking.

01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:02.750
Social scientists call
sales people and others

01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:07.500
that establish rapport quickly
with somebody clickers.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:10.320
They have this ability
to find connection.

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:14.160
And it the big secret
of clickers are they

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.950
find similarity.

01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:19.110
They find mutual
interests or something

01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:22.114
in common with the other person.

01:46:22.114 --> 01:46:24.030
Super sellers-- there's
been a lot of research

01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:27.520
on this-- in a meeting
with prospects,

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.640
they get on the same
wavelength as the prospect,

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:33.235
and it's almost like
they're in sync.

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.310
In some of the tests, they think
at the same breathing patterns.

01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:44.830
Whether it's consciously
or unconsciously,

01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:48.980
they mimic the gestures
even of the prospect,

01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:51.930
and they sort of get in
a mind meld with them.

01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:54.920
And LinkedIn provides
you with a lot

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:58.050
of information about
clients and prospects

01:46:58.050 --> 01:47:00.720
to build on this whole
bond of similarity.

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.680
Because similarity is
how people connect,

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.370
and it really contributes to
this whole likeability factor

01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:10.090
that we were talking about.

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:13.640
And LinkedIn also tells you a
lot of ways you're connected,

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:16.950
similar skills that
you have with somebody,

01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:20.142
similar people that you
know in common, groups.

01:47:20.142 --> 01:47:22.100
And then they have this
on the right-hand panel

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:23.270
when you get to anyone.

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:27.050
So you could also mine
somebody's profile

01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:30.510
for detailed
information, but also

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:33.560
they graphically show
you a lot of ideas.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.570
You always want to
be connecting dots.

01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:39.180
And I think that LinkedIn
provides a lot of information

01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:42.700
of how to connect the dots,
of how people are connected

01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:45.570
to other people, what
their interests are,

01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:48.460
what their groups are, a
lot of things like that that

01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:51.300
can be very useful in
terms of your pitch,

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.340
whether it's in
person or online.

01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:56.900
This is a point that
Reid Hoffman made,

01:47:56.900 --> 01:48:02.100
the CEO of LinkedIn his
book, "The Startup of You"

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:05.080
is this whole idea of giving
little gifts-- we're not

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.490
talking "gifts" in quotes
here-- sending an article,

01:48:08.490 --> 01:48:11.810
offering advice,
making an introduction,

01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:15.940
writing a rec on LinkedIn,
offering to critique something.

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:18.150
And there's a lot
of studies that

01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:22.780
show that if you do at
least two of these gifts

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.920
before you make a sales pitch,
you'll be much more successful.

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.610
One seller started
out with 300 leads,

01:48:29.610 --> 01:48:32.490
did this gifting
strategy, and then

01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:36.120
reached out to introduce
yourself and link

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:38.640
and got a 65% return
rate, so now they're

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:39.950
on a first-level basis.

01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:43.020
So it's an interesting
way to sort of build

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.347
that initial relationship.

01:48:44.347 --> 01:48:45.680
I think we have a question here.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:45.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.525
Just coming back to your
last slide for a minute,

01:48:47.525 --> 01:48:49.630
it just prompted me to
think about something,

01:48:49.630 --> 01:48:51.650
or another slide back.

01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:56.250
In the selling
world, a lot of us

01:48:56.250 --> 01:48:58.780
have accounts that are
direct competitors.

01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:00.050
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:02.950
AUDIENCE: What's any advice
you have on that, as far as

01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:06.890
how you deal with-- It's
like dating multiple people.

01:49:06.890 --> 01:49:07.890
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:09.265
AUDIENCE: It can
be a lot of work

01:49:09.265 --> 01:49:11.210
when you're trying to
put an article out there

01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:13.530
to get one person thinking.

01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:17.790
But it might be what their
direct competitor's doing.

01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:18.790
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:21.155
Well, this is going to be
a problem in the business

01:49:21.155 --> 01:49:21.780
that you're in.

01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.440
And I think that
what you have to do

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.060
is come up with a communication
strategy-- what your brand is,

01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:30.200
what you want to stand
for, the kind of articles

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.250
and things you're going to
put out there-- and realize it

01:49:33.250 --> 01:49:36.788
doesn't matter if your
competitor sees them too.

01:49:36.788 --> 01:49:37.704
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:49:42.105 --> 01:49:42.980
CATHERINE KAPUTA: OK.

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:43.880
Oh, I see.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:46.140
I see.

01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.270
OK.

01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:49.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:53.200
And I'm thinking of it less
from the content I share.

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.280
I can figure that out
as far as, hey, this

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.730
is an interesting
article for either,

01:49:59.730 --> 01:50:02.270
whether it's one of them
doing something well

01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:04.630
or one of them doing
something poorly, or whatever.

01:50:04.630 --> 01:50:06.510
But more like
managing connections,

01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:09.087
like to Tom's points
earlier about Microsoft

01:50:09.087 --> 01:50:11.670
being a competitor of ours, now
I'm talking more to the people

01:50:11.670 --> 01:50:14.560
that I'm trying to engage
with and connect with.

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.700
I don't necessarily
want CIO at Staples

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.930
to also know that I'm having
active conversations with CMO

01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:29.170
at Office Depot or somebody
at Walmart or somebody else.

01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:32.220
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Yeah,
but you can on Settings

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:37.460
disable letting people
know certain things,

01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:41.670
if you want, like
connections that you make.

01:50:41.670 --> 01:50:45.815
You can eliminate some of
that from the Notifications.

01:50:45.815 --> 01:50:46.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:47.981
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
So you can do that.

01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:52.960
I don't know what else--
any other ideas here?

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.940
AUDIENCE: Well,
because many of them

01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:12.270
are insanely sensitive
to each other

01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:15.760
and what the other one's
doing or not doing.

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.930
It's like everybody's scared
of-- so Lowe's and Walmart,

01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:20.995
not direct competitors,
but they kind of

01:51:20.995 --> 01:51:22.620
are watching what
each other are doing.

01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:28.080
And I don't go out and
advertise that I'm actively

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:29.710
working with both of them.

01:51:29.710 --> 01:51:30.626
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:51:43.921 --> 01:51:45.670
AUDIENCE: It can work
both ways, I'm sure.

01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:46.660
CATHERINE KAPUTA: It
can work both ways.

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.951
I'm just thinking too, when
I was a client perspective,

01:51:48.951 --> 01:51:52.865
there were a lot of people--
ad agencies, for example,

01:51:52.865 --> 01:51:54.240
can't have a
competitive account.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.220
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:57.510
CATHERINE KAPUTA: So if
you're in an ad agency,

01:51:57.510 --> 01:52:00.160
they're not going to handle
any of my competitors.

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.540
But there were other supplies
we dealt with, obviously,

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:06.920
that are meeting with-- but
I think it's changing a lot,

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:11.270
because I think historically
a lot of executives--

01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:15.140
and I would never mention
it in a meeting, obviously.

01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:16.600
You've got to downplay it.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:19.020
But I don't think you can
worry about it too much.

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.584
You can eliminate certain
things from your Settings.

01:52:22.584 --> 01:52:24.334
AUDIENCE: It just
becomes a full-time job.

01:52:24.334 --> 01:52:25.961
It's like Facebook, right?

01:52:25.961 --> 01:52:26.960
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:29.440
AUDIENCE: You can say, oh, you
can go put friends in groups--

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.260
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:30.920
Right.

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:31.836
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:41.620
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:45.360
Right

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:47.640
AUDIENCE: --the idea of brand.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:52.150
Because if your brand is such
that you are really an ultra

01:52:52.150 --> 01:52:54.060
connector and you're
using this as a tool

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:56.970
and it's really--
because if you only

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:59.370
have a couple of connections
and they're competitors

01:52:59.370 --> 01:53:00.970
with each other,
that feel sensitive,

01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:05.230
like you're choosing those two
companies, versus if you're

01:53:05.230 --> 01:53:09.280
really active in a very
specific way where it's

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:12.610
your brand, whether it's the
maverick or the other things.

01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:15.440
I think that can lend itself
so that when someone sees it

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:17.470
and they see that, oh,
he's connecting there too

01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:19.310
or he's in this group
that they're in,

01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:22.260
then it feels more authentic,
like, hey, look, this is me.

01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:23.710
I do this socially.

01:53:23.710 --> 01:53:27.540
You need to make it so that
that is your brand so that it

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:30.050
doesn't feel like you're
sharing secrets across.

01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:33.210
It's more I share all
this stuff publicly.

01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:36.120
For me, I want to try to
get this where it is public

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.530
that I-- if you want to
see that I'm connecting

01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:40.790
with new people, great, see it.

01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:42.400
Know that the
information is public.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.816
Because the other thing is
that even if you change privacy

01:53:44.816 --> 01:53:47.560
settings, we all know that
privacy settings change really

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.060
frequently.

01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:50.450
So if you put
information out there,

01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:54.050
know that it is in the public
domain the moment it gets out.

01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:55.050
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

01:53:55.050 --> 01:53:56.800
I think it's a
whole new world now,

01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:59.320
and I think this is
part of doing business

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.320
in the modern world.

01:54:04.590 --> 01:54:06.400
You've already got
Google brand behind you.

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:07.860
That's very, very powerful.

01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:10.050
You want to build a strong
enough brand that they

01:54:10.050 --> 01:54:12.660
want to work with
you and they feel

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.520
that they're getting
the attention from you,

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:17.900
that they're getting your
smarts and your unique selling

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:21.716
proposition, however
you've defined that.

01:54:21.716 --> 01:54:23.590
And I think that's what
it's all about today.

01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:26.540
Because I think people want
to work with the best talent

01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:30.650
that they feel comfortable
with, that they feel they get

01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:33.790
outstanding service
from, et cetera.

01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:34.670
Any other thoughts?

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:44.800
Has anyone had an experience or
have you had an experience with

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.096
a client saying, I don't like
that you're-- how do you handle

01:54:48.096 --> 01:54:48.870
that?

01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:50.536
AUDIENCE: What I was
going to go back to

01:54:50.536 --> 01:54:54.730
is at a higher level separating
you are your persona at Google,

01:54:54.730 --> 01:54:57.340
and then you're
outside of Google.

01:54:57.340 --> 01:55:00.950
We're trained, there's
a lot of things

01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:04.230
that we know that are
internal to our company.

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:06.190
So you also have to be
very careful with when

01:55:06.190 --> 01:55:09.600
you go posting stuff and what
you're putting out there,

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.450
it's outside of the company.

01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:14.580
And I think that maybe there
hasn't been enough thought

01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:17.610
given to the internal
versus the external

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.070
and then how you
bridge that gap.

01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:20.940
And I've struggled
with that too.

01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.990
Because just like if you
have two competitors, how

01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:26.290
do you share information
in the right way,

01:55:26.290 --> 01:55:28.410
you can also share
too much out there,

01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:30.050
and you can have challenges.

01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:32.650
So you just have to give it a
lot of thought and make sure

01:55:32.650 --> 01:55:33.790
that it's--

01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:35.165
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Can you give us

01:55:35.165 --> 01:55:38.080
an example of the decision
making in what you shared?

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:45.190
AUDIENCE: When I was dealing
with GE in a past life,

01:55:45.190 --> 01:55:48.430
GE is ultra worried
about any information

01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:49.990
about them being shared.

01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:52.430
And we were talking to
Beth Comstock, the lady who

01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:55.080
you had up there, the
CMO of General Electric,

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:59.460
and she came back-- she's
very much into social media--

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:01.140
to one of my colleagues.

01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:04.220
She said that's actually
an internal GE thing.

01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:07.000
We don't want that spoken
about in the social.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.940
And she called LinkedIn
and had it taken down.

01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:14.052
So it was a big deal, and our
team got chastised for it.

01:56:14.052 --> 01:56:15.510
So you do need to
be a little bit--

01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:16.400
CATHERINE KAPUTA: You
need to be very careful

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:18.140
with clients about
things like that.

01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:19.050
What can we say?

01:56:19.050 --> 01:56:20.680
Make sure they've
seen it before.

01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.420
Hey, I'm going to post this,
and are you comfortable with it?

01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:27.339
Because a lot of cultures
are like a GE culture.

01:56:27.339 --> 01:56:29.630
It's more traditional, and
they're very, very concerned

01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:31.420
about proprietary information.

01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:36.220
But part of your job is we value
that your information's private

01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:40.300
and the trust, the
trusted adviser.

01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.420
AUDIENCE: One of the
questions I have is just

01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:43.250
taking a step back.

01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:45.416
So I understand the importance
of getting your brand

01:56:45.416 --> 01:56:46.047
out there.

01:56:46.047 --> 01:56:47.630
Also, the two years
before I was here,

01:56:47.630 --> 01:56:49.129
I was doing social
media management.

01:56:49.129 --> 01:56:51.750
And we went from 300 likes to
3 million likes on Facebook,

01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:52.590
right?

01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:54.680
And my boss was
always, OK, great.

01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:55.930
How is this making us money?

01:56:55.930 --> 01:56:57.140
How is this
translating into sales?

01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:58.730
I'm like, but we
have so many likes.

01:56:58.730 --> 01:57:02.597
The question is, what sort of--

01:57:02.597 --> 01:57:04.930
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Well, that's
why I was showing the IBM

01:57:04.930 --> 01:57:06.380
story with the tracking page.

01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:08.850
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:12.850
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
Social media is so new

01:57:12.850 --> 01:57:16.214
that a key measurement is
this whole idea of engagement.

01:57:16.214 --> 01:57:17.630
And how do you
measure engagement?

01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:23.430
And it's a thorny problem
in the whole branding world.

01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:24.530
How do you measure that?

01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:26.850
But the big thing that
people are trying to do now

01:57:26.850 --> 01:57:29.710
is link it with a
landing page so they

01:57:29.710 --> 01:57:33.480
can track new leads, what
kind of communications

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:35.990
they're giving to
that potential lead,

01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:38.790
and then tracking conversion
that it became a client.

01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:41.550
Now then there's the
question of existing clients.

01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:45.080
Again, it's this whole idea if
you believe the whole branding

01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:50.120
bible that you want to have
meaningful touchpoints,

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:54.220
and you want to have
consistent, ongoing touchpoints.

01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:56.550
And there's a lot of
reasons advertisers

01:57:56.550 --> 01:58:00.090
feel this is valuable, so that
everything you communicate

01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:06.590
to the client is on-brand and
on-strategy and consistent

01:58:06.590 --> 01:58:09.190
and that it's ongoing, that
you keep the relation--

01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:12.930
and it's a way of augmenting
the personal relationship,

01:58:12.930 --> 01:58:16.890
how many times you call
the client or prospect.

01:58:16.890 --> 01:58:19.030
But the thing that
they're trying to do

01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:20.580
is this whole tracking.

01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.180
It's a new area.

01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:25.620
And that's where they're trying
to get leads to a landing page,

01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:28.030
so then you contract conversion
and things like that.

01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:30.580
So that's how
you're making money.

01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:39.660
And I guess as I say, it's a
whole new area of branding.

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.330
So it's this whole
thing of what are

01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:44.410
the other ways we can
measure the effectiveness?

01:58:44.410 --> 01:58:49.109
So it's in
development right now.

01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:55.570
AUDIENCE: I don't know
how to speak into these.

01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:56.364
OK.

01:58:56.364 --> 01:58:58.640
CATHERINE KAPUTA:
That's working.

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.440
AUDIENCE: I think
that also goes back

01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:05.910
to what Ketan was saying
with campaigning and emails.

01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:09.360
Once we've done all of this
and we've established ourselves

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:12.130
on LinkedIn, whether
or not Erin thinks

01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:18.900
we have credible profiles,
but as long as prospects do,

01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:21.840
Kira and I found that
we could use InMails

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:24.560
as a way to establish
the relationship

01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:29.355
and set up a meeting and kind of
nurture that and go from there.

01:59:29.355 --> 01:59:31.670
I don't want to say too much.

01:59:31.670 --> 01:59:35.020
We're doing a presentation on
it to a few people in this room,

01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:38.684
so I don't want to
speak too much on it.

01:59:38.684 --> 01:59:41.100
CATHERINE KAPUTA: How were you
tracking the effectiveness?

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:47.360
Can you not destroy
your presentation

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:49.814
but give us some insight?

01:59:49.814 --> 01:59:51.480
AUDIENCE: Well, of
course we're tracking

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:54.170
response rates and
the amount of meetings

01:59:54.170 --> 01:59:57.610
that we set from the
outreach that we do

01:59:57.610 --> 02:00:00.790
and then also tracking
how the connections change

02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:04.180
from third-degree
to then first-degree

02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:07.360
after sending one InMail.

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:11.420
And also it's been successful
connecting with people

02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:14.530
that we've talked to in
the past, other prospects,

02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:15.960
going out, connecting
with those,

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.490
and then seeing-- many of us
work within regions, right?

02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:22.910
So if you're connected with
this many CIOs in your region,

02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:26.800
it makes it easier to
send an InMail to a CIO

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:30.400
also in that region who perhaps
is connected to those two

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.940
you're already connected with.

02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:34.780
So just kind of increasing
your credibility

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:36.822
through the connections
that you have has helped.

02:00:36.822 --> 02:00:37.821
CATHERINE KAPUTA: Right.

02:00:37.821 --> 02:00:38.341
Right.

02:00:38.341 --> 02:00:38.840
Yeah.

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:41.040
And this also
gives you a vehicle

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:44.800
for ongoing communication.

02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:46.260
So that's what
really starts making

02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:51.330
a difference-- we talked
about being on-trend.

02:00:51.330 --> 02:00:53.580
We talked about being
up-to-date-- figuring out

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.790
what's of interest and
periodically sending things

02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:57.960
so that there's these
touches going on.

02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:01.240
When you think of brands
that you do business with,

02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:02.800
they'll send follow-up emails.

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.734
Then you'll get
something after that.

02:01:04.734 --> 02:01:06.400
Thought you might be
interested in this.

02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.210
So you want to do
a similar thing.

02:01:08.210 --> 02:01:13.910
That's what eventually works
and keeps a relationship,

02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:16.954
augments the kind of personal
touch that you can give.

02:01:19.670 --> 02:01:20.170
All right.

02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:22.582
So we were giving
the little gifts.

02:01:22.582 --> 02:01:24.790
I know you're going to have
a presentation after this

02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:28.340
on story, but you always
want to be telling stories.

02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:32.170
Stories are sticky and
disguise the sales message.

02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:37.290
And this is a whole big
message of branding.

02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:40.140
You rarely see a commercial
that talks about really

02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:44.040
what the product is and analyzes
it in any kind of rational way.

02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.110
Really they wrap the
brands in stories.

02:01:47.110 --> 02:01:49.890
They tell stories that
people connect with.

02:01:49.890 --> 02:01:53.250
And you want to use stories
to tell about here's

02:01:53.250 --> 02:01:55.340
a project that we
had from a client.

02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:57.570
Here was the challenge.

02:01:57.570 --> 02:01:58.630
And then tell a story.

02:01:58.630 --> 02:02:02.120
And the best stories are
stories you can film.

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:05.230
You want to bring to life
so that people can imagine

02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:09.390
they were there and the
challenges, the obstacles.

02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:12.660
There's a lot of
different story formats.

02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:15.580
The story format that I used
when I was telling that Barbara

02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:18.580
Corcoran story in the beginning,
I could have just made

02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:22.590
one slide and said here
are seven principles

02:02:22.590 --> 02:02:24.830
that Barbara Corcoran displayed.

02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:28.270
But no, I told the story
about her boyfriend

02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:30.690
left her and this and
that and the other thing

02:02:30.690 --> 02:02:34.320
and she wrote "The Corcoran
Report" and the Donald Trump

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:35.640
thing.

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.210
You want to build
it so people get

02:02:37.210 --> 02:02:41.370
a sense of the different phases,
the struggle, the obstacles

02:02:41.370 --> 02:02:43.631
and then how you solved
the problem at the end.

02:02:43.631 --> 02:02:45.880
So you want to sort of bring
that whole thing to life.

02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:50.840
And LinkedIn gives you a lot
of avenues with the updates,

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:52.910
so anybody can post an update.

02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:54.750
You can do it in Groups.

02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:58.170
You can make it anonymous,
a technology client

02:02:58.170 --> 02:03:01.930
or a retail client, so not
mention a specific name,

02:03:01.930 --> 02:03:02.640
if you want.

02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:06.870
But tell a story that's related
to problems they're probably

02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:12.070
facing and how it was solved
it how it was successful.

02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:13.880
You always want to
be asking questions.

02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.240
Questions are a very powerful
thing in advertising.

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:22.840
Because statements are
passive, but a question

02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:24.470
begs involvement.

02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:27.050
Ronald Reagan famously
asked the question

02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:30.220
are you better off today
than you were four years ago.

02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:35.760
Most people couldn't say
yes, and he got elected.

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.730
Questions can be
very provocative,

02:03:37.730 --> 02:03:41.810
because it gets people thinking,
just like the story gets people

02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:45.390
thinking about the story
and gets people all involved

02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:47.420
in the story.

02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:48.960
Questions get people involved.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:53.250
When you just make
statements, we did this,

02:03:53.250 --> 02:03:57.310
it doesn't really retain
in the memory the same way.

02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:59.820
You always want to
be tracking contacts.

02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:00.991
And LinkedIn has a tool.

02:04:00.991 --> 02:04:02.990
I don't know if a lot of
people know about this,

02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:06.260
but you can track
relationships or you

02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:10.640
can make notes,
reminders, how you met.

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:13.000
You can tag them, put
different tags on people.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.030
So you can go to
LinkedIn and bring up

02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:16.910
all the people
with a similar tag.

02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:21.540
Or you can transfer
your first-degree names

02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:26.440
to a CRM system that you use
and like better to manage them.

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:29.960
But you want to be tracking
all these contacts.

02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.870
And as I mentioned
earlier, branders

02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:38.030
think of increasing
touchpoints, online, offline.

02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:42.120
You want to leverage
your status updates.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.470
We talked about repurposing.

02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:47.070
You can make it public
plus Twitter, so anything

02:04:47.070 --> 02:04:49.620
you update that it goes out
to the public plus Twitter

02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:51.130
automatically.

02:04:51.130 --> 02:04:56.260
You can also tag your
updates in the body of it,

02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:59.350
@company or @user, user,
and it'll automatically

02:04:59.350 --> 02:05:00.480
go to them as well.

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:02.880
If you have certain
clients or prospects

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:05.540
that you have permission
to use their name,

02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:10.510
it's an easy way to keep
that touch going on.

02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:12.900
And I think it's important
to-- how can you do all this

02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:14.390
and keep your day job too?

02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:17.820
So you always want
to be automating.

02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:20.620
I see LinkedIn as the
center because there's

02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:23.140
280 million members and growing.

02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:26.010
It's the business site.

02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:28.670
But leverage all
these other vehicles

02:05:28.670 --> 02:05:30.290
that you have as well too.

02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:34.520
G+ is good for Circles and
people that share similar

02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:36.130
passions and interests.

02:05:36.130 --> 02:05:41.920
Twitter I see as like a PR
thing, very short sentences.

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:45.000
You can link, as you know,
to other longer articles.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.610
But it's a very
quick form of PR.

02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:49.340
YouTube, videos.

02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:51.000
Videos are very powerful.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.370
Facebook, Pinterest
is about pinning.

02:05:54.370 --> 02:05:58.370
I have a business where
it's not so visible.

02:05:58.370 --> 02:06:00.950
But I have certain
slogans that I use.

02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:03.430
If you don't brand
yourself, other people will.

02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:06.785
But I put with an interesting
visual and put it on Pinterest.

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.572
So you always want to be
moving the brand forward.

02:06:12.572 --> 02:06:13.530
You want to be current.

02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:15.250
You want to be meaningful.

02:06:15.250 --> 02:06:17.980
Multimedia, figure out the
different media you can use.

02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:21.220
Consistent, ongoing,
and this whole idea

02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:24.940
of having an
emotional connection.

02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:27.550
And my final thought is you
always want to be visible.

02:06:27.550 --> 02:06:30.210
Branding is always about
building visibility.

02:06:30.210 --> 02:06:33.750
Social selling is about
building visibility, finding

02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:36.740
the right people,
connecting with them,

02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:38.410
building relationships.

02:06:38.410 --> 02:06:41.160
And just like we talked about
there's a beauty premium,

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:44.160
there's a visibility
premium, both for products

02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:45.490
and for people.

02:06:45.490 --> 02:06:48.440
And people who are
visible, research

02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:51.340
shows people think
they're better than people

02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:53.300
who aren't that visible
in the industry.

02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:56.840
And LinkedIn gives you a
vehicle for building visibility

02:06:56.840 --> 02:07:01.080
and building connections with
your clients and prospects.

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.100
So I just threw this in.

02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:06.520
This is a client's
story of, again,

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:12.610
branching out into areas
outside the IT department

02:07:12.610 --> 02:07:16.030
for building business
and companies.

02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:18.390
So the whole idea was
finding business leaders

02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:23.010
outside IT, interacting,
delivering, and again,

02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:25.710
this two-gift idea
or three-gift idea,

02:07:25.710 --> 02:07:27.760
sending some
interesting articles,

02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:29.590
sending some interesting
things that they

02:07:29.590 --> 02:07:32.238
thought they would
be interested in.
