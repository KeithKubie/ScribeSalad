00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.149
James Joyce is one of the most revered writers in the English language and a central figure in the history of the novel

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.979
he is still hugely important to us because of his devotion to some crucial themes the idea of the grandeur of

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.819
Ordinary Life his determination to portray what actually goes on through our heads moment by moment

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.008
what we now know partly thanks to him as the stream of consciousness and

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.430
His determination to capture on the page. What language really sounds like in our own minds

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.979
Born in 1882 James Joyce Spent the first 20 [years] of his [life] in and around

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.879
Dublin and the rest wandering in and between the European cities of trieste Zurich and Paris in

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.689
Three decades he published two books of poetry one collection of short stories one play and three novels

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.070
All of them different in scope and scale, but sharing one thing in common

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.949
Dublin a city he loved and hated

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.699
Each of my books he once explained to a friend is a book about Dublin Dublin is a city of scarcely

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.299
300,000 but it has become the universal [city] in my work at the end of the nineteenth century

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.969
Dublin was the second city of the British Empire

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.309
Like his father Joyce was fiercely opposed to Ireland's status as a british colony and supported the cause of Irish independence

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.789
Joyce was educated by the Jesuits [and] early on at school began to reveal his knack for foreign languages

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.549
By the time he arrived at University college Dublin

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.850
Joyce was writing book reviews poems and short stories

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.979
But he also needed to find a career. He tried medical school in Paris, but spent more time in brothels and bars than the library

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.040
In 1904 he met a young woman from Galway named, Nora barnacle who was uneducated

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.629
But highly erotic and compelling [to] Joyce when she first saw him

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.190
She thought he [was] a nordic Seaman with electric blue eyes a yachting cap and plimsolls, but when he spoke well

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.400
Then I knew him at once for just another word Phylis Dublin boaster trying to chat up a country girl

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.429
But Nora fell in love with him nevertheless and remained devoted through all their difficult years of life together

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.219
After a few months [noir] agreed to follow Joyce to Europe for a self-imposed exile

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.810
free from the morality of the Catholic church and the subjugation of the British Empire

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.260
They eventually landed in trieste an austro-Hungarian port town where they would spend the next [10] years

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.239
raising two [children] both of them given Italian names Lucia and Giorgio

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.739
Joyce eked out a meager existence as a language teacher at the Berlitz school and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.730
translating Irish writers like Yeats and Oscar wilde into Italian

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.680
1914 turned out to be Joyce's year of breakthrough when a publisher in London finally decided to bring out his book of short stories

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.510
Dubliners which had been rejected 22 times and the American poet Ezra pound arranged to get his novel a portrait of the artist

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.439
[serialized] this was followed by the serialization of

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.570
Ulysses in 1918 the novel which made Joyce's name around the world

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.130
For the next 23 years Joyce's reputation grew and he took his experiments with language and literary form ever further

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.440
Until his unexpected and sudden death in zurich in 1941. He was buried in Fronton Cemetery just near Zurich smen [Zoo]

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.589
Joyce's Principal work ulysses is named after the most dramatic adventure story the ancient Greeks handed down to western Civilization

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.289
It is seen as a pinnacle of high culture and tells the story of the long wanderings of the hero

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.089
Ulysses on his journey back [from] the siege of Troy death occur his home

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.329
But the major character of Joyce's novel is not a warrior King or a grand hero

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.279
He is instead a very flawed quite Kindly and quite foolish man

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.929
Named leopold bloom he works as a minor player in the advertising industry

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.660
He's married, but his wife is having an affair

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.180
He's been sacked from a string of jobs

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.979
And he's very much given to daydreaming about all the things he would love to go right in his life

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.169
But which we know won't happen he farts he likes looking at women in the street

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.549
He dreams of winning competitions in weekly magazines and of owning a cottage by the sea

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.450
Being Jewish he's a bit of an outsider in Catholic Dublin

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.559
And there are various little humiliations which he has to put [up] with all the time

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.759
[bloom] is very unlike a traditional hero, but he is representative of our average unimpressive

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.169
Fragile but still rather likable everyday selves

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.309
Joyce Lavishes attention on Leopold bloom he treats him as deeply worthy of respect and immense interest

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.479
He someone joyce suggests that we should learn [from] and try in certain ways to be [liked] just as in the ancient world

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.459
Ulysses was held up as an inspiring model of resourceful and brave conduct

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.929
We follow bloom for a whole day as he wanders around Dublin. We see him having lunch buying a supper drinking coffee and cocoa

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.679
He worries about his relationship with his wife and daughter. He goes to work he listens to someone singing he has various conversations

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:32.590
Joyce is saying that the apparently little things that happen in daily life eating feeling sorry for someone feeling sorry for oneself

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.849
Putting the washing on the clothes line these aren't really little things at all if we look at them through the right lens

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.419
they are revealed as beautiful serious deep and

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.909
Fascinating our own lives are just as interesting as those of the traditional heroes

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.420
It's just with less good at appreciating them the helpful lens is supplied initially by Joyce's novel

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.409
But ideally we should internalize it and make it our own. We should accept ourselves as minor

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.020
legitimate heroes of our own

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.660
dignified lives

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.839
Traditionally novels like most films today show us people speaking in well-formulated

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.120
clear and relevant sentences

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.269
And we tend to suppose without really thinking about it that this is a fair reflection of their inner life

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.540
They speak thoughts and feelings that they have but this isn't Joyce's way at all

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.549
Joyce takes us into our minds and tries to show us. What thinking actually?

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:44.100
Sounds like at one point in ulysses leopold muses on the cycle of life while he's watching the tram cars and people in the street

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.730
This is [what] it sounds like through Joyce's microphone

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.280
trams past one another [in] going out going clanging clanging useless words

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.459
Things go on the same day after day squads of police marching out back trams in out

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.150
Those two loonies mooching about Dignam carted off

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:10.799
Minor purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her one born every second somewhere other

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.300
Dying every second since I fed the birds five minutes

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:23.220
300 kicked the bucket other 300 born washing the blood off all I washed in the blood of the [lamb] bawling [man]

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.000
It's a strange and yet actually perhaps rather familiar muddle of high and low concerns

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.570
Bloom is thinking about birth and death and the random shortness of life and the idea of religion

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:43.139
but he's also thinking about how he fed some birds the ordinary rhythms of Daily life the noisy trams and

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.519
the fundamental oddity of language in which sounds we make with our mouths

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:55.349
Stand for things in the world if we could slice the top of people's heads and get a view into the diverse thoughts that

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:57.479
Circulate and cut across one another

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.779
Contradicting and confusing we have a much more

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:06.089
[accurate] picture of our fellow humans and one radically at odds with the image

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.090
We typically have that people are

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.760
psychological monoliths with clear definite and fixed views who are very certain what they believe [and] care about

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.919
Joyce like other Modernists describers of stream of consciousness thoughts and feelings is

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.039
Suggesting that if we knew more [about] what others in ourselves

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.139
Really thought and felt. We'd have a clearer sense of what it means to be human

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:34.199
And we'd perhaps also be slower to Anger quicker to forgive we'd love more and hate less

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:40.619
We'd be more curious about the apparently strange by ways of our own and others minds

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.579
the more Joyce went beneath the surface of our

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:53.419
Utterances to reveal the cacophony of our minds the more he felt the need [to] twist and remould language itself

00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:00.020
To capture how he sound to [ourselves] in his last and truly puzzling novel Finnegan's wake

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.060
Joyce decided to create his own [version] of English a tower of babel

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.989
He called it by mixing together bits and pieces of more than 40 languages

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.980
Sometimes the words on the page look entirely foreign, but if you sound them out you can often find the sense here

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:22.010
We are again means what it says. It's just that the words are jammed together to reflect the speed of the mind in action

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.270
Joyce went in for many

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.489
Portmanteau words two more words stuck together to create a new one [a]

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:34.939
fun for all is a fun funeral or a fun for all a bisects cycle is a

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.880
bisexual or a bicycle for sex

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:46.250
Joyce twisted prestigious names so shakespeare became shake his beard and Denty alligator was Dante alighieri

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.249
The plot insofar as there is one in Finnegan's wake is about a man called Tim

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:58.159
Finnegan who falls from a ladder dies and comes back to life when someone spills whiskey on his face during the wake

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:05.479
It's intended as a universal story about the fall of mankind and the character of Tim Finnegan is also meant to be simultaneously

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:12.920
Adam, Noah Richard the third Napoleon and the Irish nationalists Charles Parnell there is indeed a plot in this book

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.139
it's just not one joyce explained sarcastically that can be rendered sensible by the use of

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:25.939
Wide-awake language cut and dry grammar and go ahead plot in attempting to be completely faithful to real life in all its true

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.859
Confusion and complexity Joyce ended up writing a book that is fascinating Lee

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.349
instructively unreadable the fourth sentence of the first chapter runs like this

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:43.970
Rot a peg of pars malt had gem or [shen] brewed by arclight and Rory end to the [regan] brow was to be seen ring

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.930
'some on the Aqua face

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:52.400
It's a reminder of how [much] fiction when it seemed logical and understandable is always necessarily a drastic

00:10:52.740 --> 00:11:00.240
[foreshortening] of what is actually going on in the world and the minds of characters Joy's pushed one possibility of the realistic novel as

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:07.980
Far as it could [possibly] go into a realm as mysterious haunting and perplexing as the dreams of a stranger

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.189
Joy Spent the greater part of his life writing. What was he hoping to achieve through his art

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.989
What is art for in his novel the portrait of the [artist] as a young man?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.220
Joyce Gets his spokesman Stephen to have a go at spelling out an answer

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:29.639
He follows a surprisingly traditional route using two terms from the medieval Philosopher, Sim, Thomas aquinas

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:37.799
But the first is integra toss this means that an artist is [someone] who attempts to grasp with unusual vigor the true

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.299
integrity and identity of what is being studied it might be a tree a

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:49.109
Moment of history or the life of a fictional character in 20th Century Dublin, we don't normally do this

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:56.459
We don't really concentrate on what a person [is] saying or doing or what objects around us really are and look like

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:04.380
we don't normally isolate and study carefully art [has] the job of doing this for [us] and teaching us to do so

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.620
habitually

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.320
the second step for an artist in Joyce's view is to bring clarity or

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:17.550
Clarity to things which means shining the light of reason [into] [the] murkier parts of experience and life

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:26.070
The Paradox is that Joyce did just this but it is attempt to be utterly clear about what being human is actually like?

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.800
He created works which are in places. Uh Turley baffling to a reader in a hurry that

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.800
Shouldn't surprise us too long though artist Joyce sees it should be a corrective to unnatural

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.340
but dangerous blindness and inattention to

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:46.139
cliche an over Rapid summary if art sometimes puzzles us

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.199
We know says joyce that it's doing its job properly. It's really killing us to the mysteries

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.629
We have to quickly grown blind to

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.680
you
