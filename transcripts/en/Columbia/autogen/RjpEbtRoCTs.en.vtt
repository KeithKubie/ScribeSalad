years ago I'm one with the conservative

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.390
years ago I'm one with the conservative
 

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.460
years ago I'm one with the conservative
dates but all of this okay what but the

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:29.470
dates but all of this okay what but the
 

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:47.950
dates but all of this okay what but the
next slide would be it would be a a map

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960
 

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.570
I'm scared they're left and that's

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:49.580
I'm scared they're left and that's
 

00:29:49.580 --> 00:30:01.300
I'm scared they're left and that's
Australia between presentation we've got

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:01.310
Australia between presentation we've got
 

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:12.060
Australia between presentation we've got
a recent items as well

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:12.070
 

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:35.299
No

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:35.309
 

00:30:35.309 --> 00:30:37.369
you happy today I would point out that

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:37.379
you happy today I would point out that
 

00:30:37.379 --> 00:30:38.690
you happy today I would point out that
you called everyone in this room

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700
you called everyone in this room
 

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.509
you called everyone in this room
basically civilization a retarded all

00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519
basically civilization a retarded all
 

00:30:41.519 --> 00:30:43.100
basically civilization a retarded all
the Europeans all the Middle Easterners

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.110
the Europeans all the Middle Easterners
 

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.259
the Europeans all the Middle Easterners
anyone who is in terms of American he

00:30:45.259 --> 00:30:45.269
anyone who is in terms of American he
 

00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:48.409
anyone who is in terms of American he
basically said it's low civilization I

00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419
basically said it's low civilization I
 

00:30:48.419 --> 00:30:49.519
basically said it's low civilization I
think it takes a lot of guts

00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:49.529
think it takes a lot of guts
 

00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:51.619
think it takes a lot of guts
but then that implies that civilization

00:30:51.619 --> 00:30:51.629
but then that implies that civilization
 

00:30:51.629 --> 00:30:54.019
but then that implies that civilization
was good yeah that advice so it feels

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:54.029
was good yeah that advice so it feels
 

00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:55.549
was good yeah that advice so it feels
good but if we assume that then we're

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559
good but if we assume that then we're
 

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:57.259
good but if we assume that then we're
also those they actually slow well I

00:30:57.259 --> 00:30:57.269
also those they actually slow well I
 

00:30:57.269 --> 00:31:00.139
also those they actually slow well I
think that's true I think there's lots

00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:00.149
think that's true I think there's lots
 

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:05.269
think that's true I think there's lots
of evidence to support anyway if you

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279
of evidence to support anyway if you
 

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:08.629
of evidence to support anyway if you
look at a map of the world of around

00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639
look at a map of the world of around
 

00:31:08.639 --> 00:31:13.039
look at a map of the world of around
40,000 years ago you are looking at the

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:13.049
40,000 years ago you are looking at the
 

00:31:13.049 --> 00:31:16.489
40,000 years ago you are looking at the
environment that is the ice age or one

00:31:16.489 --> 00:31:16.499
environment that is the ice age or one
 

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:20.649
environment that is the ice age or one
of the ice ages and therefore it has

00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:20.659
of the ice ages and therefore it has
 

00:31:20.659 --> 00:32:13.470
of the ice ages and therefore it has
completely different

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480
 

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.130
all right

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:18.140
 

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.090
this is a very sketchy effort to show

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.100
this is a very sketchy effort to show
 

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:26.950
this is a very sketchy effort to show
what the world looked like when the sea

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960
what the world looked like when the sea
 

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.720
what the world looked like when the sea
level was perhaps 400 feet below where

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:31.730
level was perhaps 400 feet below where
 

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.270
level was perhaps 400 feet below where
it is found and one of the things that

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:34.280
it is found and one of the things that
 

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.330
it is found and one of the things that
is most evident is that Southeast Asia

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:37.340
is most evident is that Southeast Asia
 

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.270
is most evident is that Southeast Asia
was a subcontinent it's often referred

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:40.280
was a subcontinent it's often referred
 

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:46.350
was a subcontinent it's often referred
to as sundaland by geologists and

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360
to as sundaland by geologists and
 

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.560

Australia New Guinea or another

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:49.570
Australia New Guinea or another
 

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.190
Australia New Guinea or another
subcontinent separated by the small

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200
subcontinent separated by the small
 

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.140
subcontinent separated by the small
straight of some sort and that's often

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:56.150
straight of some sort and that's often
 

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.289
straight of some sort and that's often
called suckle and but the reason I'm

00:32:59.289 --> 00:32:59.299
called suckle and but the reason I'm
 

00:32:59.299 --> 00:33:03.490
called suckle and but the reason I'm
showing this is because if you if you

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:03.500
showing this is because if you if you
 

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.799
showing this is because if you if you
look at East Africa you see that's the

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:08.809
look at East Africa you see that's the
 

00:33:08.809 --> 00:33:10.450
look at East Africa you see that's the
red sea is that sort of laws manage

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:10.460
red sea is that sort of laws manage
 

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.720
red sea is that sort of laws manage
going up you can see that the Middle

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:13.730
going up you can see that the Middle
 

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.750
going up you can see that the Middle
East and Egypt are very very close for

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760
East and Egypt are very very close for
 

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.419
East and Egypt are very very close for
that matter Pakistan is rather closer

00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:19.429
that matter Pakistan is rather closer
 

00:33:19.429 --> 00:33:21.159
that matter Pakistan is rather closer
it's India's sticking down and Pakistan

00:33:21.159 --> 00:33:21.169
it's India's sticking down and Pakistan
 

00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:23.650
it's India's sticking down and Pakistan
owes the left part of that yeah

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:23.660
owes the left part of that yeah
 

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.360
owes the left part of that yeah
and Europe is not very far away now you

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:28.370
and Europe is not very far away now you
 

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.419
and Europe is not very far away now you
look at Australia anything how does he

00:33:31.419 --> 00:33:31.429
look at Australia anything how does he
 

00:33:31.429 --> 00:33:36.010
look at Australia anything how does he
look out there the answer to that would

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:36.020
look out there the answer to that would
 

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:46.960
look out there the answer to that would
appear to me

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:46.970
 

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.560
okay

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:48.570
okay
 

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:52.639
okay
here's out of Africa this we're almost

someone over here someone up here and
 

00:33:58.679 --> 00:34:02.419
someone over here someone up here and
some end up over here now the question

00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:02.429
some end up over here now the question
 

00:34:02.429 --> 00:34:06.310
some end up over here now the question
is why did they get to Australia as fast

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320
is why did they get to Australia as fast
 

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.009
is why did they get to Australia as fast
if you know if you go if you're walking

00:34:12.009 --> 00:34:12.019
if you know if you go if you're walking

it's maybe 10,000 bucks atoms of 20,000

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:24.089
it's maybe 10,000 bucks atoms of 20,000

if 40,000 years is right which would

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:29.490
if 40,000 years is right which would
 

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:35.299
if 40,000 years is right which would
mean that people would expand about five

00:34:35.299 --> 00:34:35.309
mean that people would expand about five
 

00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:37.789
mean that people would expand about five
miles every 10 years not such an

enormous thing to do on a gradual basis
but then when you look at textbooks what

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220
but then when you look at textbooks what
 

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.819

you know they hunted mammoths they

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400
you know they hunted mammoths they
 

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.650

but you have to give that some thought

00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839
but you have to give that some thought
