machine learning project I often

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
machine learning project I often
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420
machine learning project I often
recommend that you setup a single real

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
recommend that you setup a single real
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.279

learning is a very empirical process we

learning is a very empirical process we
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270
learning is a very empirical process we
often have an idea code it out for an

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
often have an idea code it out for an
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670
often have an idea code it out for an
experiment to see how it did and then

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
experiment to see how it did and then
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530
experiment to see how it did and then
use the outcome of the experiment to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
use the outcome of the experiment to
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750
use the outcome of the experiment to
refine your ideas and then keep going

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
refine your ideas and then keep going
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760
refine your ideas and then keep going
around this loop as you keep on

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
around this loop as you keep on
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.220
around this loop as you keep on
improving your algorithm so let's say

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
improving your algorithm so let's say
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.540
improving your algorithm so let's say

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.620
 
so if

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
so if
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200
so if

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
by a has 95% precision this means that
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.359
by a has 95% precision this means that
when classify a said something as a cat

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369

that really are cats what percentage
 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.270
that really are cats what percentage
were correctly recognized by your

were correctly recognized by your
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.940

classifier so what percentage of actual

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
classifier so what percentage of actual
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:03.730

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.350
 
so if classify a has nine 'thus and we

that there's often a trade-off between

something is a cat there's a high chance
it really is a cat but of all the images

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
it really is a cat but of all the images
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.970
it really is a cat but of all the images
of our cats you also want it to pull a

of our cats you also want it to pull a
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.390
of our cats you also want it to pull a
large fraction of them as cats so it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
large fraction of them as cats so it
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880
large fraction of them as cats so it
