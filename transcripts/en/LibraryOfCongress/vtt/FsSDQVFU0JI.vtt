00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.860
&gt;&gt; Sarah Browning: Hey,
everybody [laughs].

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.860
You've got to look at yourselves.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.230
You are one beautiful crowd.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.150
Welcome to the fourth annual
National Book Festival Teen

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.720
Poetry Slam.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.980
My name is Sarah Browning.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.950
I have the great incredible
privilege of being the cofounder

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.460
and executive director
of Split This Rock.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.600
We are so proud to cosponsor this
slam with the Library of Congress

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.940
and the National Endowment
for the Arts, and to be here

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.870
on this beautiful, cold, rainy
September 2nd with all of you.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.100
And with remarkable teen poets
from the Washington, D.C. area,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.640
from Baton Rouge, from Minneapolis,
and from Portland, Oregon.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.390
Let's give it up.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.600
Right on. I want to give a shout
out to our ASL interpreters.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.950
Yeah. I think they've
been working hard all day.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.250
Am I right?

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.780
Yes. And you know what?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.170
Poetry is not easy to interpret.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.180
No. It's not.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.540
No. And especially these teen
poets because they have to keep

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.050
in a time limit, and so
sometimes they talk very fast.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.070
Yeah. So we're going to be
shouting them out all evening.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.850
So huge thank you for their
hard work and dedication.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.150
That's right.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.190
And a thank you to the
National Book Festival

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.210
for always having interpretation
and other access

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550
for people with disabilities.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.030
Right on. So I'm going
to take a second

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.620
to tell you about Split This Rock.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.140
We are a national organization
based here in Washington,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.500
D.C. Our mission is to cultivate,
teach, and celebrate poetry

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.670
that bears witness to injustice
and provokes social change.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.670
You think we need some
of that poetry right now?

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.030
I think we do.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.940
You think we've been needing that
poetry for the last 400 years?

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.550
I think we have.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.640
We've been having that poetry
too in the United States

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.390
and throughout the world,
throughout all of human history.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.030
And it's Split This Rock's mission
to elevate those voices, young,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.400
older, our forbearers, and our
current brilliant practitioners

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.150
at all levels of their
careers, of their writing lives.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.600
And we are just incredibly moved by
the poetry that is being written,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.480
performed, published in America
and throughout the world today.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.870 position:56%
Split This Rock is proud to
present that poetry and to foster it

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.190 position:56%
in many programs nationally and
throughout the Washington D.C. area.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.430
Our cornerstone programs
are a biannual,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.000 position:56%
that means every two years, biannual
-- We always get that wrong.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.570
Poetry festival.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.750
Split This Rock poetry festival.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.340
Poems of provocation and witness.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.640
You're all invited.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.210
The next one is April
19th to the 21st, 2018.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.230
You have time to plan
for those dates.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.100
You better be there.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.860
I invite you to visit the
table at the back where Sue

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.910
and Ruben are sitting
there to welcome you.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.210
They're waving at you.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.510
They're beautiful.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.820
There they are.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.370

listserv there or you can visit us

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.940

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.830
And sign up to get not only
updates about programs,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.310
including Split This Rock Poetry
Festival coming up April 19th

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.620
to the 21st, 2018, but also
every week Split This Rock poem

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.650
of the week because it's --
We're creative like that.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.020
We're poets.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.730
It's called Split This
Rock Poem of the Week.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.300
And it will come to you in
your inbox or on social media,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.590
a poem by a contemporary
poet reflecting

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.280
on the pressing social
issues of today.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.730
In all kinds of different ways.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.460
And it comes to you
on Friday morning.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.790
You might be a government
functionary.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.320
Any of those in this room?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.650
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.370
You might be a teacher.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.490
You might be a religious leader.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.750
You might just be somebody
whose heart is hurting.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.390
We got any of those
folks in the room today?

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.030
Yeah. And maybe you need a little
bit of poetry in your life.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.110
So sign up for that
poem of the week.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.270
You won't be sorry.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.490
Our other signature program is a
youth program, and you're going

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.820
to see that highlighted today.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.540
We've got after school poetry clubs

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.850
in high schools throughout
the D.C. area.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.130
We're the home of the
D.C. Youth Slam Team.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.430
Three stars.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.810
Hey. That's a thing.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.110
They do it.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.120
Yeah. And open mics at Busboys
and Poets, two locations,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.340
5th and K in Shirlington, Virginia.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.830
And check us all out at
splitthisrock.org for more.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.130
All right, then.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.470
And I just want to ask you all,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.190
I want to ask you all,
to support young voices.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.750
This is the future.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.410
This is the future
not just of poetry,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.360
not just of this country,
but of our Earth.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.820
The voices you're about to hear.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.410
And we need to invest and
support these young people

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.540
and the great variety, the
great richness, of youth voices

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.690
that you're about to hear tonight.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.140
So thank you for being here.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.730
And with that said, it's
my very great pleasure

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.970
to introduce your MC tonight,

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.960
our Split This Rock's
youth program coordinator.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.640
You've already seen him once.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.300
I give you my colleague,
my friend, Joseph Green.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:42.690
[ Applause ]

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.930
&gt;&gt; Joseph Green: Which one?

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.840
I think that each one
of these mics calls

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.630
for a different type of speaking.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.190
This is my spoken word.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:59.550
Hey, everybody.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.340
How you doing tonight?

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.770
Make some noise.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.300
This is my Barack.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.760
It's going to be a good evening.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.060
Poetry. Poetry.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.360
Poetry. All right.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.190
Cool. Just an idea I had.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.480
Hi. My name is Joseph Green,
and I'm going to be your host.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.780
Raise your hand if you've ever been

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.130
to a spoken word event,
slam, or open mic.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.430
True. True.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.730
True. All right.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.030
Hands down.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.330
Raise your hand if you've never
been to one of these events before.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.140
Ooh. Welcome.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.040
This is going to be
a good time for all.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.660
But there's a caveat to that.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.360 position:56%
This is only going to be a good time

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.990
if you open yourself
up to that good time.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.180
Right? We can be standing in
front of something prolific,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.580 position:56%
but if our minds are closed, there's
no way for that message to get in.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.590 position:56%
And there's so many things that get
in the way of that happening, right?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.540
We see someone who
doesn't look like us.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.770
We see someone and they say
something that we disagree with

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.990
or they come from a
place we don't come from

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.320
and all of a sudden we shut off.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.410
On this stage today there are
going to be young people from all

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.440
over this country, all
shapes and sizes and colors

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.890
and sexual identities, and all of
that is going to be here on display

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.870
for you laid at the altar
of your consideration.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.110 position:56%
And it will make you a better person
if you open yourself up to it.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.430
So if you're ready to have a good
time, I'm going to need you all

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.510
to make some real noise right now.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.340
[ Applause ]

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.640
Good. Good.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.940
It feels good.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.870
So for those of you who have never
been to a poetry slam before,

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.890
I'm going to take you
through a couple of rules

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.610
so you understand what's
about to happen here tonight.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.490
We have seven competitors
from all over the country

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.980
who have prepared poems,
original pieces,

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.280
that they will share with you.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.660
Those poems have to
be within 3 minutes

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.300
with a 30 second grace period.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.400
There's a first round
and a second round.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.390
And the first round because
we are sponsoring this slam

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.910
with the Library of Congress
in honor of the Book Festival,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.770
they have to read a poem that
is about reading or writing

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.040
or education or something
under that umbrella.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.900
So they had to write new
poems just for this event.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.600
Right? The second round can
be about anything they want.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.050
So brace yourselves.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.450
Okay. So a poetry slam is a
competition where you're going

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.080
to hear a poem, and we have
some very special people

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.980
in the audience today who are
in charge of judging the poetry.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.470
Now we realize how silly that
is, the idea that we're going

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.150
to take something that is
subjective and objectify it.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:43.870
But this is America [laughs]
and so we have found a way.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.170
So they will hear this.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.570
They will hear the poems.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:52.080
A zero will be the worst
poem they have ever heard.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.940
Simultaneously, all of us will fall
asleep and the slam will be over.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.970
Right? Now a 10 is the best
poem they have ever heard.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.390
Simultaneously, all of us
will be awoken and float

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.230
up to whatever is next for us.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.530
That's it.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.830
There's no more slam.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.130
Nothing. We're good.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.430
All right?

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.730 position:56%
So when that happens you'll feel it.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.030
You'll know.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.330
All right.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.630
And so these judges have
a very, very hard job.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.890
Right? They have to take this
art and give numbers to it.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.970
Audience, you also have a job.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.120
This is a participatory sport.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.390
Okay? So the judges
will give their scores.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.690
Then I will call them out.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.610
I will say, "7.5."

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.650
Your job at that point is to react

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.460
in whatever way you
think is appropriate.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.120
If you feel that score
is accurate to the poet,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.990
you will cheer and say, "Yay.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.930
I believe that is a
very accurate score."

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.110
You have to say that every time.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:53.380
No. If you do not agree with
the score, we don't boo here.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.730
We say, "Listen to the poem."

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.550
Because maybe they missed it.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.470
Right? They give it
a 6.5 and you are

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.720 position:56%
about to transcend to another place.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.020
Right? Maybe it didn't come in.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.530
So you say, "Listen to the poem."

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.520
So I'm going to need
everyone to work with me.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.380
I'm going to call out a score that
you disagree with, and I need you

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.280
to be loud and exuberant and
tell me what you're going to do.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.590
All right.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.890
Here we go.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.330
4.5.

[ Audience Shouts ]

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.770
I'm sorry.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.210
But it's going to be fine.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.050
Now I'm going to introduce
you to our esteemed judges.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.040
I'm going to go over
to my Barack mic.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.480
So we have somebody else special
in the audience [inaudible] before.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.780
All right.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:49.760
So this is the Library of
Congress National Book Festival.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.640
The Library of Congress has
a librarian of Congress.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.370
And she is in the building tonight.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:04.510
Please clap it up for
Ms. Carla Hayden.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:10.120
[ Applause ]

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.970
You want to say something?

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:17.990
Come on and say something.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.290
We got time.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.910
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well, and
this always gets me all juiced

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.010
up because last year I got to
be a judge and it's hard work.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.650
This is a rough crowd.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.820
I got -- Didn't I get challenged?

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.330
&gt;&gt; Joseph Green: I
thought you did a good job.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.630
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, thank you.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.930
&gt;&gt; Joseph Green: Yeah.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.230
We're contractually
[inaudible] to say so.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.530
No.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.830
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.280
Well, I just want to
tell you enjoy the --

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.480
I talked about this slam
for the rest of the year,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.280
and it gave me inspiration.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.380
And I just had to come and say
thank you all for being here.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.570 position:56%
Thank you for everybody that's going
to get up here and share with us.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.870
&gt;&gt; Joseph Green: I appreciate that.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.390
They appreciate that, young people.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:03.270
[ Applause ]

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.720
Proud to live in a
world where things

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.660
like this are still important.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.960
All right.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.700
So now to your esteemed judges.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:17.700
One of your first judges you may
or may not have heard of him.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.200
His name is Juan Felipe Herrera.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:28.550
And so each judge was asked
to give a little bit to say

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:33.290
about themselves, and this is
what he said about himself.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:38.160
Recent poet laureate and for the
young people performing tonight I

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.460
believe in you.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.490
Can we clap it up for
Juan Felipe Herrera?

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:51.480
Our next judge goes by the
name of Elizabeth Acevedo.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.840
Now here's what's funny about that.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.140
Not everybody in the room clapped

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.730
because everyone don't
know Elizabeth yet,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.140
but I'm going to tell you
some things about Elizabeth

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.070
because next year everybody in
this room is going to be clapping.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.150
It goes like this.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.860
She's a National Poetry
Slam champion.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.470
Her debut YA novel "The Poet
X," out from HarperCollins,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.660
will be out for sale March 2018.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.690
Additionally, that festival
that Sarah was talking

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.520
about that happens every
two years next April?

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.340
She will be a featured
reader at that festival.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.670
Can we please clap it up
for Elizabeth Acevedo?

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:41.500 position:56%
And next we have Melissa de la Cruz.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.730
Author of "The Disney
Descendents" and "Alex and Eliza,"

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:57.590
a novel about young Alexander
Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.640
which let me tell you I
cannot wait to buy that book.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.230
And important to know.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.870
Do I look as good in light as I
did in the -- I appreciate that.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.170
Thank you.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.440
Just going to keep it going.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.920
Also, she once came in third
in a slam of three people.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.920
Can we please clap it up
for Melissa de la Cruz?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.020
Our next judge, Adrian Matejka.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.060
Clap. There you go.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:39.300
He has a new book out,
"Map to the Stars."

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.360
One of the finals judges
for the Poetry

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.630
Out Loud competition this year,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.100
and one of the most pleasant
individuals I've met here

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.720
at the book festival, please
clap it up for Adrian Matejka.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.580
And last but not least,
his name is Joey Reisberg.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.580
Clap it up for him now.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.890
He is a rising senior at
Carver Center in Towson.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:10.040 position:56%
He is the 2016 National Poet for the
Northeast, and his favorite thing is

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.950
to see young people
with talent rise.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:20.780
Clap it up.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.080
Now back over here.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.230
I'm going to read out
the names of the poets

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.890
who are performing tonight.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.140
They -- What they -- If you come
from a city, what is that called?

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.440
They hail.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.740
Thank you.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.040
This is participatory.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.340
If I ask a question,
just shout it out.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.640
All right.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.940
They hail from these cities.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.950
Anybody in here from
Portland, Oregon?

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.690
That -- That didn't come
with one of the teams?

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:52.040
How about anybody here from
the Northwest of the country?

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.340
Make some noise.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.750
Don't raise your hand.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.420
Make some noise.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.720
High five.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.020
All right.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.600
So we also have a team
here from Baton Rouge.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.750
Anybody here from that
part of the country?

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.190
Make some noise.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.770 position:56%
These two people are super excited
to be from that part of the country.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.080
Welcome. All right.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.720 position:56%
We also have poets from Minneapolis.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.320
Yes. Anybody here from
that part of the country?

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.320
Awesome. All right.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.180
We also have poets from
D.C. Anybody here from D.C.?

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.330
All right.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.710
I'm saying that to say this.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.060
For the rest of the evening, we
are on team clap for everybody.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.880
Right? That's the team
that we are representing.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.020
So when you see somebody
coming to the stage,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.170
you clap like the future
is coming to the stage.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.120
And your clapping is reflective

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.300
of how bright you want
the future to be.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.600
All right?

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.900
So I'm going to call out their
names, and that's the type

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.760
of energy I'm going to
need to hear right now.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.720
We have Maya [assumed spelling],
Catherine [assumed spelling],

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.300
Taya [assumed spelling],
Anaya [assumed spelling],

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:05.510
Asher [assumed spelling],
Sophia, and [inaudible].

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:11.500
[ Applause ]

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.400
This is a yes or no question.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.000
Are you ready for a poetry slam?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.780
You only had two choices,
and you got it wrong.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.520
So if you've never been to a poetry
slam before, there's something

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.170
that we do at the beginning.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.610
It's called the sacrificial poet.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.330
Not as gory as it sounds.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.050
This poet's job is to
calibrate the judges,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.790
to make sure that they are
ready for the performance.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.060
This person is not
in the actual slam.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.360
So they're not up to win.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.110
But the score that the judges
give will be what they use

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.510
as their litmus for the
rest of the program.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.350
So we typically have a poet just
like the rest of the poets who come

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.940
up and read an original poem.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.320 position:56%
Unfortunately, one of the poets from
Baton Rouge was unable to join us.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.070
He has a heart condition
and is in --

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.050
on bed rest right now
and couldn't make it.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.930
Her name is Jasmine Smith.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.230 position:56%
Can we give her a round of applause?

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:07.870
Because this is being filmed,
and her poetic spirit is

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.020
about to be felt in this room.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.570
So reading one of Jasmine's
poems, the one that she created

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:20.530
for this space, a current member
of the D.C. Youth Slam Team,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:25.620
three stars, hey, please
put your hands together

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.880 position:56%

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.690
&gt;&gt; Tyka Wallace: In
elementary school,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.400
we were always given
secondhand books.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.100
I knew this because
once I learned to read,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.610
the stamps on the inside
cover read "Property

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.290 position:56%
of Insert Wealthy School Name Here."

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.620 position:56%
The pages were torn, and written on,

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.520
and I always wondered
what it would be like not

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.120
to receive a secondhand education.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.000 position:56%
If children are the future, the kids

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.570
at my elementary school
were learning

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.530
to take what they got,
to not protest too much.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.690
To accept outdated information.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.330
I guess a bunch of black kids

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.770
from Glen Oaks weren't
worthy of fresh prints.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.410
When I got to high school, the
admission requirements got harder

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.130
which is to say the students got
whiter and the textbooks got newer.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.580
Hot off the presses
with glossy covers.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.210 position:56%
When your school is black, volunteer
organizations will paint murals

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.470
to brighten up the
black neighborhoods.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.730
When your school is
historically white,

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.160
you will have $1,000
gymnastics mats.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.740
Somewhere across town a
white child is playing

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.080
on a brand new jungle gym
while a black student flips

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.850
through a book with missing pages.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.570 position:56%
White students receive iPads because
textbooks take too much maintenance.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.260
Black kids tape pages together,

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.720
trying to piece their
history back together.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.110
White kids get salad bars,

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.200
and we get another vending
machine filled with junk food.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.630
They'd rather watch black
schools dissolve into ash,

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.630
rather watch them wash away,
than give them resources.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.840
Rather spend $1 million
renovating the white school

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.010
than making sure there are
enough teachers at the black one.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:18.160
When did separate, but equal
become part of the curriculum?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.610
If we had accurate history books,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.110
we could see that it
was never taken out.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.030
We could see how ink smudges look a
lot like the blood of my ancestors

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.340
and how their pain is consolidated
into a civil rights chapter,

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.760
like they haven't been
surviving this entire time.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.670
Like these books, my city is so
segregated you could divide it

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.130
in half which is as much math as
they teach us around here anyway.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.670
They call my high school a castle
the way it towered over the city,

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.260
and maybe that's why it felt more
like a guarded tower for privilege

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.470
than a place of enrichment.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.460
The school was built by people who
couldn't have walked its hallways,

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.370
and its whiteness is deafening.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.330
Its resources are deafening.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.720
Its classism is deafening.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.760
If reading and writing
are so essential,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.400
then how come they have written
us out of this narrative?

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.010
How come the right to a
decent education is property

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.890
of "Insert wealthy
school name here"?

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.400
When they rip a solid education
from black hands like ripping pages

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.980
out of a children's
book, it becomes clear

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.600
that we were not meant to learn.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:29.370
[ Applause ]

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:35.090
&gt;&gt; Joseph Green: She was given that
assignment like 30 minutes ago.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:43.090
Right? Judges, that is the longest
amount of time you will be given

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.830
to come up with your scores.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.880
In fact, I am talking even longer
now to make sure that in 10 seconds

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.090
when I say, "Judges, show me
your scores," you are prepared.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.800
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.660
Judges, show me your scores.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:08.670
I tried. From low to high we have
a 7, a 7, a 7.3, a 7.4, and a 7.6.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.290
Clap it up for the poet, please.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:19.430
[ Applause ]

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.720
I am so happy that was
the first poem read.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.060
For anybody in here
who was questioning,

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:31.660
"I wonder where this is going to
go," that's where it's going to go.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:37.090
And I say this not as a warning,
because I don't care to warn you.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:42.170
But in the hopes that this
work is received well.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.080
If you have a feeling
when you hear some

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.950
of these poems like,
"That's not right."

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.320
Or, "That makes me feel weird."

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.270
Or like an allergy, right, stop.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.570
Be mindful.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.750
Ask yourself, "Why is that
the feeling I'm feeling?"

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.630
Could there be something
wrong in this world

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.510
that doesn't directly affect me?

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.730
Possibly. And how can we
make the world a better place

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.130
by caring for one another?

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.690
Right? Don't discount it because
it don't make sense to you

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.480
or doesn't happen in
your neighborhood.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.210
That's why we're here in
this space, because you want

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.750
to bring these stories to
an entirely new audience.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.930
We have poetry slams
all over the city.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:19.200
We want you all to understand
that there are young people

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.990
on this planet that exist
outside of the realm

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.950
of what you see in the news.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.950
Right? Or what you think
about when you go and you see

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.360
like whatever the new pop movie is.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.340
There are people, young people,
who are considerate, who are aware,

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.730
who are awoke, still waking,
trying to wake the world.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.110
Right? And a lot of
them are here tonight.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:43.600
So please keep that in mind,
that this is not easy for them.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.310
As confident as they will seem,
this is not easy for them.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.950
As you would imagine,
any of you in front

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.580
of 1,000 people you've
never met before talking

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.600
about something particularly
personal.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.900
All right.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.100
So that's the level
we're going to set.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.400
All right?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.700
That's the type of
courage and bravery,

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.000
and that's what we need rewarded

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.570
when we bring the young
people on stage.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.170
Now I have a simple
yes or no question.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.740
Hint. The answer is yes.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.190
Are you ready for a poetry slam?

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.430
Please put your hands together for
the first poet and the first round.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.510
Maya.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:26.500
[ Applause ]

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.370
&gt;&gt; Maya: Some kids come
to school wounds deep

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.960
as wells hidden beneath
Band-Aid stretched skin.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.710
Teachers demand they try harder
to pull themselves apart,

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.800
to see how much more blood
they have left to give.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.000
To sign an oath on the
top of their assignment.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.100
Chubby cheeks and bright
eyes line the altar,

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.190
their thoughts more
profound than those

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.550
of philosophers they will
someday be assigned to read.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.650
Their minds bustle with curiosity.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:04.830
So why does schoolwork
look like human sacrifice?

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.550
Children sacrifice their creativity
for the system's convenience.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:12.210
The system sacrifices children
for money, throws five year olds

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.840
on to assembly lines
that move too quickly,

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.340
not allowing them to
catch their breath.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.770
Painting them with wide brush even
though there's only enough pigment

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.490
for a few bristles.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.800
Letting the ones who never had
a chance fall through the cracks

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.710
and in to the locked doors
of the principal's office.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.220
Reduce their cries for help
by calling it misbehavior.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.360
Punish them with out
of school suspensions.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.750
Convince them they're just
like criminals on house arrest.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.730
Throw them in to the
cells of private prisons.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.730
This will be easy when white people
in dark suits paint darker children

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.970
to look like dollar
signs in jumpsuits.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:54.660
Skimp on their education
knowing it will lead to crime.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.670
Do not teach them to read.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:00.660
Stuff this poetry of 17th century
white men down their throats,

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.270
especially when they are choking.

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.540
Force them to analyze
someone else's words

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.160
so formulaically they
forget how to use their own.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.650
Assign books so unrelatable
they never want

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.240
to read for pleasure again.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.040
Do not teach them to write
with their own voice.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.020
Tell them it is too informal.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.110
Let them know that stories of truth

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.170
and trauma must be
packaged pretty enough

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.240
for the palatability
of their oppressors.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.330
Value the stories of
slave owning presidents

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.760
and do not tell them their
country was built on graveyards

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.820
of stolen land and stolen breath.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.380
Watch them fill in circles
as their minds grow numb

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.950
from stress and stimulants.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.020
Blood pumping with Adderall
to replace the curiosity

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.480
that got bled out of them.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.080
It is easy to do this when
they see learning as the enemy.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.770
If somehow a child begin to emerge
from these ashes still curious,

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.050
still a fighter, still authentic,

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.970
tell their parents they
have a learning disorder.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.590
Make them feel incompetent for
failing to turn in to Play-Doh

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.640
in the hands of a system that wants
them molded into perfect soldiers.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.030
Tell them that they will
drown in this quicksand

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.380
and immediately throw
them a prescription pill.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.740
Convince them it is
a life preserver.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.690
Convince them this thing they do

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.440
for 40 hours a week is
a life preserver even

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.740
when they tell you
they don't know how

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.050
to preserve their own
happiness for the life of them.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.130
Do not teach them their rights.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.640
After all, it is your job to
sculpt kids to be prisoners

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.280
in jobs they will learn to hate.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.860
In cycles of poverty they will
never have the tools to break.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.930
In jail cells where you throw
away their ballot and chain them

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.650
to a world that will never change.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.850
Call it democracy.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.990
But when you see another
generation in shackles,

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:57.210
don't you dare call it freedom.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:05.610

a 7.1, a 7.2, a 7.3, and a 7.9.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.700
So testing.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.230
Check. 1. 2.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.010
How's my mic sound?

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.590
My mic sounds nice.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.520
Check. 1. Okay.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.820
You're not ready.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.120
All right.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.710
So if you heard during
that first poem,

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.720 position:56%
there were people who were snapping.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.020
Right? Right?

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.220
If you hear a line that you
like, it's okay for you to snap.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:59.110
Right? That way you can be like,
"Yo, I really like that poem,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.570
but I'm not going to interrupt
it by walking up to the stage

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.670
and saying hey, I enjoyed
that line."

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.920
Right? So let's practice
that real quick.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.640
Everybody snap.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.540
Yes. I love doing that in
large crowds because I grew

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.310
up eating Rice Krispies and I
close my eyes and I remember.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.230
You can also say, "Word."

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.530
Everybody say, "Word."

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.730
You can make that sound you make

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.620
when you have a delicious
piece of chocolate.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.360
Didn't even have to tell you.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.970
And, last but not least, you
can do something that I really

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.070
like invented by a friend
of mine [inaudible].

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.480
You can take the word she and
you can take the word Jesus

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.330
and no matter your
religious affiliation,

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.630
you can smash them together.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.360
If you hear something that makes
you feel particularly holy,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.360
you say, "Shesus."

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.070 position:56%
It feels better when you participate
so I'm going to need everybody

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.340
in this room to give me their
best shesus on the count of three.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:55.710
1. 2. 3. Doesn't it feel
good to participate?

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:58.760
If you're ready for your
next poet, say yeah.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.390
Coming up next to the stage,

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.510
please put your hands
together for Catherine.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:13.500
[ Applause ]

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.500
&gt;&gt; Catherine: According
to my journal,

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.610
I'm having more good days than bad.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:28.940
A tiny heart on the cover corner,
a page for each day written

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.410
in at night with the
easiest key in the world.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:38.340
Yellow is for happiness, pink
good, purple survivable, green sad.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.520
Blue days, blue days are bad.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.710
A childish word for how
I feel when I don't get

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.760
out of bed, but I want to.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.410
To clean up my room and uncover the
scraps of yellow paper on my floor,

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.750
fold pink blankets, wear
my favorite purple socks.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.020
Bad as if bad even comes close
to how I feel right then.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.560
Bad as if I feel anything bad.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.720
Like it only took 10 minutes for a
doctor to prescribe me something,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.540
and bad like it's not working.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.070
According to my journal, yellow
doesn't show up that much,

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:12.080
but there's lots of pink, the color
of smoothies I've started drinking

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.270
and my new sheets, of my best
friend's nails and sister's cheeks.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.170
According to my journal,
I'm getting better.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.900
According to my therapist,
I'm a lovely child.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.200
You're welcome, mom.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.310
According to her, I'm eating again.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.880
According to me, yellow is for days
when I lean against my best friend

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.270
in history, when the sunset
was at 6:51 instead of 4,

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.470
when my brother knocks on my
door just to say he loves me.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.500
Yellow is for days when I'm
convinced I've been faking it all

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.800
these years.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.360
Yellow like my skin after
another day of not eating.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.760
Like the honeysuckle candle I
bought to remind me of summer wind.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.910
Yellow like the painting
in my kitchen.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.950
The one my grandma owned.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.340
February 13, 2012 I wore a
yellow shirt to school, daring,

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.260
bravely drawing eyes on me.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.460
My siblings and I ran
off the school bus.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.770
My mom sat us down on the couch

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:12.350
and I've seen my mom cry
before, but not like this.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:16.330
Finding me hidden by my bookshelf
in tears as she decides it's okay

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.410
to tell a 12 year old her
grandmother committed suicide,

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.010
the grandmother who taught her
how to cook bright yellow eggs,

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.090
soaked golden buttery
popcorn just right,

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.220
and teach patience enough
to watch any sunset.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.080
She didn't have time
to teach me how to draw

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.520
so every letter I write
is straight lines.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.990 position:56%
A book of pink, yellow, blue, green,
purple, is missing violet, indigo,

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:40.000 position:56%
chartreuse [inaudible] bumblebee
bright sunshine, gold, butterscotch,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.600
cannery, daffodil, mustard,
lemon [inaudible] blond.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.100
The hair color we shared.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:53.710
According to my journal,
I'm getting better.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.020
February's over.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.580
The sun's staying out later.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.110
I'm cutting my hair soon.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.600
I'll buy another pen in case
my yellow ever runs out,

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.410
and cover pages with
reminders of my happiest days.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.730
I will publish books that open and
spill yellow ink on to your laps,

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.420
magazines with foldouts
for every shade imaginable.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:22.590 position:56%
And essays written in pink, articles
in purple, poems printed in green,

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:29.510
obituaries written in my blue pen.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:42.810
Scores. 3.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:52.240
2. 1. From low to high, 7.3,
7.7, 8.2, 8.4, and an 8.5.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.570
Clap it up for the poet.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:01.760
Keep that energy going for the
next poet in the first round.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.840
Taya. All the way to
the stage, folks.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.140
All the way to the stage.

[ Applause ]

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.420
&gt;&gt; Taya: So you're about to embark
on your first year at Hogwarts.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.860
I know it's scary.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.900
Starting a new school can be scary,
but fear not, my sweet first year,

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.430
as I impart on to you the
knowledge I have gained from years

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.990
of house cups and potions
classes that I wish I had had

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.560
when I was a young witch.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.190
No standardized test
can measure your magic.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:50.230
The brightest wizard can fail,
and the dullest can thrive.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:56.920
No multiple choice mess can
measure just how magical you are.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.790
Your newts and owls
don't define you.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:04.100
There is nothing uncool
about school spirit.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.840
Deck yourself from head
to toe in house colors.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.330
Scream at the top of your lungs in
the stands for your Quidditch team,

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.420
but don't go too hard if they win.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.270
A fire whiskey hangover does
not excuse you from turning

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.890
in your potions essay
in the morning.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.600
Remember not to compromise
your beliefs just

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.900
because you want to be popular.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:28.360 position:56%
As a brave man once said to an even
braver child, "It takes a great deal

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.700
of courage to stand up to your
enemies, and an even greater deal

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.860
to stand up to your friends."

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.890
And remember in 19 years
you aren't going to care

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.070
about the professors you
hated or the tests you failed.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.090
You're going to care about
the people you loved,

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.890
the memories you made.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.940
For every Dolores Umbridge,
there's a Remus Lupin.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.720
For every Draco Malfoy,
there's a Ron Weasley.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.680
For every Triwizard tragedy,
there is a Yule ball.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.020
And there's a [inaudible]
for any other problem

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.230
that might come along the way.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:04.210
In these dark and troubling
times, we have to remember

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:08.980
that we are magic, and Hogwarts
should feel like our home.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.640
And remember, if all else fails,
Hermione Granger could stay

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.720
on her grind and get straight As
during a time of unspeakable magic

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.880
that threatened her very existence.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.180
So you can too.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:32.500

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.710
[Laughs] this is my
biggest fan right there.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:48.570
Judges. From low to high,
we have scores already.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.870
Here we go.

6.8. 7.5. 8.3.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.620
8.7. And an 8.9.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.950
Clap it up for the poet, please.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.650
[ Applause ]

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:12.260
So if there's something
happening on stage that you enjoy,

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.690
please feel free to take to
the interwebs and let the folks

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.160
out there who couldn't fit
in this room know about it

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.730
because if you haven't noticed
this room's kind of full.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.030
All right?

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.330
We're at standing room
only status here.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.250
You can use the hashtag
for the book festival

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:39.450
which is natbookfest.com@atari
-- What is it?

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.750
Natbookfest.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.480
Or you can also add at
Split This Rock so we know

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.210
that you love what's
happening up here.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.650
And I believe the librarian of
Congress also has her own Twitter.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.200
I know because she just tweeted,
and she put my name in it.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:39:00.810
What? Time to die and go to Heaven.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.470
And now for your next poet.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:08.510

clapping right now for Anaya.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.780
&gt;&gt; Anaya: For Lucas and Latifah,
the two stars that burn themselves

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.870
out far before their time.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:44.170
If tonight is the last
night you plan on breathing,

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.620
if the weight of the world is so
heavy on your shoulders you --

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.190
The only place you can see to
lay down this burden is a grave.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.590
If you are so tired of this
existence you want to put yourself

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.360
in to an eternal rest, I'm sorry.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.830
I cannot make this life
more livable for you.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.020
But before you go, can
I ask you one thing?

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.250
When you pick up the pen
to write the suicide note,

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.890
write a poem instead.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:14.060
About all the things you love
and all the things that love you.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.360
Write a poem.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.110
Turn the pain into prose and see
how quickly the end becomes a

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.410
new beginning.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.700
Write a poem like your life depends
on it because sometimes it does.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.130
I too have known nights on
bathroom floors with blood

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.670
and tears streaming so
quickly I do not know

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.570
which one I'll run out of first.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.650
No praying to gods I stopped
believing in a long time ago

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.450
that if they were real they
would make the pain go away.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.190
No looking death in the face
and inviting him home for dinner

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.210
like a long lost friend I couldn't
wait to get reacquainted with.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.070
But I have also known salvation.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.060
Known that if the words of
your demons can end your life,

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.560
then words of hope can save it no
matter how deep a hole you've dug

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.460
yourself in to.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.340
Even when holding on to life feels

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.980
like grasping air your lungs
can't even keep inside of them,

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.700 position:56%
reach your hands out for a lifeline.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.770
And I'll give you a pen.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.290
And tell you that poetry
is the pathway to healing

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:11.240
that you never saw coming, and
ain't I a testament to that?

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.540
Because I am still standing

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.470
after depression has
brought me to my knees.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.430
After I have asked God
more times to end my life

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.990
than I have thanked
him for giving me it.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.970
And ain't that a blessing?

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.990
To survive even when your own
body has tried to kill you?

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.230
So hold healing in your hands,
and it gets hard sometimes

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:32.000
because you can't even remember how
to be a person, much less a poet,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.280
but I promise being a poet
isn't always about pretty prose.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:43.760
Sometimes it is just
about being alive.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:52.110
Hell, most times it's just about
being alive here in this place.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:57.060
So I've seen so many
resurrected I almost call it holy.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.040
Call it magic.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.920
So let me spellbind you.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.220
Survival. Put down your razor.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.520
Don't spill blood.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.820
Spill ink.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.240
Write a poem across your wrists and
thighs and show everyone your scars

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:21.560
and story and tell them that
this is what survival looks like.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.860
This is healing.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.300
This is life through language.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.720
And never forget how
hard it was to get here.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.130
To turn your back on your demons.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:33.190
But if the pen is mightier than
the sword, then it is mightier

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.100
than any mental illness
that has tried to kill you.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.420
So tonight so write me a
suicide note, an obituary,

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.720

there should be a comma.

&gt;&gt; Asher: I am aching to
lose myself these days.

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:16.940 position:56%
Fingers curled with a need to touch,
to ease the hurt, writing everything

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.910
down like it matters
because maybe it does.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.820 position:56%
Because maybe my feelings aren't
real if you can't read them because,

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.740
like a love too young
to be any less,

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.260
maybe a feeling isn't a
feeling if it's not physical.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.850
So make believe that blurry

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:33.910 position:56%
and scuffing along the blue sky are
scatters and rags of high cloud warm

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.090
from the sun, bright and blinding.

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.590
Eyes [inaudible] brown are on
the stems of grapes once clear

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:41.440
and lucid now scan
around in watery panic.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.550
This amber melancholy
is smoking and alive.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.200
Hands clasped and teeth
crooked like a zipper,

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.620
body warm like an old sweater,
and stained with things

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.400
like whiskey colored
regret and drowning in it.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.750
These hands are thin, and
rough, and never meant for this.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.520
Give me a script, a line
to walk, small lights

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.110
and murmuring conversations.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.980
Tell me to just keep
breathing because god

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.020
of nothing said to
have something to do.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.700
Because we can't hear
all these big plans yet.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.930
I reek of uncertainty,
and half sleep stupor.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.220
So instead of reading
between these blurred lines,

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.310
let us measure the margins and
assign meaning in the morning.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:21.080
Language is a landscape
punctuated by bodies, faces dazed,

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.900
tongues slack and mad with heat.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.280
Soil sings for our similes.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.800
So I talk and talk and talk
and never say what I mean.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.560
Unearth my prose just enough
to remember what happened.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.310
Write and write about love
I will not fall in to,

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.370
about how I crushed what I could
because it was small and so was I.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.370
About how I wake up and nothing is
beautiful the way I imagined it.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:44.280
And pretend these words
weigh anything.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.170
Because maybe they do.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.710
Because maybe I don't have to make
these loose lyrics soft enough

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:52.720
to grasp before I litter
them across a page.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.960
Maybe this isn't an ache at
all, and my bones only crack

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.680
because they are broken
ballads begging for a new body,

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.680
one with palms big enough
to write a biography.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.610
Eyes like bible black
dream catchers.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:11.520
I am a boy born of hard
lemonade and a Midwest April.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.340
Somewhere there is a
story about kissing once

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.750
and leaving in sheets of rain.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:22.510

be the one to write it.

slathered in grass fed butter,

the crusts cut off and thrown away.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.050
Dipped in a plate coated
in raw sugar cane.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.550
Her mother brought her munchies
while she taught her baby how

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.850
to read.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.980
She pulled books filled with boxes
and CDs from under the table.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.030
She held them with the edges
of her skeletal fingertips

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.330
so the records wouldn't wreck.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.390
And they spun with a voice
of wisdom that taught her

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.660
to ignore the silent H. On
her first day of kindergarten,

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.220
she brought her chapter books
and sounded out sentences

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.710
in her head while the teacher
taught the class the alphabet song.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.900
White Wonder Bread coated in
the very last scrape of butter,

00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.890
she no longer coughs when she bites

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.680
in to crusts mixed
with secondhand smoke.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.190
Her lungs were like weeds
from the concrete cracks

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:08.000
of a womb made of nicotine
and whiskey.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.880
She makes herself her meal.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.300
Before cleaning up
familiar carpet stains

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.370
by her mother while her baby slept
deeply on the couch to the sounds

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:20.930
of '90s sitcom reruns and
voices of strange men.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:24.410
She started kindergarten 10 miles
away from her, but learned the song

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:29.050
of beeping metal detectors
instead of the ABCs.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.710
In fifth grade I started
taking care of myself.

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:34.480
My mother let her skeletal
fingertips where some skin

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.490
around the bones -- She
entrusted my teachers

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.300
to fulfill my thirst for words.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.670
No longer was she busy with
our pocketbooks and ABCs.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:43.910
She remembered she needed to eat.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:46.010 position:56%
By fifth grade she's in foster care.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:48.800
Her face tells the story of
broken beer bottles slashed

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.950
across smooth brown skin, skin
that should have stayed soft

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.530
until puberty gave it ridges.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.910
She learned that you can make a
child grow old with suffering,

00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:00.540
without giving her the time to age.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.460
She's assigned a book report,
but it's hard to make honor roll

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.880
when your mother was gone while
hers was reading her to sleep.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.100
While the books in your
classroom ripped at the hinges --

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.400
How are you supposed
to learn to read then?

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.150
When the books in her
classroom smelled

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.010
of paper printed fresh while
she learned to read "Hamlet"

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.660
and "A Midsummer Night's Dream,"

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.620 position:56%
while you sat before a conveyor
belt bringing in new mouths to feed.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.640
It's a decade and some too
late when they finally decide

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.930
to open our borders and let
us get to know each other.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:31.600
And when she gets her first
history report, I wipe a chalkboard

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.900
of happy drawings from
an imagination

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.950
that wants to replace her memory.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:39.800
And she copies the
vocab words one by one.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.770
When I ask her to name the
face of 20th century hate,

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.450
she is silent with no answer.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:48.000
When I ask her to name the
faces of peaceful demonstration,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.650
she is silent with no answer.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.890
When I ask her if she
knows her history,

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:53.490
she is silent with no answer.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.590
When I ask her if she
could read the history

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:59.180
that her teachers never taught
her, she is silent with no answer.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:04.030
So why should I be able to learn
from history and be the future?

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.850
So why should she be lost
without words and forced

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.650
by the man to stay in the past?

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:14.290
So that you and I, my dear
sister, are both silent.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.950
Sell out. Become as white
as the page he's on.

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:27.240
The strong black man ain't
in history books more

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.990
than a quota requires because to
document too many black martyrs

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:34.890
would give little black
kids too much strength,

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:36.890
and to document too many living,

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:39.780
breathing blacks will
give them too much hope.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.100
And to document too many black
inventors would give them too

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.710
much ambition.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:48.510
So put a history book in front
of the little black child.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:53.090
Only show them their ancestors
bloody, broken, raped, and stolen.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:56.620
Convince them from a young age
submission is in their blood,

00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:01.120
that their only chance of getting
rid of it is to bleed it out.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.500
Tell them they're better
off blending in,

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.640
that in these books
blacks are never the hero,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.510
seldom the victim,
always the villain.

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:10.940
That if they want to know more

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.840
than just how their ancestors
died they have to take it

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.720
as a high school elective.

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.870
That in these schools their
culture isn't taken seriously.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:22.860
Neither are their achievements.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.910
But they should still
be happy to learn

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:29.610
about a white man stealing a black
man's land, a black man's wife,

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:32.940
because look at all this
country has done for us.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.260
We should pledge to a flag
that waves our ancestors' blood

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.540
in our faces because we don't want

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.110
to seem ungrateful for
our freedoms, right?

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:44.240
We should stand and sing
along to the national anthem

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.030
because they cut out
the slave verse.

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:50.200
Right? We should support our black
troops fighting for a country

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.520
who doesn't even care about them

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.240
because at least this way
they're not dying at the hands

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.590
of their own country's hate.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.940
Right? At least this way
someone will care enough

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.650
to remember them, right?

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:05.020
At least this way they will
finally be labeled as heroes.

That was just the first round.

girls could my daddy turn sour

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.380
if my daddy could still
call himself a daddy?

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.430
He got six girls, but for as long

00:55:56.430 --> 00:56:02.640
as I can remember I was always
daddy's princess and he my king.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.180
My dragon slayer.

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.300
My knight in shining armor.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.950 position:56%
But never put a parent on a pedestal

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:13.230
because kings don't
always do their duty.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:15.710
Knights aren't always found noble.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:18.440
And dragons don't always get slain.

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.650
And my mama, she say my
daddy always been the same,

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:26.800
but I know he was the remedy
to my tears, not the reason.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.960
He used to let me ride
in his blue Chevy

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.130
and teach me how to work the radio.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:37.430
And we'd go jogging on Sunday
mornings, and I still wonder

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.920
if we had been in church
instead of running,

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.310
could that have changed this?

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:42.610
Could that have stopped him?

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:43.910
Could that have saved us?

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:46.850
It doesn't matter now.

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:51.310
He used to take me to Maxwell's
Market to get shrimp salad

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:54.610
or couscous, and I still
don't know what couscous is,

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.910
but it tastes good.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.810
He used to give me a
small sip of his wine.

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:04.780
And, daddy, you were never drunk
or high, but you hit the highway

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.520
like it was a blunt puff, puff.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.460
You passed up your ride
a few too many times,

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.870
and I stopped screaming,
"Daddy's home."

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:14.090
Because it was past my bedtime.

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:18.250
But I was still awake because you
didn't slay those scary dragons

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:19.550
under my bed.

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:23.490
So, daddy, tell me how many dragons
could destroy daddy's kingdom

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.880
if daddy left his kingdom for dead.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:30.870 position:56%
If dragons started having names like
Angela and Shannon, and the monsters

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:33.580
in my nightmares became
his mistresses.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.110
And I stopped worrying
if they were under my bed

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:40.910
because I knew they were in
his, and he had betrayed me.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:46.080
Us. But I did a good job of never
biting the hand that fed me.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:47.410
Poison, daddy.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.620
I moved out four years ago.

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:53.570
And I still wonder if you know I'm
angry, if you know your name ain't

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:58.310
on speed dial anymore, if you know
you make bastard sound so heavenly.

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:01.380

but I really don't want to.

How you make step daddy
sound like a blessing.

How you make me feel so heavy,
and angry, and hollow, and dark.

Because of you I got
demons, but I don't got you.

it has been scientifically proven

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.270
that a hamburger, a bottle of
vodka, a pill from your pharmacist,

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:55.560
a teacher with an attached metal
detector, computer screen, a knife,

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.490
and even your very own sex
organs have the undeniable power

00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:01.310

all in the exact same way.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.770
I suppose I stopped believing
in God when I begged him

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:39.740
to give me the strength to starve,
and he gave me weakness in return.

from the inside out like black

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.030
As a child, they taught me in
Catholic school that it was a sin

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.360
to commit suicide, but
how could I not believe

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.770
that it wasn't God's purpose, my
life's purpose, to make my body

01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:01.270
so small it would evaporate
in to thin air?

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:04.500
That happiness could -- would come
when I could walk in to a room

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.910
and sugar quietly on my own while
the rest of the world felt the kind

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:11.600
of warmth that makes your eyes
close slowly on their own.

I would stop taking up so much
space, I would stop apologizing

for being alive because
now I was just a corpse.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:26.190
When the human body starves,
all it can think about is food.

When all it can think about is
food, the sadness goes away.

When the sadness goes away,
the dopamine does too.

your addiction has
reduced you to a vegetable.

rained on, I now knew I needed it

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.590
to grow root strong,
deep in to the soil,

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.910
find water for my deserted
body to feed my mind.

Learn slowly that trees
can grow amongst fungus.

Feeling dread and sorrow
and worry and pain,

own body, step out of my coma,

how it feels to be addicted,

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.380
and rivers were the same
lukewarm blue of my bed sheets.

Thunder promised, but
didn't deliver last night.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.220
She's like a forlorn
and bewildered mommy.

I watch the wind whip the

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:36.790
looming like a funeral where
you aren't really sure who died.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.320
A mammoth hook of muddy water,

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.010
a can opener to the
[inaudible] of [inaudible] waves.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.420
I thought I knew.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.160
The day we ran out of hot water,

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.710
like we were always
running out of things.

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:48.120
Like time, and what to
say, and yellow light.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.090
All the things she doesn't
know, they're coursing

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.860
through carrot peels in my sink,
condemned to trickle in to sludge

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.620
and sand before reaching the ocean.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.160
We are both thirsty,
but it is careless

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.880
or cruelty watering the
street as well as the lawn.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.850
So the facts go damp
around their borders.

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.700

in to the closet

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.290

smell of hair oil and oranges.

And, mama, I don't know
where the river is.

myself to keep others warm,

When my little brother asks me,

all of his eight year
old body tremoring,

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:21.450
if monsters are real,
I want to lie to him.

That he has nothing to worry about.

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:34.880
And I know it sounds deceiving,
but if given the choice,

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.490
I would have chosen the ignorance.

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:39.340
The innocence.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.910
But sometimes we don't have
[inaudible] option, and the things

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:46.100
that happen to us, and the
lessons we learn far too quickly,

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.720
I have known monsters of men.

One who showed their things in the
prettiest of smiles and then draw me

in just close enough to
take a bite out of me.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:57.700 position:56%
And no matter how many times my
fists have made blow with his belly,

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:00.430
he still has not regurgitated
the piece of me he swallowed,

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.410
and I have grown far too fired
up asking to have it back.

01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:06.590
Because men like him have always
just taken what they wanted no

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:09.550
matter how many noes they have
had to swallow in the process

01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:13.610
or how much of his skin I have left
beneath my nails from the fight,

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:17.420
and it be the only
piece of me I have left.

01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:20.710
Along with the ache in
my chest mourning my soul

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:23.190
and innocence and the memories.

01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:28.910
Like the grasp of his fist or the
crack in my back or the feeling

01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:32.100
of the wall he pushed me against
while he tried to push in to me

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:38.080
or the sting of his,
"Don't tell nobody.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.220
Won't nobody believe you anyways."

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.810
And he was right.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:45.260
When I accused my best
friend of sexual assault,

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.260
everyone accused me of falsifying.

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.560

I called him monster.

01:08:56.930 --> 01:09:00.930
And they asked me what I
did to make him that way.

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:04.000
What a girl has to do to
cause someone so close to her

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.720
to commit such unspeakable acts.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.190
And maybe that's why they stay
silent through all of this.

he went off to find the next girl

he did me and call her best friend.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.870
Can we just recount this?

01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:05.170
Start the timer over?

01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:08.790 position:56%
Let's go back to before November
before we had a censored businessman

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:12.020
who has claimed bankruptcy six
times and in no time at all shut

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:14.630
down the investigation on
the Flint water crisis?

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:18.340
Poisoning my body by sponsoring
an anti-choice bill in a room full

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.200
of men that's mandating
mother, censored.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:25.290
Ban Muslim countries as if religion
has a physical location and as

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:28.930
if religion is the thing to
fear here, not that racist

01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.940
in an orange color stained suit.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:35.740
How did we mess up this bad here
in an inauguration speech written

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:38.390
to include the slogan for the KKK?

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:41.450
A vice who believes in
electrocuting queer teens.

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:46.950
Unrelated, but checking the
box for some election was hard.

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:52.020
Do you support accidental nuclear
war or purposeful genocide?

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.320
Great news.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.200
One box, not to name any
boxes by names, had both.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.500
And a lot of other stuff.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.740
I used to build box forts as a
child, but thankfully I grew up

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:04.740
and didn't move on
to building walls.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.500
I'm trying to tear them down, but
lately I've been too busy, I guess,

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:13.900
just surviving on cardboard I
guess, writing any news I can.

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:17.520
If someone's 140 characters
can ignite the whitest fire

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.820
in a neo Nazi's heart, I guess
mine should be able to smother it.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:27.620
Racial violence is rude and
terrible [inaudible] good blood

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.960
on tax payer lawns.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.110
America must stop this.

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:37.190 position:56%
Bad. My fingers are moving too fast.

01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.490
I lose track.

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:41.350
Typing class in elementary
taught me the base keys.

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:45.370
A. S. D. F. J. K. L. Semicolon.

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:50.140 position:56%
I'm thinking with all the education
cuts all someone's learning is A, M,

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:56.420
E, R, I, K, K, K. I'm not
as informed as I need to be,

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.850
trying to keep up, but the Fox
news commercials look so invited.

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:02.600
Yeah. I want to Sham Wow.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.930
Sop up the blood on the
streets they're trying to blame

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:09.810
on whatever minority
it is this week.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:12.150
Two months ago I wrote a poem.

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:17.880
I've kind of given up rewriting it
because we don't need a new start.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.450
We need a revolution.

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:22.070
Black lives matter.

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:23.950
The first pride was a riot.

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:25.550
Keep abortion legal.

01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:31.210
Feminism means nothing if
it is not intersectional.

01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:52.710
[ Applause ]

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:55.390
&gt;&gt; Joseph Green: Judges,
scores in 3, 2, 1.

01:18:55.390 --> 01:19:06.890
From low to high, I have an 8.4,
a 9.1, a 9.2, a 9.3, and a 10.

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:09.190
Clap it up for the poet.

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:19.030
[ Applause ]

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:20.330
You all ready for the last poem?

01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:22.200
Say, "Yeah."

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:30.510
Coming up next to the stage, please
put your hands together for Maya.

01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:39.500
[ Applause ]

01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:47.010
&gt;&gt; Maya: To every white
person who is surprised

01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:52.800
that racism still exists in
2017, did you think it died just

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.670
because we stopped
calling it a plantation?

01:19:55.670 --> 01:20:00.680
Is it because the owners look
more like Wall Street suit

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.880
and tie stockbrokers
trading children

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.110
from the city's poorest
schools for jail cells?

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:10.560
Do you think it died just because
the master has a badge now?

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.970
Why do you care so much that
he replaced his whip with a gun

01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:20.720
when his target was
always a black body?

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.290
Did you hope his shackles
wouldn't someday imprison your son?

01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:26.600
Or were you surprised
that some babies come

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:31.280
in to this world rope already
tied tight around their necks?

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.000
Did you find yourself at the
mercy of another headline hoping

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.850
that your son's name wouldn't
be mentioned next to Trayvon's

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:42.010
or Tamir's or [inaudible]
or Philando's?

01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:45.840 position:56%
Did you ever consider why after each

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.150
of those names the next
one never surprised you?

01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:53.380
Is it because your Facebook feed
can afford to be all cute kittens

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:54.680
and pumpkin spice lattes?

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.870
Did you not see the videos of black
and brown children's bodies traded

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:03.020
as trauma stories on white
people's Facebook pages

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.620
to prove how woke you are?

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.740
To prove how open your eyes are
because your eyes can afford

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.670
to be both blinking and alive?

01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:15.570
To prove that your heart
can be both beating

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:18.870
and be not asking to
get shot by a cop?

01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:23.480
Does it surprise you that black and
brown children raised under ball

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.140
and chain, clad in orange
jumpsuit, got paid nothing

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.260
to make your car's license plates?

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:34.170
To sew the stars on
your country's freedom?

01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:38.620
Did it surprise you when Heather
died because you thought people

01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.250 position:56%
who looked like you are bulletproof?

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:44.470
Or because you thought you'd
never have to find out.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.380
Does it surprise --
Will it surprise you

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:53.230
when police rob another
child of his life?

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:57.390
Use his skin color to determine
the quality of his education?

01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:59.660
The nutrition of his food?

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:03.100
Or will it only surprise you when
another army of white nationalists

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.460
with torch and swastika flag
march through the streets?

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.730
You say you don't see color.

01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:14.440 position:56%
So why is your Facebook page awfully
active when a white ally dies

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.090
for doing the right thing?

01:22:16.090 --> 01:22:20.960
But silent when a person
of color dies for existing?

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.270
You say you can't believe
how bad hate is in 2017,

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.400
but how many more bones
do you need to stand

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.070
on before you realize your
country was built on a graveyard?

01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:32.370
How many more souls have

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:38.140 position:56%
to lose their bodies before you stop
being surprised and start listening?

01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.680
Have you considered how much more

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.440
of your surprise this
world can tolerate?

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.370 position:56%
How many more headlines will it
take before you stop being surprised

01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:49.400
that racism still exists?

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.990
And start being angry?

have an 8.5, I have an 8.8,

01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:23.270
an 8.9, a 9.2, and a 9.9.

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:25.510

01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:36.890
You can't say I didn't tell you.

01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:41.930
May I have every poet that touched
the stage on the stage right now,

01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:43.500
please, while we are
tabulating the scores?

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.510
Can we give them the round of
applause that they deserve?

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:17.510

second, and third real quick?

01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:29.570
All right.

01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:30.870
All right.

01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:33.630
All right.

01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:37.590
So -- Because we are about to go
over time if we have not already.

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:41.290
I just want to say a couple things.

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:45.990
One, on behalf of Split This
Rock, we are so honored to be able

01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:47.420
to come and hold this space.

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.230
Thank you to the Library
of Congress.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:52.650
Thank you to the people at
the National Book Festival

01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:54.990
for making this possible.

01:24:54.990 --> 01:25:00.340
I would like to say that this
is just an ordinary thing,

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:04.600 position:56%
but we know that some of the words
that get said here are inflammatory.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.610
Or dangerous.

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:07.910
But true. Right?

01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:12.710
And until we live in a world
where we can just tell the truth

01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:15.450
and it doesn't have to be a
special occasion, we're still going

01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:18.830
to have these poetry readings
here, there, and everywhere

01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:26.310
because these young people
deserve, demand, have earned,

01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:31.140
will take the microphone as needed.

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.520
On behalf of Split This Rock
and the Library of Congress,

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.820 position:56%
I want to thank our esteemed judges.

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.670
Thank you so very much for
taking the time to be here.

01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:45.580
I would also like to thank the
National Endowment of the Arts.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:51.250
Yes. And I would also like to
ask you to keep fighting for it.

01:25:52.390 --> 01:26:04.450
And now since we had these judges
give numbers to score these poems,

01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:08.900
I'm going to tell you who
is third, second, and first.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.520
Knowing full well that we all won.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:20.980

and say hello to one of the poets.
