00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:01.501
- [Voiceover] Part Two, B.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.845
Region S is the base of a
solid whose cross sections

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:07.744
perpendicular to the x-axis are squares.

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:10.186
Find the volume of the solid.

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:10.847
Alright.

00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:13.681
So, region S, we see it right over here.

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.350
In the last part, we already
said that this function

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.707
is f, and this function is g.

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:21.502
Now, you could try out
some values and think about

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:24.520
how'd they behave, or you
could get a sense that, hey,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.796
like a fourth degree
quadratic's gonna have these ups

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:29.176
and downs like that
while the, the something,

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:31.195
well, this is, it has an
x term, but then it has an

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:32.567
exponential term right here.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.283
That might have more of a
kind of an upward trend,

00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:38.440
especially as x increases,
and then an upward trend also

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.902
as x becomes more and more negative.

00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:43.258
Because this exponent is
going to become positive.

00:00:43.258 --> 00:00:45.917
So, you can think about 'em
in different ways like that.

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:48.158
But what's important is region S.

00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:50.005
And there's a couple things
we have to think about.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:51.862
We have to think about
the bounds of region S.

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:55.191
We know that the upper bound
of region S, x is equal to,

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.260
we know x is equal to two here.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.544
But we don't know this
value right over here.

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:03.110
We don't know, let's just call that a.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.946
I'll put a question mark over there.

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:07.195
We don't know what this x value is.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.911
But we do know that at that x
value, the functions are going

00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:11.263
to be equal to each other.

00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:15.188
So, we know that f of
a is going to be equal

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:17.078
to g of a.

00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:19.738
Or, another way, in the last
section, we talked about

00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:21.791
the absolute value of f of
x minus g of x, which we've

00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:24.556
already inputed into our
calculator and saved it.

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:28.235
We could also say that the
absolute value of f of a

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:31.743
minus g of a is equal to zero.

00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:34.317
And you don't need the absolute
value there 'cause obviously

00:01:34.317 --> 00:01:36.456
the absolute value of
zero is going to be zero.

00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:38.580
But we've already inputed
this into our calculator.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.136
So, it's going to be useful.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:43.014
So, we can solve that thing we
inputed into our calculator.

00:01:43.014 --> 00:01:44.803
When does that equal zero?

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:47.545
And actually, let's just do
that right from the get go.

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:51.641
So, on our calculator, we
already inputed right over,

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:53.399
let's make sure it's on.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.344
In our calculator, we already
inputed the absolute value

00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:59.723
of f of x minus g of x.

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:01.956
And so, we can use our
solver now to figure out when

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.344
does that equal zero.

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:06.444
It actually equals zero just
into where we see it equals it

00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:08.465
one time, two times, and three times.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.566
So, we want to find this
place right over here.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:13.503
We want to figure out
what x is, or what a is.

00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:16.081
So, let's look at the math functions.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.020
Actually, let's clear this.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.039
And actually, let me quit that mode.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.176
And so, let's go to math.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:24.774
Scroll down to the Solver,

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:27.294
the Solver.

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:30.639
And let's see, we want to redefine.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.707
Okay, so we want to see, so
we could go to the orginal

00:02:32.707 --> 00:02:33.739
screen of the Solver.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.782
And actually, I did this
in the previous problem,

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:37.703
although we redefined y sub one.

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:41.240
But you say, okay, when
does zero equal y sub one,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.094
or when does y sub one,
that's this here, equal zero?

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:48.042
And so, you press Enter.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.621
And then, we can put in an initial guess.

00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:51.897
Let's look some place
in-between zero and two.

00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:53.720
So, I'll put in an initial guess of one.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.616
Now, let's see what it gravitates to.

00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:56.245
Oh, whoops.

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:59.953
And then, I could do alpha solve.

00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:03.421
Alpha solve, let's let it
munch on it a little bit.

00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.981
Let's let it munch.

00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:09.004
It's going.

00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:09.613
And there you go.

00:03:09.613 --> 00:03:11.941
It got to 1.03, which is the one we want.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.843
It didn't go to x equals
zero or x equals two.

00:03:14.843 --> 00:03:17.770
It went to 1.03.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.532
So, a is approximately equal to 1.03.

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:24.910
So, a is approximately equal to 1.03.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.326
And so, what interval do we take?

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:28.532
We don't want just the area of s.

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:30.308
We're saying that s is the base.

00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:32.386
And if we take

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.210
a cross section, we're gonna have squares.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.345
So, this is going to
be a base of a square.

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.272
So, this length right over here
is going to be the absolute

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:42.959
value of f of x

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.289
minus g of x.

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:46.969
That's the length of the base.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.698
But if we want the area of
that cross section, you can

00:03:49.698 --> 00:03:52.142
imagine, let me draw it at a
little bit of an angle here.

00:03:52.142 --> 00:03:54.128
So, you have a cross
section of a square there.

00:03:54.128 --> 00:03:56.508
You have a cross section of a square here.

00:03:56.508 --> 00:03:59.747
And so, the area of each of
those cross sections is going

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:02.371
to be the length of the base squared.

00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:05.245
And then, you multiply that
times the dxs, you get that

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.660
volume of each of those little sections.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.483
And you sum 'em all up, and
then, you are going to get

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:13.779
the volume of that figure.

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:17.540
So, the volume of that figure
is going to be equal to,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.387
so the volume is going to
be equal to the interval

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:27.281
from x equals a all the way,
so that's approximately,

00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:32.548
well, I'll just write a
over here to x equals two.

00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:35.996
Of this business, this is
the length of one side of

00:04:35.996 --> 00:04:36.860
the square.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.423
But we want to square it
'cause that's gonna give us

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.862
the area of that cross section.

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:43.020
And then, so let's do that.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.560
So, times, I could say the
absolute value of f of x

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.555
minus g of x.

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.333
I could just square that.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:54.004
Or, if I want, I could
just put parentheses there.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:55.838
I'll actually leave it as
absolute value since that's

00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:59.066
what I've already inputed
into my calculator.

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.316
And, so, that's gonna give
the area of each of those

00:05:02.316 --> 00:05:05.079
cross sections
perpendicular to the x-axis.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:07.472
And you multiply it times d
x, you get the volume of that

00:05:07.472 --> 00:05:08.450
little section.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.721
And then, you add 'em all up from

00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:13.225
x equals a to x equals two.

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:15.319
And luckily, we've already
done a lot of the work here

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.506
on our calculator.

00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:20.668
Our value of a is stored
in the variable x already.

00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:22.468
So, let me quit this.

00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:26.147
And then, so, let me go
back to my math functions.

00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:30.270
Let me go to definite interval
or a function interval.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.412
Select that.

00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:35.529
And now, I'm not gonna do y sub one.

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.580
I'm gonna do y sub one squared.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.573
So, let me go variables, y variables.

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:43.690
It's a function, y sub one.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.673
And I am going to, let me make sure.

00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:48.404
I'm going to square it.

00:05:48.404 --> 00:05:50.111
That's what I do right over here.

00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:52.293
My variable of integration is x.

00:05:52.293 --> 00:05:55.764
I'm going to do it from x.

00:05:55.764 --> 00:05:58.221
The value of a is stored in the variable x

00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.350
in my calculator right now.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.044
It's a little confusing.

00:06:00.044 --> 00:06:01.890
This first x is a variable of integration.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.614
The next x is my lower
bound of integration.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.430
And then, my upper bound is two.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.815
And so, the most complex part
here is some of the short cuts

00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:11.650
I'm doing with the calculator.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.076
And we let the calculator munch on it.

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:17.037
And it's approximately 1.283.

00:06:17.037 --> 00:06:19.541
So, it's approximately

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:23.671
1.283 cubic units.

00:06:23.671 --> 00:06:25.588
And we are done.
