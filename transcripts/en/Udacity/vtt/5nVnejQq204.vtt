00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this unit, we looked at growth and harvesting to study fundamental concepts

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in differential equations and simulations.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In particular, how to find optimal values for parameters and how to find

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which data are most critical for our simulation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The most fundamental concept of all, however, may be that of an equilibrium.

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is going to play a vital role in the next unit, may be design an anti-lock breaking system.
