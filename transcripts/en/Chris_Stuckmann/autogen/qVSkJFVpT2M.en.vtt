because in the past whenever a filmmaker

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
because in the past whenever a filmmaker
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.990
because in the past whenever a filmmaker
has said you know what look we need more

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000
has said you know what look we need more
 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.360

time to work on this it's generally a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370
time to work on this it's generally a
 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.890
time to work on this it's generally a
good choice because it shows that a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
good choice because it shows that a
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.330
good choice because it shows that a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
filmmaker isn't as concerned about
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.060

finances and things like that and coming

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070
finances and things like that and coming
 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.920
finances and things like that and coming
out at a certain time to make more money

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
out at a certain time to make more money
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.320
out at a certain time to make more money
that's what I'm worried this decision

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
that's what I'm worried this decision
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.880
that's what I'm worried this decision
might also be about and that would mean

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
might also be about and that would mean
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.830
might also be about and that would mean
that I do not like this choice this is

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840
that I do not like this choice this is
 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.270
that I do not like this choice this is
all behind the scenes stuff that I don't

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
all behind the scenes stuff that I don't
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160
all behind the scenes stuff that I don't
know about but I got to say if they're

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
know about but I got to say if they're
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.540
know about but I got to say if they're
just moving it to a different date

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550
just moving it to a different date
 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.130
just moving it to a different date
simply because there's less competition

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140
simply because there's less competition
 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.130
simply because there's less competition
then not a big fan of the choice but I'm

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
then not a big fan of the choice but I'm
 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.420
then not a big fan of the choice but I'm
really hoping that what it is is that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430
really hoping that what it is is that
 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.040
really hoping that what it is is that
they're just trying to make the best

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
they're just trying to make the best
