drummers I've ever seen in my life,

00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,890
I'm going to be at Madison Square Garden.

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,960
November 7th for the New York comedy
festival. Tickets are on sale now.

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,620
I believe that's a Wednesday Hump Day.
Everybody.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,200
Um, and uh, I didn't read
the one read. I had Hubble.

19
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,980
Everybody. Do you have eyes? Do they
not work as well as they should?

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,060
Do you like spending less money on
things more than more money on things?

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,220
Do you know what the Internet is?

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,110
If you answered yes to any or all
these questions than visit Hubble

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,070
contacts.com, uh, motivate your audience,

24
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:33,550
choose one or two. All right. I
guess these are positive things.

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,270
Talk about how you've been wearing
humbled contacts for the past 25 years.

26
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:41,110
I have it before I didn't see things and
now I see I didn't wear those fucking

27
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,160
things.
I don't have context.

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,110
I have no idea. I don't want
the same. These guys make
contact lenses and they're,

29
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,590
they're fucking great.
How was that? With humble,

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,060
you'll get a fresh pair of lenses for
every single day for less than 60,

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,530
for less. 60 contacts for
33 bucks. Do the math.

32
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:07,820
That's barely a dollar a day. This is
way more affordable than other brands.

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,510
Go to Hubble contacts.com and get
your first two weeks for free.

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,890
Hubble sells directly to you.

35
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,380
So they can offer context
at a more affordable price.

36
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,580
They can send you to an optometrist if
you don't have a prescription featured in

37
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:22,580
vogue, Gq, tech crunch, Mashable,

Thursday afternoon just before Friday.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,610

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,110
And with that, the other announcement I
have to make, I have a very special guest,

44
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:47,760
a long time waiting,

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,360
long time in the coming for
whatever fucking reason.

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,700
We've hung out a million times.
We never thought to do a podcast.

47
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,450
I didn't want to infringe
on the man's talents. Um,

48
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,740
please welcome Mr Tom Rhodes.
Yay. What's going? Yay from me.

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,710
What's up brother? How are you brother?
Um, I'm doing good man. I'm so psyched.

50
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,390
You're on a podcast. You're one of
the, one of the best comics I know.

51
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,080
I've known you for like,
I know I've known you for like 20,

52
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:17,080
I don't know how many years,
a long way back in la.

53
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,830
And I would say I was living in
New York like 98 99 was that it?

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,680
I think, yeah, maybe that was what it was.

55
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:30,010
I thought I met you in like 95 or
96 out here in la. He's out here.

56
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,110
Maybe briefly,

57
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,710
you probably walked by with your
romantic novel hair that you had back up.

58
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,940
Romance,
novel haircut.

59
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,740
I meet with my red Afro Two hacks
passing in the night. Right.

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,100
Trying to get better. And then, yeah.

61
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,670
And then I think the first time I like
officially kind of met you and was

62
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,970
hanging out back when we
both had folic strength. Yes.

63
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,500
And I was very excited that you knew who
I was because I had seen you at eating

64
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:58,030
it of all places, which is why I
became a huge fan of your standup.

65
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,540
I've told you this story before, but I'm
gonna tell the listeners where you were,

66
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,230
uh, you were talking about some sort of
extracurricular activity that you were

67
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:08,740
doing. I had done mushrooms in
Amsterdam and vulnerable park. Yes.

68
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,760
And I just remember you were describing
the whole fucking trip of it.

69
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,120
And I just remember you just at
one point you were just like,

70
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,670
I was running through the
grass summit tippy toes.

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,740
And it's just something about
that was like, you know,

72
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,270
there's w with alcohol,

73
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,630
there's nothing worse than just seeing
somebody who's like completely fucked up.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,790
But like with mushrooms,

75
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,750
there's like a oneness with the world
where you literally watching adult become

76
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:38,080
a child or something. I just thought you
described it. I've never taken mushrooms,

77
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,330
but like from what I've seen when
I've seen people tripping and I'm a,

78
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:42,151
I was there with,

79
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:45,010
with Nia way back in the day when
we were still boyfriend girlfriend.

80
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,170
And we would die in laughing.
And that became like, you
know, like one of the, uh,

81
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,660
a catch phrase for us.
You know,

82
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,080
we would just be walking
around the apartment and one
would be in the other room

83
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:56,620
and we just, we're just yelled that out
and run into the grass on my tippy toes.

84
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,990
We both would just start laughing.
That's the greatest compliment.

85
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,680
You could get one like a,
uh,

86
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,220
a joke or a sentence from a joke becomes
part of somebody's vernacular, you know?

87
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,050
Oh yeah, there's been a few.
There's the Dave Chappelle,

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,760
Dave Chappelle had a bit
about, uh, how, you know,

89
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,070
he likes eating chicken
and he's a black dude.

90
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,310
So there's that weird sort of stereotype.
But he's like, but, but I like it.

91
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,390
He goes, but I won't eat it
in public because he goes,

92
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:26,920
I'm afraid there'll be some white people
around going look at him. He loves it.

93
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,020
So just like the encyclopedia says,
it wasn't that the last line of that bit.

94
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,450
I don't remember. But I just remember
to this day, I know I can't eat this.

95
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,690
Thinking of that line. Well to this day
when me and Nia or hanging out, uh Oh,

96
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,490
if we're eating food and F if she go as a
taste, I go, oh, that's good. I like it.

97
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,150
And she'll just go look at him. He
loves it. Like it just, it's just,

98
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:53,140
there was a few of those. Yeah. Now
I've got to go through all of them.

99
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,100
Sarah Silverman,

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,030
Sarah Silverman said something about how
she prac bought condoms or something.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,750
I forget. I just remember that was the
punchline was cause I do a lot of fucking

102
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,890
neo was watching that we're in this
little one bedroom apartment is everything

103
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,370
is in New York little and I was shaving
in the other room and I just heard that

104
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,590
I didn't even really even here the setup,
which probably why I can't remember it,

105
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:19,160
but I just burst out laughing while
I was shaving. So, um, anyway,

106
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:23,410
you're part of my mount Rushmore
of lines that just never, it never,

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,470
it just never left my, my, my,
my head. I don't know why. So.

108
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,310
And furthermore other, you know,
I would say either you or Doug,

109
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:36,311
Stan hope have probably put the most like
stand up miles on the odometer as far

110
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,730
as the places that, that you've
played, how far you've gone. Um,

111
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,010
but I mean you might
have to be the king man.

112
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,220
You were telling me that at some point
in this podcast you are going to start

113
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,150
rattling off your dates.

114
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:54,410
If actually you sat down here looking
like you didn't have a care in the world

115
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:59,100
and you just casually mentioned to me that
you're off to Mongolia tomorrow. Yeah,

116
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,020
yeah. I would be a fucking wreck going
like, oh, I, what am I going to forget?

117
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:06,860
Something I would have to check 50 times
to make sure I have my passport and I

118
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,590
would stick it in the bag and I would
zip it shut and then look to make sure

119
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:12,950
that I would zip it shut again and then
I would still have to check it before I

120
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:17,210
left the house in the car on the way to
the airport before I started talking.

121
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,470
That anxiety down because I used

122
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,190
is my, um, Genghis Khan
biography to reread on the plane.

123
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:25,140
That's it. Is that how you
say it? It's not gang. Yeah.

124
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,190
I played in Mongolia last October and
it was freezing. It was in the third.

125
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:30,480
So this is the,
you're the only guy I know.

126
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:33,830
Not only is Benda Mongolia over
notice that he's return engagement was

127
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,660
triumphant return to Mongolia.
You asked him the Comedians,

128
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,610
they're wonderful guys.

129
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,990
I mean in Mongolians are beautiful and
they look like the people in the Avatar,

130
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:46,350
but without the blue. And, uh,

131
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,590
five of the low f five of the local
Mongolian comedians met me at the airport

132
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:55,800
when I arrived and they chow,
they cheered when I came out.

133
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,460
I'm like the most famous comedian
that's ever played in Mongolia,

134
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,870
so they'd like bend over
backwards showing me, uh,

135
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,470
Ulaan Baatar and we drove out to the,
uh,

136
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:10,830
the world's largest Genghis Khan statue.
And Yeah,

137
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,870
they taught me that it's a, it's Genghis
Khan not getting gifts and those, those,

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,490
well, I like a, you're not
obnoxious with that information.

139
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,510
You could be really conti at a party.
Uh, excuse me guys. I don't interrupt.

140
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,160
It's Genghis Khan,
Huh?

141
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,150
Yeah.
And Americans and other people say though,

142
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,880
they call those white round tents a Yurts,

143
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:33,860
but they actually call them GIRs
in Mongolia. So what's, what's the,

144
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:34,694
uh,

145
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,900
I don't know anything about it other than
it's just sort of spoons with northern

146
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:43,780
China. It's between them and Russia
and China and Russia. And, uh,

147
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,910
so I liked it so much and um,

148
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,620
I wanted to go back in summer and see it
when it wasn't, um, bone chilling cold.

149
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:56,280
So it's kind of, um,
uh, vacation. So I mean,

150
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,210
I'm going to do a gig there,

151
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,270
but I'm going to go in and I'm
going to spend like four days there.

152
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,000
These guys are going to take
me way out into the country.

153
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,690
We're going to sleep in a girl,
one of those round tents. Um,

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,160
shoot life, shoot some
arrows, do some, uh,

155
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:15,720
do some Mongolian warrior activities.
And then I got a Gig.

156
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,730
You've got to tell Rogan about this.

157
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,220
Rogan sounds like he would be all
over the country. Would love it.

158
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm sure you would love it.
It's um, you know, that's the,

159
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,640
I've shot some arrows in my time.
I went,

160
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:30,500
I went both fishing and some by you down
and fucking hour with o was somewhere

161
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,760
outside of New Orleans.

162
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,730
It's a great thing about being a comedian.
I remember I was in Alaska years ago.

163
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:39,731
I did a Gig in Ketchikan and I met the
perfect Alaskan Guy who took me fishing

164
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:44,510
on his charter boat and
then took me skeet shooting.

165
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,470
I obviously feel like
when you meet those guys,

166
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:50,010
there's always some sort of like raggedy
plane you get in first that lands on

167
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:53,350
water or they put snowshoes
on bottom of it plays

168
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,660
upon tune. Um, so let's see. Uh, you know,

169
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,730
you're the only guy I know
that it's played Vietnam.

170
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,240
I love Vietnam. You know, my, my,

171
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,220
you're the, I know that watches like
Ken Burns documentaries. Like, yeah,

172
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:11,430
I've been there. I've played there.
Yeah, I know what it looks like. No,

173
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,264
I've done all of that.

174
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,790
Um, I, you know, well,

175
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:19,791
I did that special for comedy
central in 1995 called Viva Vietnam.

176
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,940
I W I got to go to Vietnam. You've
been going there? I was over the years.

177
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,450
Yeah.

178
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,230
I was the first comedian ever to have a
development deal with comedy central and

179
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:35,400
so I could do whatever I wanted. It was
like being a junior filmmaker almost, so.

180
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,140
Oh. And they were sitting 94. Bill
Clinton lifted the travel ban on Vietnam,

181
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,170
the way like Obama lifted the travel
ban on Cuba and my father fought in

182
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,890
Vietnam. He flew helicopters. He was
shot down everyone in his helicopter.

183
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,430
Can you tell that story?
Uh, yeah. Quickly. Yeah. So,

184
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:58,050
and this is why Vietnam has
always been a really important,

185
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,830
it's a been a big thing in our family.
Um,

186
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,000
so my father flew helicopters
in Vietnam in 1969.

187
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,030
He was stationed in play cool. And, uh,

188
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,920
he, there was, there was all these
soldiers stuck on the ground.

189
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:18,780
They're surrounded by, uh, the
north Vietnamese soldiers in there.

190
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:19,920
They're just getting slaughtered.

191
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,630
So my father had to fly in and rescue
these guys. How old was he? Um,

192
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,040
he actually joined my, my dad was one
of those knuckleheads, so he was 30.

193
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,270
His,
uh,

194
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,440
his buddies in his unit
called him Methuselah because
he was like the oldest guy

195
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,340
there because everybody else was 19.
You know, he just thought, you know,

196
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,100
he grew up on John Wayne movies.
He thought that, you know,

197
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,550
he was one of those guys that thought
you have in your country needed you,

198
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,670
you know, so, uh, they made, he made,

199
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,920
I got the letter from the army,
uh, and all his metals, um,

200
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,600
after he died.
Uh,

201
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:59,380
so he made three attempts to
land to save these guys and was,

202
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,380
it took so much heavy fire,
he had to lift up,

203
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:07,381
circle around and on the fourth attempt
he gets down and there's like 20 guys

204
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,750
down there is still alive
and it's life or death.

205
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,750
So they all like jump on the
helicopter and as he's pulling up,

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,340
you know, and these just getting
rattled with so much, um,

207
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,510
fire machine gun fire that the helicopter
nose dived down and everybody died in

208
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:30,430
the helicopter except for him and his
copilot who was knocked unconscious,

209
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,840
he unhooks him, drags him across
the field under heavy fire.

210
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:39,580
And then they had to wait there for
like an hour or two before someone could

211
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:43,850
come in and rescue. Was he shooting back
at them or what? Well, it's funny, he,

212
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,430
cause he, you know, he, my dad, uh,

213
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,560
would laugh when he tells his story
because he always had this pistol that he

214
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,690
would take with him when he,
when he was flying.

215
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:57,190
And then the one day he forgot it, he gets
shot down. So he wasn't shooting back,

216
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:00,070
he didn't have a gun. So, um,

217
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,700
my dad was a decorated war hero and he,
um,

218
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,720
he got like five medals for
the men over your house. He,
uh, Tom has it framed. Yes.

219
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,740
The letter and, and
there's like, you know,

220
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,640
the little from the army is saying what
he did from his commanding officer and

221
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,220
there's almost not enough room in the
frame for all of them as like five,

222
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,250
there's like six medals,
but five were from that one incident.

223
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:25,360
He got the distinguished
flying cross and, and, uh, my,

224
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:30,090
my father, um, is buried in Arlington
national cemetery as they should be.

225
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:33,550
And you gotta be a bad ass to get in
there. You know, I would say he qualifies.

226
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,850
So my dad, uh, probably be
buried across the street.

227
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,470
I'm like sort of a seven, 11.
I want a viking funeral pyre.

228
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,130
Um, so, so my dad,
every year he would get,

229
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:49,870
he would have a reunion with his Vietnam
veteran helicopter buddies. It was like,

230
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,210
um, big thing for him. Uh,
and uh, and, and you know,

231
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,800
my dad also loved stand up comedy.

232
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,240
My Dad loved prior and my dad's the reason
I'm a comedian, you know, you yet all.

233
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,780
I remember driving around with it as a
little kid listening to Richard Pryor

234
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:07,960
with my dad. So as he thrilled that
you became a comedian. Oh yeah.

235
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:11,790
My Dad drove me to my first open
mic night. My Dad, my dad, see,

236
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,740
I looked at him and Tommy,

237
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,760
so my dad stand up comedy was always
revered in my family and well especially,

238
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,100
you know, because my dad and he just, uh,

239
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,590
my dad wore shipped prior.

240
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:28,270
He had a Bob Newhart records
and JC great taste too. Yeah.

241
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,830
So I, I, um,

242
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,370
I think those were like my two
biggest influences as a kid.

243
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:38,170
And then my family is from Washington
DC and my uncle did open mic nights for

244
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:42,040
one year in 1978.
I'm 11 years old.

245
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:47,041
My Dad took me to see my uncle perform
at this open mic night and it was a club

246
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:51,860
called El Brooklyn's in DC.
And the entrance was next to the stage,

247
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,770
the shows in progress.
We walk in,

248
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,260
I'm wearing a Washington Redskins jacket.

249
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,490
The comedian on stage pulls me on
stage and he starts interviewing me.

250
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:06,290
Like I'm the coach of the Redskins and
I'm like, I'm 11. I'm mum's a bashful,

251
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:11,150
dopey kid. I give you one
word answers. Yes, no,

252
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,010
but I'll never forget standing on that
stage and seeing all those happy people

253
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,640
with their heads thrown back and laughter
and all the teeth in their mouth.

254
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,610
And that moment changed my life. And
I, you know, and I, I just, I can,

255
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,710
I can still picture it. You know,
it's, I, you know, um, you know,

256
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,210
black people, Latin people,
white people, like Asian people,

257
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:34,220
just the flavors of humanity.

258
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,960
And I just thought that that was the most
magical place in the world to stand on

259
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:42,200
stage, making people laugh. So, um,

260
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:47,201
I became a student of comedy after
that and would keep notebooks.

261
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:51,570
And then I started when I was 17 with
a fake idea. You still have all your

262
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,710
comedy, like you like your,
your apartment, first of
all, it's cool as shit.

263
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,470
It's also like this,
uh,

264
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,740
it's the Smithsonian of your life and he
has his dad's helmet from Vietnam when

265
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:08,550
he was shot, the one that he was wearing.
Um, I got chills looking at that thing.

266
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,770
Yeah. Like that's like a imagine like
you brain when he was aware of that. Yes.

267
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,210
And you had told me the story as we
were sitting there smoking a wonderful

268
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,560
cigar.
Uh,

269
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,860
and you told me this story and then to
New York and I still have the helmet and

270
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,570
I was like, Oh wow,
man, I couldn't believe.

271
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:28,390
And then to walk in and see it and
after and just the heaviness of it once,

272
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:31,860
it's like a story attached to it. Like
if you just got a helmet and it was like,

273
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:35,610
yeah, this is like, uh, you know,
some memorabilia thing. This is,

274
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,610
and you have to wonder what
have to actually know what
happened while that thing

275
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:42,990
was. I mean I'm into that type of shit.
Like I got that weird thing of like,

276
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,270
um, if I know the story behind it, which
is why I have to be careful because I'll,

277
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:50,760
I'll just fill my house up
with a bunch of shit like that.

278
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:54,270
And then I have all this fucking anxiety
that I have no place to send anything

279
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,104
down.
You know,

280
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,590
I can't have this thing cause I kinda
grew up with semi hoarders that just would

281
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:03,210
not fucking throw anything out, you
know, 40 years of magazines and Shit. Um,

282
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,110
no, that's a good thing about, you know,
I had everything in storage for 10 years.

283
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,770
I just traveled the world.
I decided not to live anywhere.

284
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,580
Do you think can see that. So I got to
preserve all these great things, you know.

285
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,161
But do you think,

286
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:19,110
you think your dad being in Vietnam
and then you learning about that,

287
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:21,630
is that how you got the travel bug
to the level you that you're on?

288
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:23,290
Like some Tom Brokaw level shit?
Yeah,

289
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,400
maybe. And my mother's from Argentina.
Um, so I don't know. I mean,

290
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:32,960
I had performed everywhere in
the United States, you know, 20,

291
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:37,880
30 times and I wanted to
branch out. Um, but, but,

292
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,140
but,
but back to Vietnam,

293
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,650
I mean that was a really special
thing for me to go there.

294
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,610
And I filmed this hour special called
Viva Vietnam for comedy central.

295
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,660
I was like a travel log type of thing.
Um,

296
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,960
did the Jane Fonda workout tape in Hanoi
with some old women in a park when that

297
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,030
Denang China beach setup a slip.

298
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,370
CIA people about why Jane
Fonda is funny for that. Uh,

299
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,180
Vietnam veterans hate Jane Fonda's
guts still to this day. Veterans, um,

300
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,610
at those Vietnam reunions,
my dad would go to,

301
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:16,470
they still sell the Jane
Fonda, um, urine, uh,

302
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,530
the thing for like a urinal
guard with her picture on it.

303
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,100
You know what I'm saying? A
urinal cake. Yeah. It was a no,

304
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,640
like the little plastic thing
on it. Oh yeah. Okay. Um,

305
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,260
and so at the height of the Vietnam war,
Jane Fonda goes to Hanoi.

306
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,990
The, um, uh,

307
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:38,991
the capital of the people were having
a war with and she's antiwar and,

308
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,300
and,
and they took pictures of her own,

309
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,700
like anti aircraft artillery and,

310
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,270
and then she met the POW [inaudible] and
one of them slipped her a note and then

311
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:54,150
she, uh, apparently, if I
remember the story correctly,

312
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:59,151
she gave that to the Vietnamese
prison guards and Oh God,

313
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,170
who was tortured extra for, I'm slipping
her a note. Oh God, that's fine.

314
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,090
That's has to be the ultimate,
uh, stupid celebrity moment.

315
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,020
Yeah. Where you're, you're
just so like, you know,

316
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,690
sucking the Dick of your
own fucking ego that you,

317
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:20,290
you go and do something like that to just,
well, I think being against a war zone,

318
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,460
okay, that's fine. Do that.

319
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,370
You'll go to the Capitol and I've watched
enough war movies that my heart would

320
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:29,550
be in my fucking throat. The second
you get the note, you're like,

321
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,040
do I got to put this under my
tongue and put it up my ass? Like,

322
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,330
what do I gotta do? I gotta do it. I
know this is like some top secret shit.

323
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:40,180
Shitty. Yeah. Um, but so
in, in 1990, we filmed it,

324
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:45,020
it was me, guard came at you mad,

325
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,490
slipped me a note.
Um,

326
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,480
he'll need extra bamboo
under his fingernails. Uh,

327
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,920
so 19 September [inaudible] 94
we filmed it and like Americans,

328
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,620
it was only like, that's, that went there.

329
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:02,840
Like it hadn't become like a tourist
place yet. So, and this park in,

330
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:07,380
in Hanoi, a old women would gather
and do Tai Chi in the morning.

331
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,980
So at the time in [inaudible]
94, beginning, early nineties,

332
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:15,981
Jane Fonda was making these exercise tapes
and we set up a television with a VCR

333
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,910
and we brought the tape
and 1994 technology,

334
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:25,390
we had to run an extension
cord like five blocks to,

335
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,770
to set this up in the park.
And these old women loved it.

336
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:33,000
They took to it and they started doing
it and she was, I turned it as she goes,

337
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:37,640
now turned to the right and I'll say,
I'll say she turned to the right. Did you,

338
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,940
did you see,
uh,

339
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,950
can you imagine her fucking agent
when she was telling them that,

340
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,320
I'm going to go to North Vietnam?
He's just sitting that Jane,

341
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,250
I've worked so hard with you
to get you to this level.

342
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,850
I'm imploring you not
to do this. Oh, Marie,

343
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,510
the a bed bed bed.
Uh,

344
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,770
Mary Tyler Moore episode. Um, God,

345
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:05,470
what a fuck he sort of like
the first Dennis Rodman.

346
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,940
Like when by the time Dennis did it, it
was just, just been so much. First of all,

347
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:14,500
they didn't have our guys, you know,
in, in p and W. Yeah. Yeah. And uh,

348
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,520
well, I mean, you know, um, what
was that guy's name? Otto warm beer.

349
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,050
It was a guy that I have no clue who
that is. Did he played for the Bengals?

350
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:26,410
I'm the only one who remembers this
guy's name. I think he was from Chicago.

351
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:31,120
He was there. He went to North
Korea and vacation a few years ago.

352
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,440
And he stole a banner out of the basement
of a hotel. Yeah. And they sent him,

353
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,040
sentenced him to, you
know, hard labor for life.

354
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,880
And then they came back a year later.
They sent him back as a vegetable.

355
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,260
There was in a coma. Yeah. And he died.
Yeah, he died. It's heartbreaking stories.

356
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,050
So yeah, he went up, he went
in there and like, yeah,

357
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,540
it took that poster, whatever, which
is, you know, something you don't do.

358
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,440
I remember somebody on, on,
on the Internet, it was like,

359
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,380
as you example of white privilege,
oh my God. It's just like, even this,

360
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:05,620
you have to turn into that. Yeah.
Can't we all just be like, wow,

361
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,730
that's somebody's son. Yeah. You
know, can't, can't you just do that?

362
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:14,650
Do you have to turn it into like a
fucking Hashtag, uh, social justice,

363
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:19,030
whatever fucking moment. Everyone's
being dehumanized. Yeah. I mean, I dunno,

364
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,340
that was one of those six months or so.

365
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:24,010
I can understand why anybody
would go to Vietnam on vacation.

366
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:27,520
They killed so many of our, she knew
so many people that died, you know,

367
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,890
and I went back in 2014.
Hennoi was my favorite.

368
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,750
It's French tree lined boulevards.
It's really, uh, the lake.

369
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:41,560
The John Mccain was shot down
in, uh, in the whole town.

370
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:46,540
Has Swan boats now has now has swan peddle
boats. No, it doesn't. I told you that.

371
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,350
Did you tell me that? I did tell you that
was just use my Boston background. Yeah,

372
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,270
you can rent couples.
Go there and rent swan paddle boats.

373
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,530
See that's why I don't watch people
stand up specials because things stick in

374
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,680
years.
I forget cause I was sitting there like,

375
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,380
oh I'm going to throw in the swan
joke thing from when I got back.

376
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,080
So I went in 2014.

377
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:13,081
This English guy who runs the Gig there
and annoying also gives motorcycle tours

378
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:14,890
of the north in Vietnam.

379
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:19,080
So I went back April of this year and um,

380
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,190
I went on this,
if it was my,

381
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,440
my dream to go on this motorcycle journey
and we were 45 miles north of Hanoi

382
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,510
going up a mountain,
a little winding road,

383
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,870
and the bike went out from
under me and I wrecked and say,

384
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,880
how good are right around you.

385
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,990
I was the fourth time I've been on
a motorcycle and I've been afraid of

386
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:45,950
motorcycles my whole life. So it was
something I wanted to do to break my fear.

387
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,110
And, uh, just wearing a helmet.
My head bounced off the road,

388
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,150
but I was fine. And, uh, took
a lot of skin off my elbow, but

389
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,160
I think it just taking the safety course
out here, we ride around a parking lot.

390
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,420
My wife's brother,

391
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,100
my wife is from Holland and her brother
teaches motorcycle lessons in Rotterdam.

392
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,780
So last summer when I was in
Rotterdam visiting her family, uh,

393
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,180
he took me out and, and he and I
did that in the parking lot. Okay.

394
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,423
So I did

395
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,150
then how long between that and then
just writing up a fucking mountain in

396
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:21,830
Vietnam? Uh, what,

397
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,820
eight, 10 months later I do this.
I took my ground school and,

398
00:24:26,821 --> 00:24:28,140
uh,
didn't fly again.

399
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:32,000
And eight months later I decided to fly
in fight or a dirt bike when I was a

400
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:37,001
hurricane and I like tore a tendon in
my arm and I missed a baseball season,

401
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:41,460
which was a big deal when you're
14. Yeah. And uh, and then I didn't,

402
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,690
when I lived in Amsterdam and
I had the, uh, worked, uh,

403
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,970
for this Dutch travel show for a year,

404
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,200
I got to do a highlight on Peru
and we went to the Nazca lines.

405
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,190
You know those lines that people
think are alien landing strips.

406
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:58,920
They weren't discovered until the 1920s.
That shit on

407
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,100
not cover that Zeplin box
set. Uh, you're talking about,

408
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,830
cause I really dumb guy here, dude.
I don't, I don't, that's weird.

409
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:08,490
You'd like talk in English, but half of
this shit you're saying I don't, I don't,

410
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm just like, I don't know what that is.
I'm just, this is taking me back to the

411
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,533
cool,
well I'm just like,

412
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,200
there's these desert drawings and they
weren't discovered until the 1920s when

413
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:18,240
aircraft was um,

414
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,270
first flying over Peru and one's that
Condura one's a monkey and then there's

415
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,860
the, looks like these landing
strips in between it and um,

416
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,101
yeah.

417
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:32,940
Why would you make it like that if
everyone didn't know how to fly back then?

418
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,600
Right. Is that what they, they asked it

419
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,990
like a thousand years old.
It's,

420
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:38,990
how could they have done it
unless aliens helped them?

421
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,310
Maybe just, maybe that's the theory. They

422
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,960
develop some sort of hot air
balloon before anybody else.

423
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,760
And then they all perished in some
sort of a plague and there, you know,

424
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,890
everything was biodegradable back then.

425
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:55,460
How you're going to find
the hot air balloon. It can,

426
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:56,950
it doesn't always have
to be aliens doesn't,

427
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,620
yeah. I used to do a line years
ago that a, the Incas did cocaine,

428
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,200
I guess that explains why
they were building, uh,

429
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,690
alien UFO lending strips in the desert
all night.

430
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,590
Um, tell me about a couple
of things I want to ask.

431
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:18,060
One of my favorite podcast episodes ever
was the one that you did with the late

432
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:20,880
great John Fox, who was, I never met him,

433
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,830
but I heard all of the
stories. He was like, um,

434
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,730
road viking. I mean, he, like every, he,

435
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,330
he created the cliches.
Like he was kind like,

436
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:39,290
uh, the like, I don't know,
the Elvis or like, you know,

437
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:44,450
the early days of rock and
roll where there was no, you
know, go out and go create

438
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,450
it and create what the fuck
this is going to be. And he,

439
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:52,280
he kind of did that as far as
every fucking cliche now, um,

440
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,260
that guy was,
and listening to that podcast with him,

441
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,790
because I'd only heard of him
and I never really, you know,

442
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,070
there's all these short little clips of
him on the Internet just to get like an

443
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,190
hour, an hour and 10 minutes, however
long it is of him telling stories.

444
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,460
And then just hearing the
stories in his voice like that.

445
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,390
I that crazy laugh he head,
oh my God.

446
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,810
Oh my God. Like, uh, amazing.

447
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,080
How did you get like everybody on my,

448
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,760
on my buddy Paul Versey met him
and was like, man, that guy was,

449
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:24,310
he was a fucking sweetheart and verse.

450
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:27,650
He met them right towards the end and
he actually who they are working like

451
00:27:27,651 --> 00:27:32,180
Milwaukee or something and he watched
his set and actually gave him a couple of

452
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:36,920
tags, encouraged him and all of that. And
I don't know if he was sick yet, but um,

453
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,800
he just was all mad. He was like the
nicest guy and all of that type of stuff.

454
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:44,660
So I'm so glad that you did that episode,
but how did you get to meet John?

455
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,360
Um, I worked with him when I was
really young. I think I was, I,

456
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,850
I was 19 when I worked with
him in Jacksonville, Florida.

457
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:54,140
There used to be a punchline there.

458
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:58,160
It was a great room and I used
to do the comedy zone down there.

459
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:03,590
This was way before that. You know, the,
the Atlanta punchline in the, in the boom,

460
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:08,180
in the late eighties there was punchline
comedy clubs all over the south.

461
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,590
And the one in Jacksonville was one of
the best and the guys that owned it,

462
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,940
it was like four guys and then they
all got like Mercedes and BMWs and then

463
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,600
they're breaking in so much money.
They moved it to a bigger venue.

464
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,420
They had like 150 seat room.

465
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,050
Then they moved it to a 500 seat room
and the place was never the same.

466
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:28,370
And then it went out of business.

467
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,140
But at one time that was like one of the
W it was one of the greatest clubs in

468
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:36,980
the south. So I worked
with him. And you know,

469
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:41,660
John Fox was legendary for kind of being
a womanizer, coke freak, booze hound,

470
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:45,560
all that. Chan I check he liked me. Um,

471
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,450
because I I could drink heavily and um,

472
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,480
I I was row relatively cute and um,

473
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,740
you track some late would attracts
some ladies. So he still had,

474
00:28:57,741 --> 00:28:59,300
he was on one of the first

475
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,890
right, right. That is,

476
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,890
that is next level like getting pussy
where it's just that remind me of Pedro

477
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,100
Martinez when he lost the
heat on his fast ball.

478
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:13,790
So he developed a couple other pitches
and he was able to stay in the league at

479
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,624
a high level.

480
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,170
So he's sitting there crushing ass cause
he was a good looking guy when he was

481
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:21,080
young. Right. Blonde hair had
the mullet, which was the look,

482
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,110
the whole Miami vice oak he
could pull up was crushing as,

483
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,470
and then all of a sudden he starts
[inaudible] loses a little heat on his

484
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,170
fastball is like, here's a good
look. You look looking young fella,

485
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,830
I'll bring him along. That'll keep
bringing the ladies up to the light here.

486
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,400
That's the thing. Yeah. I think

487
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,470
people don't remember, don't think of
when they think of him when he could.

488
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,180
He was on one of those early
Rodney Dangerfield young comedian,

489
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,480
and he looked like a California
surfer guy. He had blonde hair,

490
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,210
Tan, he's a Tan, great shape.

491
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,710
And then he got older and Pudgy and
he looked like an older white guy,

492
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:57,310
alcoholic dude. So, um, the
life caught up with him.

493
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,320
He helped me get in.

494
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,770
He loved me and he helped me get in with
Chicago xannies where he was the man

495
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:10,750
and you know, that was his hometown. He
was from Waukegan, Illinois. But, um,

496
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,460
he was mister Chicago,

497
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,740
so he gets me work with him in
Chicago, booked like three weeks, uh,

498
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,160
the downtown room and a couple of the
suburban rooms for a couple of weeks.

499
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,340
I'm 19. I'd never been to Chicago, uh,

500
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:28,870
and it was sold out every
night and he was the man, uh,

501
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Saika one of those porn star came
and he took me to the blues brothers,

502
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:39,511
had a bar or doing cocaine after
hours off to the pinball machine.

503
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,620
He took me, he took me to a cubs
game. He took you under his wing.

504
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,180
He took me under his wing, but it
was great. I mean, uh, you know,

505
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,270
I'd only been doing comedy for two years
and now I'm in Chicago playing and sold

506
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:54,550
out rooms opening for this guy.

507
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,350
But he took me to see
the cubs and he was a,

508
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:01,900
he was kind of a Chicago celebrity back.
Yeah.

509
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,230
And he was buddies with Steve
Stone and he actually took me up,

510
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,040
we got to go up into the booth when
Harry Carey's saying take me out to the

511
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:16,270
ballgame. And like, Harry Carey's
like, you know, half in the bag,

512
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:18,640
leaning out the window and,
um,

513
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,390
the had to hold his belt so
he didn't fall out. I mean,

514
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,050
who lead a better life than that guy
gets to announce baseball while he's just

515
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,230
catching a buzz. And everybody's thought
it was hilarious that he was like,

516
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,080
he was literally drunk. Yeah. On
the, yeah. In the afternoon there.

517
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,220
So, um, yeah, so I mean, you know, uh,

518
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:44,300
John Fox was really nice to me and I
knew him through the years and then, uh,

519
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,560
the trials and tribulations
and bad relationships and
years of booze and excess,

520
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,080
uh, it was kind of sad what, I mean,

521
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:56,740
he was kind of the cautionary tale of,
you know,

522
00:31:56,741 --> 00:32:01,330
you don't want to be this road guy who um,

523
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,520
is just chasing women in partying
and stuff forever because it,

524
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,370
uh,
it was really a sad end for that guy.

525
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,430
And then he lived in the
apartment building next door
to the apartment where the

526
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,380
xannies puts the comedians in
Chicago. It's an old town. And,

527
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,360
uh,
there's the old town Ale House,

528
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,830
which I remember him taking me there
and all these, that area in the,

529
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,540
in the late eighties was Graham a kid.
And it was, you know, it was so much fun.

530
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,990
And then, uh, he was kind of like sad,

531
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:40,040
lonely drunk guy at the old town. Alehouse
towards the end or was towards the

532
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,960
end, like when, when
did it start becoming,

533
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,780
when did it sort of shift
where the industry wasn't,

534
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,740
he stopped getting work and,
um, and I, I sat in the night,

535
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,970
Nah,
I can't remember.

536
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,760
I can't remember what year I
did that recording with him.

537
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,850
I don't think it was the nineties,
cause when I was, no, no,

538
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,440
it was asked early thousands. Yeah.
Cause when I was in the nineties,

539
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,060
when I was starting to get out
there on the road, it was, uh,

540
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,700
I would hear legendary stories about him.
And then everywhere I had just been,

541
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,601
it seemed,

542
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:16,601
Doug Stan hope was there and had some
sort of debauchery in the fucking green

543
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:21,050
room. And I remember the first time
I met Doug Stanhope, uh, you know,

544
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:24,230
I instantly loved the guy,
but before I met him I was like,

545
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,200
who the fuck is this Stan Hope Guy?
What the fuck can he, you know,

546
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,750
do all this shit outside of the Goddamn,
uh,

547
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,640
the comedy condo and a, but I
would always hear like, oh my God,

548
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:37,820
the Atlanta punchline, they,
they used to have stories.

549
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,890
I know there's a couple of
guys who was still alive,

550
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:42,020
so I don't want to fucking
put this shit out there.

551
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:47,021
But there was like a couple of guys on
that Mount Rushmore of like the wait

552
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:52,430
staff would be so excited
that they were coming to town.

553
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,100
And after like maybe a night and a half,

554
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,480
like that Sunday night show seemed like
three years away and they would just

555
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:00,770
like,
I don't think I'm going to make it.

556
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,090
Because there was those guys
that came to town and they just,

557
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,690
they were like this pied Piper
in the entire fucking wait staff.

558
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:12,590
They had this charisma. All the
bartenders, the club owners, they,

559
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,580
he would just take them on
a crawl night after night,

560
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,750
after fucking night. And
yeah, and like, I mean, I, uh,

561
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:23,330
this other guy that I know of,
well I'm not gonna mention his name,

562
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,980
like he had a nickname and all that,

563
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,650
and you would pick up the phone and he
would just, he would say anything like,

564
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,510
Tom, like Yanni bills, it's so and so.

565
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,470
And the running joke was you would just
scream in horror knowing that he was

566
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,310
coming to town,

567
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,670
he was going to stay with you and that
you guys were going to be hitting a

568
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:41,240
bottle or two every f it would be
like trying to keep up with Lemmy,

569
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:41,841
some of these guys.

570
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:45,190
That reminds me of something like
the Lemmy Motorhead stories, um,

571
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,250
that you hear him so

572
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,870
well. You don't have the, um, the,

573
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,860
the albums in the
following to fall back on.

574
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,510
Like I remember anything John Fox
when he was still like surfer,

575
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,710
good looking guy.
Uh,

576
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:02,120
I remember he would walk by the
waitress station and he would go, um,

577
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,780
he would just announce
fuck me before him famous.

578
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,420
He would say that out loud to the,

579
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,250
to the way he never would have survived
the me too movement. Oh my God. Wow.

580
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,840
But so when he was so
towards the end and you know,

581
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:20,000
and I always had a soft spot in that
from a hurt for the guy because he helped

582
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,450
me when I was a young comedian. And, uh,

583
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,220
so I did that interview with
him. And, um, the thing that I,

584
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:31,940
that stands out for me on that interview
that I did with him. Oh, so there was,

585
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:34,550
there was one when it,
when it got sad for him,

586
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,720
I remember there was some
turbulent, he was in and, and uh,

587
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,660
he was falling apart and as a,

588
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:46,350
as an alcoholic and he's in this
terrible relationship and the girl had

589
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:49,140
scratched his face,
like really bad.

590
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,980
And so he had all these scratch
marks on his face. And uh,

591
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,850
there was a story in Atlanta about him
breaking down on stage and crying and

592
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,580
just some really sad stories
and shit that happened to him.

593
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:01,860
But the thing that stands
out fucking movie. Yeah.

594
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,940
The thing that stands out for me about
that interview was did he still believed

595
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:08,700
in love?
He's talking about,

596
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,470
and he had been through all this shit in
his life and you know, he's, he's older,

597
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,304
Pudgy,

598
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,870
alcoholic guy past his prime and he's
still talking about love and it's like

599
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:23,450
raging bull. But the stand up version,
like the narrow back in the day Co,

600
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,990
he could've played John Fox like the
John Fox story. It's the same thing.

601
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:32,790
And in the end he ends up doing stand
up in raging bull. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

602
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,110
Um, well you, uh, you, you
cleaned up your act how long ago?

603
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,070
Uh,
I've been so good.

604
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,580
We're four, almost five years.
That's fucking amazing. I've been a,

605
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:46,370
I finally kind of cleaned up my act.
I don't like,

606
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,380
I don't think I would ever
not do it again, but like,

607
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,150
I drank like the last day of
June and then I drank, uh,

608
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,750
August 7th,
and I'm not going to drink again.

609
00:36:55,751 --> 00:37:00,751
Select October now I sort of drink like
the way I smoke cigars or I should say

610
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:03,920
the way I would like to smoke
cigars, which I like, you know,

611
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,970
a couple times a month or every other
month or something like that. Uh,

612
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,900
you know, um, I'm trying to
like, you know, I've got a kid,

613
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm a super old fucking dad to have a kid,

614
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:19,290
so it's just like I have to
fucking be around until this,

615
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,380
my kid has it figured out.

616
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,151
Yeah.
Every,

617
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:27,151
every warrior needs to move onto
Wiseman and I can't be out pounding it.

618
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,170
And, uh, one of the greatest things ever
happened to me was given up the booze.

619
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:36,350
And I mean, and I have feasted from
the banquet of life. You know, I, I,

620
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,500
I mean I lived in Amsterdam, you know,
uh, hosted a talk show over in London.

621
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,250
You would like the Dave Letterman late
night talk show for two years on Dutch

622
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:50,130
television. But, um, you
know, I went through, uh,

623
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,000
some pretty hardcore tragedies.
My Dad, who I adored, um,

624
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,010
was killed by a drunk driver in
2009 through the irony of that,

625
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,680
when you see that helmet,
that surviving Vietnam,

626
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:06,610
all of that in the metals and all that.
And then just some jackass in Anaheim,

627
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,340
which, you know, we've all
fucking done. So I can't put like,

628
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,760
it's just fucking unbelievable again.
And then my little sister,

629
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:17,410
who I was really close with, um,
died of breast cancer in 2011, uh,

630
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,940
my wife and I actually got married
at her hospital bedside, um,

631
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,210
the day before she died of cancer
cause I didn't want her to miss it.

632
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:30,010
So that was 2011. So 2012, 2013,

633
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,080
I had stopped drinking for pleasure,

634
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,200
saying I would just like numbing
myself because I was so heartbroken.

635
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,880
And then, um, January 1st, 2014, uh,

636
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:47,590
in Philadelphia, I blacked out
and busted my head open and, uh,

637
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,910
the next, and I got like six stitches
on my forehead. I had a black guy.

638
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:56,440
The next day I looked in the mirror and
I saw so much ugliness and, uh, and I,

639
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:57,690
I knew,
I knew,

640
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,300
she didn't know that was the moment
when you look in the government.

641
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,420
I had been thinking about it and I just
thought the main, I mean vanity was,

642
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:09,340
was a big reason because, um, I, I
saw so much ugliness in the mirror,

643
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:11,740
but also I knew it was
holding me back as a comedian.

644
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,170
I knew I could be a better comedian
if I stopped drinking every night.

645
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,520
And, um, you know, and I
didn't go to any AA meetings,

646
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:25,870
which a people always get
offended when I say that, but, um,

647
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,010
I just, I just had had enough and um, the,

648
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,840
for the first, the first, first couple
of weeks, you know, you're a little,

649
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,060
little bumpy, but uh, you know,

650
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,870
you can get through it just pictured you
look into the mirror with the black guy

651
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:44,310
in the car and just be like,
all right, you went, yeah, yeah.

652
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,210
When I'm a fucking doing this.
Well,

653
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:48,400
what happened was I looked in
the mirror and I just thought,

654
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,730
I want to go one year when I looked in
the mirror, what I said to myself was,

655
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,390
I want to go one year
and see what it's like,

656
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,380
not be in drunk every night to be,
to see what I could get done.

657
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,120
And I got so much done, uh,
writing jokes and, you know,

658
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:08,940
working on my book in different
projects and stuff. Uh, I,

659
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,450
I, I, that's what made
me stick around. Yeah.

660
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,460
Well mine to having a kid now too. It's
like it's every, every dad told me,

661
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:17,690
he said, Oh yeah, I have a kid that'll,

662
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:20,600
that'll curb your drinking cause they
don't give a shit or have any sort of

663
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:24,650
concept of what being hung over his yeah.
And they wake up with like,

664
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:29,240
they're there on a full tank.
Like the whole body is brand new,

665
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,840
nothing hurts and they're ready to just,
it's just like that Duh Duh Duh.

666
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,920
They get right in your face. Ha. He's
yelling and shit and it's just like,

667
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,770
um, it's actually, you know,

668
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,580
I'm finding if I'm going to go out
and do stand up, I have to make the,

669
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:47,030
I have to be out the door by
eight o'clock, eight oh five,

670
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:48,530
I'm going to fall asleep.

671
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,180
It's just one of those things like she
gets up at like a quarter to seven in the

672
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:56,750
morning. And uh, that happened to
me last night where I was like,

673
00:40:56,751 --> 00:41:00,290
I'm going to go out. I think it was
actually, I was going to go see a mission.

674
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,870
Impossible. Cause I'm wanting to watch
Tom Cruise, speaking of helicopters,

675
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:06,770
find that helicopter. And um, I just, Oh,

676
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:09,320
the next showing isn't until 10 or 10 30.
And I knew I was like,

677
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:13,980
I'm gonna fall asleep in the middle of
mission and possible Tom Cruise Action

678
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:18,110
Summer action movie. I am so fucking
tired, I'm going to fall asleep. So, uh,

679
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,280
plus I want to take my, uh, Neil
long to go see it in like Imax,

680
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,730
get the whole thing before, uh, the whole
experience before it goes away. So, um,

681
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,090
let, let me see. Ah, let's, let's promote,
so you're going to be in Mongolia.

682
00:41:29,091 --> 00:41:31,760
What else do you got? Like I don't
know if I have any listeners there.

683
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,160
That was such a great story about
how supportive the comics where,

684
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:39,161
because I did a Gig in India and
like most of the crowd was comedians.

685
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,380
I was so happy that I didn't realize
that because I would've been like

686
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:44,410
intimidated. Like, Oh God, they're
all going to be like, well,

687
00:41:44,411 --> 00:41:49,250
what's the next joke
structure? And afterwards we
all hung out and it was like,

688
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:49,821
it was weird.

689
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:54,821
It was like I was hanging at a comedy
club on the other side of the world in,

690
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,180
in like total. They're called, but it
was the exact same fucking questions.

691
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:03,150
Did you write on stage? You do that? Yeah.
Don't you think this guy is overrated?

692
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:05,210
And they would say shit like
that. I was like, oh my God,

693
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:08,720
it's the exact same physical, the guys
they're repelling over there. Um, uh,

694
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,500
emulating your, uh, gestures and
stuff cause they hung out with, no,

695
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,241
but I actually do,

696
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:18,210
what I found was people in India are
fucking hilarious that just, they're a,

697
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,700
there, it's kind of that same vibe of
like when you go to Ireland and Scotland,

698
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:27,180
when you just meet like, like, yeah,
this is why I love the most, you know,

699
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,220
the fraternity of it, you
know? Yeah. They're like, uh,

700
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,030
people in Australia funny. They're just
fucking funny. I don't know what it is.

701
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:37,340
And then other places you go, I'm not
going to mention is I want to shit on any,

702
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,990
he just go in and they're just like,

703
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:41,870
these people are polite and then
you go to these other places.

704
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:44,840
It's just like you just is the
second you walk into the airport,

705
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:47,390
you just start seeing
characters. He's like, all
right, this is to be a good show.

706
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,100
These people are cool. So I'm so
glad you went to um, that, that um,

707
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,630
storer in Paris and on your podcast,
you wouldn't give the name of it.

708
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
Oh yeah.
Cause I turned you onto it.

709
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,370
I knew I didn't want to live emails.

710
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,240
What's the name of that Patisserie?

711
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,740
Cause I was picturing you go in there
the next time standing in this line,

712
00:43:09,741 --> 00:43:12,380
you know, you're all excited.
Like that fucking asshole bill.

713
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:16,520
Set It on his podcast all get to stand in.
But there's already,

714
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,130
the word is kind of what people already
know. And when people come up to me,

715
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:23,570
I tell him like, like what it is. And
I actually liked the sandwiches better.

716
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,410
The sandwiches are amazing.
I remember what I,

717
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,080
what I told you what I tell everybody,

718
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,480
get one of the sandwiches
because they're incredible.

719
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,540
And then buy one for later from when
you're walking around Paris and you think

720
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:36,410
to yourself, damn, I wish I'd bought
a another sandwich for later. Yeah.

721
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,860
And it doesn't overdo it. It doesn't, it's
just makes you want to keep going back.

722
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:43,980
So, um, you know a lot of, uh, that
mission impossible. I heard he's in Paris,

723
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,160

to the 29th, uh, Galway,

748
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:27,110
Ireland during that comedy festival.
And that's your potential.

749
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,700
If you could live anywhere in the world.
You told me that would live in Galway.

750
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,390
It's one of my favorite places in
the world. Uh, the 31st is Dublin.

00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:37,530
November 1st is Belfast.

00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,363
No,
this is

753
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,160
such a fucking interest and get you want
the most interesting people I've ever

754
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:45,070
met because how do you
not, you know, well,

755
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:48,020
I guess there are mouth breathing
more on set could travel this way and

756
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,780
[inaudible] reading. Sorry.
Now we're with fucking, uh,

757
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,790
and their worldview wouldn't fucking
change, but yours does. Thankfully.

758
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,940
I'm interrupting here. Continue.
What else? Uh, yeah, but you know,

759
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,270
I was trying to make that show where I
would be the Anthony Bourdain of comedy.

760
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,260
Um,

761
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,100
but whatever.

762
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,900
It'd be November 8th to the
11th at the Improv and Addison,

763
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,910
the November 12th through 18 Las Vegas.
Uh,

764
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,170
November 23rd through 27, Tokyo, Japan.

765
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,810
November 29 two rotate second.
I'm at the Improv in Pittsburgh.

766
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,460
I'm actually really excited
about and my wife, no, I've,

767
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,780
I've never been to Pittsburgh. So, um,

768
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:35,990
she used to travel with me everywhere and
now she's selective where she wants to

769
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:39,860
go. She wants to go to Pittsburgh
because we've never seen it.

770
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,640
I can tell you you to
get was a per Manny's.

771
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,450
You've got to get one of those sandwiches.
Yeah.

772
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,740
They're Italian section with all the,
uh, the Gaba, Google and all that shit.

773
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:50,640
Joe Barton, I converse, he
brought me through the, they,

774
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,950
they went and got it through.
Pittsburgh is one of the, uh,

775
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:59,240
great cities. This country has one
of the great, the old Basset America.

776
00:46:59,241 --> 00:47:02,630
I've never performed one of the go,
go to a pirates game.

777
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,830
That view with the bridges.
It's, it's believable.

778
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:09,740
It's one of my favorite cities.
And when you come from the airport,

779
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,220
it's the greatest skyline you're going
to see because it's not like you see it

780
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:16,130
and it just keeps getting bigger
and bigger. You can't see it at all.

781
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,670
And then you drive through like
this fucking hill, this tunnel,

782
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:24,330
and then you come out and just
Boehm and says, panoramic elicits,

783
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,800
it's like all of these bridges does the
ballparks and everything to the left

784
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:32,800
Heinz field, uh, um, [inaudible]
pirates play. It's gonna say pac bell.

785
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:35,140
It's where the giants used to play.
I forgot what the fuck they call it.

786
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,990
They change them every year. And then, uh,

787
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:41,440
then the skyscrapers and though they just,
there's so much to do there.

788
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,080
The food is unbelievable. And the, uh,

789
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,980
you should be like [inaudible] you should
give out little stars for Comedians

790
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:50,860
that, uh, that work
ever. He used to do that.

791
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,690
What do Willie Stargell in 1979,
they called him pops.

792
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,160
Yeah. And they had those, there's
flat hats back then. Yep. The old,

793
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,090
he used to give out little stars to the
his teammates that he thought whenever

794
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:07,180
they did something. Great. All
right. So on the back of their hats,

795
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,800
they had all these stars. Do you remember
that? Yeah, vaguely Kent to call them.

796
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:14,350
It was like a really cool thing about the,
I saw him on one of the last time,

797
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:16,730
one of his last public
experience, uh, to Colby,

798
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,650
the side arm throwing no
appearances. Uh, I saw, uh, yeah,

799
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,440
but I saw Willie Stargell when he was old.
He was sick.

800
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,120
He could tell he was dying. And I was at
three rivers stadium and I was watching,

801
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,280
uh, the cubs first, the pirates and
Sammy Sosa was still out in right field.

802
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,990
You still look Cuban, you know,
before, if you've seen them now. No,

803
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:42,330
he's whiter than, you know. Yeah. Um,
there was some big story about him. Yeah,

804
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,430
I read recently. Yeah. He's, oh,
he's living in Dubai and he's, um,

805
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,360
he looks, yeah, he looks
like John Fox. Yep.

806
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,840
Now that's what Sammy Sosa looks
like. Okay. So, uh, yeah, what?

807
00:48:55,841 --> 00:49:00,040
Pittsburgh?
November 29 to December 2nd,

808
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,840
I don't think the pirates will be playing.
Then we go to Heinz field and then, um,

809
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,490
December 10th to the 17th,
I'm in Israel doing this Israel tour.

810
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,850
Uh,
and then where haven't you remembered?

811
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:18,040
20th through the 22nd I'm at the Improv
in Orlando, Madagascar. What have we got?

812
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,390
I've never been Antartica Hulu.
I've never, the only con I have not,

813
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:26,800
the only content I have not
performed on is Africa in Antarctica.

814
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:32,250
Okay. Yeah. Dude, there's gotta be some
sort of expedition. So the, the, uh,

815
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,040
they're writing the comedy Igloo as
soon as that opens, when the, uh, yeah,

816
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,590
the 40th anniversary of the thing,
when they, when they all go down there,

817
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:42,424
you gotta a,

818
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:47,920
you gotta get that thing to going to
dial back the international travel next

819
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,950
year. Well, I want to,
how I do it is I, I, I'm,

820
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:56,680
I'm overdue to go, go to Australia and
I just sorta like as I get the new hour,

821
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:01,330
I just have it in my head were what hour
I did the last time I was there and I

822
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,460
always go and, uh, have a great time.

823
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:08,040
It's a lot weirder now that I have a kid.
So we set up this east level.

824
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,600
Australia to Sydney is one of
my favorite cities in the world.

825
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,930
All of those cities are great.
Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth. Yeah.

826
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,900
I came to Perth on Australia Day.
Fucking lunatics.

827
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,400
Who Do the El Camino was still popular,
so popular.

828
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:24,190
They love those fucking things. That a,
what's the, I forget what they call it.

829
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,890
It's a, I remember going to Australia
for the first time. I'm like,

830
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,040
what kind of cars?
Yet?

831
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:33,020
There's this, this automobile brand
called Holden and they still make those,

832
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,203
um,

833
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,820
yeah, cars, they're great. People
would get more fucking shit faced.

834
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,460
Drive it all around. I've
told you this shit. I saw,

835
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:44,880
I went to Bon Scott's grave and
somebody went to Bon Scott Scott Miller,

836
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:49,440
genuine draft bottle on there and I
wanted to remove it, but I was like, oh,

837
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,710
out of respect for the person that put
it there at bond probably would've drank

838
00:50:52,711 --> 00:50:56,190
and he wouldn't give a fuck.
But, um, all right, let's, uh,

839
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,520
let's wrap this up here. So
I, I just got to say you,

840
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:03,900
you're one of my favorite people, one
of my favorite comedians. And, uh,

841
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,770
this has been one of the best podcasts
I've done as far as just like fascinating

842
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:12,180
fucking store. I mean, everything we
had life death here. What'd he say?

843
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,880
Heroic behavior here arisen.
Is that a word?

844
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,740
Heroism. Heroism. Ben?

845
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:22,220
I've been to a lot of countries too and it
just doesn't seem dumb luck, man. I, uh,

846
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,670
thanks for having meall a man. I, uh,

847
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,650
you're one of my favorite people to
hang out with every time you and I get

848
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:30,310
together and we just like hang out as
buddies. I always get material out of it.

849
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,030
You know,
I was telling you that story about a,

850
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,020
because I pronounced so
many words incorrectly,

851
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,830
I was just gonna say,
I can't imagine how many,

852
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,240
how many fucking countries I've been to.

853
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:40,140
And I still sound like
I've never left my block.

854
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:42,980
Oh mean, it's just so great. Um,

855
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:46,130
I was telling you about arguing with my
wife because she wants me to clean the

856
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:50,750
toilet and like, I don't, I
don't want to clean the toilet.
Right. And, um, you know,

857
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:53,780
a lot of thoughts go through my head
during the day, you know, watching movies,

858
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:57,260
sleep on the couch, call a friend,
cleaning the toilet is not one of them.

859
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,120
And we live in an apartment building.

860
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:01,750
So this is what it's like to argue
in an apartment building. Uh,

861
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,070
you make a valid point.
Now lower your voice,

862
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,110
because I don't want
everybody in my building,

863
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:09,770
no one my business and I'm in the
laundry room, folding clothes.

864
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:13,940
Some guy walks in there. I
know you, you're the dude
who don't clean the toilet.

865
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,310
So like I've been doing that.

866
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,160
I've just started doing that
like in the last two weeks.

867
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,810
And that comes from having a conversation
with you on my balcony smoking

868
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:26,330
cigarettes or cigars cause yeah,
you're one of those guys,

869
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:29,210
you're always spitting out material.
You realize that you've got to go,

870
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:31,860
don't waste that on me.
You better do that. Yeah.

871
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,290
I used to get an argument with me.
Neva was still living in an apartment.

872
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:40,360
We used to, uh, she didn't give a fuck
and she calls it, she's passionate.

873
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,750
So,
uh,

874
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,930
this is when she would occasionally throw
shit at me or punch me in the chest.

875
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,390
Um, this is back her younger wilder days.
And I remember, uh, we would get into,

876
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:55,600
and I would lose so many arguments because
she didn't give a fuck about volume.

877
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,040
And I would always be going like, all
right, do you have your bait to point?

878
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,840
You don't got to help the whole
fucking world know about it. I said,

879
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:03,090
they get loud.
She would just be like,

880
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,210
so then what's worse as
you start whispering,

881
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:11,290
so only your shit is coming out and all
the names like, oh my God, he's horrible.

882
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:14,020
He's not even arguing.
She's so fucking right.

883
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:18,040
That's where they get ya when they get
allowed on. Yeah. Well anyways, uh,

884
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,340
so greatly you finally came
on, finally. Got You on.

885
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:24,250
I think it's cause we also love
smoking cigars and telling stories.

886
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:28,280
So it's like why would we have a
podcast get in the way of that? Um, um,

887
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,440
I'm so glad you came on. You get
to, uh, promote your dates here.

888
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:36,120
So go see him in Mongolia. If not, you
can see him in Pittsburgh, Atlanta,

889
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:41,250

I still, I still play everywhere,

890
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,860
all over the states.
And you have a great life.

891
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,540
I majored in like radio communication
where you got a great radio.

892
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,750
I wish somebody would give me a voice
over gigs. Huh? You know, this town is,

893
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:52,590
you've got to take it.

894
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,480
I'm running through the
grass on my tippy toes.

895
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,960
Um, definitely check him out.
He's going to be everywhere,

896
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,940
and if he's going to
travel that fucking far,

897
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,680
you can travel a little bit to go see
him. Uh, the great Tom Rhodes, everybody,

I'll talk to you on Monday.
