00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Desertification, is the degradation of a productive,
lush environment into dry, dry desert. Great

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.070
for MarioKart and alien planets in movies,
but terrible for growing food.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:22.080
Planet Earth is a constantly shifting landscape
of 8 biomes, ranging from rainforest to grassland,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.570
desert to taiga. Twenty-two thousand years
ago, the Sahara was pretty much uninhabited,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.910
except for the area around the Nile Valley.
10,500 years ago, monsoon rains rolled in

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.070
to wet it up. Climates change, it happens,
and sometimes they change hella dramatically…

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.530
like when whole deserts completely shift their
borders… which is happening RIGHT NOW.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.180
Only a few thousands years ago, the Sahara
was green and lush, and now we can't even

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.579
IMAGINE it… instead, research has found
the Sahara's shifting sands are expanding,

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.309
causing die-offs of vegetation, failure of
agriculture, and increased erosion without

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.379
plants to hold the soil in place. But this
wasn't always the case. Scientists had hypotheses

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.330
that an ancient river ran through the Western
Sahara, feeding the land and securing it with

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.729
vegetation. Clues were left off the coast
of Mauritania, where researchers found sediment

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.600
resembling that of a huge river… but there
was no river around, only arid sands. They

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.180
called this ancient waterway the Tamanrasset
and now, according to a recent study by the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.140
Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite,
it's real!

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.040
And was confirmed recently using microwave
radar. If it were still there, the Tamanrassat

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.460
river would be the 12th largest on Earth,
winding 300 miles inland (500km) to the Mauritanian

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.460
coast.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.460
As the researchers point out, climate change
happens fast. In a study in Earth and Planetary

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.659
Science Letters researchers looked at 30,000
years of dust blown from Africa into the Atlantic.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.640
Over the millennia the amount of blown dust
rose and fell in lockstep with the amount

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.159
of moisture on the continent; less moisture,
more dust, more moisture, less dust. Today,

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
because it's so dry, the majority of the sediment
in the Atlantic is from Saharan dust!

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.340
It can (and does) reach North America!

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.360
By looking at this dust, they know about 6,000
years ago the African Humid Period ended suddenly,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.250
coinciding with an axial change in the Earth's
ORBIT. According to research from NASA and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.120
climate scientists, the Sahara exists, in
part, because the Earth's spin changed, decreasing

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.489
Northern Hemisphere monsoons, and causing
the Sahara to grow. Vegetation died very quickly

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.739
and the third largest desert in the world
took over North Africa, all in less than 300

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:29.739
years!

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.099
In a separate study in the journal Science,
one of the jet streams which moves hot dry

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.319
air across the planet's Equator, has shifted
northward, causing the tropics to expand 140

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.810
miles northward in the last 26 years; and
with it… the deserts of Earth. Why?

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.690
They're not sure, but they know global warming
is part of it, as is the ROTATION OF THE EARTH.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.129
In the movies, when a wizard summons a massive
storm, the storm dissipates at the moment

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.239
of his defeat. In reality, when we make huge
changes to the Earth's climate, those changes

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.959
are not felt, or easily reversed across multiple
human lifespans. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.430
Laboratory, the melting of Greenland ice is
changing the way the Earth spins, changing

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.599
the tilt of Earth's axis by 2.6 centimeters
per year, with an increase in that tilt on

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.599
the horizon!

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.599
Why is the ice melting?

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.790
You need only look in a mirror. We live on
a spinning top, and we're messing with the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.790
balance.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.890
SO WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.360
To put it simply, as the distribution of ice
and water on the planet changes, the Earth's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.580
axis changes in a process called precession.
Thus, the sun will hit different latitudes

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.159
our planet at different intensities than before
-- drastically changing the weather systems

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.599
and our overall climate. Whether it's natural
or man-made, the jetstream is already shifting

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.120
causing the tropical deserts to expand into
previously lush territory (as we know it has

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.209
done in the past), but scientists don't believe
this is a natural phenomenon, it is happening

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.769
WAY too fast, and the rates are increasing…
we're doing this.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.519
As desertification hits the American plains,
South Asia, and the Mediterranean, humans

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.530
feel the affects through drought, climate
changes, and, eventually, economics. In a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.870
2005 report about desertification from United
Nations University, they state 10 to 20 percent

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.820
of these "drylands" have been negatively impacted
through the loss of farmland and biodiversity.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.410
That was a decade ago, and at the time, 2.1
billion people lived in the drylands of our

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.220
planet. It's clear, the deserts have, and
will expand, and as they continue to do so,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.580
farmland will dry, vegetation will disappear,
and people will either have to move, or completely

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.870
alter their lifestyles.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.080
Now, if you're thinking, "But Trace!

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.280
The ocean is FULL of water!

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.440
Let's just use that!

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.690
You can't. Julian explains why we can just
turn saltwater to freshwater, here. (soundup)
