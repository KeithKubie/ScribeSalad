[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.020
LOUIS GREY: Very excited
to have Karen here.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.570
Karen has a long and
storied history at Google.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.010
She joined Google in 2002,
and was here through 2011,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.792
and worked as a media liaison.

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.250
Really launched a
lot of the things

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.125
that you've taken for
granted here at Google,

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:22.450
including the blog and
our Twitter account.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.460
And much of our outbound
has flowed through her

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.200
and come from her ideas.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.110
She later went on to be an
editorial director at Twitter,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.640
and was there, I
think, six years?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.510
KAREN WICKRE: About five.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.468
LOUIS GREY: About five.

00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:33.400
We'll give her five.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.560
And so she's had, really,
kind of a firsthand

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.040
experience at some of the
biggest names in tech,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.030
and really, the world.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.050
And you've had a
front-row seat to that.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.740
And it's been interesting to see
your career flourish and grow,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.700
even after you left this
small little company.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.090
And it was good to
see your stories when

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.370
you wrote this book, which
is "Taking the Work Out

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.290
of Networking," which
is really an introvert's

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.206
guide to networking.

00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:56.830
One thing that's been
fun for me to see

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.590
is that I feel like
everybody knows Karen,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.710
or they've known of her, or
she has been one step away

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.259
from other people that we know.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.800
And I managed to go
through this book

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.270
and really take a lot out of it.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.289
And so I'm glad you're
here to talk about it.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.330
KAREN WICKRE: Oh, me too.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.950
LOUIS GREY: And we probably have
a few introverts in the room

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.033
who could benefit from it.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.000
So first, why don't
you tell us why

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.740
did you write a
book for introverts?

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.320
KAREN WICKRE: Well, I'm
thrilled to be here.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.010
I love Google, and
I've long loved Google,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.010
so it's great to be back
in the plex, as it were.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.070
I wrote the book to see
if I could break down

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.010
in detail the things I have done
to create a big virtual network

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.420
for myself.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.860
And it wasn't that I woke
up one day and said, wow,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.450
I have a fantastic network.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.110
It's more that other
people over the years

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.980
have often said to me, you
seem to know everybody.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.920
And I would be the one for
the hot years in Google,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.830
as he said, as Louis said,
I was here from 2002,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.150
when hiring really turned
up, and Google was getting

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.350
a million resumes a year.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.040
It might still.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.650
I don't know.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.910
But there was a point where
that started to happen.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.440
And I was getting inundated
from all my other contacts

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.099
everywhere.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.140
I want to work at Google.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.620
I want to work at Google.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.670
And I generally will say yes
to most meetings, or calls,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.780
or Hangouts, or something.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.710
I would connect with
everybody that had questions.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.180
The answers would
vary, obviously,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.340
depending on a lot of things.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.220
But during that time, as I was
sort of telling people maybe

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.090
how to go about navigating
Google, and applying to Google,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.960
and thinking about it, it
led me to think, how can I

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.250
codify how people not
just do a job search,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.160
but also, like, be able
to call on other people

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.350
when they have questions,
when they need something,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.870
because we all
have those moments?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.750
So fast forward a
few years, and I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.740
wrote a column for what used to
be called "Backchannel" which

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.000
is now part of "WIRED."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.900
Steven Levy was the editor.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.180
And it was essentially
building off

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.260
of my many meetings
with either job

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.380
seekers or people that wanted
to move into tech businesses

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.170
from some more traditional
industry, or something

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.250
like that.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.980
And I went through
the same thing.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.370
And I thought, I need
to really detail this.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.270
So fast forward again,
I've left Twitter.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.290
I got a book agent, and a couple
of New York editors called me,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.180
and we kicked around a
bunch of ideas for books.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.250
And finally, someone asked me,
what is the one piece of advice

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.920
that you find yourself
always giving people?

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.770
And I said, it is to
build a network for life.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.330
Introvert didn't
really come into it

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.980
except I'm an introvert.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.760
So I've not built a
network on the basis

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.430
of me being a famous celebrity.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.820
Not only am I not that,
but I much more prefer

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.940
a background role.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.060
And I still have done it, and so
that's what made me think, OK.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.980
Let me break this
out for people.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.480
So the book is for introverts,
but not only introverts,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.579
because in the
process of doing it,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.160
I discovered everybody
hates networking.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.270
Everybody hates the idea.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.150
Everybody thinks of it as a
chore, and that it's phony.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.040
And it doesn't seem to
yield much very effectively.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.866
So I thought, this is the way
I want to go is make something,

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:42.484
approach in a way that's more
useful for all kinds of people.

00:04:42.484 --> 00:04:44.650
LOUIS GREY: You talk about
networking being a chore.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.780
I think most people, you
said they don't like it.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.560
They don't want to do it.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.740
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.190
LOUIS GREY: And that's
especially true for introverts.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.940
Many times when you
talk about networking,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.995
you're talking about it from
the phase of a job seeker.

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:54.670
KAREN WICKRE: Yes.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.211
LOUIS GREY: And yet,
there are people

00:04:56.211 --> 00:04:59.140
who have stable jobs who
don't plan on leaving.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.550
So who cares?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.830
So why would somebody
who's in a stable job

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.100
want to do networking, and
why is it important for them?

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.600
KAREN WICKRE: Who
among us thinks

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.510
you have a stable job for the
rest of your working life?

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.790
I mean, honestly,
I've talked to people

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.010
who did think that until their
job wasn't stable, right?

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.110
Until you name
any kind of change

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.150
happened that they weren't happy
with, or lots of circumstances

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.760
happen.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.190
And so the idea that it's a
kind of one and done thing,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.640
it just isn't reality
for most of us anymore.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.990
But I also think the value
of one's personal connections

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.180
and contacts, or
as the subtitle,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.910
"Making Connections that Count,"
is really something we do

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.180
want to be able to call on
people who have subject matter

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.550
expertise, and experience
in a specific thing

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.400
when we're looking for
that specific thing.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.160
So job's a big
category, but not only.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.190
But I have literally talked
to people who have said,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.400
I'm coming to you because
I let my network go.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.020
How do I start again?

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.140
Because I've been in a job I've
been happy in for a long time.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.821
And now, I need
to make a change.

00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:14.320
LOUIS GREY: So one
thing I run into,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.945
and you've talked
about it in the book,

00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:18.640
was that there's this
perception that networking

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.370
or the process of it requires
you to not be yourself, and be

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.532
fake, to put an artificial
representation of yourself,

00:06:24.532 --> 00:06:25.990
and filter out the
things you don't

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.100
think people want to know.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.340
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.798
LOUIS GREY: Do you
find that that's

00:06:28.798 --> 00:06:31.930
true or do you find by being
your true self in full,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.747
you have the most access to
new people and new ideas?

00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:36.580
KAREN WICKRE: I think
when you're authentic,

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.380
and you're not in the clutch
of fear and neediness,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.850
and feeling the need to be in a
transactional mode with someone

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.670
you don't know at all, that's
a position of vulnerability,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.170
to be sure.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.690
That's not fun for the
person who's in it.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.720
But the more you find
common points of connection,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.200
even with people you
don't know, the easier

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.470
it will be to remember later.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.196
Oh, that person was easy to
talk to, or I liked that person.

00:07:08.196 --> 00:07:09.820
Maybe they're going
to know about this,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.580
or I know they do know about
this other thing I'm asking,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.740
a different role a
different company,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.700
They lived in another country
I'm thinking of whatever it is.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.680
That person is approachable.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.590
And I think that's the
way that we all want

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.630
to connect with each other.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.075
And so why not put it to
practice as we go along?

00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:34.580
LOUIS GREY: In 2000, as the
dotcom bubble was popping,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.580
and you start to-- if you
look at your LinkedIn,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.521
they start to be instead
of five-year chunks,

00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:40.020
they're like one-year
chunks, right?

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.220
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.500
LOUIS GREY: And I
think a lot of people

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.750
in the valley, especially,
you talk about it that they

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.150
have three-year job cycles.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.345
So you came to the end of one
of these one-year job cycles,

00:07:49.345 --> 00:07:51.762
and it was really hard
to find a dedicated role,

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:53.220
and it was for a
lot of your peers.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.500
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.264
LOUIS GREY: And you talk about
this story of you creating

00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:57.430
almost like a support group.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.150
KAREN WICKRE: I did.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.941
LOUIS GREY: Where you
connect to each other

00:07:59.941 --> 00:08:01.280
and say, so how's it going?

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.460
And as you told
it, that eventually

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.850
led you to a contract role at
Google a couple years later.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.190
So why was this your job?

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.120
How did it fall to you to
put together this group?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.900
Because that shows to me
someone who isn't necessarily

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.095
that introvert, stay at home
role, but more of a leader.

00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:21.970
How did you get this?

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.350
KAREN WICKRE:
Well, I don't think

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.600
those are opposite things.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.490
So I am an introvert
stay at home

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.420
when it comes to if I've had
kind of a long stretch of being

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.570
out and about.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.650
The mental calculation is,
how soon can I go home?

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.500
Like, when can I
get some respite

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.760
from being out in the world?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.484
But I go back out
into the world.

00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:47.480
So the thing I really am at
root is a connector of people.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.540
And I also thought
it was true, there

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.230
was this big downturn
in 2000, 2001.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.910
Nobody was hiring.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.200
Jobs just melted away.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.560
I mean, it was a first for the
Bay Area, for Silicon Valley.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.150
And so I knew a bunch of
people who had been looking.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.320
And now, there were no
jobs listed anymore.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.640
So I thought, well, we need
to keep each other going.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.590
So I asked a few people I knew,
and some better than others,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.900
some former work colleagues.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.150
I think there were
eight of us or so.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.730
And we would meet around my
dining room table in the city.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.320
I think we met weekly, but it
might have been less frequent.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.790
But the idea was
talk over what leads

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.550
you're finding, if you need
help describing yourself,

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.399
or if you want to be
for the time being

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.940
a consultant, what
are your services?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.900
What's your pricing?

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.800
Let's just kick it around,
because we got to kind of feel

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.240
our way through this.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.060
And that group did meet
for probably the better

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.940
part of two years, on
and off, just because it

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.780
was a long period of people
practicing their elevator

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.950
pitch, or maybe I'm going
to be interested in this,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.783
and I got to go do some
research about that.

00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:05.710
It was a good lesson for me.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.240
And I think I do turn to
other people for advice

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.560
and for guidance.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.230
And I want those people
to be not random,

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.714
but people who know
the environment I'm in,

00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:18.880
know what I'm interested in.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.060
And that was kind of the
purpose of this group, too.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.270
So I did go.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.410
I did move from my support
group at the dining room table

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:35.320
to a contract as a marketing
writer for Google in 2002.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.250
However, I knew the
first VP of Comms here,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.340
whose name was Cindy McCaffrey,
because I'd worked with her

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.870
at two other companies prior.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.300
So I'd kept up with her.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.910
I'd visited Google
not on university,

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.590
but in the first of the office
park complexes just over here.

00:10:57.445 --> 00:10:59.320
The other thing I had
been doing is freelance

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.330
writing for trade publications.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:08.440
So I actually reviewed
Google as a search engine in,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.420
I don't know, something
like maybe 2000, just as

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.900
a freelance thing.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.990
And I remember that's
how I knew Google

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.920
was that I'd looked at it, and
it was so many leagues better

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.120
than all the other 20 search
engines that had come before.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.870
So I thought, wow.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.890
They've got something.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:27.890
This thing really works.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.110
I gave it a good review.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.990
Anyway, I came to have
lunch with Cindy one day,

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.660
and I thought, wow,
that's interesting.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.180
And I just kept
in touch with her.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.780
I did call her when I was on
the lookout for freelance work.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.880
And initially, she said, we
just hired a marketing writer.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.890
So right now, we're fine,
but I'll keep you in mind.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.180
And then she called
me back and said,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.580
actually, we're
drowning in work,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.940
and that guy had
to go on a leave.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.900
How soon can you come down?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.670
And so it was September 3, 2002.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.880
I do not forget this date.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.546
And it wasn't just
a matter of Cindy.

00:12:05.546 --> 00:12:07.420
Then, I had to meet
other people on the team,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.930
and start talking about
specific projects I'd be doing.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.630
And within a couple
of weeks, I thought,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.370
this is where I want to be.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.300
And rather than work at home
and send things in, I said,

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.100
I'm just going to be here,
and make them get sick of me.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.817
I'm going to be here and remind
them that I want a job here.

00:12:26.817 --> 00:12:28.900
And it took a while, but
that was how it happened.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.410
LOUIS GREY: Yeah.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.826
And you mentioned earlier, you
made a comment about Google

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:34.439
getting a million job applicants
in a day trying to get in.

00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:35.230
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.660
LOUIS GREY: So that sounds
like the world's changed a bit.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.450
You've gone from 2000,
where there's not

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.670
enough jobs
available, and trying

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.330
to get into a small company
of 600 or so when you started.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:45.640
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.930
LOUIS GREY: To literally Tens
of thousands when you left.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.960
And I hate to say it, but it's
gotten bigger since you left.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.620
KAREN WICKRE: I know.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.120
I know.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.130
I left at 50,000 when
the Motorola acquisition

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:54.890
went through.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.890
LOUIS GREY: And so there's
been a lot of change.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.699
And you were kind of a front-row
seat to a lot of that change.

00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:00.490
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.900
LOUIS GREY: So how did
that change your approach

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.030
to both networking
and communication?

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.576
Because now, you have
this tremendous stage,

00:13:06.576 --> 00:13:08.950
and you have all of these
people who want your attention,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.450
and you have to be
a filter as well.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.350
KAREN WICKRE: Right.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:17.050
So on the first part of that,
the thing that I learned

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.050
at Google that I'd never
worked for a company

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.005
that had grown so big so fast.

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:28.000
People had said to me, you have
to be kind of entrepreneurial

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.410
when you're at Google.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:34.937
You have a lot of room to
explore and make things happen.

00:13:34.937 --> 00:13:37.270
I didn't know what that meant,
really, at the beginning.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.830
It didn't really sink in.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.819
But the thing that I did
discover pretty early,

00:13:41.819 --> 00:13:43.360
I was part of the
communications team

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.880
when I finally did
get a full-time job.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.540
Communications as a
team has a wider view

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.470
of a company than almost any
other team, because between all

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.970
the people on their
beats, they're

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.470
aware of corporate stuff,
product stuff, employee stuff.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.960
I mean, as a group,
collectively,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.840
they have a really
wide horizon, which

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.870
I did like, because I
worked with everybody.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.640
I was a floating--

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.870
I was an editor.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.960
I was essentially like
the editor that became

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.880
the editor of the Google blog.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.330
And so in that
process, not only was

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.620
I working with different
people along the way,

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.840
but I also realized as I
became friendly with people,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.990
they became like my brain trust
to help me understand what's

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.120
happening around the company.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.790
Not secret launch plans,
but more like early on,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.550
I have liberal arts degrees.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.100
I really didn't even
understand a search index

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.960
in the beginning.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.880
So if I was friendly with
an engineer who did know--

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.400
and they did--

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.779
I could, like, help
me understand this.

00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:57.070
And out of that came the
original thing that was called

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.830
Google Zeitgeist, which
is now Google Trends.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.590
But at the time, it
was a hand-picked

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.470
from the index printed
out 50 sheets of paper

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.900
highlighting things that
we thought were spikes.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.070
I mean, it was primitive, but
he was very patient with me

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.800
and helped me understand
what that was about.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.460
So then when I had questions
about things like that,

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.170
I could go to someone
like him and say,

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.960
does this make sense to you?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.740
As I began to understand more,
he was, like, a good reality

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.370
check.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.810
And so were other people across
legal, and product, and product

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.180
marketing, and just
different ones.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.470
I mean, Peter has been
here all this time,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:43.130
and we used to work on
the mighty Google Research

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.010
blog, which was anomalous
to the other blogs,

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.840
but it was awesome.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.160
It had its own personality.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.510
So I think you have to
have your internal network,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:59.090
especially in a big company,
that are just informal friends.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.420
Companies not this
big, you can imagine

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.496
people saying at
the water cooler,

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:08.120
I'm so excited about that launch
tomorrow, and somebody saying,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.630
really?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:13.280
Does legal know about that
yet, because I'm not--

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.860
that, I hope, doesn't
happen here anymore.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.990
But you can
appreciate that it has

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.790
a value to ongoing business.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.180
But it also just
enriches your experience

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.940
so that you understand all
the parts of the business,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.680
and who's doing
what, and that people

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.590
are looking after and
focused on different things.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.960
To me, it's very enriching.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.990
And I don't know how you
can navigate in a company

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.956
today and not do that.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:39.890
LOUIS GREY: And so
networking itself

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.190
is kind of a private
activity in a lot of cases.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:42.590
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.370
LOUIS GREY: It's
talking one-to-one.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.450
KAREN WICKRE: It's
not broadcast.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.533
LOUIS GREY: You mentioned
Peter by his first name,

00:16:46.533 --> 00:16:47.990
because to you, he's Peter.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.040
To a lot of these other
people in this room,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.760
he's that guy
sitting over there.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.030
And so you have a different
level of knowledge

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.590
based on how well you know them.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.769
So you were able to see
Google transform in two ways.

00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:58.560
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.100
LOUIS GREY: First was going
from private company to public,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.999
and the second in
terms of having

00:17:02.999 --> 00:17:04.790
that one-to-one
relationship with reporters

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.369
to the point where you
can broadcast on your own

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.690
with the blog and Twitter later.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.720
And this is kind of a
dual-pronged question.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.220
Take us through those stories,
because a lot of these people

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.200
weren't in the room.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.940
Talk about going public
at Google and Twitter.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.649
You did it twice.

00:17:18.649 --> 00:17:19.398
KAREN WICKRE: Yes.

00:17:19.398 --> 00:17:21.500
LOUIS GREY: And then
talk about, how did you

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.790
get a company to go
public with a blog

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.875
and start to share with
the rest of the world?

00:17:27.875 --> 00:17:32.090
KAREN WICKRE: So Google is
a fantastic story about this

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:39.140
because Google bought Pyro Labs
in 2003, which was Blogger.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.450
And from the beginning,
the comms team,

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.810
we all said, this
is what we should

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:49.490
use for our own publishing, a
sort of corporate publishing

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.050
mechanism, instead
of press releases,

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.440
which was the old-fashioned way.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.510
Google didn't put out that many
press releases to begin with,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.730
and it's a very arcane way of
doing things, not Google style.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:07.220
So there was not a lot of
opposition to the concept

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:07.860
at all.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.460
The question was
more, well, what's

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.610
the approval flow, and the
workflow, and things like that?

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:20.630
And it took a while
because I think we first

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.780
announced and
published or unveiled

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:30.740
the Google blog in
the spring of 2004

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.220
after we had filed for the IPO.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.580
So the lawyers were
great, but they were also

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.090
a little wary
about, this all has

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.350
to be under the rules
of business as usual.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.060
No wild stuff here on blogs.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.960
At that time, people were very
anxious about corporate blogs,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.010
because typically, it was
more like individual employees

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.279
doing it, right,
rather than a company.

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:58.820
In fact, the Blogger
guys at the time

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.670
said, a company
can't have a blog.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.180
And I said, it's just
a publishing platform.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.300
Yes, they can, and
we're going to.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.440
So eventually, we got going.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.130
But if you look back at the very
beginning of the Google blog,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.090
it's like, here's a
recipe from Charlie.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:22.430
It was the safest, most
non-newsworthy stuff,

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.430
because that was all we
could get past the lawyer.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:30.080
So it took getting past the IPO,
and then getting some cadence.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.870
And then eventually,
I could institute

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.214
an editorial calendar.

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:35.630
Because I was on
the comms team, I

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.090
made sure all the comms
people were signed off

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.550
on the individual topics.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.340
Individual team members
from the relevant team

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.940
would be the writer, or at
least drafter of the thing,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.890
because they were the
subject matter experts.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.180
That was from the beginning.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.780
And I didn't realize it
then, but Google really

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.330
paved the way for what
other companies do

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.790
in terms of their own
news and information,

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.590
because I made
sure it wasn't just

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.450
product announcement,
product announcement.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.720
I wanted interesting
stories to come through.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.630
And then over time, more
countries, more products all

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.590
wanted their own blogs.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:17.240
And at one point, I think we
were up above 200-something.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.490
And that's why there's
now this streamlined thing

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.480
that my wonderful successor
Emily Wood has put into place.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.990
And Twitter, adding Google
as a Twitter account

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.300
was something I made
a case for internally.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.010
It was 2009.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.980
The techies were
already busy on Twitter,

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.860
and so were tech reporters,
so that was my argument.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.920
We had to have a presence
there because tech reporters

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.440
were using it already.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.290
And initially, I
got some pushback,

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:56.330
because at 2009, Google had
plenty of public channels.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:01.235
And I just said, because of
the kind of company we are,

00:21:01.235 --> 00:21:02.840
we have to be there.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.510
And initially, it was, well,
we don't have headcount.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.810
And I said, you
don't need headcount.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.640
I can do this.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.430
It's not a 24/7 job.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.340
And so I did get the OK to
do it, which was awesome.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.560
And the first tweet was, "I'm
feeling lucky" in binary, which

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.970
was a big hit at the time,
just because it was different,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.650
and it sort of announced us.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.580
So I'm happy that
I was part of that,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.740
and that's how those
things happened.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.840
Now, Twitter is like a
different generation,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.700
practically, in terms it--

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.390
as a company publishing
its own stuff.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.640
Yes, of course, they
had a Twitter account.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.880
But by the time I got there,
the founders were all gone,

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.080
so they didn't have a voice
of Twitter biz anymore.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.090
And it was, frankly,
a bigger challenge

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.850
to have Twitter, the
company, represented

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.534
on its own platform, ironically.

00:22:00.534 --> 00:22:02.450
And they had less to
talk about, and there was

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.410
less they wanted to talk about.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.630
It was not a great time
at Twitter back then.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.810
So it was tougher to
get a cadence going,

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.530
but I did institute the
same idea of principles

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.780
about what the blog
should be talking about,

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.140
and all the names that should
be attached to post, and stuff.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.180
And then it has morphed a
lot, even since I've left,

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.500
in terms of how they do it.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.000
I mean, so much has
changed, really,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.900
even in the last five years,
in terms of company news

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.060
and information.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.560
LOUIS GREY: So we talked about
this a little bit over lunch,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.330
but working at both
Twitter and Google,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.160
you've had to work
with some seriously

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.740
introverted leadership, right?

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.870
And so how do you
encourage people

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:48.160
to whom networking
is not very easy,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.160
and speaking publicly is
not very easy to actually go

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:51.850
out and do that?

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.724
How do you tell them
this is a valuable thing

00:22:53.724 --> 00:22:55.229
and get them to engage?

00:22:55.229 --> 00:22:56.770
KAREN WICKRE: Well,
fortunately, that

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.675
didn't all fall to me to do.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.700
My goal was always to be
genuine and helpful, honestly.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.340
And so I was in situations
where I could do that,

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.110
but I was not the advisor
talking about media

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.030
opportunities as much.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:21.580
I did know that someone
like Steven Levy, who's

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.610
an editor-at-large
at "WIRED" now,

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.280
who's the guy who wrote
the big book about Google,

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.810
he was a perfect comfort
level for lots of people here.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.200
And that made it a lot easier
for him to get access and write

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.600
that book.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.130
And if you don't
know it, I think

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.260
it's still a good
book to explain

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.859
how Google approaches problems
and thinks about things.

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:45.400
LOUIS GREY: And
that's "In the Plex."

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.190
KAREN WICKRE: "In the Plex."

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.630
So it depended on--

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.360
I mean, I would never
be in a situation

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.190
to push a broadcast
TV interview.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.600
Other people would do that.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.580
But I could suggest maybe
the more offbeat sources that

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.230
had credibility, or the more
interesting ones that were not

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.670
necessarily the
biggest following,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.780
but maybe had influence in
areas that the founders or some

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.285
of the executives
would care about.

00:24:15.285 --> 00:24:16.743
LOUIS GREY: You
talked about blogs,

00:24:16.743 --> 00:24:19.227
and obviously Twitter having
its own Twitter account, which

00:24:19.227 --> 00:24:21.310
brings us into this new
generation, like you said,

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.349
of social networking.

00:24:22.349 --> 00:24:23.140
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.640
LOUIS GREY: And so
in your book, you

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.300
go through and talk about a
mix of real-life networking

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.910
and also social networking.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.730
What do you think that
percentage should look like?

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.550
Can someone get away with
being a keyboard jockey,

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.040
and just doing email, and
just tweeting just enough,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.470
and just posting
Instagram just enough so

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.049
that you have that
kind of loose ties

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:44.840
that you reference
constantly in your book?

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.460
KAREN WICKRE: A presence, yeah.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:45.940
Yeah, you can.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.740
I mean, that's part of
the point of my book

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.460
is I wasn't, like, conferred
with a lot of power

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.300
and visibility that people
would want to connect

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.390
to me, which is typically how--

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.060
that's how and maybe Tony
Robbins does it, right?

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.020
But for most of us,
it's more, I mean,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.200
you want to be your
genuine self and be

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.890
open to meeting new and
interesting people now

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.090
and again, essentially.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.000
It's not a 24/7 calling.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.490
So I do believe that the
various social channels make

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:26.650
it possible to discover, and
meet, and have relationships

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.620
with people, with many
more people than was

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.090
ever possible without
that, for sure.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.880
But it's not a
numbers game, either.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:41.780
And so there's nothing that
can beat a one-to-one exchange,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.760
however the other
connections work.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.080
And in a way, I learned
that at Google, too,

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.100
because it was the first truly
international company I worked

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.980
for, where we'd have
global offsite once a year,

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.550
and everybody would be together
for a week, and we'd socialize.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.400
And even if you only worked
with somebody or other

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.560
on your team a little
bit, just the fact

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.680
that you'd had some
social interaction

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.860
and some time together
for a week a year

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.280
really strengthened
the online relationship

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.400
that you'd go back to.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.590
So I do think that's valuable.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:20.240
But we're so used to these
momentary touches with people,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.284
whether it's a Twitter DM,
or even just an open tweet,

00:26:24.284 --> 00:26:25.700
and a few of your
friends respond,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.970
and you have a little thread.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.280
LinkedIn was built for a certain
kind of online connection,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.880
obviously, and it works
pretty well for that,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.020
for its main purpose.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:46.300
Instagram, like Twitter,
lets you follow people

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.870
you don't know, right?

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:53.530
And you can have a
way to contact them.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.170
These are unlike Facebook,
which was not really designed

00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.820
for this asymmetrical
networking.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.700
That was much more your
friends and family.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.150
So I do talk in the
book about making

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.370
use of those, whichever
ones you're comfortable on,

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.470
and where people
you're connected to

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:16.420
are on, so that part
of my day every day

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.070
is probably a few Twitter DMs,
a couple of text messages,

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.360
a couple of Facebook
Messenger posts,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.977
or something like that,
where I'm just saying,

00:27:27.977 --> 00:27:28.810
hey, thought of you.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.410
Saw this.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.940
How are you?

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.320
Let's talk soon.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:37.390
It's not a heavy lift, and it's
not an obligatory response.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.970
It's more just like, I'm
thinking of you right now.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.220
LOUIS GREY: So you mentioned
asymmetrical connections.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:42.850
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.080
LOUIS GREY: And one thing
I want to talk about

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.199
is asynchronous versus
synchronous following.

00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:46.990
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.450
LOUIS GREY: And in the early
days, it was very clear.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.100
In Facebook, I'm
connected to Karen.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.010
Karen's connected to me, and
it can't just be one way.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.700
And Twitter was never the case.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.461
So I could follow you, and you
didn't have to know who I was,

00:27:58.461 --> 00:27:58.960
right?

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.829
But I would see your updates
and I could respond to you.

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:02.620
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.230
LOUIS GREY: And they've made it
so that you can possibly only

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.860
see responses from people who
you've already connected to,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.850
or you can filter those down.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.030
But do you see that
there's some kind of value?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.964
Does it even count
as networking to just

00:28:14.964 --> 00:28:16.630
be aware of what other
people are doing?

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.330
KAREN WICKRE: Yes.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.970
Being aware and curious about
what other people are doing

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.630
is definitely a piece
of connecting to people,

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.670
because it just
helps you when you--

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.270
it gives you context, right,
for when you do have occasion

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.770
to meet someone, or
want to meet someone,

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.500
that you have a
little more context.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.930
And the context now is richer
than just the job history,

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:43.430
right?

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:48.250
If people have public
accounts, and you

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:54.820
see that a Google alum who's
got an interesting approach I'm

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.990
following is Hunter Walk,
who's now at BC with Homebrew.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.687
And so he's posting, he
and his wife and daughter,

00:29:02.687 --> 00:29:04.270
like, go to a nail
salon, and they all

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.720
get their nails painted.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.735
He's wherever he is.

00:29:07.735 --> 00:29:09.610
And so you meet him,
and you think, oh, yeah.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.110
He went to the
Museum of Ice Cream,

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:15.400
or he posted something funny.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.650
That's fair game for
a person you've never

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:21.820
met because he posted
it, and it's public,

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.920
and you have a little bit of
ground to be common on together

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.670
that you can meet in the
middle and be sociable

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:31.570
about it, personable.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.111
LOUIS GREY: Well,
you mentioned that.

00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:36.280
So in your book, you
talk a lot about doing

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.250
the minimum standard to get
into one of these networks,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.960
but you have to be authentic.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.570
You can't just tweet a few
links and then disappear.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.820
But you also have people on
the other side of spectrum

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.590
who share everything, right?

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.310
And they don't stop, and you
mute them, or do whatever,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.967
but they just
continue and continue,

00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:53.800
because there's different
personalities that

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.190
take place in all
these networks,

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.710
including, I think
you said, be it

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.772
the communicator, or the person
who pontificates and makes

00:29:59.772 --> 00:30:00.730
comments on everything.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.180
KAREN WICKRE: Yes.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.763
LOUIS GREY: How do
you find your lane?

00:30:02.763 --> 00:30:04.480
Do you just know what it is?

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.840
KAREN WICKRE: No.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.630
OK, here's I tried out now my
favorite quote from the book,

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.750
from a guy named Ivan
Meissner, which is,

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.650
"Think of networking less like
hunting and more like farming."

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.390
Or if you like, substitute
"gardening" for "farming."

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.070
So the idea is you're
nurturing, you're watering,

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.350
you're planting, you're
trimming, you're weeding,

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.300
you're plowing under,
you're replanting,

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.561
where hunting is very
transactional, shall we say?

00:30:33.561 --> 00:30:34.060
A one-hit.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.390
I built my online
connections over time just

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.089
by, oh, this
person's interesting.

00:30:45.089 --> 00:30:46.630
I have something in
common with them.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.750
They're interested in
the same things I am.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.310
I didn't meet them,
maybe, at Google,

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.642
but I followed them I know
what they're doing now.

00:30:54.642 --> 00:30:55.600
I want to be connected.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.480
I mean, it's a long game, right?

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.210
And it's a sort
of ongoing process

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.040
of cultivation and nurturing.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.860
LOUIS GREY: Sure.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.731
And you talk a little
bit about, or a lot

00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:06.730
about loose connections.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:07.300
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.799
LOUIS GREY: And so when you
look at these loose connections,

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:12.770
first of all, you can
define what that means.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.790
And then second, for people
who are a loose connection who

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:19.790
might not have a direct overlap
with a job, does that matter?

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.890
Like, do engineers need to
connect to marketing people?

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.920
KAREN WICKRE: I would
never mandate such a thing.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.320
No, I mean, it's
based on who you like.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.730
I find an interesting
thing, though,

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.020
that in the time since I've
left Google, Google, to me,

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.390
is such a world-class network
of people, past and present.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.460
I mean, literally
at the door here,

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.230
a guy waved that I
worked with 15 years ago.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:51.070
I maybe the last time saw
him eight or 10 years ago.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.147
And he couldn't stay today.

00:31:53.147 --> 00:31:55.230
I'm going to follow up and
just say, I missed you.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.785
How are you?

00:32:00.147 --> 00:32:03.480
It can be very intermittent,
and there's no prescription

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.160
about roles or history, even.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.810
It's more just, who
do you like, what

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.930
associations you might
have with a place?

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:19.350
I'm sure a company that
fosters and encourages

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:23.430
collaboration and cross-team
work and relationships

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:27.270
and friendships does better
in the long-term networking

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:32.509
realm than one that is
very siloed, just a guess.

00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:34.050
LOUIS GREY: And you
talk specifically

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.260
about an All-Hands, where people
flew in from around the globe

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.030
and met here.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.190
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.430
LOUIS GREY: And you still
have relationships today.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.221
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:43.170
LOUIS GREY: But the reality
is both you and I had dogs,

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:47.310
and wouldn't we rather walk a
dog around the park two times

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.350
than go to some
event in the city

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.690
and walk around the
room for two times?

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.750
I'd rather walk the dog.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.541
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:56.292
LOUIS GREY: So do I have to
go to this corporate party?

00:32:56.292 --> 00:32:57.000
KAREN WICKRE: OK.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.060
So a global off-site is not
probably an optional thing.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.720
It's different than the
holiday party, I would say.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.120
You probably do have
to participate fully

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.310
in the off-site,
and that's probably

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.230
a good thing all around.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.360
I do write about
corporate parties

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.840
because they're not really
networking opportunities,

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.324
I don't think.

00:33:21.324 --> 00:33:22.740
They may or may
not be obligatory,

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:28.530
but they are more of a
political statement, perhaps.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.790
And by that I mean not
at a company this big,

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.010
but at smaller
companies, you need

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.260
to be seen as a
team player, right?

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:42.700
You need to be part of the group
and going along with things.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.440
So in a small company,
it's not for fun.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.570
It really is a work obligation
to go to the holiday party.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.620
What I say in the
book is you do not

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.470
have to stay all night
at the company party.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.540
Make sure you're seen by
a couple of the people

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.619
you need to be seen by,
and then make an exit.

00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:02.910
But they're not the same thing.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.070
LOUIS GREY: No, absolutely not.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.290
KAREN WICKRE: Right, yeah.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.365
LOUIS GREY: I was just bridging.

00:34:05.365 --> 00:34:06.073
KAREN WICKRE: OK.

00:34:06.073 --> 00:34:07.170
LOUIS GREY: OK.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.840
So you also
mentioned in the book

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.780
that the people that you
need aren't always those

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.190
who are doing the hiring.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.709
So can you explain that?

00:34:15.709 --> 00:34:16.860
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.560
In fact, mostly, you
know how it works.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.860
Mostly, if your friend
says, I've already applied,

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.219
and I'd love to meet the
hiring manager, that's just not

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.030
going to happen.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:31.445
That's just not how it works,
especially in a big company.

00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:32.820
You don't meet
the hiring manager

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.480
before many other steps happen.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.300
But you may want
intel about a team,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:45.120
or the manager of the team, or
the future of the product line,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.820
or what the dynamics
are of the group, and do

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.699
they have cooperation from
the other surrounding groups?

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:56.040
You may want all kinds
of intel about what it's

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.270
like to work there, and
who the other people are,

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.240
and all that kind of stuff.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.100
So no one person is
going to have, like, here

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.292
is the entire answer
to your job quest.

00:35:06.292 --> 00:35:08.920
I know everything that
you need to know about it.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.430
It's going to be, like
I said, a long game.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.890
One person has this
piece of the puzzle.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.280
Somebody knows about
the product viability,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.520
or has strong opinions about
it that are somewhat informed.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.640
And someone else has been
on the team for a while.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.470
Someone else can tell
you maybe the history

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.230
of how the group has evolved.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.020
Different people along the
way that you might meet,

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.520
and so that's how you--

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.920
It's like a journalism
effort, really.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.340
You're kind of the reporter
trying to put together

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.100
a story for yourself
that makes sense

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.946
and that informs your interviews
when you get to that point.

00:35:45.946 --> 00:35:47.337
LOUIS GREY: And
so one thing that

00:35:47.337 --> 00:35:49.170
has happened, when you
started at Google, it

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.689
was literally 17 years ago.

00:35:50.689 --> 00:35:51.480
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.550
LOUIS GREY: And so the
company's changed, but so

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.840
have the products that
are being offered,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.005
and so has the technology.

00:35:56.005 --> 00:35:56.796
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:35:56.796 --> 00:35:59.040
LOUIS GREY: And so I think
about this sometimes.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.710
My previous role in
a previous company,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.020
I once asked to have
everybody's birthdays

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.080
so that we could publish them
in an internal newsletter.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.710
The enterprising HR
person responded, not only

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.930
sent me a bunch of birthdays,
but included their birth year,

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.820
and then sorted it from
oldest to youngest.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.278
And I was down at the bottom,
I was like the third youngest

00:36:17.278 --> 00:36:18.235
person in the company.

00:36:18.235 --> 00:36:21.360
Now, clearly personal
identifiable information,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.380
big mistake.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.070
But I'm no longer the third
youngest person in the company.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:25.470
KAREN WICKRE: Right.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.190
LOUIS GREY: Neither are you.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.023
KAREN WICKRE: Right.

00:36:27.023 --> 00:36:29.380
LOUIS GREY: And as
things have changed,

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.030
you talked about the fact
that 60 is the new 40.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.270
But also, it's really hard
to reboot your career at age

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.542
40, or 50, or 60.

00:36:37.542 --> 00:36:38.750
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah, for sure.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.947
LOUIS GREY: So is
networking more important

00:36:40.947 --> 00:36:42.780
because the world is
changing underneath it,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.790
or are you just going
to hold onto your people

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.270
and move forward?

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.420
KAREN WICKRE: Honestly I have
to say it's more important.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.140
Holding on and hoping no
one's really noticing is--

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:58.350
I mean, that has a limited
success rate, right?

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.370
Basically, if you have a growth
mindset, if you're curious,

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.927
if you are willing
to evolve, if you're

00:37:08.927 --> 00:37:10.760
open to learning new
things, open to meeting

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.180
new people, open to having new
thoughts, that's the thing that

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.290
keeps you going, correct?

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.920
And in a way, I
used to joke that I

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.380
was the oldest person
at Google at the time,

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.940
because I am older than Eric.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.210
However, then Google
hired Vint Cerf,

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.150
and Vint is older than I am.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.770
So he became kind
of an inspiration

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.310
for me, because he's
awesome, and, like,

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.280
an insane world traveler
in his three-piece suits.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.430
So we all have age
discrimination.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.940
I do, too.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.540
I will characterize
someone as being too old.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.710
And I mean it's in their mind.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:57.050
It's like, they don't have
a growth mindset, I guess,

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:58.360
is maybe the way to say it.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.640
But we all have to
kind of watch for that.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.690
But I think the
answer if you fear

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.690
it is better step
out a little wider

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:11.627
rather than hope
no one notices me.

00:38:11.627 --> 00:38:13.210
LOUIS GREY: Sticking
with demographics

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:18.260
that are uncomfortable for
800, Alex, you are female.

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:22.369
And so as a woman who's
networking, those are--

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:24.910
I mean, you talked about Twitter
being a really hostile place

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.240
for women sometimes, and you
kind of railed against it.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.510
I'm not talking about
while you worked there,

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.170
but I mean as a platform.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:30.190
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah, I
meant as a platform.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.810
LOUIS GREY: Just to clarify.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:31.685
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:38:31.685 --> 00:38:35.110
LOUIS GREY: But as a female
who's outwardly networking,

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.300
do you find that
it's easier than what

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.180
you think your male counterparts
are having it, or is it harder?

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:45.225
Do you find that going out
for coffee or sending an email

00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:47.350
sometimes gets the wrong
response or people looking

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:48.270
at it the wrong way?

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:52.810
KAREN WICKRE: So to
me, for me where I am--

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:53.980
I'm 67.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.290
So for me, the age
factor has kind of

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.550
trumped the woman factor.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.870
And in a way, that's lucky.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:11.140
I think it's very interesting
because I was considered

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.394
maybe an anomalous person
who worked in Silicon Valley,

00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:16.060
but nonetheless,
someone who kind of fit

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.910
in, and had been
around a long time.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.110
I had some credibility.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:25.040
So that helped me.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.520
I was not party to a bunch
of uncomfortable exchanges.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.390
On the other hand,
when you're older,

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.240
you're also more invisible.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.000
And in a way, I find that
kind of a superpower,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
because nobody pays
attention to you.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.280
And if you're a
woman, they're also

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.300
not listening to what you're
saying in a meeting, which

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.130
is not always good.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.530
But at the same time,
it's kind of interesting.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.790
Maybe it all ties to being an
introvert, because I observe,

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.340
and I watch, and I kind
of take my own counsel,

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.320
and kind of react later.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.270
But I can observe the scene
and watch how people are.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.140
But I do think that
for me personally,

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.830
I'm sure I wasn't
seriously considered

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.570
certain times in my career--

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.490
not just at Google,
by any means--

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.300
for different roles or
something because some guy

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.590
was friends with another guy.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.460
I'm sure that has happened.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.390
But at the same time,
I made my own way.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:29.340
And I think honestly being a
few years ahead was beneficial

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.250
to me, oddly, and
never really got

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:35.430
in my way at all at Google
or Twitter, for that matter.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.970
And earlier on, I was at
a lot of smaller companies

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:43.080
and computer
publications where there

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.120
wasn't as much of an age
consciousness gap at that time.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.400
And I didn't have this
yet, so maybe that

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.322
made a difference, too.

00:40:52.322 --> 00:40:55.897
LOUIS GREY: So when you
introduced your book

00:40:55.897 --> 00:40:58.230
in Mountain View, this was
about a couple of months ago?

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.880
LOUIS GREY: Yeah, at Books Inc.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.210
LOUIS GREY: Had a book signing.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:04.380
So I asked you a question,
which I'm going to repeat,

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.090
so you're already
ready for this one.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.910
So at Twitter, you
tweet 140 characters.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:10.980
Now, it's 280.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.410
Maybe you're able add a photo,
but it's pretty concise,

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.050
and you're owned
by the container.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.767
And a blog is more open-ended,
but it's not 100 pages.

00:41:17.767 --> 00:41:18.600
KAREN WICKRE: Right.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.980
LOUIS GREY: Your book is.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:24.180
So how did you take on this
uncomfortable challenge

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.040
of having to write
for long form?

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.780
And obviously, what
you're doing is

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.120
kind of like a book tour
and a book signing tour.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.640
These are probably
outside your comfort zone

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.475
because you haven't
done it before.

00:41:32.475 --> 00:41:33.308
KAREN WICKRE: Right.

00:41:33.308 --> 00:41:34.836
LOUIS GREY: How did you do it?

00:41:34.836 --> 00:41:38.610
KAREN WICKRE: Well, I knew
enough about publishing to say,

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:42.600
if I get an agent, and they
sell a proposal, I'm in.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.820
I'm going to follow
this adventure.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.850
I know what's generally
entailed here.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.787
I'll do it.

00:41:48.787 --> 00:41:49.620
I just thought that.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.680
I did know it would be a problem
to write long, because I'm not

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.180
used to writing long.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.910
I've written for online.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.100
A thousand words is more than
enough, most of the time.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.587
So I get the contract, and it
says 60,00 to 80,000 words,

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:05.670
and I thought, I'm just
not going to pay attention

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:06.840
to that right now.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.790
I can't.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.080
But the simple answer
to writing long

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.980
is you just have
to break it down.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.170
So I would pay attention
not to the meta length.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.040
I would be more like, follow--

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.040
I had to learn how to
make a good outline, which

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.290
I hadn't done since school.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.750
And then literally
go to the outline

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.820
and say, OK, that's next,
and then that's next.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.540
I mean, that was hard.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:33.660
That was really butt in
seat type work to make.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.570
And then one day,
my editor said,

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.030
let's just count
up how far you are.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:43.350
And I did it all in Google
Docs, and so she just

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:45.170
did a rough count
of every chapter.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:48.570
It was like, wow, I'm
at 43,000 words already.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.820
So you will see it's
not a long book.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.280
There's sidebars with exercises.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.100
There's epigraphs
for every chapter,

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.660
because that's as long
as it needed to be.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.680
And actually that's what
my editor told me, too.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.510
I didn't have to overly repeat.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.740
But it was a slog.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.300
It was something I had to learn.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.850
Same with going out
and talking about it.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:15.377
In a way, it's not my
natural state, but--

00:43:15.377 --> 00:43:17.710
if I had to do it for the
rest of my life, I don't know.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.910
But for some period
of months or a year,

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:24.090
I enjoy it, because
it's not constant,

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.880
and it's fun to talk
about, and especially

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.185
to get the questions.

00:43:28.185 --> 00:43:30.030
LOUIS GREY: So you talk
a lot about getting

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.680
the first role at Google
through people you know,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.570
and using the network, and
helping other people forward.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:36.270
An similar at Twitter, someone
you knew in your existing

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.190
relationship got you there.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.970
So that sets up
this kind of wall

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.380
where people who don't
know you can't get in.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.880
And when you talk about Google
getting a million resumes

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.250
a quarter, or a day, whatever
it looks like, it's a lot.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.041
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:52.920
LOUIS GREY: So there's
a two-piece on this.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.270
First does that mean online
job submissions are dead

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.837
and recruiters should
just do something else?

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.920
And then the third thing
which I'm concerned about

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.590
is if you're only getting
in by who you know,

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:06.360
doesn't that just
cement the diversity

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.740
problem that we already have?

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.490
KAREN WICKRE: That's
a very good question.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:14.310
But I would say recruiters
are not going away,

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:19.650
because there are still lots of
jobs in the world that follow

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:27.710
this CV submission, picked out
of the pile, phone screening

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.920
process that goes on.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.920
The question is really
about the higher-level jobs,

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.620
and the executive roles,
and the roles that

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.270
are kind of built
on relationships,

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.820
and have fostered
relationships with other people

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.120
in other places.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.750
That's an interesting
thing to explore.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:51.530
For me personally,
that's why I'm

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.440
open to meeting everybody all
the time and giving advice.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.200
Even if I don't
have direct advice,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.120
I will literally Google
a good how-to article,

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.680
and send it to someone, and say,
I can't help more than this,

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.830
but this is a good source
for what you need to do next

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.540
or what you need to know.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.490
It is a very good question about
the idea of the sort of friends

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:14.750
of friends.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:18.590
And I don't have a single
good answer to that.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:23.480
I would say that the more
people in hiring positions

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.010
and incumbents at companies
are aware of that,

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:33.170
the more they broadly
network for roles, not just--

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.650
the old example
would be Ivy League

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:40.670
is the only place we go, versus
all other kind of schools.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.740
Now, I think we have to
say that they don't all

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.000
have to be four-year colleges.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.180
We want to look at a bunch
of different variables.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.480
It's going to just be a
piecemeal improvement, I think,

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.410
where someone says, we
are determined to find--

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.290
we're going to look
in more sources.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.180
We're going to have a broader
definition of the role,

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:08.235
and we do not want
the friendly person

00:46:08.235 --> 00:46:10.360
that we already know we'd
like to have a beer with,

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.590
in the famous notion.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:19.950
In fact, I did interview
an HR executive,

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:24.030
because this question of
cultural fit has come up a lot.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.060
It's kind of shorthand
for they fit with us,

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.380
they're like us,
that kind of thing.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:35.250
And she said that at least in
her circle of HR and training

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:40.260
and development people, they
knew that was a bad construct,

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.000
and they don't use that.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.890
They don't want
to reference that.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:47.790
They think, instead, about
one's cultural contribution

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:53.160
to a company, which could
be narrowly defined,

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.790
but hopefully is much more
broadly defined as they have

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:58.620
their passions and
their interests,

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:01.680
and they're not all the
same, and they don't all

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.640
match each other.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.500
They're more like
they bring a richness.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.280
So they have a contribution to
make culturally and socially

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.560
as well as the job skills.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.940
And I like that way
of thinking about it.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.870
But it takes discipline
to actually apply

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.965
that in all the steps
in a hiring process.

00:47:19.965 --> 00:47:21.990
LOUIS GREY: And so
you often talk about

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.870
having this large
network of connections,

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:27.240
but do you also have
a really tight network

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.030
of close connections where
you can be unfiltered?

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:35.310
And is that just a relief to
not have to be this public face?

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.660
KAREN WICKRE: Well, for sure.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.750
But I'm not sure I'm this public
face that much of the time,

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.410
to be honest.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:43.740
I mean, we all do when
you actually get together

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.520
with someone face-to-face,
you're hopefully

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:55.020
going to be more personal
and more unfiltered than even

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.360
watching what you tweet,
or something like that,

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.540
or what you choose
to write about.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.470
We all need that, too.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:07.560
We need the intimacy of the
actual direct connection

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.550
as well as, I think, this
broader world that helps

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.560
us a lot of things that we do.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.721
So Cliff, I think
we have the option

00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:19.220
for anyone else in the audience
who's live to ask questions,

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.365
if you do have them.

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:24.380
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
Levy, who's great.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.950
What other reporters
were good to work with

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.020
and who was bad to work with?

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.690
KAREN WICKRE: Well, I mean,
actually, it's interesting.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:35.960
The whole scene has
changed so much.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.340
It used to be there were the
big mainstream outlets, and then

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.900
a bunch of bloggers.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.380
And now, we can't really
make that differentiation

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.410
the same way.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:50.030
So Steven Levy is a wonderful
long-form reporter and not

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:54.590
a day-of scoop-type reporter.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:58.940
There's actually too many to
name who were covering Google,

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.240
but most of the--

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.100
maybe this is a fudging
on the question.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:04.940
I don't know.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.280
But it's a relationship
business too, right?

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.230
It's ongoing conversations,
and by the way, not just

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.400
when you need something.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:18.620
It really mirrors the same idea
of connecting with people so

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.960
that you can give context,
and be off the record,

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.810
and let them know
something's coming

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:25.040
without saying what it is.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.360
And it's very much a good
relationship network.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:34.160
I would say that
the publications

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.480
have changed so much.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:41.930
Buzzfeed and Vox,
maybe these are

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:46.890
things that didn't exist a
few years ago, VICE sometimes.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:50.500
There are many more outlets
than the mainstream.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.020
The reporters change,
though, because they're not

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.990
in long-term stable
jobs, for the most part,

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.420
and so they move around.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.320
So someone like Mike
Isaac, for example,

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.320
cut his teeth a little
bit at Recode and "WIRED."

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.980
And now, he's at
the "New York Times"

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.830
finishing his book on Uber,
which we're all waiting for.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:17.540
So the cast of characters,
in a way, has changed,

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.100
and some of the
practice has changed,

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.010
because it's not about--

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:25.010
years before even Google,
for a long time in PR,

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.850
it was the long form,
which was magazines

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.280
that were three months
out, the short form, which

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.830
was newspapers, and then
here came this other thing,

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.210
the blogs.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:39.996
And it's just so much a
different landscape now.

00:50:39.996 --> 00:50:42.540
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
what your perspective was

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.111
on networking
events, where it's--

00:50:46.111 --> 00:50:48.360
because you talk a lot about
the current relationships

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.545
where you're working
with someone.

00:50:49.545 --> 00:50:49.980
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.810
AUDIENCE: But where
you know there's

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:54.545
a networking event
that someone's hosting.

00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:57.090
Would you attend it or
not, or what your take is?

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.590
KAREN WICKRE: If
it was really just,

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:03.210
like, the purpose of this event
is to make people come home

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:07.790
with business cards or
contacts beamed between phones,

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:09.660
I'd question.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.810
Like, that's like a weird
speed dating kind of thing.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.510
And that's why I think people
hate the idea of networking

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.470
is that's what they think
of is hotel ballroom.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.462
I'm going to make
myself stay 30 minutes,

00:51:21.462 --> 00:51:23.670
and I'm going to come away
with three business cards,

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.800
or whatever.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.590
But if it was a
conference, then that's

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:32.340
a little different, where
there may be common interest.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.090
You might be there
for a day or two.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.756
You're going to have
a little small talk

00:51:35.756 --> 00:51:37.240
with this one and that one.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.900
There might be a legitimate
moment of connection.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.630
You wouldn't do a whole
networking thing there.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.060
You'd follow up.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.410
But that's more
natural than just,

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:50.970
like, network to find your
next job at this event that

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.470
is about that.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:55.830
I wouldn't do that,
personally, and I think

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:57.300
they're painful, those things.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:57.841
I don't know.

00:51:57.841 --> 00:52:00.420
Has anyone had a good
experience at one of those?

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.766
Does anyone do those?

00:52:02.766 --> 00:52:06.060
AUDIENCE: If I could ask you to
summarize the whole book in one

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.765
formula, what would it be?

00:52:07.765 --> 00:52:10.140
KAREN WICKRE: Well, it wouldn't
be a formula, because I'm

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.015
a liberal arts major.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:18.330
Well, it might be this
guy's quote, Ivan Meissner.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:24.060
Networking is more like farming
than hunting, to paraphrase.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.840
In other words, it's
seasonal, it's a long game,

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.910
and you're continuing
to tend it.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:34.500
So in essence, I think
that would be what I'd say.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:39.030
The other thing I might add is
people want to help each other.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:43.350
It's just you have to
give context and have

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:47.940
some kind of richness around
what you're seeking or asking.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.918
But people like to help
each other if they can.

00:52:51.918 --> 00:52:55.680
AUDIENCE: When you reach out
to people, and as an introvert,

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.130
I have a problem where you
don't know what to say.

00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:59.856
Like, you don't have
a purpose in mind.

00:52:59.856 --> 00:53:00.980
Like, what do you do there?

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.230
And if you reach out to
people, do they always respond

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.340
to you, especially
with people where

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.400
you have nothing
really you need to say,

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.267
and you don't know
each other that well?

00:53:10.267 --> 00:53:12.600
KAREN WICKRE: I think I'd
wonder why you're reaching out

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.690
in the first place.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.495
What would make you reach out
to someone you don't know?

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:20.441
AUDIENCE: Like in
general, because--

00:53:20.441 --> 00:53:22.440
KAREN WICKRE: Someone
tells you it's a good idea

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.895
to make more contacts?

00:53:23.895 --> 00:53:24.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.228
KAREN WICKRE: OK.

00:53:25.228 --> 00:53:26.580
You still need context, right?

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.850
So if it's just--

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:33.990
like, LinkedIn kind of set this
up in a way that is, I guess,

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:36.460
somewhat useful, but not
entirely useful, right?

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:39.690
Where you send somebody
that canned language.

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:42.030
I'd like to join your network.

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.530
Don't do that.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:47.790
Don't just send a canned
message that's not from you.

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:51.960
They make it easy to
overwrite that and say,

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.890
I'm interested in your
career as a product manager.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:59.220
I'm interested in how
you got to that company,

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.360
or you've written
about something

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.380
in I. I want to know
more about that.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:10.756
So you immediately bring some
reason for it to the front.

00:54:10.756 --> 00:54:13.380
And that's when people are like,
oh, that's kind of flattering,

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:18.240
and maybe I will respond
to that, however briefly.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.460
No, people do not
always respond,

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:25.522
and that's just the
way it goes, I think.

00:54:25.522 --> 00:54:27.105
The law of large
numbers or something,

00:54:27.105 --> 00:54:28.920
the more you're trying.

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.050
I do find that the better--

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.580
your odds are
always better if you

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.820
can say, I am a friend of
so and so's, or even better,

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.440
your friend introduces you.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:42.560
But beyond that,
if you say, someone

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.730
has spoken highly of
you, or I heard you talk,

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.280
or I read your paper.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:53.130
I would love to have 20 minutes,
or could you respond to this

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.780
and send me a link
to your paper,

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:59.160
or could we have a
20-minute call, or if we're

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.130
both local, could I
buy you coffee one day,

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:03.855
or something like that?

00:55:03.855 --> 00:55:06.810
That it's, like, not a
heavy obligation for them.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.040
There's not a time limit.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.945
And you're saying, I'd
really like to know more.

00:55:10.945 --> 00:55:12.570
And maybe you don't
ask it all at once.

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:16.830
Maybe it's just, may I ask you a
few questions about this thing?

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:20.460
And I think people
will respond if they

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.259
have that kind of context.

00:55:22.259 --> 00:55:23.800
Maybe it's not as
full as you'd like.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.380
Or sometimes, people
will say, yeah.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:30.870
Actually, based on who you are
and your background, yeah, I

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.660
would love to talk shop with
you about it, because I can

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.060
see you have some
background that's related,

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.670
something like that.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:39.810
But you do bring something.

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:43.290
You're not asking a favor in
the sense of, please help me.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.190
You're just saying,
I'd like to know more,

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.990
or this interests me.

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:50.490
Would you take time
to tell me more?

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:55.860
It's not like, I need a job,
and I have to apply tomorrow.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.600
That would not get a
response, a good response,

00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.542
most of the time.

00:55:59.542 --> 00:56:01.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:01.990
Thanks for coming.

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:06.360
So when I read about the history
of companies like Google,

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.855
and Twitter, and all these
other technology companies,

00:56:09.855 --> 00:56:11.730
how they were started,
how they were founded,

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:16.020
it's usually a story about
a small handful of people

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.530
who somehow know each other and
then make this great company.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:24.810
And when you read about like,
oh, how do you start a startup,

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.570
it always skips that step.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.280
It's always like,
you have your team.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.580
And now, make your startup.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:34.140
Here's the steps, how you
get venture capital funding,

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.830
and all these other things.

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:38.760
How do you go from
having this network

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.180
that you've cultivated
to having, like,

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:48.150
a team that you can use
to actually take steps

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.334
to start things like this?

00:56:50.334 --> 00:56:52.000
KAREN WICKRE: It's a
very good question.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.970
I mean, I'm only
speaking as an observer

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:56.370
here of the same history
you're talking about.

00:56:56.370 --> 00:57:03.850
But it seems like probably the
first thought isn't a company,

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:05.170
but like, is it a product?

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:09.600
Is it a thing we can make
that's interesting, if it's

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.110
engineers and technical people?

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:16.740
And money doesn't come
into it for a while,

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:19.200
but it's more like,
is this a good idea?

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.300
Is this something either
interesting, or groundbreaking,

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.700
or does something different
with technology in some way?

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.660
Google's pretty unusual in
that most companies don't

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:38.970
have an early team of employees
that is as cohesive for as long

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:41.190
as has been the case at Google.

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:43.380
That's really rare, I think.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.620
And so typically,
it's more like,

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:50.460
the Beatles, where it's like,
it was Stu Best, but he died.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.810
Or, I mean, Stu Sutcliffe.

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:53.310
He died, and then
it was Pete Best,

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.750
but he didn't kind of work
out, and we didn't like him,

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:56.940
and so then it was Ringo.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.610
It's like, when I read
about companies starting,

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:03.720
it's often, OK, this was
the beginning, and then--

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.540
in fact, I just met a guy who
said, I was part of a startup.

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.980
It was successful,
but I realized

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.750
I didn't want to
do it, so I bailed.

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:12.060
I sold my half to the
other ones, and I'm out.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.720
People shift around.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.265
But essentially, it
does come from either,

00:58:16.265 --> 00:58:17.640
we have a good
idea because we've

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.973
been fooling around together
and come up with something.

00:58:19.973 --> 00:58:23.700
Or in a lot of cases now,
it's like, we worked somewhere

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.380
on something before,
but we always

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:29.540
had this thing we talked about
as a thing we'd like to try.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:35.790
But there are so many steps
between that and even VC

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:37.830
or anything becoming a company.

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:41.999
Lots don't obviously
get that far.

00:58:41.999 --> 00:58:44.040
But it is interesting what
you're saying, though,

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.790
about it is kind of your
personal network of people

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:51.360
you know well at first.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.430
You're not discovering people
on Instagram for your company.

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:58.860
It's people you know and
trust in the beginning,

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:03.780
and think deeply about stuff.

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:08.640
And then it's a long, long
journey after that, I think.

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.810
And so how that happens?

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:13.280
I mean, we're lucky
to live in a place

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.590
and in a time when there's
so many things that

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:21.540
are, like, incubators,
and angel investors,

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.180
and small accelerators,
and things that

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:29.190
are for very early stage,
just fooling around

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:33.120
startups that are not
formulated at all,

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.210
but it's a few people trying
to figure something out.

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:37.680
And by the way,
they're networking,

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.710
and talking to other people,
and testing out their ideas.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:44.190
So it's very hit and
miss, but I think

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:46.262
that's what, I don't
know, makes it seem--

00:59:46.262 --> 00:59:48.720
LOUIS GREY: I'm going to say
it's a small conversation that

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.620
turns into an idea.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.699
KAREN WICKRE: Yeah.

00:59:50.699 --> 00:59:51.990
That's a good way of saying it.

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:53.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:54.180
It's great to be here.

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.330
It's really great.
