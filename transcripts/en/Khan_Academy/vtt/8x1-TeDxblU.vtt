00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.059
In the last couple of videos,
I had started a cupcake

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.440
factory and I was the richest
guy in town and I was doing so

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.080
well that it attracted
competition.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.720
And then Imran came
in and he started

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.040
his own cupcake factory.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.520
And he took all of my
business and he

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.340
ended up charging $2.90.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.440
And, I think, the number I used
in the last video, he

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.980
sold 500,000 cupcakes.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.340
And he had this great
return on asset.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.710
I think it was 20%
of something.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.060
He took away all my business
and I got decimated.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.440
I think my cupcakes-- I was
originally charging

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.540
something like $3.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.170
And my cupcakes, I only started
selling 250,000 of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.160
them and then my
return on asset

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.390
essentially went to zero.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.545
I was kind of break-even.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.550
And at the end of the last
video, not being a great

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.860
businessman, I said, oh
well, actually let

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.140
me just raise prices.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.360
Because I have this set number
of customers and they like the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.990
way I operate the cash register
a little bit, or

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.400
maybe they live a little bit
closer to my cupcake factory,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.460
or my bakery, or whatever
you want to call it.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.672
And so I actually
raised prices.

00:00:57.672 --> 00:01:00.560
I cut out a little bit of a
profit, but actually by doing

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.310
that, I do lose a couple of
these people because they are

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.680
willing to walk a little bit
further for a cupcake.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.150
But I get an OK return.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
But this is kind of maximizing
it and then, over time, more

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.930
and more people realize that
Imran's charging so much less

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.840
for cupcakes.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.610
So actually my revenue stream
starts to decline because

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.900
fewer and fewer people
show up.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.400
I say this really isn't a
sustainable situation.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.650
Imran came here.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.950
I think he was he was selling
500,000, right?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.190
He's getting this great
return on asset.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.280
I'm getting this crummy
return on asset.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.920
I'm only making $40,000
a year; he's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.330
making $300,000 a year.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.080
I need to get back at him.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.640
So what I do is, I say, let me
lower the price and, besides

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.710
taking some of his business,
there will actually be some

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.100
incremental more people in the
town who will actually

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.780
start buying it.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.580
So it's not a zero sum game.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.580
A zero sum game means that if I
win, someone else is losing

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.250
by that amount.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.920
If I lower prices, I'll take
some business from Imran.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.080
But there will also be people
who were probably eating

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.910
something more nutritious than
cupcakes who might now eat

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.440
cupcakes to get their daily
requirements of sugar and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.810
trans-fat then, in the case
of my cupcakes, nicotine.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.840
So, let's say, I cut prices
below Imran because I realize

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.250
this increase price strategy
was kind of silly.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.730
So I lower my prices to $2.70
and, at $2.70, I'm able to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.900
sell, I don't know,
400,000 cupcakes.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.680
And I took some business
from Imran, right?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.920
I'm not a lot cheaper
than him, but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.760
I'm a good bit cheaper.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.770
So, let's say, I took some
business, so he's only selling

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.020
400,000 cupcakes and now, the
aggregate cupcake and--

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.070
actually not.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.380
Let's ignore this for a little
bit because now, in this

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.130
reality, I'm getting a 15%
return on my asset.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.740
Imran's getting a 7% percent
return on asset.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.260
Let's say there's a third party,
Vikram And he just has

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.570
a love for making cupcakes and
he says, well, you know, what

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.410
if I could spend my life making
cupcakes and, even if I

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.940
just get a 7% return, that's
a pretty good living.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.250
And a 15% return
would be great.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.910
So he also enters the market.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.410
He's kind of a smaller
operator.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.150
He didn't have quite as much so
he puts $500,000 into it.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.190
He has a 400,000 cupcake
per year capacity.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.415
Since there's a smaller
factory , it's

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:14.300
a little less efficient.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.320
It costs them a little bit more
to produce a cupcake.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.790
And he comes in and he says, you
know, my joy in life isn't

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.170
so much-- he obviously has to
pay his bills, he likes to be

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.460
rich --but he says, he just
derives joy from seeing people

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.570
eat cupcakes.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.990
So he undercuts everybody.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.620
And in doing so he just operates
at full capacity.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.050
He operates at 400,000.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.750
He operates at full capacity.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.565
And then he takes business
from these guys.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.200
And then he takes business
from me as well.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.670
And then, what's the state of
affairs in our city now?

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.400
So my return on asset is 7%.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.290
Imran is essentially
at break-even.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.160
He's making no money.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.020
And then Vikram is making a 12%
return on asset because--

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.080
essentially, he undercut
everyone and was able to take

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.440
all the volume.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.850
And, if you look at the city
as a whole, that's the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.320
aggregate capacity right here.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.190
And this is the second worksheet
in that-- Let me

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.460
tell you where it is again, if
you didn't watch the last

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.710
video, is khanacademy.org/
downloads/cupcakes.xls.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.440
But anyway, Vikram had entered
the market, and now I

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.130
calculated here aggregate
capacity.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.930
This is the total number of
cupcakes all of the factories

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.240
in the market can produce.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240
This is the aggregate demand.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.730
So 1.1 million cupcakes are
getting sold a year and then

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.550
this is the average return
on asset, right?

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.780
But in this situation, what
continues to happen?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.180
I have all of this
extra capacity.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.460
Only 32% of my capacity is being
utilized and, obviously,

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.000
right now you can say the market
price for cupcakes is

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.760
well above the marginal cost
of producing a cupcake.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600
And Imran's sitting there with
this huge amount of capacity,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.480
and maybe he's the richest guy,
because he has a huge

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.080
inheritance from grandma.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.690
And so he says, this is silly.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.110
I'm the biggest guy in town.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.100
I'm the most efficient
guy in town.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.340
I have all the capacity.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.030
I'm the richest guy in town
and I'm making the worst

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.720
returns on assets.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.290
So what he says is, you know
what, I'm just going to

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.650
undercut everybody.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.955
I'm going to charge
$1.70 per cupcake.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:35.070
At $1.70 per cupcake, all of a
sudden, there's a whole new

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.560
market for people who want
to eat cupcakes.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.220
There's a lot of people who
might have been eating

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.340
Twinkies and other things, that
maybe they could get at

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.040
$1.80 per Twinkie, and now
cupcakes are the desired

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.140
source of food.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.690
So, obviously, aggregate demand
is going to go up and,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.160
let's say, he just sells out.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.280
He just goes and he sells two
million cupcakes a year.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.880
And so he makes a huge
return and he

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.020
just kills our business.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.380
So I'm just taking huge losses
and Vikram is taking huge

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.340
losses, right?

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.660
He's like, you know what, we
have to match his prices.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.650
I sell it at $1.70 and then
Vikram sells at $1.70.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.960
And we said at $1.70, people are
willing to eat two million

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.860
cupcakes in a year.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.660
So, let's say, at $1.70 it's
split evenly between-- well

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.110
Vikram can only produce
400,000 cupcakes.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.960
So let's say he sells 400,000.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.790
And then the remainder split
between the other two.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:48.140
So, let's see, 800,000
and 800,000.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.160
And, as you can see here,
there's a general trend that,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.310
as people have extra capacity,
there's almost this incentive

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.990
to lower your price relative
to the other person.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.390
Because if you're not using your
capacity, then that's a

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.300
cupcake that's not being
made that otherwise

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.270
could have been made.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.060
And your cost of producing that
incremental cupcake is a

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.170
lot lower, so you're just
like, well, as long as I

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.600
charge something more than that,
I'm going to make money

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.600
that I otherwise wouldn't
have made.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.920
But when you do that,
you're actually

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.060
lowering the market price.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.300
And then all the parties keep
wanting to do that.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.630
And that's why competition
really is good for customers.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.230
And that's why a monopoly
is bad.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.430
If you were a monopoly, if Sal's
Cupcakes were the only

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.950
guy in town, he could just
keep his prices high.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.220
And even if his utilization went
down, there would be no

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.090
incentive for him
to lower prices.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.850
But in this reality with
competition, there's this huge

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.640
incentive that, when you have
extra capacity, especially if

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.190
you have a lot of extra
capacity, there's this huge

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.640
incentive to lower prices
so that you can

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.140
utilize that capacity.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.220
Likewise, if you're running near
full capacity, there's a

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.670
huge incentive to
raise prices.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.080
Because if you're at full
capacity, and we saw that in

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.460
the last video, when it was
just me, I went to full

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.280
capacity and I was able to raise
prices because all that

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.740
extra money just goes to me.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.640
But, as you can see, there's a
couple of key learning points

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.370
in this set of videos.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.420
When you have huge returns, as
Sal's Cupcakes had in this

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.730
video or in this worksheet over
here-- When you have huge

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.730
returns, it attracts
competition.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.140
The competition attracts
capacity, right?

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.410
We went from aggregate capacity
from one million with

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.040
my original factory,
to now 3.4 million.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.560
And then, when you have that
extra capacity, everyone's

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.570
incentive is really to lower
prices so that they can try to

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.350
grab some of that utilization.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.340
The only way that you could
avoid this is, if Sal, Imran,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.789
and Vikram were to meet in a
room and say, hey guys what

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.450
we're doing is silly why don't
we just all agree on a price.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.020
And you might say that's a good
business move and, if you

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.750
actually did it, you would
end up in jail.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.330
Well, hopefully you'd be
in jail if you had good

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.570
regulators, because that's
called collusion.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.100
You'd be forming a cartel.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.120
You'd be forming a group that
is trying to control prices.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.170
So in a truly competitive
environment, we're not allowed

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.630
to communicate and we're not
allowed to tell each other,

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.430
hey, why don't we just
set prices at X.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.340
We always have to be competing
with each other and lowering

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.870
our prices.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.010
But the general theme here
is, when you're at high

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.350
utilization-- the whole reason
why I'm even entering into

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.780
this whole spreadsheet and all
of that, is to talk about

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.080
inflation in general.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.470
But, in general, prices will
go up when you have high

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.150
utilization, right?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.130
If all of us were running
at 100% utilization--

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.390
Actually, let's do
that scenario.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.810
Let's say, for whatever reason,
everyone is able to

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.080
get cheap loans, and they take
home equity loans, and they

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.570
decide to use all of that extra
money that is coming

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.900
from their home ATM
to buy cupcakes.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.170
So aggregate demand goes up huge
and all of the cupcakes

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.820
in the market get sold out.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.130
So I'm selling a million
cupcakes per year.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.980
Imran is selling two million
cupcakes per year.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.760
And then Vikram is
selling 400.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.620
So we're all tapped out, we're
at 100% capacity utilization.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.940
And then the return on assets
are pretty good.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.660
But we all, as a group, say,
wow, you know, if I'm already

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.190
sold out, why don't I just raise
prices because it's not

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.180
going to affect demand
so much.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.710
People want cupcakes so badly,
so I could raise prices to $2.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.770
That improves my return
on asset.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.880
Imran's no dummy, so he
does the same thing.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.370
He raises his price to $2.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.100
And let's say people are getting
so much money from

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.790
their home equity loans and
they're still willing to buy

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.750
the cupcakes from us.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.790
And Vikram does the
same at $2.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.170
And so everyone's return on
asset improves even more and

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.910
you can even argue that it would
attract competition.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.670
But I think three players
is good enough.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.870
And let's say it just keeps
happening and I realize that I

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:46.710
can raise my prices all the way
to $3 without affecting my

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.620
utilization, without any
impact on demand.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.520
Let's say it has a slight
impact on utilization.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.620
So I'm selling 950,000
cupcakes a year.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.490
He's selling, I don't
know, 1.8 million

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.900
cupcakes in a year.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.180
And let's say Vikram
is selling 380,000

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.740
cupcakes in a year.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.000
But in general, if you look at
returns in the industry, in

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.750
this situation, by raising our
prices, we're getting better

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.770
and better returns, right?

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.670
More money's coming to
the bottom line.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.140
So, as long as we have a pretty
high utilization-- and

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.830
people debate on what is the
level of utilization in lot of

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.260
industries where it makes
sense to raise prices.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.710
But, when you're at a relatively
high utilization,

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.880
it really pays to increase
your price hurdle.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.740
And on the other side of the
coin, when you have a low

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.890
utilization of your asset, even
though it might not be

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.340
completely-- well, it is
rational if you're a

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.360
competitor.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.160
But when you have very low
utilization, you essentially

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.120
want to lower your prices so
that you can utilize your

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.100
factory more.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.060
And you can play around with
this and just think about some

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.070
scenarios yourself.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.710
And that's the real big take
away I wanted you to get at,

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.420
is that high utilization of
anything, of our aggregate

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.840
capacity, prices
will increase.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.600
Low utilization, prices
will decrease.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.850
And actually I'll
say two things.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.510
High utilization will allow you
to raise prices and when

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.620
you raise price you'll get a
better return on your asset,

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.560
and then the other side effect
is, when you have that high

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.630
return on asset, you'll also
have more investment going on

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.250
to build more capacity.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.990
So aggregate capacity
will go on.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.570
So those are the two side
effects of high utilization.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.560
You have prices increasing and
then you have more capacity or

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.200
more investment coming on.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.730
Low utilization, you have kind
of the opposite situation.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.560
No incentive for someone to add
a factory, like we did in

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.800
these situations, and there's
every incentive for every

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.840
player in the market to the
lower prices because they just

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.110
want to use their factories.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.680
Otherwise their factories
just go unutilized.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.900
Anyway, I think I said the
same thing five times in

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.410
different ways, but I think
that's your point.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.050
I'll return to the drawing
board, literally, in the next

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.540
video and we can proceed with
our discussion of inflation

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.060
and deflation.
