00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.800
You don't necessarily need to have a
Computer Science degree to be successful

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.400
as a Ruby developer.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.830
I went to art school, which doesn't seem
to have anything to do with code, but

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.550
it was still an extremely valuable
set of experiences that I was able to

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.800
bring with me.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.860
For example, one of the most important
parts of art school is critique,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.280
where we give each other
feedback on our work.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.240
Through this process, I learned how
to accept and internalize criticism

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.110
in a way that helps me work
well with others on a team.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.148
Think about some of your own experiences
that you're bringing with you into this

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:28.560
nano degree program.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.260
Whether you're coming from sales,
have worked for a family business, or

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.540
are still a student,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.210
everyone comes to code with some sort
of transferable skill or knowledge.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.790
Take a moment to reflect on some
of your own transferable skills.
