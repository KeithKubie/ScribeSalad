00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.880
So here we are in the Python documentation, and

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.870
if I scroll down, I can find a module

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.420
named turtle. There is a lot of helpful information

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.310
about the module here, including information on why turtle

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.690
is actually called turtle. And if I scroll down

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.660
on this page, I will find a class Turtle.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.040
Turtle with a capital T, which is the class

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.620
we used. There it is. I'm going to go back,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.610
and if I scroll down again, I can see all of

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.360
the methods we use. Like forward, right, and a lot of others.
