00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
I'm a fellow at the Berkman Klein
Center. Very happy to be here and I'm

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.340
originally Swiss but spent the past 18
years in in Asia. I'm looking at AI

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.789
and always from China and maybe a larger Asian angles. The research question is

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.330
it's partially copy/paste from the 10 or
15 year older question. "What about

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.429
the Internet in China and outside?" And
now the question is "What about AI in

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.960
China and outside of China?" There's
a lot of a lot of stuff to to be looked

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.809
at. AI will have as big an impact
on society. And society always means me

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.129
you and the family and everybody around us. Just as the Internet20 years

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.949
ago, and over time. It would not be
wise to say the Internet  is not for

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.469
me or to say nowadays AI is not for me
because it's going to be around you anyway.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.899
And so from a personal individual
point of view or a company point of view

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.970
or even a family point of view, I think
it makes sense to start looking around

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.119
and see what's going on. Does it
help you? Does it hurt you? Should

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.830
you use it? Should you not use it? Then
once it's clear that you should

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.140
use it and how do you use it? What are
the tools, what are the risks for

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.130
employees, risk for companies, risk for
kids? I'm always worried about the people

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.920
who are not able to enjoy a technology.
I think that scares me because it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.329
creates a even larger gap. You don't only have rich people and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.740
poor people, and you have that divide. But
I think with the rich and the poor you have an

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.110
additional divide of using technology or
not using technology or being able and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.450
having the money to use technology will
make the rich richer and the poor

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.159
more poor. So that's something that scares me because it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.220
creates tension and we've seen that over
the past 10 or 20 years.
