From Disney,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.320
comes a movie made for everyone.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.700
From 10-year-old girls

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.420
to people high on shrooms

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.160
to...

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.460
Actually, that's pretty much it.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.100
This one is really Nietzsche.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.620

finding her missing father and learning to believe in herself

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.780
While at the same time, director Ava DuVernay pours LSD directly into both your eyeballs

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.040
In a bonkers mix of grounded straightforward storytelling

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.660
and Reese Witherspoon transforming into a giant flying leaf Pokemon.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.540
"Wow."

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.140
I am freaking out, man!

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.500

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.760
"Shut up Meg"

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.800
"Yeah, shut up Meg"

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.680
"Shut up Meg."

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.640
When her dad pulls an Interstellar

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.260
and crosses the universe with the.. power of love?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.920
"Love. That's the frequency."

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.280
She'll team up with her brother, young Sheldon

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.560
Three fairy godmothers

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.040
and a cute boy who just kind of wanders in

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.180
"What are you doing here?"

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.680
"I don't know"

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.460
Together, they'll find her dad on the set of Drake's "Hotline Bling" video

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.980

That's the one.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.000
Get ready for more A-List stars dressed like J-Pop Idols than an anime themed met gala

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.020
Featuring the larger than life wise sage known as Oprah

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.920
As a more grounded 100 foot tall version of herself

Reese Witherspoon as your favorite weird aunt

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.660
"We're warriors who serve the good and light in the universe"

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.040
and Mindy Kaling as that copy of Bartlett's familiar quotations you leave near the toilet

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.520
"Tomorrow, there will be more of us. Miranda, American"

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.200
"'The foot feels the foot when it feels the ground. Buddha Napoli"

Epic Voice Guy, Internet.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.480
So thrill at the latest Disney juggernaut

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.440
Which enchanted critics (with the idea that this is awful source material to make a movie out of) and made (a fraction of) a billion dollars at the bo--

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.140
Wait, what?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.900
It wasn't a critical success?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.040
"I'm underwhelmed"

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.040
And it was a box office disappointment?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.780
And this isn't the first time they screwed up A Wrinkle In Time?

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.300
That's impossible...

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.980
That just doesn't happen in Disney

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.480
(Tell that to John Carter and The Lone Ranger from 2013)

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.400
Is this a dream? Seriously is this a dream?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800
Am I dreaming right now man?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.500
Because I had a couple of edibles before seeing the movie and I'm kind of waiting for the second one to kick i--

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.460

"My gift is my command"

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.580
Note to self: Don't invite Reese Witherspoon and Oprah to your secret santa

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.760
Their gifts suck!

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:48.780
