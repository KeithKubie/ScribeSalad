[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:10.332
DANIEL DREZNER: Thank you.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.210
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.172
It's good to be back
to the Bay Area.

00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:19.130
The one problem with
getting a PhD from a place

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.160
usually is that they don't hire
you afterwards as a professor.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.660
So you're sort of
like Moses knowing

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.270
that when you get
to the promised land

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.430
you can't go inside the walls.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.650
So it's good occasionally
to visit and know

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.260
that you can be back.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.270
So this book is a
little personal for me

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.460
in the sense of
one of the reasons

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.710
I got a PhD in political science
was that I sort of naively

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.862
believed that part
of what you could do

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:46.820
would be to influence
the marketplace of ideas.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.167
That as a political scientist
I could write things

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:52.250
in a variety of venues and
people would read them.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.740
And who knows, maybe policy
would actually get changed.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.450
And to be fair, that's not
entirely unrealistic or I

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.176
wasn't--

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.010
I didn't think it was
necessarily naive.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.000
John Maynard Keynes in one
of his great masterworks

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.970
wrote very famously
"The ideas of economists

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.550
and political philosophers,
both when they are right

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.460
and when they are wrong, are
more powerful than is commonly

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.660
understood.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.510
Indeed the world is
ruled by little else.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.010
Practical men who
believe themselves

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.190
to be quite exempt from
any intellectual influence

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
are usually the slaves of
some defunct economist,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.310
mad men in authority who
hear voices in the air

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.730
are distilling the frenzy
from some academic scribbler

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.390
of a few years back."

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.932
So Keynes thinks
that ideas matters--

00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:36.181
I'm not nearly as smart as
he is-- but I thought maybe

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:38.810
that would potentially be the
way in which you could actually

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.130
have an impact on the world.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.629
And there is that
kind of naive view

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:44.360
that even if you write less
sort of serious scholarly work,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.030
eventually some
version of that idea

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.590
will trickle down to the rest
of the world with the idea

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.990
that therefore you can
actually have a relatively

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.000
appropriate conversation
about the right way

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.680
to advance democracy or
secure the national interest

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.320
or what have you.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.029
Of course there is a
valid question about

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:06.653
whether or not the
marketplace of ideas

00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:07.910
actually works terribly well.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.310
And indeed, part of the
reason I wrote this book

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.990
was that things
had been happening

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.300
over the last few
years that suggest

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.660
that maybe intellectuals
don't necessarily--

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.020
the sort of way in which the
marketplace of ideas functions

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.690
isn't exactly the way
we would want it to.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.140
So Exhibit A would be the notion
that you had on the one hand

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.420
a president in Barack Obama
who actually, I think,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.270
thought of himself
as an intellectual.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.760
And yet once he
became president,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.610
to some extent felt
imprisoned by a category

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.510
he referred to as the blob which
refer to the sort of collection

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.100
of foreign policy intellectuals
and think tankers and so

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.390
on and so forth in Washington
DC who he felt constrained

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.867
what he could do as president.

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:51.950
And then on the other hand,
you have Donald Trump.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.658
And you have to give
Donald Trump credit.

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:57.410
As a candidate, he
managed to actually unify

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.950
the opinions of people who
studied foreign policy ranging

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.920
from the far left
to the far right,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.320
in which there was almost
unanimity that this guy would

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.460
be an unmitigated disaster as
a foreign policy president.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.230
Various petitions were signed.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.150
Various statements
from historians

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.012
or political scientists or
economists or foreign policy

00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:19.220
experts, including a lot of
Republican foreign policy

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.880
experts, warning
this was a bad idea.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.350
If anything, Trump
as a candidate

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.710
leaned into this
basically saying,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.010
we need to shake the rust out
of American foreign policy.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.350
And in some ways
echoing Michael Gove

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.980
who was a British minister who
during the Brexit campaign,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.890
even though every sort
of expert community

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.930
warned the Brexit
would not work out well

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.940
for the British
economy, Gove responded

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.210
I welcome the fact that the
experts are on the other side.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.299
I think we need to
listen to the people.

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.590
And as a result, despite all
of these sort of warnings,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.371
Donald Trump got
elected president.

00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.140
I also, to deal
personally with the fact--

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.000
as David said, I've
written six books.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.380
And this is the sixth one.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.630
And I'm proud of all my books.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.940
But I have to recognize that
without question the book

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.810
that everyone will remember
when I am long dead and gone

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.960
is a book I wrote
about zombies which

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.284
was a small textbook trying
to explain what theories

00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:15.950
of international
relations would predict

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.720
would happen if, in
fact, the dead started

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.240
rising from the grave and
tried to feast upon the living.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.490
Now don't get me wrong, I'm
really proud of that book.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.990
I worked hard on it.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.540
But it is telling that
that's the book that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.690
captures the most amount of
attention in the public sphere.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.990
It makes me feel a little
bit guilty at times.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.730
But at the same
time, and this sort

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.420
of reflects a general tendency
of debate among intellectuals,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.767
usually when intellectuals
are talking about what

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:42.350
is the marketplace
of ideas look like,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.810
what's the of state
of public discourse,

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.180
they tend to be
extremely pessimistic.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.630
And this is a trope that
has gone on, you can argue,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.340
from the 1950s and late
1960s with Richard Hofstadter

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.350
and "Anti-intellectuals
in American Life,"

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.440
and in the '80s Russell Jacoby,
"The Last Intellectuals."

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.340
And you have a whole raft of
books over the last few years

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.597
that have basically suggested
that the state of ideas

00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:10.680
is not what it used to be.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.110
And indeed, the only
debate among intellectuals

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.200
seems to be when did things
start to go downhill?

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.680
For some people it was the death
that the New York intellectuals

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.710
that would write for "Dissent,"
or what have you in the 1950s.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.422
For others, it was the death
of Bloomsbury, the group

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:26.880
that actually
Keynes, among others,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.680
was a part of in
the United Kingdom

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.190
during the anti-war period.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.620
And then others
just basically go

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.661
back to the death of
Socrates and argue that it's

00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:36.060
been downhill since then.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.600
And that said, I actually don't
necessarily agree with that.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.210
In some ways, there's
never been a better time

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.430
to be an intellectual.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.570
There is a whole variety
of conferences and venues

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.580
in which people are
perfectly willing to hear

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.180
what I have to say.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.846
The fact that you all
would have me here

00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:54.270
is extremely comfortable--

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.010
extremely comforting.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.560
But the degree of hostility
among my colleagues

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.630
about concepts like
TED Talks for example

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.830
is fascinating to me.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.050
I have my own criticism
of that format

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.920
as a way of expressing ideas.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.730
But I also think it's somewhat
churlish of someone like me who

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.420
is paid to talk to people to
be upset that it turns out

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.720
that there's a large category
of people that want to listen

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.990
to podcasts or watch 18 minute
videos in which they are

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.370
introduced to new ideas.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.030
So we're kind of in
a weird situation.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.877
We know that
something seems to be

00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:27.210
off in the marketplace of ideas.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.830
But on the other
hand, I do wonder

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.990
if people are potentially
being overly pessimistic.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.430
So one explanation
for all of this

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.814
is it's all social
media's fault.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.480
The problem is that
everyone is addicted

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.260
to Twitter or Facebook or some
Google product which I'm sure

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.730
I can't name that
is at fault. And I

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.330
don't think that's the case,
because among other things

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.850
even sort of very stodgy
public intellectuals

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.100
are now on Twitter as well.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.610
It's not like they're
neglecting these things.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.071
And indeed in
researching the book,

00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:59.820
I thought this might
be one of the causes.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.444
And I was struck by
the degree to which

00:07:01.444 --> 00:07:03.720
regardless of one's
intellectual quality,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.580
they all do want to
be on social media.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.610
They will tweet about it.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.070
My explanation instead
rests on the notion

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.890
that there are two types of
intellectuals that essentially

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.630
contribute to the
marketplace of ideas

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.671
particularly in the area
of foreign policy, which

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:19.440
is the area that I
know the best about.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.057
And I call these two
categories public intellectuals

00:07:22.057 --> 00:07:22.890
and thought leaders.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.200
Now these are terms that
are constantly used a lot

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.166
and often mean different
things to different people.

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:29.790
So I'll be a little
more exact in terms

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.130
of what I'm talking about.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.960
Public intellectuals,
in some ways,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.910
are Isaiah Berlin's foxes.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.220
So Isaiah Berlin wrote
a great essay back

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.830
in the 1930s called "The
Hedgehog and the Fox"

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.110
where he said that there
were two kinds of thinkers.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.290
The fox knows a little bit
about a lot and the hedgehog

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.190
knows one big thing.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.370
So public intellectuals
work like foxes.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.200
They know a little
bit about a lot.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.970
And they essentially
are critics.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.190
Public intellectuals
excel at telling you

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.817
everything that is wrong
with everyone else's idea.

00:07:59.817 --> 00:08:00.900
And that's a good quality.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.234
That is a quality that you want.

00:08:03.234 --> 00:08:05.650
If you're introduced to a new
idea, you want to know well,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.390
what do I think about this?

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.800
And certainly to
some extent, you

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.330
want to make your own judgment.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.820
But you also want to hear
from learned scholars

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.330
presumably in terms of
what they think about it.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.700
Thought leaders, on the
other hand, are hedgehogs.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.560
Thought leaders
have one big idea

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.750
that they think can
explain everything.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.080
If you throw any kind of
policy problem at this person,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.150
they will somehow find
a way to get it back

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.430
to whatever their big idea is.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.350
So thought leaders
are evangelists.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.230
Thought leaders desperately
want to tell you exactly the way

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.694
the world works.

00:08:35.694 --> 00:08:37.110
And to some extent
one of the ways

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.679
they excel is by explaining
the extant arguments about this

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.740
are wrong, I have a better idea.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.460
Now to be very clear, I
believe that a good functioning

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.010
marketplace of ideas needs both
of these kinds of thinkers.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.140
You need both
public intellectuals

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.194
and you need thought leaders.

00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:56.610
And if you have them in balance,
it works relatively well.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.225
It means that someone will come
up with a new kind of idea.

00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:00.600
And then you have
thought leaders

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.370
that will stress test it to
within an inch of its life.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.610
So the bad ideas presumably
eventually disappear

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.680
and the good ideas
might actually persist,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.570
eventually become
consensus, and indeed

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.370
might trickle down either to the
public or to key policymakers.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.890
The problem is you're
in a situation where

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.240
it's out of balance.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.490
If you have a marketplace
of ideas where there are too

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.430
many public intellectuals and
not enough thought leaders,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.070
essentially the barriers
to entry are too high.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.660
Critics are too powerful.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.550
Someone who tries to
come up with a new idea

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.740
easily get shot down.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.540
And so as a result,
the marketplace

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.420
becomes sort of
stagnant and ossified.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.560
It's just an oligopoly.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.920
It's very difficult to sort of
crack this kind of marketplace.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.150
And that's potentially
problematic.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.970
On the other hand, a
marketplace in which

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.010
thought leaders predominate
and there aren't

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.710
a lot of public intellectuals,
the problem in this instance

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.170
is that the barriers
to exit are too high.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.930
In essence, you have a much
more vibrant and potentially

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.270
heterogeneous
marketplace of ideas.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.540
The problem is, is that
stupid ideas don't die.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.952
You operate in a world where
essentially a thought leader

00:10:02.952 --> 00:10:04.410
can come up with
an idea that might

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.940
be seductive for a whole
variety of reasons.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.330
But if critics aren't powerful
enough, they can't kill it.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.300
And so as a result
bad ideas will

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.930
persist and wind up potentially
getting into the mainstream.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.040
So essentially, if I was
writing this book back

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.622
in let's say the 1960s,
I would make the argument

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:25.830
that the problem is, is that
public intellectuals are

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.746
too powerful and we need
more thought leaders.

00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:30.090
But because I'm
writing this in 2017,

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.920
I'm essentially
arguing the opposite.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.570
That, in fact,
there are three sort

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.750
of major tectonic forces
in the United States

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.780
that have stacked the deck
powerfully in favor of thought

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.861
leaders and have undercut the
sort of traditional sources

00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:43.860
of public intellectuals.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.530
So I'll explain what
those three are.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.750
The first is the
erosion of trust

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.700
in authority and expertise.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.700
So this data comes from
the Pew Research Center.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.090
But I could have ginned up
data from Gallup or the General

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.320
Social Survey or any kind
of long-run survey stream.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.910
And they all show
the same thing.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.150
With the exception of the
United States military,

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.030
Americans' trust in
every major governmental

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.480
and non-governmental institution
has declined precipitously

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.280
since the 1960s.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.460
Essentially beginning with
Vietnam and Watergate,

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.880
it follows this
exact same thing.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.190
It goes-- and then it sort of
ping-pongs for a little bit.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.460
After 9/11 there
is a brief spike.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.590
Trust in institutions
really goes up after 9/11.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.430
And since then, [EXPLOSION]
it's been really, really bad.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.040
And we are now at sort of
ultra low levels in almost all

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.560
of these things.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.930
This includes, by the way
knowledge institutions.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.210
So the General
Social Survey runs

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.360
an annual question in terms of
confidence in knowledge based

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.880
institutions, or institutions
that generate knowledge--

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.680
medicine or higher
education or what

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.510
have you in the
scientific community.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.710
In 1974, approximately
50% of Americans

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.790
placed a high degree of
trust in those institutions.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.870
By 2012, the average had
fallen to 30% of Americans

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.090
that had placed high trust
in those institutions.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.790
So as a result, the problem is,
is that essentially Americans

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.420
don't trust the sort of
traditional institutions

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.840
that generate presumably
knowledge or expertise.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.390
Now the effect of this on
the marketplace of ideas

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.170
is pretty clear.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.210
Which is essentially those
who traditionally produce

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.420
public intellectuals, which are
primarily universities or think

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.900
tanks or what have you, very
often used to have the ability

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.580
to argue from authority.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.519
Which is say a Harvard
professor says thing x is bad.

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:37.060
And readers would
see that and think,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.250
oh, well he's a
professor at Harvard,

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.410
we should totally listen to him,
even If he didn't necessarily

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.201
know what he was talking
about, by the way,

00:12:42.201 --> 00:12:44.190
just the fact that he
was a Harvard professor.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.690
But we are now
operating in a world

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.940
where no one cares
necessarily if you

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.310
are a tenured
professor at Harvard

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.040
or if you were a think
tank fellow at Brookings

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.190
or if you were a MacArthur
Genius Grant winner or a Nobel

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.210
Prize winner.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.220
Those sort of appellations
don't matter nearly as much.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.770
And so as a result, this has
lowered the barriers to entry.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.440
Someone can make an argument
as a thought leader,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.174
even if they lack, potentially,
the traditional accreditations.

00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:09.840
Even though, by the
way, thought leaders

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.100
might very well have
these accreditations--

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.290
I'm not trying to say
that they're necessarily

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.050
less well-educated--
but it basically

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.510
by Americans distrusting
traditional sources

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.790
of authority, it opens
up the possibility

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.130
for new thought leaders
to enter the marketplace.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.920
The second trend that
matters is the rise

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.630
of political polarization.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.940
So this chart is from a
traditional political science

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.800
data set that scores basically
how Republicans and Democrats

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.310
in the House vote.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.830
And as you can see,
the data on this

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.480
is relatively
incontrovertible which

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.229
is over the last 30 or
40 years or so, Democrats

00:13:43.229 --> 00:13:45.270
have shifted somewhat to
the left and Republicans

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.120
have shifted way,
way, way to the right.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.990
But this is not just limited to
the House of Representatives.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.540
The Pew Research Center
shows data suggesting

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.240
that essentially the number
of extreme partisans,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.570
both extreme left Democrats
and extreme right Republicans,

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:06.137
have doubled basically
between 1994 and 2014.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.220
Now there's some debate
among political scientists

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.190
about whether or not
the rest of the country

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.350
is also becoming more polarized.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.360
Some people argue that
essentially, yes, this

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.640
is the case and indeed
the data since 2000

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.080
suggests this is going on.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.970
But other political
scientists argue

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.609
it's not so much that people
are becoming more extreme,

00:14:23.609 --> 00:14:25.650
it's what we would call
partisan assorting, which

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.750
is to say essentially
traditional Southern

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.610
Democrats have suddenly
decided, oh, no,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.009
we're actually Republicans.

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:33.300
Whereas, let's say, traditional
Rockefeller Republicans

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.174
who live in the Northeast
realized, no, we're

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:36.120
actually Democrats.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.880
And so if those two
categories switch parties,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.220
it makes it look like there's
stronger polarization when

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.761
really what's
happening is people are

00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:44.610
finding their ideological home.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.220
The one thing you can say is
that the political parties

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.590
are becoming more
ideologically homogeneous.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.690
in a way that was not
true 40 years ago.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.930
And the real problem
now is the effect

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.020
this has on political
elites in terms of how

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.000
they view the other side.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.730
Essentially you now have
polling that essentially

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.360
shows that an ever increasing
fraction of both Republicans

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.290
and Democrats view the partisans
on the other side as a threat

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.810
to the country,
which they did not

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.787
view in terms of survey evidence
from like the 1960s or 1970s.

00:15:15.787 --> 00:15:18.120
And that they thought they
were a threat to the nation's

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.080
well-being.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.150
And indeed we are
now at the point

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.360
where survey evidence also
shows that extreme partisans

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.060
on both sides don't
want their children

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.790
to marry outside of their
ideological persuasion.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.690
So essentially what is happening
is that partisanship has almost

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.620
replaced religion or
race or gender as sort

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.890
of a person's principle notion
of identity to some extent.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.595
And indeed there was one survey
paper that basically took--

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.610
that created fake resumes of
people in which they could

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.950
potentially put something
in like someone was working

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.660
for the Young Democrats
or the Young Republicans

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.076
in college or
something, basically

00:15:56.076 --> 00:15:58.260
a way to sort of signal
to the employer what

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.032
their ideological
predisposition was.

00:16:00.032 --> 00:16:01.740
And then they also,
before they did this,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.960
surveyed those
employers to find out

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.000
what their own political
predilections were.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.770
And what turned
out is that people

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.210
who scored as either very
conservative or very liberal

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.080
were more likely
to discriminate on

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.620
hires based on political
partisanship than based

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.440
on race or religion
or sexual orientation.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.070
So in other words, partisanship
is a powerful drug.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.851
Now the reason this affects
the marketplace of ideas

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:28.350
is that essentially if you are
a public intellectual, almost

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.177
by definition, you are going
to have heterogeneous opinions.

00:16:31.177 --> 00:16:33.510
You are sometimes going to
say something that says, hey,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.051
you know what, I
think the left might

00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:38.010
be somewhat wrong on issues
like public school choice.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.950
Or I think the right
might be wrong on denying

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.760
the existence of climate change
and the need for US policy

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.477
to address it.

00:16:46.477 --> 00:16:48.810
The problem here is that
essentially political partisans

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.540
on both sides want their
own House intellectuals.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.414
They don't want to hear
contrarian points of view.

00:16:54.414 --> 00:16:55.830
And so as a result,
this basically

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:00.240
rewards people who are
perfectly willing to say things

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.050
that essentially reinforce
partisan's preexisting

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.920
worldviews.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.599
So someone like a Dinesh D'souza
on the right for example,

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.510
who can just say
everything is Obama's fault

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.089
or Sean Hannity would be
another example of this.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.359
And then the final
trend that matters is

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.000
the rise of wealth inequality.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.819
And again, the data on this is
relatively incontrovertible.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.560
Over the last 30
to 40 years, life

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.589
has been extremely good for
the top 1% of the income

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.619
distribution.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.650
But if life has been
good for the top 1%,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.910
life has been super
awesome for the top 0.01%.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.061
Now the reason this
matters in terms

00:17:35.061 --> 00:17:36.810
of the marketplace of
ideas is not so much

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.960
the effects on society, but
rather essentially we now

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.039
have a new class of plutocrats
that essentially has more money

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:45.330
than they know what to do with.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.080
And it turns out that
what they want to do

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.550
is go back to college.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.100
They already have
a genuine interest

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.280
in promoting greater degrees
of intellectual discourse.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.850
And this is true whether we're
talking about Mark Zuckerberg

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.600
or whether we're
talking about Bill Gates

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.970
or whether we're talking
about the Koch brothers.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.480
Except it turns out they don't
actually go back to college.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.250
What they wind up
doing is creating

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.220
their own intellectual
salons or attending

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.210
other intellectual salons, like
the Davos World Economic Forum

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.680
or PopTech or South by
Southwest or the Milken Global

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.680
Conference, or a whole variety
of these kinds of conference

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.760
circuits.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.060
Now this in and of itself
is not a bad thing.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.050
I think this, on the
whole, it's genuinely good

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.000
that billionaires have
an interest in ideas.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.710
And certainly this
doesn't make them

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.470
any different from, let's
say, predecessors like Andrew

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.600
Carnegie or John Rockefeller.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.970
The difference is, is that
these people are still alive.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.540
And because they're
still alive, they

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.510
do want to use their money to
potentially try to influence

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.890
the marketplace of ideas.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.990
But they function
in some ways like--

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.210
the term is
philanthrocapitalists,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.400
which is essentially
they want a return

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.110
on their nonprofit investment.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.660
They want a return on their
intellectual investment.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.750
They want to make sure that if
they do this, it has impact.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.329
And it's tough to measure
impact when we're talking

00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:01.620
about the marketplace of ideas.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.960
I mean we can measure the degree
to which things are mentioned,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.418
but that doesn't necessarily
mean that people agree with it

00:19:06.418 --> 00:19:09.810
or not or that people have
truly internalized the beliefs.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.440
And this can potentially
be a problem.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.140
It's also potentially a problem
because, essentially, you

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.440
can argue that the top
0.01%, the billionaires,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.630
might have very strong
disagreements on things

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.620
like social policy or even
potentially economic policy.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.990
But by hanging around
with each other

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.940
and by potentially going
to these conferences,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.000
they wind up sharing a
similar kind of world view.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.620
Which is they,
generally speaking,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.720
don't necessarily
believe that much

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.550
in the role of
the state in terms

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.160
of providing key public
goods or providing

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.760
key functions in terms
of both domestic politics

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.300
and in terms of foreign policy.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.550
And indeed, there is a
danger to some extent

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.170
that they might
look at the world

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.090
and look at
international relations

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.920
and look at sort of
traditional diplomacy

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.860
and essentially think of it
as a faulty piece of code

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.560
that either needs to
be bypassed or hacked.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.210
Now potentially--
and so as a result,

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.150
you wind up with nonprofits that
essentially completely bypass

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:03.960
the state.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.293
And there are times when that
might actually be correct.

00:20:06.293 --> 00:20:08.622
But there are also times
where you simply cannot ignore

00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:10.830
the role of the American
government in terms of doing

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.310
things like running
foreign policy.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.140
So who are the
winners and losers

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.290
as a result of this kind
of new ideas industry?

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.420
The losers are sort of
the traditional sources

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.090
of authority.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:27.660
So as I said
before, universities

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.830
face some difficulties.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.020
On the one hand, the
sort of expansion

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.570
of the entire marketplace
does lead to a demand

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.920
for more intellectuals.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.680
But it also shifts the demand
from public intellectuals

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.739
to thought leaders.

00:20:38.739 --> 00:20:41.280
And the simple fact is, and I
can say this being a university

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.260
professor, most
university professors

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.550
are public intellectuals.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.980
I mean we hedge ourselves to
within an inch of our lives

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.590
when we're talking to the
public because that's what we do

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.210
when we do our scholarly work.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.660
But most members of the public
don't want to hear us hedging.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.870
They want to hear people
making very powerful

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.830
affirmative statements saying
this is true, even if we're not

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.131
necessarily certain about this.

00:21:04.131 --> 00:21:05.880
The other problem is,
is that universities

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.920
run afoul of at least
two of the trends

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.770
that I talked about causing a
shift to thought leaders, which

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:15.810
is university professors are
actually shifting way further

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.390
to the left.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.230
So this is a chart from
the UCLA's Higher Education

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.200
Research Institute that
basically surveys professors

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.020
and asked them whether
they self-identify as being

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.870
on the left or liberal,
moderate, or being

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.940
conservative.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.750
And as you can see from the
data, basically in 1989, 1990,

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.972
you had approximately
two liberals on campus

00:21:35.972 --> 00:21:36.930
for every conservative.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.763
So there's no denying
that the campuses were

00:21:38.763 --> 00:21:42.180
always further to the left
than the American body politic,

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.870
but it wasn't that much.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.260
We're now operating in a
world where essentially you

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.960
have six times as many
liberals as you do

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.510
conservatives in universities.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.270
And this ratio is
even more concentrated

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.850
if you exit let's
say the hard sciences

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.830
and talk about the
social sciences.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.870
And the problem with
this is twofold.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.190
First, just because people in
political science departments

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.230
or economics departments
are way to the left

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.392
doesn't mean they
do bad research.

00:22:09.392 --> 00:22:11.850
That would be like complaining
that the military is further

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.727
to the right and therefore
we can't trust them.

00:22:14.727 --> 00:22:15.810
These are all professions.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.143
They operate according to
professional codes and ethics.

00:22:18.143 --> 00:22:20.130
Peer reviewed
scholarship doesn't get

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.860
accepted just because it
promotes a liberal worldview.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.580
What it does do, however, is
potentially alter the questions

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.710
that scholars ask.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.320
And so as a result, I do think
the conservative criticism

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.240
of universities is a
little more accurate here

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.599
in saying if conservatives
are not on campus,

00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:37.140
then there might be
certain questions

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.510
that they don't ask
because it makes liberals

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:40.912
somewhat uncomfortable.

00:22:40.912 --> 00:22:42.870
And the other issue here
is that essentially it

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.360
creates an easy cheap shot.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.160
Which is to say if a
group of professors

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.320
produces an impeccable
piece of research

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.910
arguing we must do public policy
x and conservatives don't like

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.470
it for whatever
reason, conservatives

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.470
can always say, well,
that is a typical response

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.035
from an out of touch
elite liberal academic.

00:23:00.035 --> 00:23:01.410
And there is at
least some degree

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.151
of truth in that statement, even
if the actual research is still

00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:04.650
accurate.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.760
And so as a result, it renders
them politically vulnerable.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.010
The second group of
losers are the sort

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.217
of traditional
nonprofit think tanks.

00:23:13.217 --> 00:23:15.300
And here I'm talking about
things like the Council

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.420
on Foreign Relations or
the Brookings Institution

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.330
or the Center for Strategic
and International Studies

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.720
or what have you.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.080
Oh, sorry, I should go back.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.200
There was one other
evidence of this

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.020
so I did survey elite
intellectuals and policy

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.530
makers about their attitudes
about social science,

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.410
basically asking them if they
had more or less confidence

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.050
in it over the last 10 years.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.940
So this is the chart showing
all of the responses I got.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.264
And if you lump together more
confidence and about the same,

00:23:45.264 --> 00:23:46.680
you have a majority
of people that

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.760
have pretty strong faith in the
research from social science.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.160
But this is what the
data looks like if you

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.260
look at people who
self-identified

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.180
as either conservative
or libertarian.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.690
Which is they are much more
skeptical of academic research

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.915
than other forms
of intellectuals.

00:24:03.915 --> 00:24:05.790
With regard to think
tanks, one of the things

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.740
that has happened
over the last 10 years

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.220
or so is that essentially the
2008 financial crisis has left

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.980
think tanks badly overexposed.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.940
In the previous seven years
between 9/11 and 2008,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.740
a lot of think tanks
suddenly started

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.980
building gawdy new
headquarters in Washington.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.570
They got a lot of
research funding

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.819
from the federal government.

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:28.110
Their endowments were swelling
because the stock market

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.660
was booming and so forth.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.750
Then when the crash happened,
federal funding dried up

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.090
and traditional sort of
foundation support dried up.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.250
So as a result, these
think tanks wound up

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.620
trying to look for
new sources of income.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.670
In some cases, it
was Silicon Valley.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.670
In other cases, it was
traditional multinational

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:45.720
corporations.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.030
In other cases, it was
foreign governments.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.730
And the problem is
that this has left

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.950
think tanks being exposed to
essentially accusations of pay

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.870
for play.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.420
There's actually a memo from
the government of Norway

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.140
arguing that we should totally
fund think tanks in Washington,

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.616
because that's how we can
access key policymakers.

00:25:04.616 --> 00:25:06.240
And accusations of
conflict of interest

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.630
are extremely difficult to
combat for nonprofit think

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.820
tanks.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.290
And in terms of
political science,

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.546
as opposed to economics,
this is another issue.

00:25:15.546 --> 00:25:17.670
Essentially one of the
arguments I make in the book

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.045
is that economics
has done really

00:25:19.045 --> 00:25:20.562
well in this new marketplace.

00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:22.770
Whereas my traditional
discipline, political science,

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.500
has not.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.326
There are a variety
of reasons for this.

00:25:25.326 --> 00:25:26.700
But the biggest
one I would argue

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.280
is that economists
are simultaneously

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.410
more to the right than
political scientists are.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.410
If you poll economists,
they're much more

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.910
closer to the political center.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.830
And also economists
have a world view

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.590
that sells extremely
well to plutocrats.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.930
Which is to say the logic
of the invisible hand,

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:48.330
the logic of if just engage in
the pursuit of self-interest,

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.640
all of society
benefits, is a message

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.380
that billionaires like to hear.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.047
Political scientists,
on the other hand,

00:25:54.047 --> 00:25:55.504
we're just the
skunks at the party.

00:25:55.504 --> 00:25:57.490
We like to tell people
that essentially there

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.310
are structural factors
that really matter.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.400
That individual agency is not
necessarily that important.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.039
And if you're
really, really rich,

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:05.580
this is partially
due to your effort,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.288
but it might be
partially due to the fact

00:26:07.288 --> 00:26:09.722
that you were born
on third base.

00:26:09.722 --> 00:26:11.430
And that is something
that, surprisingly,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.977
a lot of rich people
don't like to hear.

00:26:13.977 --> 00:26:15.810
So they won't listen
to political scientists

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.750
necessarily, but they certainly
will listen to economists.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.250
All right.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.770
In terms of the winners,
there are three categories.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.550
The first is the private
sector supplier of ideas--

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.560
and I'll get to that
in a little bit.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.560
The second are sort of the
more partisan think tanks.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.790
And Beyonce always wins.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.704
Let's just be honest about that.

00:26:34.704 --> 00:26:36.870
But the reason I have Beyonce
there is basically I'm

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.330
talking about
intellectual superstars.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.460
So in terms of the
McKinsey's of the world,

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.320
what you're increasingly
seeing is the rise

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.660
of for-profit think tanks.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.760
Whether we're talking
about the McKinsey Global

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.054
Institute or Goldman Sachs
Research Institute or Kohlberg

00:26:53.054 --> 00:26:54.720
Kravis and Roberts,
which actually hired

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.300
David Petraeus to head their
own in-house think tank,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.870
or political risk consulting
like the Eurasia Group,

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.954
these kinds of groups genuinely
produce interesting research.

00:27:03.954 --> 00:27:05.370
I've consumed a
lot of their work.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.860
And I generally-- I don't
mean to diminish it--

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.212
but there are two
potential problems with it.

00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:11.670
The first is, is
that because these

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.180
are for-profit industries,
they very often don't make

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.480
their data available to people.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.480
Because very often, if
McKinsey Global Institute

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.010
is producing a
report, the report

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.040
is based in no small part
on the proprietary work

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.830
they have done by consulting
for various corporations.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.360
So they can
legitimately explain we

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.220
can't make this data available.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.260
Which is fine, but it
makes it hard for me

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.490
as an outsider to necessarily
take their arguments on faith--

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.620
or it requires me to take
their arguments on faith.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.110
I can't stress test
their own analysis.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.940
And this is certainly
true as well even

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.860
within the confines
of Silicon Valley

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.380
when Facebook does an
analysis on social, media,

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.450
for example or
something like that.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.870
The second problem with
this is that weirdly

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.890
even though for-profit companies
obviously are generally

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.010
producing this research with the
idea of attracting and drawing

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.560
people in to hire
their services,

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.110
weirdly that is seen
as less hypocritical

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.660
than nonprofit think
tanks doing research.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.480
Because at least the for-profit
folks like McKinsey are saying

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.764
look we're out to make a buck.

00:28:10.764 --> 00:28:12.930
And weirdly enough, in the
marketplace of ideas that

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.357
is somehow seen as refreshing.

00:28:15.357 --> 00:28:17.940
The second group of winners are
the more partisan think tanks.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.670
And here the Heritage Foundation
is a good example on the right.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.610
The Center for American Progress
as an example on the left.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.510
And the reason is that you
increasingly have people

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.150
either in the form of
Sheldon Adelson on the right

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.000
or let's say Tom Steyer on
the left that are perfectly

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.270
willing to fund partisan
think tanks but actually don't

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.789
want these think tanks
to necessarily cooperate

00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:40.830
with people on the other
side to actually produce

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.700
let's say cross-cutting policy
issues like prison reform

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.690
or promoting human rights
and American foreign policy.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.740
And then in terms of superstars,
we can talk about the fact

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.619
that essentially one of the
things that has happened now,

00:28:55.619 --> 00:28:57.660
even in the marketplace
for foreign policy ideas,

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.850
is that it
increasingly resembles

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.210
the marketplace for either
entertainment or sports.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.820
Which is essentially the
people at the very top tier

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.940
wind up commanding a
disproportionate share

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.520
of the total revenue
from that sector.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.040
And so as a result, you have
people like Fareed Zakaria, who

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.110
is sort of a traditional
public intellectual,

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.330
and Niall Ferguson, who
is just down the road,

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.079
and I would argue is
a traditional thought

00:29:20.079 --> 00:29:23.250
leader commanding anywhere
between mid-five figures

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.950
to low six figures for
speaking fees which they

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:29.130
can do once or twice a month.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.427
Now, again, for many of you
potentially and certainly

00:29:32.427 --> 00:29:34.260
for many of the people
in this headquarters,

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.260
the idea of potentially
making a million dollars

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.430
by just giving
speeches for a year

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.260
might not seem like
that much money.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.700
To someone like me who got
a PhD in political science

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.650
and never imagined
that that would ever

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.570
be within the realm
possibility, this

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.430
does affect what
you do somewhat.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.420
And as a result, if you can
make it to that top tier,

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.300
if you can make it to that
sort of top speaking level,

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.350
you wind up actually
becoming a superstar.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.110
But the other problem
is that you wind up

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.480
essentially becoming
a brand rather

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.310
than an individual thinker.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.870
Essentially you
are no longer asked

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.230
to just write a column for
the "Washington Post," which

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.566
Fareed Zakaria does, you
have to write a column.

00:30:11.566 --> 00:30:12.690
You have to produce a book.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.200
You have to do a TV show.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.980
You do a TV documentary
based on the book you wrote,

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.550
which by the way Niall
Ferguson has done six times.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.110
All of these things
are really good.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.270
But essentially, you
are asking intellectuals

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.920
to do the one thing
that intellectuals

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.940
are really, really bad at
which is manage themselves.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.600
And inevitably, if you wind up
being put in this situation,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.370
corners don't
necessarily get cut

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.720
but they get rounded
a little bit.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.150
So in the case of
Fareed Zakaria,

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.640
he has run into trouble in
terms of plagiarism scandals

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.150
because it turns out that
approximately 15 of his columns

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.640
cribbed language
from other things.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.510
He had basically cut and paste.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.180
Or in the case of
Niall Ferguson,

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.280
making claims in his
columns he just turned out

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.250
to be wildly
factually inaccurate.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.160
And the problem is that
this sort of intellectuals

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.760
in the top tier wind up making
ever more of these mistakes.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.149
And as a result, the sort
of top tier intellectuals,

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:06.690
particularly thought
leaders, wind up

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.360
essentially being treated a
lot like indie rock bands which

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.670
is everyone who likes
their early work,

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.470
their early authentic
work back when

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.820
they were sort of tat the
low level, when it just

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.880
used to be about the ideas man.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.882
But then, once they actually
get to a degree of celebrity,

00:31:20.882 --> 00:31:22.590
they wind up producing
things that invite

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.290
massive amounts of criticism.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.760
And the result is
that, therefore,

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.140
a world in which the
marketplace of ideas

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.160
now functions in some ways
like financial markets.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.230
Which is to say there
are asset bubbles.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.650
There are ideas that gain a fair
amount of intellectual cachet

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.170
that might actually have
some germs of a really

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.260
good argument.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.040
But as a result, wind up
getting applied more and more

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.370
to sectors that they never
should have been applied to.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:48.960
And one example of
this is the logic

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.880
of disruptive innovation,
which is certainly

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.200
embraced within Silicon Valley.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.033
And I think you could
argue potentially even

00:31:54.033 --> 00:31:55.680
applies to Silicon
Valley, but does not

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.900
apply to things
like foreign policy

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:03.034
or higher education or other
sectors of the economy, which

00:32:03.034 --> 00:32:04.950
Clayton Christensen who
came up with this idea

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.270
claimed that it actually did.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.620
And so as a result, these
ideas expand far more

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.050
than they used to because
thought leaders have more power

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:14.040
than they used to.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.200
And it takes more effort
by public intellectuals

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.840
to beat it back.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.360
The other effect of this
on particularly successful

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.730
intellectuals is that
because they will potentially

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.850
produce less quality work once
they get up to the top tier,

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.460
and because they are commanding
a disproportionate share

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.130
of the benefit, they
essentially become targets

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.650
with huge Xes on their backs.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.220
Which means the effect of
this on those intellectuals

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.970
is that they are going
to be more and more

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.490
likely to tune out criticism.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.350
Because to be fair,
this criticism

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:47.185
will often come in the form
of trolling or take downs.

00:32:47.185 --> 00:32:49.310
You know, I've talked to
Fareed Zakaria about this.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.435
And he says that about 2/3 of
the criticism he gets, because

00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:54.560
of columns that he writes
for the "Washington Post"

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.340
or because of his show on CNN
is essentially racist in origin

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.470
that accuse him of being
like a member of ISIS

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.750
or accuse him of
some absurd thing.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.850
And he can legitimately
and appropriately should

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.020
dismiss that.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.610
The problem becomes
is that if you

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.100
do that, it's a slippery
slope to start to dismiss

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.110
almost all forms of criticism.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.300
Because you can dismiss
those who criticize you

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.410
as either trolls or
partisan hacks or people who

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.710
are not as well-read as you.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.460
And it becomes to the
point where you just

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.740
wind up going in your
own cocoon and not

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.735
being receptive to any
kind of advice whatsoever.

00:33:28.735 --> 00:33:30.610
And the result is what
I call the Dark Knight

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.590
Theory of the ideas
industry, which is you

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.680
either die in obscurity
or you live long enough

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.300
to see yourself
become everything

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.840
that you despised when you
became a young intellectual.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.240
And there are degrees to
which I feel like even--

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.535
I'm not at the Niall Ferguson
or Fareed Zakaria level.

00:33:48.535 --> 00:33:49.910
I like to think
of myself as sort

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.285
of upper middle class in terms
of the public intellectual

00:33:52.285 --> 00:33:53.122
world.

00:33:53.122 --> 00:33:55.080
And yet there are times
where I look at myself,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.800
it's like dude,
what are you doing?

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.240
And you know I do
get worried about it.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.132
So what is to be done?

00:34:02.132 --> 00:34:03.590
And I confess that
here the problem

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.840
is, is that the sort of
trends that I'm talking about,

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.730
which is the erosion of trust,
rise of political polarization,

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.540
increase in wealth inequality,
are kind of macro trends

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.279
that require major
large scale reforms.

00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:17.570
And whether or not they affect
the marketplace of ideas

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.429
or not is almost a
subsidiary question.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.920
But given that those trends
are going to persist,

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.837
what can be done?

00:34:23.837 --> 00:34:25.670
One thing I would argue
is that universities

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.989
need to do a better job in
terms of promoting not just

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:33.199
individual academics, but
also promoting their brands.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.020
So one of the things I did
as being part of the Fletcher

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.180
School was we took a
Carnegie Corporation grant

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.179
about trying to make
better connections in terms

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.400
of our research to policymakers.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.020
And we went out as
a combined team.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.489
So it wasn't just me, it was
me and like five other Fletcher

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:49.280
School researchers.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.989
And while I know
that teamwork is

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.610
more common in
the hard sciences,

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:54.993
in the social sciences,
it's a little rarer.

00:34:54.993 --> 00:34:56.659
And the thing I was
struck by doing this

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.390
was the degree to which
people in the US government

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.480
or people in the European
Union or even public audiences

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.540
seemed more impressed that
we were all part of Fletcher

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.440
rather than sort of our
own individual names.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.810
And in some ways, for them I
think the whole was greater

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.960
than the sum of the parts.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.566
The second thing that needs
to be done is just patience.

00:35:17.566 --> 00:35:19.940
Which is to say, I do think
that one of the things that's

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.856
been happening in the
philanthropic world that

00:35:21.856 --> 00:35:24.980
has been unfortunate has been
this obsession with impact.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.890
The notion that if you give
money to university professors

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.350
or think tanks, you want
to see an immediate payoff

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.770
as a result of that.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.800
And the truth is,
is that very often

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.320
in the marketplace of ideas,
you need to have patience.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.170
You need to recognize
that if you fund research,

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.032
it's not always going
to come immediately.

00:35:41.032 --> 00:35:42.740
And furthermore, even
if you write a book

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.680
that no one
immediately listens to,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.180
it might actually potentially
become more influential three,

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.070
four, or five years from now.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.330
And so that's not nothing.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.630
The middle one is more
foundation support

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.900
essentially for more
traditional public intellectuals

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.110
to learn how to better gain
the marketplace of ideas.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.940
How better to actually
go in and make

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.580
their own particular points.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.450
And then the last thing
is self-restraint.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.015
In some ways, intellectuals,
you would argue,

00:36:12.015 --> 00:36:15.160
are potentially the one category
of individual that presumably

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.320
doesn't only care about
money, that we do actually

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.320
are supposed to care about
the quality of our ideas.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.420
And so I would like to
think that over time what

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.130
might eventually happen is that
even people like Fareed Zakaria

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.210
or Niall Ferguson
do care desperately

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.160
what other intellectuals
think of them.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.460
And so potentially
being told maybe

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.250
you don't have to say
yes to every speaking gig

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.300
or say yes to every book
contract would potentially

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.630
allow something in the way
of more diversity at the top

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.820
of the intellectual food chain.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.170
And with that I'm happy
to take your questions.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.003
Thank you very much.

00:36:51.003 --> 00:36:53.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.320
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that--

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.205
you talked about disruption
in higher education.

00:37:04.205 --> 00:37:06.680
How do you reconcile
that with the cost

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.052
of student debt, increasing
costs of education going up?

00:37:11.052 --> 00:37:13.010
DANIEL DREZNER: I would
say two things on that.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.468
The first is, is
that while I don't

00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:18.560
deny the increase in
student debt overall,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.617
a disturbingly large
portion of that

00:37:21.617 --> 00:37:23.450
is not actually from
what you would consider

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.010
traditional universities.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.070
It's mostly coming from the
private, for-profit university

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.990
sector.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:34.200
And that's a real problem.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.310
But I would divorce, let's
say the University of Phoenix

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:41.330
or some of these other
for-profit universities

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.580
from what you would think
of traditionally as the sort

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.312
of four year colleges.

00:37:45.312 --> 00:37:47.270
If you actually take a
look at the average debt

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.630
load of people who go
to those institutions,

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.550
I believe it's around
$30,000, which is--

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.280
I don't want to
dismiss that entirely,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.870
but if you have a
debt load of $30,000

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.540
after graduating with
a BA, you are probably

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.210
going to be able to get a
job that can pay that off.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.190
So I think, among
other things, claims

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.920
that there is a
higher ed bubble have

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.020
been by and large exaggerated.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.884
That said, I will say this.

00:38:11.884 --> 00:38:14.050
And this is going to be
something where I'm actually

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.745
going be looking at this
over the next couple of years

00:38:15.745 --> 00:38:16.799
and I'll be curious.

00:38:16.799 --> 00:38:19.340
You can argue that one of the
ways in which universities have

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.550
been able to fund themselves
over the last 10 years or so

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.310
has been an increase in the
number of foreign students

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.710
studying in the United States.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.870
And that's been a
definite increase.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:32.510
There was a lull after 9/11,
but basically over the last 10

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:36.470
years to 15 years, you've seen
increases on the order of 5%-6%

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.850
a year.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.770
There is increasing evidence
that that is coming to an end.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.460
Now part of that was because
the dollar has risen in value.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.150
So suddenly we're
just more expensive

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.940
regardless of tuition prices.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.240
But there is no denying the fact
that Donald Trump as president

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.180
has potentially cast something
of a pall on foreign students

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.840
potentially trying to
apply to the United States.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.370
There was an
interesting OECD paper

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:01.576
called "The War on Talent" that
talked about how essentially--

00:39:01.576 --> 00:39:02.950
or "The Global
Market for Talent"

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.240
that there are essentially
four places where

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.550
well-educated individuals
go to get jobs--

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.981
the United States, the United
Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

00:39:11.981 --> 00:39:14.480
It would be interesting to see
over the next couple of years

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.910
whether, because of Brexit
and because of the Trump

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.710
administration, you see high
levels of human capital flows

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.470
decline in both the United
States the United Kingdom

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.630
and increase to places
like Canada or Australia.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.374
And if that happens,
then it'll be

00:39:29.374 --> 00:39:31.040
interesting to see
what happens in terms

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.100
of the economics of
higher education.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.460
AUDIENCE: In terms
of over the past 20,

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.120
30 years and the
accessibility of information,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.017
how do you think that
impacts the kind of scale--

00:39:43.017 --> 00:39:44.850
DANIEL DREZNER: No,
that's a great question.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.766
I think that's part of
the source of it, which

00:39:46.766 --> 00:39:51.969
is if you are genuinely
interested in something--

00:39:51.969 --> 00:39:53.760
it used to be well you
have to go to school

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.660
in order to figure out how do
I find out the information.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.870
You now literally can
Google it, potentially.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.980
So I think on the one
hand, that's a good thing.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.480
It means that
potentially people who

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.910
are genuinely
interested in ideas

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.790
don't need a Stanford
degree or a Harvard degree

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.190
or any degree to be
able to potentially read

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:11.750
what they want to read.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.210
The problem with it is
that essentially you

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.440
are seeing increasingly a
degree of cyberbalkanization

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.340
in which whatever your
sort of preexisting

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.620
intellectual worldview
is, you are naturally

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.290
going to be drawn to that
quarter of the internet

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:30.785
to get information that
seems to be confirming it.

00:40:30.785 --> 00:40:32.360
And indeed, this
is actually a case

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.090
where potentially education
doesn't necessarily

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:35.960
play that much role.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.600
Indeed well-educated
people are often better

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.480
at cocooning themselves than
less well-educated people.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.000
Because well-educated
people can rationalize why

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.420
they're cocooning in a way
that less well-educated people

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.740
can't.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.810
That said, I don't
want to say that this

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.490
is like an overwhelming
phenomenon.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.101
Not everyone cocoons themselves.

00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:55.850
There's a reason why
things like TED Talks

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:56.891
are particularly popular.

00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:59.649
There's a reason why you see
an ever increasing number

00:40:59.649 --> 00:41:01.940
of platforms for people who
can potentially try to make

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.290
these kinds of arguments.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.690
I would argue there are a
fair number of Americans

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.690
that genuinely either
don't have really

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:13.130
strong ideological priors or
are intellectually rigorous

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.990
enough to recognize
look I might be wrong so

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.480
what is the best contrary view.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.970
And in that sense, that's
good for people like me.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.910
Because it means we have a
wider audience than we used to.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.100
I remember being told
once when I was first

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.940
getting my PhD that if I wanted
to influence policy makers,

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.540
there were basically four
places I could publish--

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.209
the Op-Ed page in the "New York
Times," the "Washington Post,"

00:41:35.209 --> 00:41:37.250
the "Wall Street Journal,"
and "Foreign Affairs."

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.040
that that was what
like policymakers

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.720
read and it didn't matter
what the public cared about.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.784
That's obviously changed.

00:41:43.784 --> 00:41:45.200
And one of the
benefits of that is

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.616
that there are now different
ways that you can potentially

00:41:47.616 --> 00:41:49.010
influence top policy makers.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.907
It's not just talking
to them in a room,

00:41:50.907 --> 00:41:52.490
it's also if you
make an argument that

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.430
is seen as relatively
popular that it attracts

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.670
enough eyeballs to
reading it, it generates

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.720
more attention that way.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.320
And we're in a situation now
where you can write something

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.537
for "Medium" and it goes viral
in a way that even if you write

00:42:05.537 --> 00:42:07.870
something for "Foreign Affairs"
and the "New York Times"

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.310
it doesn't.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.140
So it's a mixed bag.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.257
Hopefully, as I
said at the outset,

00:42:13.257 --> 00:42:15.340
there's a tendency when
you write about this stuff

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.770
to think, oh, god, things
were so much better before.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:19.640
I don't want to
make that argument.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.770
I don't think things
are great, but I

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.228
think they're just bad in a
different way from the way they

00:42:23.228 --> 00:42:24.796
were before.

00:42:24.796 --> 00:42:26.470
AUDIENCE: As a
consumer of ideas,

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:33.150
my strategy for avoiding
any cocooned or you know

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.700
stuck in some place is
to look for moderates.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.230
Look for moderates who I
think are very intelligent.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:47.910
And so Niall Ferguson is
a good example for me.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:49.390
If I pick "New York
Times," I would

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.670
pick David Brooks for example.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:55.595
But I mean does that seem
like a reasonable approach.

00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:56.970
DANIEL DREZNER:
No, you're stupid

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.540
and you shouldn't do
that-- no I'm joking.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.460
But I would actually--

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.720
I would dispute-- let
me put it this way,

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.844
I would push back somewhat.

00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:06.907
Which is to say I don't want
a world where all you're doing

00:43:06.907 --> 00:43:07.990
is listening to moderates.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.230
First of all the word
moderate doesn't--

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.630
I can paint two different
kinds of moderates

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.390
that would have extremely
different kinds of views.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:17.892
Part of the issue
is that talking

00:43:17.892 --> 00:43:20.350
about the left-right political
spectrum works in some ways,

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.060
but it doesn't work in others.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.030
But the other thing is
that very often someone

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.730
working on the far right or
even working on the far left

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.950
does come up with a genuinely
interesting idea that

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.180
has to become--

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.820
that you should be exposed to.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.480
So I got to spend three weeks
in Bellagio Italy, for example--

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.501
I'll explain why this
story is coming up--

00:43:41.501 --> 00:43:42.750
at the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:44.440
They have a villa
in Bellagio, Italy.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.000
I highly recommend
this for everyone.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.916
Everyone should spend
three weeks in Bellagio.

00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:49.450
It's a great thing to do.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.760
But one of the things
I did while I was there

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.140
is that I decided not to
use Twitter or social media

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.620
as a general rule.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.690
The reason this matters
is that for me Twitter

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.450
is kind of my news feed.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.880
And I follow a variety of
people intellectually pretty

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.590
heterogeneous.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.540
And what I discovered
over those three weeks

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.080
was that essentially rather
than sort of having a fire alarm

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.680
style of exposure to ideas
where I would just have the feed

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.064
and I would just get constantly
bombarded with new ideas,

00:44:17.064 --> 00:44:18.730
I actually had to do
actively searching.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.260
It was more police patrolling.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.050
I had to actually
go look for things.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:25.060
And I was able to find them
the moderate centrist ideas

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.100
that I found potentially
naturally appealing.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.960
What was more difficult was to
find the more contrarian takes

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.270
on both the left and the
right, because that required

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.750
me to go to sites where
the wheat to chaff ratio

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:42.670
was so low that I didn't want
to read like 10 bad articles

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.350
to find one good one.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.660
Whereas on the other
hand, weirdly social media

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.112
let me-- like it meant that
others would read those things

00:44:49.112 --> 00:44:51.320
and say, hey, this is good
you should check this out.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.820
And because I trusted that
person, I would then read it.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.120
And it's not like I would
always agree with it,

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.430
but it was an interesting
provocative argument.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.530
And so weirdly, I think,
by being off social media,

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:04.110
I actually found myself lacking
those kinds of contrarian

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.710
takes which are the
ones that I value

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.630
because those are the
ones that challenge

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:08.794
my preconceived worldviews.

00:45:08.794 --> 00:45:10.210
And doesn't mean
they convince me,

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.640
but at least it makes
me have to figure out

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.560
what do I agree with,
why does this trouble me

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.670
so much and so forth.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.740
So I would say you don't
want to just listen

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.870
to people like Niall
Ferguson or David Brooks,

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.640
you want to read Paul
Krugman, or you want

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.572
to read "Jacobin" magazine.

00:45:23.572 --> 00:45:25.280
You're not always
going to agree with it,

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.905
and you probably will
very rarely will,

00:45:26.905 --> 00:45:29.677
but you might get exposed to
a different point of view.

00:45:29.677 --> 00:45:31.760
AUDIENCE: Are there any
public intellectuals right

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.550
now that you admire
for not succumbing

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:40.000
to the sort of self-promotion,
who are willing to be obscure?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
DANIEL DREZNER: Oh, wow.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.130
No one's asked me that.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.260
Actually a guy that
I genuinely admire

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.340
is Francis Fukuyama which might
sound odd because everyone--

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.590
the one thing I'm sure you've
heard if you say Francis

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:53.798
Fukuyama is "End of History."

00:45:53.798 --> 00:45:56.100
Like well that was totally
wrong and why should you

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.900
listen to him?

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.880
Fukuyama really, I
think, in some ways

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.660
could have become an even
bigger superstar if he chose to.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.520
He could have on
the TED Talk route

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.840
or gotten a column or
so on and so forth.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.424
He has stuck instead
to writing books.

00:46:11.424 --> 00:46:13.631
First of all, I would argue
"The End of History" book

00:46:13.631 --> 00:46:16.290
if you actually read it as a
much more nuanced discussion

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.810
than the sort of
caricature version of it.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.500
But the other thing is that he's
really done some excellent work

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.720
since then.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.490
And It's not that he's
like JD Salinger in Vermont

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.310
not doing anything new or
not engaging the public.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.180
He does.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.600
It's just that he does it
in a very judicious way.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.940
And in some ways I admire
his self-control on that.

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.370
I don't have necessarily
have that option, as I said,

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.770
I'm not quite at that level.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:46.920
But he's definitely someone
who I admire in terms

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.690
of being able to do that.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:56.294
I guess the other person I would
admire would be Samantha Power.

00:46:56.294 --> 00:46:58.460
Not that I necessarily agree
with her on everything.

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.130
But she wrote a great book
"A Problem From Hell,"

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:05.570
wound up being an adviser to
the Obama campaign in 2008,

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.750
and then eventually
became the UN ambassador.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.260
The reason I admire her is
first because she's extremely,

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.940
passionate about her ideas.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.890
But far more
important than that,

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.870
I did a very depressing
survey of asking

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.840
people who they thought the most
influential intellectuals were

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.430
in the foreign policy world.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.580
And of the top 25 names,
there was one woman.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.650
And it was her.

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.990
And that was just
really depressing

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.810
because I know a fair
number of really smart women

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:36.060
who have serious impact.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.940
But the fact that
that was the answer,

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.747
I found profoundly disturbing.

00:47:39.747 --> 00:47:42.080
And so one of the other ways,
which I didn't talk about,

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.570
that I do think you can improve
the marketplace of ideas

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.790
is by promoting a greater
degree of diversity.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.830
Not necessarily because
women are automatically

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.288
going to have better ideas than
men or even different ideas

00:47:51.288 --> 00:47:54.260
from men but it does break
up that sort of superstar

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.300
concentration that
I don't think is

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.035
good for the
marketplace of ideas.

00:47:58.035 --> 00:47:58.910
MODERATOR: All right.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:00.240
Well I think that's
it for questions.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.220
Thank you everyone for coming.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.380
And let's give a hand to
Mr. Drezner one last time.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.880
DANIEL DREZNER:
Thank you very much.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.730
[APPLAUSE]
