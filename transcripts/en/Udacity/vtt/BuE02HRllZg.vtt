00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.180
Key objective data
are increasingly available,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.330
from low costs wearable devices,
like the Fitbit activity monitor, or

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.960
even sensors embedded in smartphones.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.370
When combined with apps on the phone,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.500
they can create a patient
self management system.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.780
That often includes the ability for
family members or caregivers,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.070
to monitor the status
of an elderly relative.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.260
They're becoming more
sophisticated over time, and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.770
the US Food and
Drug Administration is currently

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.870
grappling with the degree to which they
should be regulated as medical devices.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.810
AliveCor's smart phone case, that
can monitor a patient's heartbeat is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.510
a good example of a sophisticated device
that has been through the FDA process.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.425
This process is designed to assure
things such as, the devices are safe,

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.430
they won't injure the patient.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.270
They accurately measure what they claim,
as compared to earlier devices.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.060
They're manufactured properly and that
the manufacturer keeps records, so that

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.640
patients with a potentially defective
device can be readily identified.
