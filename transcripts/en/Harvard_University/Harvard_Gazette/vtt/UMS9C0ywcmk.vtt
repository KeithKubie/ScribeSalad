00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.139
MEDscience is a high school biology
curriculum that's essentially anatomy

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.890
and physiology of seven organ systems. A
high school teacher teaches the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.570
curriculum in school every day just like
every other course. Having a small school

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.320
kind of makes the school community a
little bit closer. You feel like you can

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.130
go and you can talk to your teachers
and they'll understand, like, what's going on or how

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.149
to help you because they really get to
know the students on an individual level.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.440
One day every week, the class comes to
the Medical School and using what they

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.019
learn during the week, take care of a
patient and the science comes to life.

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.230
Real-world places need to step in and
say look, let's help to bridge the gap

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.870
between high school and the real world,
these partnerships are huge. So today we

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.190
had to diagnose Stan with a digestive
disorder and we ended up diagnosing him with

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.710
gall stones due to his chief complaint
which was an upper right quadrant issue

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.960
which is where the gall bladder is
located. We did it pretty quickly so it was good.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.080
A lot of the kids in the class are juniors or
seniors so we're in that spot where we need

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.860
to find what we want to do, so having
like, a small introduction to something

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.700
might be able to help them hook on an
interest that they never knew that they

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.760
had. I think kids spend a lot of time
wondering why they learn what they

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.880
learn. You know, kids are desperate to
know why I need to know this and then when

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.300
they're put in a situation where they
have to know it, it's a completely

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.810
different story. When they go to MEDscience for the first time and realize

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.370
like, I can't possibly diagnose someone
if I don't know these vital signs, by the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.160
end of that day, they know them. Being able to
come to the Harvard Medical Center's, you

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.780
know, a great opportunity and it's always
important to diversify your options and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320
learn something new, so that's why I decided to come. We know we're at Harvard

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.039
Medical School, but there is no wrong
answer, you do not have to raise your

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.390
hand and we're going to learn together
and we're going to have fun.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.400
I think if kids walk away from the class
feeling like a career that was once

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.460
unattainable for me is very real and
tangible, I think that's a huge win.
