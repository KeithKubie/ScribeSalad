00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080
PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Jocelyn, and
today we're going to go

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.200
over Fall 2009 Exam 2,
Problem number 5.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.580
As always, we're going to read
the problem first. Which

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.780
compound do you expect to have
the higher boiling point: HF

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.120
or ammonia?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.210
Justify your choice with an
explanation, using narrative

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.090
or cartoons or both that makes
reference to the operative

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.390
chemical bonding.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:58.120
So first, we are trying to
figure out which has a greater

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.610
temperature of vaporization,
or boiling point; and we're

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.925
looking at HF and ammonia.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.850
Now when we're talking about
boiling points, we're talking

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.990
about breaking a certain type of
bond, and that type of bond

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660
is intermolecular bonds.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.660
We're not going to be breaking
the actual molecular bonds

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.150
bonding hydrogen to fluorine
or nitrogen, we're breaking

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.440
the bonds in between molecules
of HF or ammonia, and so what

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.450
types of bond do we
have to look at?

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.460
And Professor Sadoway, in class,
went over a couple of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.700
different types of
intermolecular bonds.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.665
And I'm going to write
them down in order

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:59.080
of increasing strengths.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.185
So the weakest intermolecular
bonds we

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:02.435
have are Van der Waals.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.700
The next is induced
dipole-dipole.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.320
Next we have dipole-dipole, and
finally a special type of

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:42.280
dipole-dipole is the
hydrogen-bond, which is the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.325
strongest. So here we're
increasing strength.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.480
Van der Waals is an induced
dipole-dipole.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.560
That means that although your
atom or molecule does not have

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.230
a net dipole, the electrons can
shift, and at some point

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.590
will cause a difference in
polarity between different

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.280
sides of the molecule.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.370
Induced dipole-dipole is
two different molecules

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.260
interacting: one that has no net
dipole and one that does.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.550
Dipole-dipole: pretty
self-explanatory.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.360
You have two molecules that
have dipoles, and they are

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.500
interacting.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.154
And then hydrogen-bond is when
you have hydrogen bonded with

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:42.230
x, where x is nitrogen,
oxygen, and fluorine.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.500
We call that a hydrogen-bond,
because these are really,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.000
really strong dipole-dipole
interactions and cause much

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.800
different behaviors in
molecules, and so we, kind of,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.011
separate it out at the subset.

00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.570
So now that we've reviewed
intermolecular bonds, let's go

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.850
back to the problem.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.040
So we were asked to figure out
the difference, or which one

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.980
has a higher vapor pressure, or
temperature of boiling, so

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.700
that's a relative thing.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.290
And as we now know that we need
to look at intermolecular

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.790
bonds, a good place to start is
with the Lewis structure,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.930
because that will tell us if
we have dipoles or not, and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.620
then we can see what the
strongest intermolecular bond

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.130
is that we need to break to
boil these molecules.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:39.515
So starting with HF, we have
hydrogen bonded to fluorine.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.150
We know that fluorine has a much
higher electronegativity

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.660
than hydrogen, so we're going
to have a net dipole.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.880
Well, we have a polarized
bond and a net

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.790
dipole towards fluorine.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.590
This causes there to be a
partial positive charge on the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.480
hydrogen and a partial negative

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.760
charge on the fluorine.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.830
So what is our strongest
intermolecular bond that we

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.050
have for HF?

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.940
Going back to our list of bonds,
we see that we have a

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.270
dipole, so we might first think
about dipole-dipole.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.660
However, we need to remember
about hydrogen bonds, and here

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.960
in HF, we have hydrogen bonded
to fluorine, and so that would

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.890
be our strongest interaction.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.750
So let's write that down
to keep track.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:56.510
Now for ammonia, we have
nitrogen bonded to three

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.840
hydrogens, and again we
have a difference in

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.380
electronegativity, and so each
of these bonds is polar.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.940
And because of the asymmetric
geometry, we will have a net

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.900
dipole, and each of these
have a partially --

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.180
sorry, the hydrogens have a
partially positive charge,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.400
right, because they are less
electronegative, and the

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.240
nitrogen has a partial
negative charge.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.830
So, which is our highest or
strongest intermolecular bond

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.750
that we have here.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.950
Again, we have a net dipole, and
so we have dipole-dipole

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.520
interactions, but because
hydrogen is bonded to one of

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.670
the special three atoms, we
have hydrogen bonding, and

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.460
that is the strongest. So, that
is what we care about.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.540
So now, we're, kind of, at a
roadblock here; both have

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.510
hydrogen bonding, which is the
strongest intermolecular bond.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.060
So how do we decide which one
is actually going to be

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.710
stronger than the other, and
therefore, have the higher

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.060
boiling point.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.620
Well even though they're both
hydrogen bonds, they will have

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.830
difference in strength, and
that's going to depend on the

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.320
partial positive and partial
negative charges, because all

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.370
of these interactions are due
to coulombic attraction.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.570
In fluorine, we know that
fluorine is the most

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.920
electronegative element and has
a higher electronegativity

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:48.920
than nitrogen, so just to keep
track of our thought process

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.460
here: this will cause the
partial positive on hydrogen

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.620
to be larger in the HF than in
the ammonia, and so from this

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.310
we can say that the hydrogen
bonding in HF will be stronger

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:15.180
than the hydrogen bonding in
ammonia, and therefore, the t

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:22.070
evaporation of HF will be
greater than the t--

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.304
the boiling point of ammonia.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.040
So now we're going to
move on to Part B.
