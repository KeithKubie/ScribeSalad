00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:04.096
&gt;&gt;Alexa: I've always been
interested in the idea

00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:05.826
of making things from nothing.

00:00:05.956 --> 00:00:09.166
When I was a kid I'd always
grab my Lego box and try

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.906
to make something totally
imaginary, like a whole city

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:14.206
or something awesome out of it.

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:16.866
And so when I found out
about this I'm, like, "Wait,

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:19.906
I'm actually building a whole
park, and not just a park--

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:22.906
a whole mini-world full of
beaches and cities and forests.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:27.086
I'm actually getting to do something
that I don't get to do in school.

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:28.816
It's such an awesome feeling.

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.616
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: We've
got posthole digging.

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:35.616
We've all this stuff.

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:37.636
It needs to also be painted.

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:39.746
So who wants to kind of lead what?

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:44.066
&gt;&gt;Tiny WPA is a program that we
launched, which puts young adults

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.156
at the forefront of stimulating
engagement in civic innovation

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:50.656
in their communities by empowering
them to design and build things

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:51.896
that improve their neighborhoods,

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:53.926
their public spaces,
their schools, etcetera.

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:58.826
We have ten young adults,
sixteen through twenty-five,

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:02.036
who have been given
this central space.

00:01:02.036 --> 00:01:04.576
I mean it literally is the
central space in the back part

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:07.096
of this playground, in the second
oldest playground in this country,

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:11.886
to create an outdoor "maker space"
slash "adventure playground".

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.206
They are leading the charge on
designing and building this space.

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:18.736
&gt;&gt;All right, where should
the submarine go, guys?

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:21.646
&gt;&gt;Alexa: Basically, we're creating
an environment for children

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:23.456
where you're not taught how to think.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.846
I'm not saying that, like,
this park isn't nice.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.376
I mean, like, I love this
park, I mean who doesn't want

00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:29.656
to slide down that wooden slide?

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.766
I mean, but, like, with slides and
swings and, like, spinny things,

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.866
that's just telling
you how to do things.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:41.456
We're building sand castles so that
they could build their own things.

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:44.026
We're making submarines so
that they could have, like,

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:45.526
their own little adventure and stuff.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:48.746
And we're building jungles
with, like, a bunch of pipes.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.876
They could just make-believe
that they're anywhere they want.

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:57.716
We're not telling you how to think,
you're showing us how you think.

00:01:57.936 --> 00:01:59.086
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: You
gotta put yourself

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:01.056
in that spot, in that mindset.

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:04.616
If you squint real hard, you can
see it, you can see the forest,

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.516
you can see the mountains, you can
see the trees, you can see the sand.

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:10.586
&gt;&gt;Alexa: So you want the city
to be, like, near the forest?

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:12.006
&gt;&gt;Girl: Yeah, we want
them to be, like,

00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:14.176
able to be adjustable
by the children.

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:17.056
And then our trees,
we're hoping, will be,

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:18.436
like, bigger versions of this.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.766
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: All those concepts
that are central to architecture

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:25.186
and being a good designer-- scale,
proportion, things like that--

00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:28.786
we're doing that here, and the way

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:34.346
that they're designing really allows
them to test and fail and then fix it

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:36.976
as much as possible with
their own intuition.

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:41.486
So we create this process
where, you know what,

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:43.426
how do you know whether this works?

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.696
Well, you get in it and it's a feel.

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:47.906
You step out of it, you look at it.

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:49.766
You jump up and down on it.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:50.516
Does it feel safe?

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:54.616
We're not going to talk about wood
grain structure in an abstract way.

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:57.646
We're gonna stand on it until
it breaks or until it gets close

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:58.896
to breaking or feels dangerous.

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:05.516
All of our Tiny WPA projects,

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:09.016
the sites really are these highly
public hacker spaces, if you will.

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:11.996
You know, where people can
come up and offer their ideas,

00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:14.506
just like these little
kids did earlier today.

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:17.376
&gt;&gt;So the road stops with the
lake or goes over the lake?

00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:20.376
&gt;&gt;Girl: We're building a
bridge right over there

00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:25.366
and then we're making it go over
a lake and then it's gonna curve

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:27.886
around here and go back into
the city that we're making.

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:29.166
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: Where
they're sort of laying

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.616
out roads and things like that.

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:31.676
That wasn't fully planned.

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:34.346
I mean that's the way we work, but
the way they could just walk up

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:35.216
and say, "Well, what if?"

00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:38.786
That opens up all sorts of
other possibilities for us

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.106
that we wouldn't have seen otherwise.

00:03:40.606 --> 00:03:44.876
And that's really powerful then for
the teenagers, for them to be able

00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:48.136
to see how a four-year old's idea

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:50.326
or a seventy-two year old's
idea could have real value.

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.696
That's a hugely powerful
moment for them.

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:57.886
&gt;&gt;Man: Keep pulling that
trigger, all the way, Yeah!

00:03:57.886 --> 00:04:02.036
All right, now that
is not going anywhere.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:05.996
&gt;&gt;Girl: At the other parks that I
usually go to there's a whole bunch

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:08.896
of slides and swings and stuff.

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:10.986
And it's just there.

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:16.056
Here, you make your park instead

00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:19.126
of the other people
and it's really cool.

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:23.096
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: I saw you'll all
working together and everyone jumping

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.436
in and getting stuff done and
that's what we need to do.

00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:27.006
This is gonna be a
really hard project,

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.656
and we're gonna have
to work really hard.

00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:29.946
&gt;&gt;Alexa: I think schools are scared.

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:32.186
I think that they just
want to keep everything

00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:34.206
by the book and by the rules.

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:37.836
And, you know, you don't really
learn until you have the experience.

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:40.756
I mean, like, you could give me,
like, a whole manual in, like,

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:41.986
how to use a screwdriver,

00:04:42.046 --> 00:04:46.506
but I'm never really gonna
truly learn till I actually use

00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:47.206
the screwdriver.

00:04:47.646 --> 00:04:50.326
&gt;&gt;Basically, you take like
this flat side and you want

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:54.746
to hit the middle of
the hole like that.

00:04:54.746 --> 00:04:58.056
&gt;&gt;When I first started this
I was just not very vocal,

00:04:58.236 --> 00:04:59.546
I'm more of an observer.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.476
&gt;&gt;Throw all your weight
into the hole.

00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:06.506
&gt;&gt;But after I'd been to this program
I am more vocal, I'm not shy anymore,

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:08.576
I'm more of a person
who takes stuff on.

00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:11.916
I'm not afraid to say
what I think now.

00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:16.126
&gt;&gt;Yep, Tunica, and then
make a dirt pile over there.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.716
&gt;&gt;I feel like people
should now hear my voice.

00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:21.686
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: So what are
some things we, you guys,

00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:23.186
are really excited about?

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:26.506
&gt;&gt;Alexa: I'm just, like, excited
to see how this finally comes out,

00:05:27.716 --> 00:05:29.936
and those kids just
wanted to play with it.

00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:33.926
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: Just to see
how far Alexa has come already

00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:37.036
and what she's already accomplishing
in such a very short period of time,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:40.226
man, it's like we're
doing something here.

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:44.576
And the fact that she's so
passionate about what she believes

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:46.756
in it's just astounding to me.

00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:49.616
&gt;&gt;Alexa: I think that
school should be like this

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:52.126
because I have learned a lot
of things from this place

00:05:52.246 --> 00:05:54.356
that I could just apply
in life anywhere.

00:05:54.436 --> 00:05:56.566
I could have a career in building

00:05:56.566 --> 00:05:58.546
because I got hands-on
experience from this.

00:05:59.416 --> 00:06:00.286
That'd be really awesome.

00:06:04.506 --> 00:06:07.416
&gt;&gt;Alex Gilliam: We're trying to
grow really empowered, motivated,

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:12.286
tenacious, resilient citizens
who will go out and do things.

00:06:12.656 --> 00:06:14.996
And, you know, that ties
very much into the fact

00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:17.616
that pretty much nothing
that we do is an abstraction.

00:06:17.696 --> 00:06:20.576
You know, we found time and time
again that people are most motivated,

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:22.756
they do their best work
when things are real

00:06:23.456 --> 00:06:27.976
and when they have tangible impact
and they can see the impact.
