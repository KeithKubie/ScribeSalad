00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.470
- Look at the snow coming.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.900
That's pretty.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.730
It's going to get
colder and snowier.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.870
Look at this.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.670
Let's check out the sky first.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.770
Totally white.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.130
No sun today, Mongolia.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.200
I love this first
snow, being in it.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.330
I wasn't in it the last time.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.800
This is what I've been
expecting for a couple of weeks.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.970
I didn't expect to be as
warm as long as I was.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.600
I'm grateful for it.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.470
But this.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.400
Today is the day it feels
like the season started.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.470
And I mean the season of alone.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.630
Now it feels like it started.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.570
I just saw a fish
jump over there.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.030
Maybe I can get
some action here.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.330
I think it's about
time do some fishing.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.130
[water rushing]

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.730
I remember a week ago,
I was thinking fishing

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.270
might be done for
the season, not

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.030
because the fish don't
bite, but because

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.100
of my accessibility to them.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.800
I guess the time of season
dictates what fish you're

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.430
going to be at certain spots.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430
I thought they would go deeper
if I could walk further,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.000
but I can't, really.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.770
No.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.930
I'm not going to chance it.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.900
The water is really moving here.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.130
Got one.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.470
[water rushing]

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.530
Got one.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.630
It appears I found a spot in the
river that the fish are active.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.730
OK.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.700
I was already in a good mood.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.600
This puts me in a better move.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.630
If I ever deserved to
catch a fish, it was today.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.670
Guess what today is?

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.100
Today's day 35, which is a good,
solid number in and of itself,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.600
but it's a milestone
number for me

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.870
because in Patagonia on
day 35, I was calling

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.930
them to come pick me up.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.670
I knew in the middle
of the night on day 34

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.470
that I was going to be
calling them on day 35.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.530
I was not in nearly as good
a state as I am right now,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.870
and I'm extremely
happy about that.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.530
Five weeks is pretty good, even
though I didn't feel that great

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.270
about it at the time.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.030
But now I'm at five weeks,
man, and I'm rolling.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.170
I'm in a groove.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.830
And I'm not cold
and I'm not sad.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.030
Lonely?
At times.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.130
I mean, not really.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.530
I miss my family.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.300
But I don't know if that
classifies as being lonely.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.800
You know, I'm not like sullen
and downtrodden and like,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.400
man, I really want
to see my family.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.000
I really do, but
I'm not like, oh no.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.830
What am I going to do?

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.500
I know they're
there waiting for me

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.330
and it's going to be all
good, so I'm all good.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
So it's all good.
