00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.940
PROFESSOR: So hello again.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.010
Here we are in
week three already.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.570
It's just amazing.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.190
Week three is going
to be very much a part

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.080
of your photographic
exercise to say the least.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.460
It's all about lighting
which, of course, is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.590
what photography is all about.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.090
OK.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.420
So for week three, it's
very straightforward.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.000
It's all about light.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.920
It's, again, very
rich in information,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.790
Remember, watch the videos
which, of course, is essential.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.110
And at the end, part
of the assignment

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.520
is using your imagination and
finding new light sources.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.220
For example, I
still am constantly

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.760
looking for new ways of
lighting my photography.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.700
Actually, I came
across this, which

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.280
is incredibly exciting
piece of lighting equipment.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.410
It's very light.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.060
The name of it is Phlox.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.710
P-H-L-O-X. It's a little pricey,
but I suggest that you take

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.900
a look at their website
if you have a chance.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.400
OK.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.960
And finally, an encouragement
to go to the resources.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.640
We have a really
pretty, in my opinion,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.600
very interesting interview
with Brian Hayes,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.060
who is a writer but also
a very fine photographer.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.650
And he and I had a conversation
about technical issues,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.280
which I think that will
be very beneficial to you.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.150
It's mostly a podcast
so you could hear it

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.800
sort of in the
background, although I'd

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.550
like you to pay attention
to what he has to say.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.770
Enjoy week three.
