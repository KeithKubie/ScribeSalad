00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.500
The ancient Mesopotamians made a type of salty,
sour cheese very similar to cottage cheese

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.770
that dates back to at least 3000 B.C.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.660
A common legend is that it was invented when
a desert traveler filled his sheep stomach

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.560
saddle bags with milk prior to beginning his
journey.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.250
As the traveler and his camel traversed the
hot environment, between the sloshing of the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.790
bags caused by the camel’s gait, the heat
of the sun, the milk and the natural rennet

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
from the sheep stomach, the entire process
produced cheese curds.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.830
There’s probably nothing much to this story.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.750
Perhaps it was a marketing ploy of the imaginative
Ancient Arabian Dairy Association…

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.620
What we do know for sure is that cheese (in
any form) predates recorded history.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.100
It may have originated accidentally in Arabia
like the story goes, or it could be European.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.980
Wherever it happened, it does seem somewhat
plausible that the practice of storing liquids

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.190
in such things as bags made from animal stomachs
may really have led to the accidental invention

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.360
of cheese because of the rennet potentially
found within.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.759
Rennet is a cocktail of enzymes that, among
other things, curdles the casein in milk and

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.750
is found naturally in the stomachs of ruminant
mammals.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.720
Whatever the case, what we know for sure is
that by the time the Roman Empire began conquering

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.470
nations, cheese was already on the menu—and
cheese making was a firmly established enterprise.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.741
The ancient Greeks credited Aristaeus, a son
of Apollo, with its discovery, and the Old

00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:28.190
Testament refers to it.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.160
Likewise, the Egyptians depict cheese making
on tomb walls that date back to 2000 BC.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.990
There’s archaeological evidence of cheese
making in Poland three thousand years earlier

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.990
than that.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.100
In Homer’s Odyssey, the Cyclops made cheese
from goat’s and sheep’s milk, and by the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.549
time Pliny the Elder penned his Natural History
in 77 AD, he devoted an entire chapter to

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.479
the variety of cheeses available around the
Empire, including a smoked goat’s milk that

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.619
sounds like it could still win some ribbons
at the Wisconsin State Fair.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.510
Whoever invented it, cheese caught on as a
way to preserve the nutrition of milk for

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.979
longer than a day or two and numerous types
were made throughout history, including someone

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.380
along the way discovering how to make the
so-called “cottage” variety, which due

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.040
to the ease of making it, probably was one
of the first varieties ever made (or something

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.050
extremely similar).

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.816
Not technically requiring rennet to curdle
(though particularly today with large curd

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:15.816
cottage cheese, rennet is usually used to
speed up the process and some cooks alternatively

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:16.816
add a bit of vinegar to help the curdling
along), the type of cottage cheese made in

00:02:16.816 --> 00:02:19.749
Colonial America is said to have been brought
here from Central Europe, where it was/is

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.079
also called Dutch cheese or schmierkase.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.569
Relying instead on naturally occurring mesophilic
lactic acid bacteria, the European and American

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.519
cooks simply set out milk, and especially
older milk, near a fire or other warm place.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.719
At this Goldilocks temperature, the bacteria
thrived in its milk bath, and after a day

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.879
or two, it would transform the liquid milk
into a curd, producing a form of cottage cheese.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.559
Some cooks would further treat the curd by
cooking it dry and washing it with cold water,

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:50.349
producing what is sometimes called pot cheese;
others would add a bit of cream to add richness

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.569
to the final product.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.209
Still others would strain and press the curd,
producing farmer’s cheese.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.019
As to the origin of the name “cottage cheese,”
much like who first invented this variety

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.379
of cheese, we can’t say for sure, but we
can at least point to the first known documented

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.459
instance of the cheese being called this,
appearing in the July of 1831 Godey’s Lady’s

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.519
Book, Volume 3 in an article titled Country
Lodgings, A Sketch, by Miss Leslie, where

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.519
she states:

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.280
The aspect of the tea-table was not inviting.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280
Every thing was in the smallest possible quantity
that decency would allow.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280
There was a plate of rye-bread, and a plate
of wheat, and a basket of crackers; and other

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280
plate with half a dozen paltry cakes, that
looked as if they had been bought under the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.969
old Court House; some morsels of dried beef
on two little tea-cup plates; and a small

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:27.069
glass dish of that preparation of curds, which
in vulgar language is called smear-case, but

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.689
whose nom de guerre is cottage-cheese, at
least that was the appellation given it by

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.749
our hostess.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:38.030
The tea was so weak that it was difficult
to discover whether it was black or green,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.900
but finding it undrinkable, I asked for a
glass of milk; and when Bayard brought me

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.669
one, Mrs. Netherby said with a smile, “See
what it is to live in the country.”

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.669
Though after all, we were not out of sight
of Christ Church Steeple.

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.370
Given that the author of the piece seemed
to think the audience wouldn’t necessarily

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.969
be familiar with the name “cottage cheese”
here, we can deduce it was either a relatively

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.170
new name or a regional one that the Lady’s
Book’s wider audience might not be familiar.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.109
Whatever the case, it is generally thought
the “cottage” descriptor here is simply

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.269
referencing this was a type of cheese regularly
made in homes in the country where milk was

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.809
often more readily available; cottage cheese
is also relatively easy (and quick) to make

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:16.370
compared to many other cheeses due to its
unripened nature, the lack of any real specialized

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.769
equipment needed, and the exceptionally small
amount of processing required to get it to

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.840
its final form.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.900
It has also been speculated that the “cottage”
here may imply “poor quality,” or “cheese

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.590
for the poor,” owing to the fact that many
living in the country who had access to milk

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.090
commonly made it.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.940
Alternatively it has been suggested that it
is the milk that was considered “poor.”

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.690
Cottage cheese was often made from the leftover
liquids after churning butter, as well as

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.500
relatively old milk that had become too acidic
to make certain other cheeses.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.440
However, with both the “poor people” and
“poor milk” conjectures, this is unlikely

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.660
as the “poverty” or “poor” slant to
the term “cottage” didn’t come about

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.660
until much later.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.660
At the point in time when “cottage cheese”
was coined, the word “cottage” with the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.840
definition “small country residence” had
only been around for about a half a century

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.570
and those who owned such small homesteads
were hardly thought of as poor in the general

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:13.970
case.
