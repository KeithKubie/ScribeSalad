CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.920
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.880
My name is Claudio.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.630
And I'm one of the engineers in
the Google Drive Developer

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.370
Relations team.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.670
As you know, we recently
launched

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.060
communities on Google+.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.270
And we have a Google Drive
Developers community where we

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.900
have discussions about Google
Drive development, new

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.180
features, and anything that
is related to Google Drive

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.320
development.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.130
For today's GDL, we asked
members of the community to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.540
ask their questions so that
we could answer them live.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.280
We did that, I think,
the last week.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240
So we have a number
of questions we

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.540
want to answer today.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.840
So let me get started with
the first question.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.820
What I'm showing right now is
the post that one of my

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.390
teammates, Steve Bazyl,
published last

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.770
week asking for questions.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.510
And let's see.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.650
The first one is from Jeff.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.160
And he actually linked to a
Stack Overflow question.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.730
So let me go to the Stack
Overflow question and see what

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.700
the question is like.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.310
The question is about making
a copy of a Google Drive

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.860
Template by URL, obviously
using the API,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.560
using the Drive SDK.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.000
I see that this question
was already answered.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.510
Basically, I can just
say that that's an

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.260
interesting feature request.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.910
It's not a very common one.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.870
This is probably the first or
second time we get this

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.220
feature request.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.185
So at the moment, there is no
way to manage those templates

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:06.170
with the API.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.789
But we will take this together
with the other feature

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.210
requests and see
what we can do.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.910
That was pretty easy.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.250
One of my teammates answered.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.800
So let's go back.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.440
Arif [? asks ?]

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.060
if there is a layman's
version of how to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.100
set up a static website.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.140
We covered this a lot
in the last weeks.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.040
What we recently launched is a
way for anyone to publish a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.590
static website on
Google Drive.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.750
We think it's very easy.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.590
It is actually targeted not just
to hardcore developers.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.230
But it's also targeted to
advanced users, so maybe

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.470
standard users.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.360
It should be very, very
easy to do so.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.720
We have documentation.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.240
But we also have another GDL
recording, from November 29,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.760
called "Google Drive SDK--

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.550
Publishing your website on
Google Drive," that explains

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.280
how to publish a static
website step by step.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.570
This is not for developers.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.080
We have other GDL--

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.920
Google Developers Live--
recordings that show how you

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.050
can automate the process.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.240
But if you want the very,
very basic version--

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.850
so doing everything from the
UI, not writing any code--

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.900
this is what you should watch.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.890
So let me say it again.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.850
"Google Drive SDK--

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.700
Publishing your website on
Google Drive." You can find it

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.430
on developers.googl
e.com/live/drive.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.760
Or you can go to our
documentation, which is at

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.040
developers.google.com/drive.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.120
And search for our
YouTube playlist.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.370
We have a playlist with all
these recordings and all

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.230
videos we've recorded
for the Drive SDK.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.030
So you can find this one there,
together with two more

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.180
that we did that are
about publishing a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.570
website on Google Drive.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.150
So we have a very basic
one, this one.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.920
We have an advanced one, which
is the one following this.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.950
And we also had a third one last
week that was recorded

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.370
with a community member that
wrote his own application that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.740
integrates Hangouts
with Drive.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.550
It's very cool.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.220
You should check that out.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.720
That's two.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.740
And by the way, I love
this community.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.310
Because community members talk
to each other, answer each

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.160
other's questions.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.560
So Jeff, the same Jeff who
asked the first question,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.910
replied to this other
question.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.740
And so this channel is not just
for us Googlers to answer

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.380
your questions.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.150
But it is also for any of you
to talk to others, compare

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.470
your experience and
share your tricks,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.670
answer other questions.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.830
This community is very active.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.290
We're very happy.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.270
We launched it slightly more
than a week ago, I think.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.140
And we have 2,000 members--

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.840
more than that.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.930
Then we have a lot of threads.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.760
It's very interesting.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.380
If you're not there, you should
definitely join it if

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.850
you're interested.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.780
Then we have Nate saying
two questions.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.230
First one-- "Will Google Drive
and Picasa integrate?" It's a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.950
very good question.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.680
It's a very common
question we get.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.350
And our goal is to provide
users with the best

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.340
experience.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.200
And we understand that the
best user experience is

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.560
merging Google Drive
with Picasa.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.680
So the short answer is yes.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.270
The long answer is yes,
we're working on it.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.270
And they will eventually
merge.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.010
So we will keep you
updated on this.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.700
Second question--

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.280
"How can one obtain public
persistent thumbnail links for

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.600
files?" Right now, what you get
in the file metadata is a

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.140
short-lived thumbnail link.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.150
So whenever you want the
thumbnail for a file, you

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.970
should get the file
metadata first.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.920
And then, check the
thumbnail link.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.740
Because that link might
have changed.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.130
There is no way to get a
persistent thumbnail link for

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.390
files from the API.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.230
What we can say is of course,
you can store the

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.470
thumbnail on your side.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.640
So you know that the thumbnail
link will expire.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.530
But you go fetch it
the first time.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.680
Fetch the thumbnail.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.190
Store it somewhere
on your side--

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.250
or even on Drive, somewhere
on your Drive account.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.980
And then, [? serve ?]
that instead.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.720
I should also remind you that
thumbnails can change.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.505
Because any time, the user that
owns the file can change

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:49.620
the thumbnail, replace
it with a new one.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.710
So that's another reason why
we don't have a static

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.530
persistent thumbnail link.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.760
So that we force you
to get a new one.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.170
And if the new one
is changed--

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.260
I mean, it's a new one.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.750
Then, you always get it
instead of reusing the

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.860
previous one.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.290
But if you don't mind risking
that, you can always download

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.150
a file first-- the
thumbnail first--

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.720
store it on your side wherever
even on Drive.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.310
And then use it.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.310
Let's see.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.550
Benjamin--

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.745
"I would really like the team's
opinion on this," which

00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:26.680
I opened here.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.760
He says this is his most-wanted
feature for Drive.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.400
I don't know if it's very clear
from the screenshot.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.480
What he's asking for is a
feature that is available on

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.540
Dropbox, which is an
easy way to copy a

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.620
public link to the [? doc. ?]

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.160
I think the question
is in two parts.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.060
First, is there a way to get a
public link for a doc, for any

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.420
file stored in Drive?

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.610
And the answer is,
of course, yes.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.410
And other people answered
this thread by

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.580
saying, yes, it's possible.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.010
You have to do this,
this, and that.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.572
What he's asking is how to have
an easy way to do that,

00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:10.760
like a right click, a single
call, or something else that

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.550
makes it very, very easy.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.860
We don't have that.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.930
But we might think about it.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.280
So this is another feature
request we are going to take

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.150
into account.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.880
So remember, there is a way
to get a public link.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.120
And if you don't know how to
do it, some other people

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.320
answering this thread will
explain how to do it.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.659
And it's basically going back
to publishing a website on

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.970
Google Drive.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:41.789
But for what concerns the easy,
simple, right-click way,

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.299
we don't have that.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.910
We might have that in future.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.920
We'll talk more about that.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.816
OK.

00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:52.040
Let's see what else.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.090
Jay--

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.710
"What's the status
of the Drive API

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.950
migrations between accounts?

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.730
We need the ability to identify
users shared on a

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.090
file in order to replicate
the ACLs."

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:04.510
So let's see.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.380
What's the point here?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.660
I think the context is of Google
Apps domain, where

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.010
domain administrators
want to move files

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.300
from a user to another.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:23.250
And right now, with the API,
whenever you share something,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.640
we only address those
users by IDs--

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.770
unique IDs--

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.430
but not email addresses.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.100
So for most cases,
IDs are fine.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:41.730
For instance, when you're in
these Google Apps domain

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.710
environment, where you can
know the user IDs for all

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.370
users in your domain.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:53.220
And the broader case may have
files shared to several users.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.080
They're not in the domain.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.500
And for those, you're not
getting the email address.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.400
We are still working on this in
the sense that we need to

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.130
find the perfect trade-off
between the

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.800
functionality and privacy.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.690
So right now, all you
get is the ID.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.380
And that is fine for
most use cases.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.400
For instance, in the Google Apps
domain case, you can use

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.250
service accounts.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:24.050
And I also have a page here in
our Docs that explains how to

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.900
perform Google Apps domain-wide

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.360
delegation of authority.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.870
So what is explained here?

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.610
You can use a service account
as a domain admin to

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.030
impersonate other users
in a domain and act

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.260
on behalf of them.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.950
This is usually what domain
admins want or need.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.210
For what concerns the broader
case, we're still working on

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:46.930
the trade-off.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.160
So still, this is a common
feature request.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.970
So this is not the first
time we hear about it.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:58.400
And we have a lot of discussions
about it.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.920
Please bear with
us a bit more.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.390
And we will update you on what
the decision will be.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.120
Just remember this is
a privacy concern.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.290
So we take it really,
really seriously.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.020
Allen--

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.860
"Is there a reason/explanation
that Docs that are in a public

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.010
folder on Drive aren't
accessible using

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:27.220
googledrive.com?"
I would say no.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.740
Because files that are in a
public folder on Drive are

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:37.270
accessible using the same
website publishing method that

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.260
we just mentioned a
few times today.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.310
So let's go back to our Docs.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.540
We have a page dedicated
to publishing

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.860
website content on Drive.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.640
The requirements are that you
set the folder as public.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.660
And according to the question,
the folder was public.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.020
So I'm surprised.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.430
And when you do, the folder
metadata will include a field

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.870
called webViewLink, which will
give you the base URL for all

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.840
files in that folder.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.170
So this is an example.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.820
Assuming that the folder ID is
A1, B2, blah, blah, blah, the

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.530
webViewLink will look
like this--

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:25.560
https://googledr
ive.com/host/folderid.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.940
And for instance, if you have
images in that folder, your

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.605
full complete URL to the image
will be googledrive.com/

00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:35.855
host/folderid/im
ages/kittens.jpg.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:46.550
So there is a way to publish
files from a public folder.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.230
And they're accessible from
googledrive.com when the

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.300
folder is public.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.456
So if I understand the
question correctly--

00:12:57.456 --> 00:13:01.140
I mean, the question is probably
not 100% correct.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.110
Because some files
are available.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.000
We also got some other questions
in other threads.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.830
So I also added them here.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.200
One of those is, "Is there
an example tutorial for

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.400
integrating Google Drive

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.120
and Android?" Yes.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:26.110
We really, really care about
the Android Developer

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.240
community using Google Drive.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.300
And that's why we recently
published a quickstart.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:39.180
And we also recorded another
GDL video explaining how to

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.650
build your first Google Drive
application on Android.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.920
And this is also linked
in this Google+ post.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:55.390
So if you follow the link, you
will see that we published a

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.710
post on our blog, which is
Google Apps Developer blog,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.470
that explains it
very concisely.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:08.570
But then, it takes you to the
quickstart guide, which is a

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.680
step-by-step tutorial that
starts from the very basics--

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.690
so the how to set up your
environment, Eclipse, and

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.130
everything, and enabling the
Drive API, creating an Android

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.290
project, adding the libraries
you need.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.420
There is sample code here.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.100
That's all it takes.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.740
And at the end of the page, if
you don't like reading, you

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.540
can also watch this video that
does all the steps for you.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.010
So you can see--

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.330
well, it's actually me doing
all of that and explaining

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:49.550
step by step how you can
write your Drive

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.980
application on Android.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.380
So we have that.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.380
And it's a very popular page.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.430
A lot of people are watching it
and watching the video and

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.550
checking the Docs.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:01.390
So if you haven't already, you
should check that out.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.650
I think I have a few
more questions.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.430
This one was on Stack
Overflow.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.220
And someone linked it
on our community.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.860
The question is very simple.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.130
"Is it possible to search within
a Google Drive folder

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.070
using the Google Drive SDK?"

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.000
Yes, it is possible.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.140
And it's very easy.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.470
We have a simple query language
that you can use in

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.090
your Google Drive
Get requests.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:34.240
And this is our page in
the documentation.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.740
It's called Search for Files,
which should be

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.200
pretty easy to find.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.420
And we explain all
you can do here.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.870
And we have a lot of examples.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.430
And one of the examples--

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:49.270
it's exactly on how to search
for something that is in a

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.330
specific folder.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.440
And it's very easy.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.450
The query you have to do--
it's folder ID in quotes.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.340
So in this case, if we are
assuming the folder ID is

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.040
1234567 in parents.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.950
Parents is the collection of
folders contained in a file.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.990
So when you write this query,
you're saying, I want all

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.060
files that are in this folder
with ID 1234567.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.410
MALE SPEAKER: So Claudio, for
those on the live stream,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.810
could you go ahead and
increase the font?

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:20.580
So we can see those
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.830
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh, sure.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.050
OK, sorry about that.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:31.260
So this is the page I
was talking about.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.010
This is Search for Files.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:38.240
And so this is how you
search for files

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.220
in a specific folder.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.780
And you can combine it with
other search criteria.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.820
So for instance, you can say,
'1234567' in parents.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:53.730
And title contains 'goodbye.'
You can put that together.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.880
And what that means is they're
searching for all files in

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.230
that specific folder with title
containing goodbye.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:07.829
So this is how we search for
files in a specific folder.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.810
And finally--

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.050
let me make this bigger--

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.280
I have the last question.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.470
The question is, "What about
enhancing the Share function

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.730
on the GDrive mobile app?

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.099
Currently, we can only share
files and folders with email

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.520
addresses, but the file
remains private.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.660
You can't choose to make
it public, which is not

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.490
convenient."

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:35.840
So you can definitely share a
file or a folder with public

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.205
using the API.

00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:41.600
I will check the mobile app.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.200
I'm not sure that
it's not there.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.780
If it's not, you can always
write your own application

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.150
that uses the Drive API.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.830
So remember, with the Drive API
and with the Desktop UI,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:59.070
you can definitely share
something with public.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.570
I will double check this.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.380
I'm not sure if it's
in there or not.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.150
I didn't check.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.960
But it's a feature we have.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.060
So it's something you
can do with the API.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.200
So if it's not there, we can
probably add it later.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.600
Or you can write your own
application to share something

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.820
with the public.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:23.410
OK, and I think that was the
last question I had for today.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:30.460
Remember, anytime you have a
question, feel free to write

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.300
on the Google+ community
we have.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.010
And if the question is
very technical--

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.690
so if you're showing code--

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.980
Stack Overflow is even
better for that.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:44.380
It's the specific
developer-oriented community.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.780
My team and I are always on
Stack Overflow and on the

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.780
Google+ community.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.560
So feel free to choose
the one that is

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.910
better for your questions.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:59.780
And if we liked this session, we
can always do more where we

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.700
answer your questions live.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.610
And if you want to ask
your questions live,

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.800
we can also do that.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.500
Last week, we had a member of
[? the ?] community joining us

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.230
to present his application.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.420
So if you want to do that, if
you want to showcase your app,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.770
if you want to talk to
us live, just ask.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.340
We'll be happy to have you on
Google Developers Live.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.150
And with that, I wish to
see you next time.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:30.220
Remember, we are live every
Monday and Thursday.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.770
But remember, there's also a
lot of contents on Google

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.770
Developers Live every
single day.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:36.510
Thank you.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.760
See you next time.
