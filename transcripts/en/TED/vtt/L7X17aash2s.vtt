00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.960
I'd like you all
to close your eyes, please ...

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.656
and imagine yourself sitting
in the middle of a large, open field

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.347
with the sun setting on your right.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.296
And as the sun sets,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.256
imagine that tonight
you don't just see the stars appear,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.296
but you're able to hear the stars appear

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.216
with the brightest stars
being the loudest notes

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.760
and the hotter, bluer stars
producing the higher-pitched notes.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.320
(Music)

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.096
And since each constellation
is made up of different types of stars,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.816
they'll each produce
their own unique melody,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.920
such as Aries, the ram.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.976
(Music)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.136
Or Orion, the hunter.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.920
(Music)

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.896
Or even Taurus, the bull.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.120
(Music)

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.496
We live in a musical universe,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.056
and we can use that to experience
it from a new perspective,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.136
and to share that perspective
with a wider range of people.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.496
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.816
(Music ends)

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.016
Now, when I tell people
I'm an astrophysicist,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.656
they're usually pretty impressed.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.896
And then I say I'm also a musician --
they're like, "Yeah, we know."

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.936
(Laughter)

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.256
So everyone seems to know

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.216
that there's this deep connection
between music and astronomy.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.896
And it's actually a very old idea;

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.936
it goes back over 2,000 years
to Pythagoras.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.216
You might remember Pythagoras
from such theorems

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.096
as the Pythagorean theorem --

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.136
(Laughter)

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.720
And he said:

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.176
"There is geometry
in the humming of the strings,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.696
there is music in the spacing
of the spheres."

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.056
And so he literally thought

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.816
that the motions of the planets
along the celestial sphere

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.080
created harmonious music.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.416
And if you asked him,
"Why don't we hear anything?"

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.736
he'd say you can't hear it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.256
because you don't know
what it's like to not hear it;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.015
you don't know what true silence is.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.656
It's like how you have to wait
for your power to go out

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.720
to hear how annoying
your refrigerator was.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.576
Maybe you buy that,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.320
but not everybody else was buying it,
including such names as Aristotle.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.016
(Laughter)

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.256
Exact words.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.296
(Laughter)

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.016
So I'll paraphrase his exact words.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.416
He said it's a nice idea,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.776
but if something as large and vast
as the heavens themselves

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.376
were moving and making sounds,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.776
it wouldn't just be audible,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.216
it would be earth-shatteringly loud.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.760
We exist, therefore
there is no music of the spheres.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.216
He also thought that the brain's
only purpose was to cool down the blood,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.496
so there's that ...

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.736
(Laughter)

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.176
But I'd like to show you that in some way
they were actually both right.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.280
And we're going to start by understanding
what makes music musical.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.136
It may sound like a silly question,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.896
but have you ever wondered why it is

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.176
that certain notes, when played together,
sound relatively pleasing or consonant,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.416
such as these two --

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.016
(Music)

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.696
while others are
a lot more tense or dissonant,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.976
such as these two.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.336
(Music)

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.576
Right?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.536
Why is that? Why are there notes at all?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.160
Why can you be in or out of tune?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.496
Well, the answer to that question

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.040
was actually solved by Pythagoras himself.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.760
Take a look at the string on the far left.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.656
If you bow that string,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.336
it will produce a note as it oscillates
very fast back and forth.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.736
(Musical note)

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.696
But now if you cut the string in half,
you'll get two strings,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.816
each oscillating twice as fast.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.776
And that will produce a related note.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.120
Or three times as fast,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.256
or four times --

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.120
(Musical notes)

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.216
And so the secret to musical harmony
really is simple ratios:

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.376
the simpler the ratio,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.576
the more pleasing or consonant
those two notes will sound together.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.776
And the more complex the ratio,
the more dissonant they will sound.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.416
And it's this interplay
between tension and release,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.176
or consonance and dissonance,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.160
that makes what we call music.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.080
(Music)

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.736
(Music ends)

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.816
(Applause)

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.056
Thank you.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.056
(Applause)

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.280
But there's more.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.000
(Laughter)

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.736
So the two features of music
we like to think of as pitch and rhythms,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.256
they're actually two versions
of the same thing,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.496
and I can show you.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.736
(Slow rhythm)

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.960
That's a rhythm right?

00:05:09.478 --> 00:05:11.336
Watch what happens when we speed it up.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.576
(Rhythm gets gradually faster)

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.016
(High pitch)

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.496
(Lowering pitch)

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.120
(Slow Rhythm)

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.616
So once a rhythm starts happening
more than about 20 times per second,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.856
your brain flips.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.960
It stops hearing it as a rhythm
and starts hearing it as a pitch.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.856
So what does this have to do
with astronomy?

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.920
Well, that's when we get
to the TRAPPIST-1 system.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.256
This is an exoplanetary system
discovered last February of 2017,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.616
and it got everyone excited

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.416
because it is seven Earth-sized planets
all orbiting a very near red dwarf star.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.296
And we think that three of the planets

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.416
have the right temperature
for liquid water.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.616
It's also so close
that in the next few years,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.336
we should be able to detect
elements in their atmospheres

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.920
such as oxygen and methane --
potential signs of life.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.216
But one thing about
the TRAPPIST system is that it is tiny.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.056
So here we have the orbits
of the inner rocky planets

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.336
in our solar system:

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.856
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.456
and all seven Earth-sized
planets of TRAPPIST-1

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.840
are tucked well inside
the orbit of Mercury.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.936
I have to expand this by 25 times

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.680
for you to see the orbits
of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.896
It's actually much more similar in size
to our planet Jupiter and its moons,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.896
even though it's seven
Earth-size planets orbiting a star.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.320
Another reason this got everyone excited
was artist renderings like this.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.856
You got some liquid water,
some ice, maybe some land,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.640
maybe you can go for a dive
in this amazing orange sunset.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.256
It got everyone excited,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.736
and then a few months later,
some other papers came out

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.480
that said, actually,
it probably looks more like this.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.280
(Laughter)

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.296
So there were signs

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.016
that some of the surfaces
might actually be molten lava

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.536
and that there were very damaging
X-rays coming from the central star --

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.840
X-rays that will sterilize the surface
of life and even strip off atmospheres.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.656
Luckily, just a few months ago in 2018,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.616
some new papers came out
with more refined measurements,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.456
and they found actually
it does look something like that.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.496
(Laughter)

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.016
So we now know that several of them
have huge supplies of water --

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.256
global oceans --

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.016
and several of them
have thick atmospheres,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.200
so it's the right place to look
for potential life.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.776
But there's something even more
exciting about this system,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.000
especially for me.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.096
And that's that TRAPPIST-1
is a resonant chain.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.920
And so that means for every two orbits
of the outer planet,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.256
the next one in orbits three times,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.056
and the next one in four,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.336
and then six, nine, 15 and 24.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.880
So you see a lot of very simple ratios
among the orbits of these planets.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.976
Clearly, if you speed up their motion,
you can get rhythms, right?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.696
One beat, say, for every time
a planet goes around.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.456
But now we know if you speed
that motion up even more,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.816
you'll actually produce musical pitches,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.360
and in this case alone,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.776
those pitches will work together,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.560
making harmonious,
even human-like harmony.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.920
So let's hear TRAPPIST-1.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.376
The first thing you'll hear will be
a note for every orbit of each planet,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.136
and just keep in mind,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.256
this music is coming
from the system itself.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.336
I'm not creating the pitches or rhythms,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.376
I'm just bringing them
into the human hearing range.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.376
And after all seven planets have entered,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.856
you're going to see --

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.135
well, you're going to hear a drum
for every time two planets align.

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.416
That's when they kind of
get close to each other

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.360
and give each other a gravitational tug.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.840
(Tone)

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.960
(Two tones)

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.840
(Three tones)

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.440
(Four tones)

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.800
(Five tones)

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.320
(Six tones)

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.640
(Seven tones)

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.920
(Drum beats)

00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:32.456
(Music ends)

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.080
And that's the sound of the star itself --
its light converted into sound.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.840
So you may wonder
how this is even possible.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.680
And it's good to think
of the analogy of an orchestra.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.376
When everyone gets together
to start playing in an orchestra,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.136
they can't just dive into it, right?

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.576
They have to all get in tune;

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.856
they have to make sure

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.776
their instruments resonate
with their neighbors' instruments,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.256
and something very similar happened
to TRAPPIST-1 early in its existence.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.096
When the planets were first forming,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.576
they were orbiting within a disc of gas,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.896
and while inside that disc,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.416
they can actually slide around

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.776
and adjust their orbits to their neighbors

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.896
until they're perfectly in tune.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.096
And it's a good thing they did
because this system is so compact --

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.056
a lot of mass in a tight space --

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.296
if every aspect of their orbits
wasn't very finely tuned,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.776
they would very quickly
disrupt each other's orbits,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.200
destroying the whole system.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.016
So it's really music
that is keeping this system alive --

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.920
and any of its potential inhabitants.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.960
But what does our solar system sound like?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.736
I hate to be the one to show you this,
but it's not pretty.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.656
(Laughter)

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.976
So for one thing,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.176
our solar system
is on a much, much larger scale,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.896
and so to hear all eight planets,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.096
we have to start with Neptune
near the bottom of our hearing range,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.256
and then Mercury's going
to be all the way up

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.176
near the very top of our hearing range.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.776
But also, since our planets
are not very compact --

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.136
they're very spread out --

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.736
they didn't have to adjust
their orbits to each other,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.376
so they're kind of just all playing
their own random note at random times.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.120
So, I'm sorry, but here it is.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.136
(Tone)

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.576
That's Neptune.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.616
(Two tones)

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.840
Uranus.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.256
(Three tones)

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.496
Saturn.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.976
(Four tones)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.496
Jupiter.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.896
And then tucked in, that's Mars.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.936
(Five tones)

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.976
(Six tones)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.200
Earth.

00:12:27.586 --> 00:12:28.736
(Seven tones)

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.960
Venus.

00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:31.776
(Eight tones)

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.016
And that's Mercury --

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.256
OK, OK, I'll stop.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.136
(Laughter)

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.656
So this was actually Kepler's dream.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.096
Johannes Kepler is the person

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.296
that figured out
the laws of planetary motion.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.376
He was completely fascinated by this idea

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.216
that there's a connection
between music, astronomy and geometry.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.776
And so he actually spent an entire book

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.816
just searching for any kind of musical
harmony amongst the solar system's planets

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.320
and it was really, really hard.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.120
It would have been much easier
had he lived on TRAPPIST-1,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.736
or for that matter ...

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.320
K2-138.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.816
This is a new system
discovered in January of 2018

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.096
with five planets,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.376
and just like TRAPPIST,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.656
early on in their existence,
they were all finely tuned.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.896
They were actually tuned

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.936
into a tuning structure
proposed by Pythagoras himself,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.280
over 2,000 years before.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.976
But the system's actually
named after Kepler,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.456
discovered by the Kepler space telescope.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.736
And so, in the last few billion years,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.456
they've actually lost their tuning,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.176
quite a bit more than TRAPPIST has,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.056
and so what we're going to do
is go back in time

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.496
and imagine what
they would've sounded like

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.960
just as they were forming.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.960
(Music)

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.160
(Music ends)

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.320
(Applause)

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.480
Thank you.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.456
Now, you may be wondering:
How far does this go?

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.440
How much music actually is out there?

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.296
And that's what I was wondering last fall

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.456
when I was working
at U of T's planetarium,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.336
and I was contacted by an artist
named Robyn Rennie and her daughter Erin.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.456
Robyn loves the night sky,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.136
but she hasn't been able
to fully see it for 13 years

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.360
because of vision loss.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.896
And so they wondered
if there was anything I could do.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.496
So I collected all the sounds
I could think of from the universe

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.656
and packaged them into
what became "Our Musical Universe."

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.936
This is a sound-based planetarium show

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.136
exploring the rhythm
and harmony of the cosmos.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.416
And Robyn was so moved
by this presentation

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.696
that when she went home,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.920
she painted this gorgeous
representation of her experience.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.016
And then I defaced it
by putting Jupiter on it for the poster.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.360
(Laughter)

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.040
So ...

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.416
in this show, I take people
of all vision levels

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.136
and bring them on an audio tour
of the universe,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.240
from the night sky all the way out
to the edge of the observable universe.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.736
But even this is just the start
of a musical odyssey

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.656
to experience the universe
with new eyes and with new ears,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.256
and I hope you'll join me.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.496
Thank you.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.840
(Applause)
