00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.440
So the name Hadoop comes from my son's toy

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.880
elephant. When he was about two, a friend gave

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.560
him a little stuffed elephant which he played with

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.030
incessantly. and we overheard him calling it something, this

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.110
strange word that he invented. and said Hadoop. So

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.420
I, I immediately wrote it down because I was

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.590
in the, the software business. And we're always looking

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.900
for good names. And this one came with a, a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.840
mascot, even. and a few years later when I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.542
needed a project name, pulled it out. Now I,

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:35.413
I wrote it down as H A D O O P. And figured that everyone would say Hadoop. Now

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:39.949
it turns out everyone says Hadoop instead, but I persist in saying

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.560
Hadoop. Now my son, of course, is 13, and expects

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.720
royalties for the name. He he wants more credit. He also accuses me of stealing

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.810
the toy. At some point, he was using it in some kind of rocket ship experiment,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.100
and I had to rescue it. And now it, it lives in my sock drawer for, for safety.
