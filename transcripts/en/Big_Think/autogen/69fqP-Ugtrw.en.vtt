up on my roof with the hammer and
dismantle them and then I have a problem

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
dismantle them and then I have a problem

but it's not a problem that cascades

going to have plenty of problems this

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
going to have plenty of problems this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.229
 
well this is a place where government

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239
well this is a place where government

subsidy makes sense we need to jumpstart

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180
subsidy makes sense we need to jumpstart
 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.780

cost of them is falling pretty rapidly
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.270
cost of them is falling pretty rapidly
and it will fall more rapidly as we get

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280
and it will fall more rapidly as we get
 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.520
and it will fall more rapidly as we get
more and more of them in place that

to subsidize coal and oil which we
continue to do in large quantities

because we've known how to burn coal and
 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.390
because we've known how to burn coal and
oil for 200 years we've gotten most of

the manufacturing advantage that we're
going to get from any subsidy now is

going to get from any subsidy now is
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.349
going to get from any subsidy now is
just pure pay off too politically

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359
just pure pay off too politically
