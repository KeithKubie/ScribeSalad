00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.600
 Today is google developer program engineer Araki 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.450
 is 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:22.830
 Today we will introduce you to the action bar controller pad 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.890
 Action Bar Compat is using Action Bar from android 2.1 onwards 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 It is compatible rally to be able to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:36.260
 It is equipped with android 3.0 or 4.0 or later 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.260
 Action bar api will be available on older devices 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:46.010
 At the time of new project creation if you use the latest android studio 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:50.150
 The action bar console pad is built in to the existing project here 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.070
 Let's think about how to incorporate and see how to use it 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:58.100
 If you are using a grader, just add a line to the build. Gradel 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.950
 Library can be added to the project 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.850
 If you are not using sdk texts in the directory you installed 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.140
 android support v 7 up this pad 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.260
 Project as a library project 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.860
 Please add to 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:22.570
 Let's first look at how to change the resource file 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.940
 When using the action bar controller pad, the theme of the activity is one of the three shown 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.760
 Must be one 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:35.290
 Theme Up Now Pad is a Dark Background Theme The Upcon Pad Light is a Bright Background 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.710
 Theme up compatto light dark action bar on light background 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 It is an action bar 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.230
 Specifically, where it is as above in android manifest xml 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.000
 Change as you did 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.060
 Be careful because it will be at-style rather than cut android colon style 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.579
 Please give me 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:02.610
 The previous example was a simple example, but you have already created a custom theme for the entire app 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:07.680
 For example, let's look at the case where it looks like 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.490
 There are two basic principles to match a custom theme to the action bar control pad 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.100
 I will 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:20.050
 The first is to specify one of the three themes we mentioned earlier as the parent theme 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.710
 The second one has an android namespace for all attributes 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:30.030
 It is to prepare two things which are not attached 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:36.580
 Specifically, it looks like api Level 14 or later system standard 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:40.180
 As attributes are available as above on files in v 14 folders android 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.040
 Specify attribute with namespace 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.409
 In the previous api level, the library uses the provided attributes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 As it is necessary like below 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:57.160
 Specify without namespace 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:02.500
 Items such as buttons placed on the action bar can be added as a menu as usual 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.810
 Be aware that action bar specific attributes are provided in the library 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.480
 Need to use 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:15.940
 The second line of code you're defining defines a new xml namespace 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.150
 If it is pure up, the part may be any name but the action below 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.890
 View live house 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:26.319
 If you skip the namespace of attributes such as lucid action in android 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.270
 Please try to use the space of this new sister 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.890
 Next we will look at the code 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.220
 Activities are not regular activity classes but action bar activities 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:42.080
 Please inherit the class 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:48.680
 This class contains action bar related methods in the normal activity class 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:53.090
 There are several methods that have support in their names in a corresponding way 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.980
 Sound create options as usual for buttons on the action bar 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.170
 By using ef 8 the menu resource prepared earlier in the menu method 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.700
 available 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09.349
 If you use the search b menu item menu item menu item 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:15.680
 Instead of using the get action view, which is a method, now menu items 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:20.269
 Use what is provided as a static method of class Pat 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.769
 For fragments, provided by a nonion support library 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:27.590
 Please use 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:32.300
 When adding a menu item from fragment, in the create method 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.700
 It should be set, and after calling like options menu true 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.910
 Create options menu and note repair options menu 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:44.070
 Override the method 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:50.569
 In addition to the normal ui options attribute when using the split action bar 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:56.210
 Need to add metadata elements within the activity element 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:05:00.590
 Finally, I will introduce three other functions related to the action bar 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.330
 When using the search view, use the class provided by the library 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.699
 Need to use 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:12.410
 However, the support library itself of action bar comp is api level 7 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:16.200
 Set of search view classes as opposed to available from 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.940
 Able info method is api level 8 or later 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:25.100
 Please note that is not available 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.120
 There is also a compatible version available for share action providers 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.100
 As well 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:35.639
 Instead of the standard android as a namespace for menu resources 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:39.960
 Let's use what was defined in the application side 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.629
 If you are in the code, create action menu and get action 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.999
 When using a provider method 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:51.220
 The menu items are now static as in the previous search view. 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:54.490
 Please use the method 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:00.020
 There is a compatible version of popupmenu class 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:03.919
 The basic usage is the same as a regular popup menu 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.879
 Action bar activity is also compatible with navigation drawer 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.949
 there is 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:13.490
 As you can see, the action bar draw will take a class called toggle in the layout 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:16.729
 You can register as a listener 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:22.250
 You can also display a progress bar in the action bar 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:26.230
 The example you see is specifying feature in Bittermint Progress and the circle is 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:31.240
 You will see a rotating loading animation 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:34.849
 If you use feature progress instead, set support blogless method 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:40.580
 You can set the degree of progress 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.960
 The transition to the upper hierarchy added in android 4.1 can also use the compatible version 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.949
 Ah 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.529
 One more activity of seaweed activity 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:52.209
 Specified in manifest file 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:57.360
 As in the action bar of the split action view, to the activity element 

00:06:52.209 --> 00:07:00.169
 Add standard attributes and metadata elements 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.560
 It is an introduction of external tools 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.990
 Action Bar Style Generator is an action bar on the web 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:10.370
 It is a tool that can be customized 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:16.189
 Resource file awareness can be downloaded by specifying the color of each part 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:20.190
 If you specify up compatibility in the selection item of style compatibility 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:22.009
 Action bar compatible and compatible style files are generated 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.590
 I will 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:29.090
 It is introduction of external library 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:34.130
 You can update the list by scrolling down in the gmail app etc. 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:35.480
 But Action Barpruet Refresh realizes that interface 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:40.420
 It is a library 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:45.010
 Here too, the action bar controller pad is supported 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:50.920
 How is it? By all means using the action bar console pad android standard 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:53.430
 Please try to create an application that conforms to the design guidelines of 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.430
 I will
