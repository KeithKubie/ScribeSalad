DESPITE THE LEADING MAN LOOKS.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:18.851
I'VE SEEN WHAT CAN HAPPEN

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:21.721

TRIES TO CARRY A FILM.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:22.789

I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT WAS DANIEL TOSH."

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:50.283
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
WILL BE SAYING.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.751
THEN THEY'LL TELL
ALL THEIR FRIENDS.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.686
