00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When I do my F/q like 10/-0.2, I get a value of -50,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but the negative actually just means that the electric field is to the left.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Negative charges fill forces opposite the direction of the electric field

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
whereas positive charges fill forces in the same direction.
