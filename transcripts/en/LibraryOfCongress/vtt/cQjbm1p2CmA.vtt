00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.230
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.420
It is a big pleasure
for me to welcome you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.010
to this special program today.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.980
My name is Martha Kennedy.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.600
I am a Curator of Popular
Graphic Art in the Prints

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.500
and Photographs Division.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.970
And we are very pleased to have two
outstanding and funny cartoonists

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.840
with us today to share
their perspectives

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.230
on political cartooning.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.760
This panel is cosponsored by the
Prints and Photographs Division,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.290
the Swann Foundation for
Caricature and Cartoon,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.970
and the Interpretive
Programs Office.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.190
This event is part of
public programming connected

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.100
with a very fine special exhibition
entitled "Pointing Their Pens,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.320
Herblock and Fellow
Cartoonists Confront the Issues."

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.950 position:56%
And this is curated by my
colleague, Sara Duke, who I think is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.250
in the audience here [laughter].

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.890
Another preliminary comment.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.940
We do plan time for
questions at the end

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.370
of the cartoonists' presentations
and I hope you have some questions.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.860
This program is being
filmed for webcast

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.460
and that's why we have all these
blinding lights up right now.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.490
So please understand that
if you ask a question,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.050
you are giving permission
to be filmed.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.920
Signe Wilkinson and Ann Telnaes
have to the Library at a time

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.760
when public attention and
debate over the significance

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.270
of the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>
tragedy and the role

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.590
of free speech have
been reinvigorated.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.900
Causes, you might ask.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.660
"Doonesbury's" creator,
Gary Trudeau,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.270
recently commented
critically on the nature

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.950
of the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>
cartoonist's work,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.360
describing it as "punching down."

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.460
Many of his peers disagreed,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.360
including our cartoonists
here today.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.190
Also, when the PEN/Faulkner
Writers' Group recently decided

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.040
to make an award to
<i>Charlie Hebdo Magazine </i>,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.260
five member writers
publicly declined

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.200
to attend the group's
fundraising gala.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.100
So, against this unanticipated
backdrop,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.770 position:56%
we asked these two distinguished
cartoonists to share their responses

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.850
to the tragic murders
of the five cartoonists

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.390 position:56%
at <i>Charlie Hebdo Magazine </i>in
January of this year, their thoughts

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.860
on free speech, other
cartoonists' related work,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.740
and their takes on
Trudeau's comments.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.260 position:56%
In addition to these very timely
concerns, we also asked them to show

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.820
and discuss their own controversial
cartoons and cartoons relating

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.420 position:56%
to women's issues and gender issues.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.590
Signe and Ann are among a
very small number of women

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.230
who pursue political cartooning
as their main professional focus.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.900
Okay. I'm going to --

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.750
-- Signe Wilkinson is
the Editorial Cartoonist

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.510
for the <i>Philadelphia Daily News </i>--

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: I'm on the left.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.660
[ Laughter ]

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.320
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: --
and she is also contributing

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.120
to the <i>Philadelphia
Enquirer </i>these days.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.520
In 1992 she became the first
woman to win the Pulitzer Prize

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.310
for her political cartoons.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.870 position:56%
And this prize-winning group focused

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.400
on human needs and
social conditions.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.630
She has received many other
prestigious awards including the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.670
Thomas Nast Award from the
Overseas Press Club in 1996, 2000,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.280
2006, and this year, too.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.100
She's also received the Robert F.
Kennedy Journalism Award in 2002

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.190
and 2008, and the Visionary
Woman Award

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.270
from Philadelphia's Moore
College of Art and Design in 2011.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.730
She served as President
of the Association

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.690
of American Editorial
Cartoonists in 1994/'95.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.310
She's published two collections

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.220
of her wonderfully hard-hitting
eye-catching cartoons,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.340
and they included <i>One Nation
Under Surveillance </i>in 2005,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.120
and <i>Abortion Cartoons
on Demand </i>in 1992.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.680
She's also drawn cartoons
for <i>Ms. Magazine,</i>

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.330
<i>Organic Gardening </i>,
and other publications.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.430
Her work has been exhibited
widely in group and solo shows.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.050
She launched "The Family
Tree," which is a comic strip

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.970
that was syndicated and distributed

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.430
by <i>United Media </i>in 2007
and ended it in 2011.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.570
Ann Telnaes, on the right,
creates animated editorial cartoons

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.460
and a blog of print cartoons.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.240
Ann made gifs and sketches
for the <i>Washington Post </i>.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.860
In 2001 she became the second
woman to win the Pulitzer Prize

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.360
for her political cartoons,
and they focused

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.150
on the presidential
election of 2000.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.080
Other notable awards she has
received are the Clifford K.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.760
and James T. Berryman Award from
the National Press Foundation

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.410
in 2003 and 2006.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.330
And in 2011 she was a finalist

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.930
for the Herblock Prize
in Editorial Cartooning.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.980
In 1997 she also won a National
Headliners Award and other awards.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.130
She has served as the Vice
President of the Association

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.060
of American Editorial
Cartoonists and is a member

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.630
of the Cartoonists Rights
Network International.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.090
Her cartoons have been exhibited
nationally and internationally,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.560
including a solo exhibit
here at the Library in 2004.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.990
She has published two
collections of her bold,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.610
streamlined cartoon drawings

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.230
in <i>Humor's Edge </i>which was a
companion volume to her exhibition,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.180
and <i>Dick </i>in 2006 which
revolved around cartoons

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.730
of then Vice President Dick Cheney.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.920
Beginning in 2002 Ann contributed
to the daily comic "Six Chicks"

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.260
for several years and to the online
publication <i>Women's eNews </i>from

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.750
2002 to 2009.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.270
Much more could be said about both
of these wonderful cartoonists,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.510
but I would like to ask you to
welcome them to our program today.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:53.240
[ Applause ]

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.480
All right, just -- I'm
going to ask Signe to begin

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.320
by sharing her reactions to
the <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>tragedy,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:09.250
and how she framed her thought
process in responded to it, first.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.880
Thank you.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.180
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson:
Thank you, Martha.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.430
When we got started on
this, planning this event,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.310
it was long before <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.850
It was long before the more recent
controversies, and we were sort

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:31.970
of wondering what the focus
would be, just free speech."

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:38.340
And I regret to say that tragedy
has really become the centerpiece

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.400 position:56%
of what most cartoonists are
talking and arguing about right now.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:52.680 position:56%
And just to be clear, my position is
that cartoonists don't kill people.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.610
Cartoons can't kill people.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:03.130 position:56%
Humorless, religious fanatics
generally do, or more often they do.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.760
A cartoon, a little
cartoon, a drawing on paper,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.520
pixels on a screen, cannot
stone anyone to death,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.260
it cannot sever a head, it
cannot send anyone to jail.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.720
And so the proportionality of what
we're talking about, a cartoon,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:27.460 position:56%
the drawing of a cartoon, and the
results that happened on January 7th

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.040
in Paris are just so
disproportionate

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.360
that it's almost hard to even
talk about it as well, you know,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.230
one thing equals the other.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:47.200 position:56%
But my interest in this goes back
to the Danish cartoons which started

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.660
in 2005, and erupted in 2006
after several months of ginning

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.300
up controversy about them.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:04.030
And I learned then that it's
really not about the image

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.050
of Mohammad being prohibited
from being -- from drawing.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.460
And that's what I'd like to talk
about today, is the use of symbols

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.460
and how we come to
focus on one thing.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.200
But, in reality, for at
least me as a cartoonist,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.030
it's been quite different.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.600
This, of course, this is
grabbed off the Internet,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.800
so I'm sorry the resolution
isn't good enough for you

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.040
to be really shocked and
appalled that I am showing them.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.620
And this is a collection of the
Danish cartoons with the most,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.240
the one that caused
the most controversy

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.300
up on the top with the turban.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:55.510
When that happened, it took a
while for the controversy to bubble

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.880
over from Europe to
the United States.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.030
And nobody really knew that --
what it was all about, that this --

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.040
that drawing Mohammad
was even a problem.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.220
One of the first papers
to publish the image

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.730
in the United States was the
<i>Austin Statesman American </i>,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.820
which did it too early.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.980
No one knew that it was -- that
this was a prohibited image,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.420
and they got no reaction.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.010
People didn't know they were
supposed to be afraid and appalled.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:37.270
But shortly thereafter, it really
hit the fan and there were only

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:44.200
about five other papers in the
country that managed to put

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.110
in a news item in the paper.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.450
And one of them was the
<i>Philadelphia Enquirer </i>.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.910
I word at the <i>Daily News </i>at
the time, and our paper did not.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:11:00.660
The <i>Enquirer </i>put one in one of
the interior pages in a little box

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.200
with an explanation and --
just to alert its readers,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.570
this is what we're talking about.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.000
There were protests.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.740 position:56%
There were many follow-ups, meetings
with people who were unhappy.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.050
But what it did was
start a conversation

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.900
in the city of Philadelphia.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.920
And right now we have a very
strong interfaith movement that,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.460
because it brought people
together to actually talk

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.370
about these things
across religious lines.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:39.520
My editor, when I said, ooh,
I want to draw Mohammad, said,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.520
mm, not so sure about that.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.660
And he backed me up on many,
many other controversies.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:52.060
So I stewed for a couple of days
to figure out how I could do it.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.350
And I did this cartoon
-- "The Big Fat Book

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.510
of Offensive Religious Cartoons."

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.160
[ Laughter ]

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.780
That's Mohammad, third
from the right [laughter].

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.830
This cartoon has been reprinted
widely and was just sent

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.990
around the world again via Twitter

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.960
after <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>
, with no controversy.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.700
And the reason is that
Mohammad is cheerful,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.640
happy, and one of the guys.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.800
He's not portrayed negatively.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.880
And this is the point
I want to make.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.380
That it isn't about
drawing Mohammad.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.000
It's how Mohammad is drawn.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.180
And so it's a political, it's
the politics; it's not the image.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.020
And I have had this experience
in other cartoons as well.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.640
Oh, oops [laughter].

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.510
Wait, this isn't a
gay wedding, is it?

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:55.040
[ Laughter ]

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:01.880
Well, about half my audience like
this cartoon a lot [laughter].

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.980
About half my audience said,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.840
"One should not be putting
a prophet in the newspaper."

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.510
And then my Jewish readers said,
"How dare you put leavened bread.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.050
[ Laughter ]

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.200
"That was a sedar dinner."

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.030
I can't please everyone
all the time.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.200
I said, "That was my
artistic license.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.400
Have you ever tried to
draw matzo [laughter]?"

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:34.900
So, again -- but I've
done cartoons --

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.330
I did one with the Pope's
coming to Philadelphia.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.970
I want you all not to be there.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.120
There's no room in
Philadelphia next September.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.960
But the Archbishop liked it so
much, he sent it to the Vatican.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.030
It's like, okay, you can't do it
sometimes, you can do it others.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:58.310
And this -- we're covering the
major religions I've pissed off

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.610
over my career.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:05.390
This was a tiny little illustration
in 1992 that went with a letter

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.720
about Arab attacks on Israelis.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.940
It appeared on our Letters Page.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.020
Next day it was in birdcages.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.870
No one commented on it.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.330
About three months
later, this was 1992,

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.570
a woman named Lynn
Yeakel was running

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.600
against Arlen Specter,
our incumbent Senator.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.120
And she was gaining on him.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.850 position:56%
It was the Year of the Woman,
Clinton was running, and Spector all

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.310
of a sudden's camp
got a little nervous.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.560
So they started a whispering
campaign about her,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.830
saying that she was anti-Semitic

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.520
for the most minor
infraction you can imagine.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.680
It was -- it didn't even involve
her, but somebody at her church,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.500
a thousand-member church.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.520
So there were letters to
the editor about that.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:04.810
And just by happenstance I drew
this with Lynn Yeakel being asked

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.200
to prove that she is
not anti-Semitic.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.170
I was eviscerated for
this tiny little cartoon.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.810
People called, they wrote, people
came into the office and suggested

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:26.250
to my editors that I find
other employment, that I was --

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:33.700
called in letters "feminism's
own Goebbels," et cetera.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.100
There was a little blowback.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.600
Let's just put it that
way [laughter].

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.290
But the argument was I should not
use the Star of David in a cartoon.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.920
However, this was okay.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.680
This was not.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.000
And it goes back to my points

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.640
on the other prophets
that we have looked at.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.150
It's not the symbol, it's
not the prophet itself.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.360
It's the politics behind it.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.450
And every group holds
certain things sacred.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.940 position:56%
The question in front of us is
whether we can let each group decide

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.940
for everyone else what is sacred.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.730
And if we do, we will
not be drawing cartoons.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.480
So that's -- I turn
it over now to Ann

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.740
to continue our --
do I have one more?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.040
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.340
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Oh, yes.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:32.510 position:56%
Just a small historical [laughter]
-- It was an early style [laughter].

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.760
It was my 1876 style.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.470
I used to call it -- I used to sign
them "Joseph Keppler [laughter]."

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.570
If you take a look at this,
this was a double-truck

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:50.160
in <i>Harper's Weekly </i>called
"The Religious Vanity Fair."

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.510
If you start from the left,

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.330
that is a stereotypical,
horrible Jewish person.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:03.510
The little, next one to the right
is the humbug Presbyterians.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.240
Way over on the right, it's the
Catholic selling indulgences.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:13.260
The guy with his hand up is
the Baptist offering baptism.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.790
You get over to polygamy.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.540
You have the Episcopalians
selling ritual salvation.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.600
And the guy on the couch was the
New Age minister of the time,

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.260
Henry Ward Beecher,
who was promising the

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.920
"love road to heaven [laughter]."

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.500
This is our heritage.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.350 position:56%
It's irreverent and it treats all --

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.160
it treats all religions with
a good dose of skepticism.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.440
My point is that in --

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.320
and my feeling is that as new
religions come this is the

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.220
marketplace that they're entering.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.800
And if we treat all of
them equally they will show

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.510
up in a cartoon like this, too.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.430
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Is it
this one to look for?

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.730
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Yes.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.030
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Okay.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.330
Okay. I have to apologize.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.250
I, of course, came down with a
cold first thing this morning.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.160
So my voice is like a
couple of steps down.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.910
So I apologize for that.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.570
So Signe talked about symbols.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.900
I'm going to talk about the
red line that everybody seems

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.110
to be discussing, especially
now with --

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.550
after <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>
and Gary Trudeau.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:41.790
Of course, as Signe mentioned,
this really did start in 2006

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.100 position:56%
with the Danish cartoon controversy.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.890
This was a cartoon that I drew at
the time in response to all our --

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.910
the debate that was going on within
the cartooning community here

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.390
in the United States.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.100
People were very divided then.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.310
I would say at that point really a
lot of people thought that the --

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.810
what the Danish cartoonist
did was not appropriate.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.030
And I was frankly surprised
at a lot of my colleagues,

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.420
a lot of my liberal
colleagues, that they really felt

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.760
that they had definitely
crossed over a line.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.640
But my point here was that
everybody has their own red line.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.240
Everybody has a different opinion

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.260
about what insults them,
what makes them angry.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.460
So if you start doing red
lines, I wanted to show

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.790
that eventually you
box in the cartoonist,

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.390
the writer, the whatever.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.930
And that's the reason
I created that one.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.040
Another thing that came out of the
Danish cartoon controversy was just

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.360
the different type of censors
that we had around the world.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.970
You know, of course you probably
know that in Europe they have a lot

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.350
of laws against the fact
that -- a Holocaust denier,

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.580
that you actually think
the Holocaust didn't exist.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.040
You're not allowed to say that.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.580
They throw people in jail for that.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.880
I think those people are nuts.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.330
I think they're crazy.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.590
They -- you know, they obviously
don't know their history.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.450
But I don't think they
should be thrown in jail

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.950
because all you're doing is you're
just -- you know, ridicule them.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.610
Tell them they're stupid.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.120
Draw cartoons about them.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.220
But to make it against the law

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.850
to say something idiotic,
I think, is idiotic.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.670
So, and this is kind
of the way I feel

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.530
about the whole thing [laughter].

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.410
"I'm all for free speech unless
I find it personally offensive."

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.650
So now, getting around
to <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.340
That was a really difficult time.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.020
I think that really
changed the conversation,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.390
at least in the cartooning
community.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.310 position:56%
And I really felt that that was sort
of going to be the catalyst for us.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.990 position:56%
I really thought that that was
going to change even the cartoonists

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.080
that had felt that the
Danish cartoon controversy,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.500
the Danish cartoons were wrong
and they shouldn't have done it.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.020
I thought that, you know, killing
five cartoonists in cold blood

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.900
over what they drew would be
enough for people to say "Enough,

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.330
that's ridiculous," you know?

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.660
If we're going to be a civil
society, that we're going

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.320
to kill people over what they
say and draw is just absurd.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.780
So I was not working

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.540
for the <i>Washington Post </i>during
the Danish cartoon controversy.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.430
But I was during <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.120
I started in 2008.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.200
So this was my immediate
response to the killings.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.500
I was shocked.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.800
You know, it's kind of hard

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.190
to do a hard-hitting
cartoon when you're shocked.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.240
But this was after
the iconic photograph

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.990
of the <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>editor.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:49.180
That he had on that same shirt and
he was holding up his fist after,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.780
I think, the bombings
is what it was,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.630
the bombings of the
<i>Charlie Hebdo </i>offices.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.000
I'm just showing you how
this appeared online.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.980
I'm going to show you individual
pieces so you can actually read it.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.930
This was a cartoon essay
I did in response to --

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.480
after the <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>killings,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.470
after the initial shock wore
off and people condemned it.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.950
Then all of a sudden
we started having,

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.980 position:56%
not just with the cartoonists, with
writers talking about how, you know,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.590
what the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>
cartoonists did was questionable.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.960
It was in bad taste.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.540
It was racist cartoons.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.150
You know, it was anti-Semitic.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.450
It was whatever.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.770
So let me just go through
the panels real quick.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.850
"So now that the shock
of the murders has turned

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.580
to questioning <i>Charlie
Hebdo's </i>satire" --

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.120
"Some cartoonists and writers
have described the cartoons

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.430
as anti-Muslim, blasphemous,
offensive and bigoted.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.660
The 2009 firing of a cartoonist

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.190
who wrote an anti-Semitic
column has also been mentioned."

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:57.180
"First of all, I am not a
big fan of bathroom humor.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.480
Secondly, and more seriously,
it's a valid discussion to have

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.900
about why the divisions
between people are so deep

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.290
and our political discourse
has become so toxic --

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.390
However, that is not what we
should be talking about now.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.400
Do we condone threats of
violence toward individuals

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.680
because of what they say or draw,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.200
regardless of how offensive
the words or images are?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:30.840 position:56%
No. Because what happens once we get
beyond the easy images to condemn --

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.970
"And who makes that decision?

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.750
" All people must have the right
to express themselves without fear,

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.140
otherwise we risk losing
our freedoms."

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.770 position:56%
So my point is, you know, when we
talk about what are offensive images

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.640
and what should we not be drawing
or what should we not be saying,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.550
my question back to you is,
who makes that decision?

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.280
Are we going to let
government make that decision?

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.490
Do we let individual religious
institutions make that decision?

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.840
I am all for letting the idiots say
stupid things in order for us all

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.370
to be able to say what
we want to say.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:18.810
I'll put up with the dumb people
in order to keep those freedoms.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.110
Am I done here?

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.410
Are we --

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.710
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: I
don't know [inaudible].

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.010
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Let's
see where we're going.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.040
Ah, it's Signe.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.860
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Just one
note on the Danish cartoons.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.920
Just as I said, if the
<i>Enquirer </i>-- it started --

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.490
the publication started a dialog.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.710
It did in Denmark, too.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:46.000
And as a matter of fact, one of the
young imams who was really the one

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.130
who went out of his way to find
others to protest the cartoons has

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.190
since recanted his
point of view and said

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:02.480
that the paper should have
the right to publish them.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.830
So, again, a cartoonist
is not the end of a --

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.960 position:56%
a cartoon is not the end of a
conversation; it's the start of one.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.500
But you can't have a conversation
if one of the people is shot dead.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.500
So I'm all for not shooting
cartoonists personally,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.950
and I'm going to say that publicly.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:29.270
This is just a little round-up that
we're not alone in this discussion.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.380
Cartooning is a worldwide
sport these days.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.490
This is Latuff from Brazil who --

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:40.210
and I apologize to my colleagues
whose cartoons I'm about to show.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.750
I did not ask for their
permission to show them at this,

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.840
although I have asked Latuff
in the past if I might.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.550
He's shooting to <i>Charlie Hebdo</i>
and hitting the mosque in the back.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.230
But the reason we need
to pay attention to --

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.630
and this is the first day out.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.890
And there were tons
of cartoons like this

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.940 position:56%
from cartoonists all over the world.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:07.300
But international cartoonists
have other concerns as well.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.250
This is another one by
Latuff drawing about Muslims.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.910
It's freedom of speech.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.590
Drawing about Jews.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.260
It's anti-Semitism.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.780 position:56%
And there's a big feeling among
cartoonists around the world, not --

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.730
I mean not universally but in
many countries, that we do --

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.680
we are unequal in the
way we treat things.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.340
But we should know that.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.960
I mean, we might not agree with it.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.260
We might think we're equal.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.900
But we should know how
others perceive us.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:44.160
This is an Indian woman cartoonist,
and she's gotten in trouble

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.650
because she's talked about
religious people in India and rape.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:53.470
"So why don't you tell your guru
to stop molesting the girls?

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.320
'Til then, cartoons on
him will be continued."

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.080
And that's a pretty
brave cartoon for someone

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.460
in India, especially a woman.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.470
It's not generally
encouraged apparently.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.790
She's had a lot of blowback.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:20.320
And lastly, this is the wonderful
cartoonist, Ali Farzat, from Syria,

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.360
who was a very courageous
anti-government cartoonist.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.640
And in 2011 someone, we
don't know exactly who,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:37.900
I guess could be guessed, abducted
him, several masked people,

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.980
beat him, as you can
see, and then stomped

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.880 position:56%
on his hands until they were broken.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.030
This is what cartoonists
around the world --

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.250
but not always face
the same thing --

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.970
but there's real, real
persecution against them and --

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.510
but this is Ali Farzat's reply.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.220
[ Laughter ]

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.610
It's the spirit of
cartoonists everywhere

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:11.350
and that's what we're
tapping into here.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.890
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:29.720
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: At this point
I'm going to ask Ann to show some

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.310
of her most controversial cartoons.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.130
And if we have time
later we will try

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.150
to access an additional
controversial cartoon

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.960
by Signe if we can do that.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.920
But Signe's already covered some
really controversial cartoons

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.690
in her earlier remarks.

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.640
Okay?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.940
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Okay.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.240
So when -- I'm going to
show you two of them.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.470
The last one we're going
to try to show at the end.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.280
Unfortunately, it's an
animation, so technology.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.900
We couldn't get it to work properly

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.410
and we're scared we couldn't
come back to the slideshow.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.830
So I will tell it to you.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.970
But I was really pleased
with myself.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.270
I didn't do this on purpose.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.110
But I actually have covered
all three major religions

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.090
to insult [laughter].

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.150
Okay. So the reason I'm
showing you three of these --

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.240
I'm not exactly sure which
one actually resulted

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.670 position:56%
in me getting threats, real threats.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.770
What happened was it was
a Islamic group based

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.970
in the U.K. This is what
I figured out later on.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:34.600
Islamic group based in the U.K.
who went to my website and went

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.620
into my archives and picked
these cartoons and put them

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.870
on Iranian magazine website.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:46.110
And then I started getting these
e-mails that all sounded alike

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:51.500
about what an awful person I was
for doing these, which was fine.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.800
I don't care about that.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.100
We all get threats.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.400
It's no big deal.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.810
But then I got a couple of like I'm
going to kill you threats from --

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:05.640
they traced them back to
Saudi, Arabia, and Kuwait.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.410
My first experience with the FBI.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.920
That was fun.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.220
So anyway.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.560
That was right after 911.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:18.180
This is before the Danish cartoon
controversy and <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.660
Ah, this was fun [laughter].

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.780
As you all might remember,

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.750
the Catholic Church sex abuse
scandal here in the States.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.170
I did many cartoons about that.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:36.730
Got lots of reactions from people
about how I was Catholic-bashing.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.130
And this one was particularly
an interesting one.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:46.500
The Minneapolis paper
published it, so then --

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.030
I will part of it if
I can actually see it.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.650
Let' see. The Chancellor of
the Archdiocese of Saint Paul,

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.960
Minneapolis wrote a letter.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.220
He didn't try to kill me, but he
did write a letter to the editor.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:08.020
And we wrote, "To use the Vatican's
recent same-sex marriage document

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.440
to portray the Vatican
as lecherously winking

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.200
at a legal same-sex unions
and pedophilia is a vicious

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.180
and unfair slur against our church,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.630
its religions, and
its lay faithful."

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.300
And my point about
that is, you know,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.440
I don't do cartoons blasting people

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.520
for their individual
religious beliefs.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.480
That's your deal.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.450
But if a leader of a
church, if the leadership

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:36.480
of a church inserts itself
in the political process,

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.690
which the Catholic Church does

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:43.220
with their reproductive rights
stances, they are fair game.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.040
So that is why I do these cartoons.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.950
And the last one we
can't show you right now,

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:52.180
but suffice to say,
it's about Netanyahu.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.970
So maybe we'll see that later on.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.220
I don't know what's
next [inaudible].

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.520
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Okay.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.060 position:56%
Do you want to say anything about --

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.360
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: Okay.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.110
No. Just briefly -- the
next section is on --

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.410
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Chick humor.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:09.710
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: Right.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.050
[ Laughter ]

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.350
We've had [inaudible] about women,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.170
their position, and
other gender issues.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.860
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: And how we kind of,
being female editorial cartoonists,

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.080
how we might take a little
bit different take on things.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.380
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Okay.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.680
So I'm not going to --
these aren't cartoons

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.090
about politics and women's issues.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.030
I've done a ton on them.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.610
But there are really, I
think, a few different --

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.570
there are certain cartoons
that I've done

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.740
that I don't think a
man would have done.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.280
And this is one of them.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.680
This is about me shopping
with my daughter

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.560
in the Brittany Spears
era [laughter].

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.380
Okay. It's four parts.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.510
I'm not happy [laughter],
but I get an idea.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:58.160
[ Laughter ]

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.420
It's again -- I mean I've been
accused of being anti-Muslim, but,

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.460
you know, you can use imagery
in many different ways.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:15.230
And I appreciate the hijab for
being there for me as a parent.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.560
The next one, "If God
had wanted women

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.400
to have octuplets --
I don't think so."

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:31.790 position:56%
Anyone who's actually birthed a baby
would understand how difficult two

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.420
would be as opposed to eight.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.400
That was, remember, when
the Octomom was big.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:46.550
And I will -- I actually
think when people say,

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.710
okay, how do you draw women?

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:55.290
One thing a woman -- a woman does
not have trouble drawing other

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:56.640
women's breasts.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.130
They're not sex objects.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.600
They're just part of an anatomy.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.820
And I think if you look at
various cartoons about women,

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:11.160
I think sometimes, not always,
there's a tendency to have trouble

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.020
with that part of the anatomy.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.520
So a woman -- oh, a woman
is a little freer I think,

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.330
or at least knows what
she's talking about.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.770
This was actually --
this is about abortion.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.950
This is quite some time ago.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:29.330
She sees the results positive.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.010

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:39.560
She goes to the abortion clinic
and come back in 24 hours

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.980
after you've thought it over.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.740
And the reason I did this
was that I had had a baby,

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.320
and I know the second that you
think that you might be pregnant,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.820
that's the only thing
that you think about.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.560
And so, for a guy across the street
at the Supreme Court to tell me

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.040
that I need 24 more hours to
think about it is, just to me,

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.690
so insulting and has no
understanding of what it's

like to actually be pregnant,
whether you want the baby or not.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:15.930

say, you know, there is always,

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:19.980
it's always talked about medical
stuff having to do with women.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.620
And men, too.

is a good idea or not.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.890
This is actually something I did in
[inaudible] or the Hillary Campaign

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:56.670 position:56%
when she got so much criticism about
how she wasn't sensitive enough

And, of course, this has
come up again just recently.

that's really interesting.

tough but they want her

what did they do to find
out if you were a witch.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:19.240
They threw you in the water and if
you floated you were a witch and,

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.150
therefore, they're going to know.

of apropos to Hillary.

you this in terms of --

serious about why it's important

to have women editorial cartoonists.

Because we're women we do notice
things important to women.

And when I first started

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.460
out in editorial cartooning I was

beginning they kind of traded women

it was a better cartoon

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:18.380
because I paused and
thought about it.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.170

my cartoons appear in both the
<i>Enquirer </i>and the <i>Daily News </i>.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.490
It appeared in the <i>Daily News </i>.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.090
the <i>Enquirer </i>did
not want to run it.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:35.490

thought it was a great cartoon.

<i>Daily News </i>did.

figure them out [laughter].

You just --

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.280

and along the same lines,

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.710
since we have the animation up,
my editor backed me up completely

it and take a look at it.

Sunday thinking nothing of it.

a lot of Palestinians were killed,
a lot of children were killed.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.040
And I thought, well, I want
to do a cartoon about this.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.640
I don't want to put any
blood in it or anything.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.870
I just want to do something
criticizing really both sides,

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.170
you know?

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.470
Because children are innocent.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:31.770
Children don't have a say in this.

or not they get bombed.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.800
office to complain
about that cartoon.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.410
And then there's an article in the
Israeli -- what is it, <i>The Post,</i>

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.900
<i>The Jerusalem Daily Post </i>.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.550
Yes, <i>Jerusalem Post </i>, condemning
-- well, talking about it and,

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.190
of course, you know,
having statements

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.510
from different organizations.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.350
They didn't bother
asking me about it.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.520
So I wasn't in there.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.960
And then I started getting
another round of e-mails

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.030
that were the most -- I have never
gotten e-mails like this before.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.750 position:56%
I mean, every single cartoonist
gets, you know, mean e-mails talking

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.200
about what an idiot you are, you
shouldn't be doing cartooning,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.930
you know, you're this, you're that.

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:24.430 position:56%
This was the most misogynistic
disgusting e-mails that I've gotten.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.900
I'm not saying it's from those
organizations, because it wasn't.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.730
It was just from individuals.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:34.350
But it's -- I think it's indicative
of what -- where we're going,

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:37.410
you know, with conversation
and social media.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.370
I'm not the first woman
that's gotten that.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:45.570
But it's -- it was a
first for me in my career.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.320
So, I guess we can
just continue with --

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.540
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy:
Yeah, other questions.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: That hat [laughter].

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.140
&gt;&gt; Congratulations, Signe,

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.870
[inaudible] the Overseas
Press Club --

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.670
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Yeah.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:02.630
[ Applause ]

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:06.180
&gt;&gt; -- we've heard recently
from foreign cartoonists

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:09.030
who have come here and said they
wanted [inaudible] translate

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:12.160
across the world for
moving text [inaudible].

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.880
Are there special things
about what you do

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.790
that you think play well
overseas [inaudible],

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:26.680
things you do that you're
conscious of, I want this to play

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.450
across the world, or
not so much [inaudible].

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.750
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Go ahead.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.050
You're closest.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.960
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: My work tends to
be more image-heavy than words.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.100
So I think that's just my
natural tendency to do, do it.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.180
I don't -- no, I don't,

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.140
I don't necessarily
change anything that way.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.600
I mean, I -- I think just the fact

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.950
that we have the Internet now
is just amazing development

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.860
for editorial cartoonists because
we can reach so many people.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.180
Of course it gets us
in trouble, too.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.760
And that's why we ended up with
the Danish cartoon conversation.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.240
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: I'm a
really local cartoonist.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.510
So my stuff depends on
people knowing what's going

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:11.370
on in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
mostly and the environs.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:16.690
So I don't think about how it's
going to be playing in Beijing

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:20.840
because I don't think
they're interested.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.830
So, you know, some of them
have, as I said earlier, have --

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:27.850
on the more international
topics have gone around.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:33.120
But I don't draw for an
international audience.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.600
For the <i>Philadelphia Daily News </i>,

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.660
Camden is a foreign
assignment [laughter].

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.530
How about --

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.830
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy:
[Inaudible], yeah.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:44.130
&gt;&gt; Most [inaudible] of [inaudible]

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:49.680
but I realize there was
a [inaudible] second part

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.090
where you guys are
being [inaudible].

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.110
But, whatever.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:59.510
There's a more serious side to it
when you talk to -- about politics.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:04.720
And, as an artist, I'm
[inaudible] your opinions about --

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.490
because let's take for instance
there was a senator who went to,

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:13.170
I think it was Japan,
not too long ago.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.470
He had [inaudible].

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.310
So do you think that the artist is
overstepping her or her boundaries

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:25.720
in making political gestures at
what we would call serious issues?

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.020
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Baa.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.670
Well, I'm not sure how that --

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:35.120
I think that was South Korea was
the ambassador who was just coming

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.740
out of a meeting and I don't --

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:42.630
I'm not sure how that
translates to cartooning.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.890
But the -- you know,
that's what we do.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:49.860
We take difficult cartoons and --

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:55.970
I mean difficult issues and
tragedies sometimes and try

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:01.550 position:56%
to give them -- give a
connection, an emotional connection,

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:05.740 position:56%
about how one could feel about them.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:12.370
So I think cartoons are sort of
a link in a newspaper or website

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:17.450
between an actual event and how
people feel about that event.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:21.920
And, of course, the reaction
is different whether you agree

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.480
with the cartoonist or not.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.700
And I think where it's
going is that --

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.190
where once we were in
broad-based publications

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:34.890
like the <i>Washington Post </i>or
in my papers in Philadelphia,

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:39.560
now people are going into more
niche online publications,

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.600
so that if people want
to access a cartoonist,

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.750 position:56%
they go to the ones they already
agree with, and are happy with them.

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:52.580
And then it's harder -- I
think the downside of that is

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:58.690
that you don't start the
conversation across party lines

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.560
or ideological or religious lines.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.420
And I think that's not
just about cartooning

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.380
but about the media generally.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.260
All sorts of things.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.680
That didn't answer your question,
but Ann will answer it --

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.980
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: No,
no way [laughter].

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.560
No, I know.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.860
Martha can answer it.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.160
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: Okay.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.610
I'd like to ask both of you,

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:24.040
why there are so few women
in political cartooning.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.720
Where does --

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.100
[ Laughter ]

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.750
I mean, I know this is -- it's
sort of a leading question,

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.210
but I think it's important,
you know,

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.070
to hear both your takes on that.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.910
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: You know,
without <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>,

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.530
that would have been
the first question.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:37.830
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Yeah, right.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.680 position:56%
We've had -- we've gone beyond, yes.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.880
I don't know.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.220
I mean, there's -- because
it started that way.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.100
Because most editors were male
and you feel more comfortable

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.450
with someone that's like you.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.750
I don't know.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.050
I mean I was in animation.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:55.890
We had the same -- we
had the same issue there,

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:59.750
that there weren't a lot
of women in the beginning.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.050
It's changing.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:06.690
I mean, it's -- the reason I make
fun of that question, on a test,

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:09.780
is because it's like
for us, we don't --

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.490
do we consider ourselves
as women cartoonists?

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:12.790
No.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.090
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: No.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:15.390
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: No.

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:16.690
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: We consider
ourselves cartoonists --

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:17.990
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: 'toonists.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:19.290
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: God damn it.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.590
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Damn it.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.890
[ Laughter ]

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.200
[ Applause ]

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.390
You said God damn it [laughter].

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.720
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: If
there was a god, damn it.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.020
Oh, no.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.800
&gt;&gt; Do you think that any of your
more controversial cartoons,

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.150
any of the ones that got more of
a reaction, would have gotten less

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.230
of a reaction if you were males?

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.380
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Well, a
lot of my hate mail begins,

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.700
"Dear Mr. Wilkinson [laughter]."

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:46.130
Seriously.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:47.560
Because my picture
isn't in the paper,

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.330
and Signe's an ambiguous name.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.710
And you're going to
have to answer that one.

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:54.010
But I don't think so.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:58.210
I think people are -- they
-- if they hate an image,

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.280
they hate the image whether
you're a woman or a man.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.580
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Yeah.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:03.880
I don't -- not really.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.730
I mean I've done cartoons that
have had the woman's point of view

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.920
where I've gotten a couple of men
like oh, you're just a man-hater,

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.910
but that's not [inaudible].

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.210
Sandy.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.740
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in hearing your
reactions to Gary Trudeau's remarks

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.980
from -- like <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:24.230
What he seemed to be pointing out
was everybody should really be,

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.080
to be concerned about
what they said.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.520
But on the other hand that some

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.450 position:56%
of the <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>cartoons were
really stirring a racist Islamic pot

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:34.750
[inaudible] Islamic pot.

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:36.050
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Go ahead.

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:37.350
You first.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:38.650
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Me first?

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:39.950
You first?

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:44.140
Yeah. I actually wrote a
response to Gary Trudeau

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:48.590
in my <i>Washington Post </i>blog, which
is an interesting experience for me

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.020
because writing is not my thing.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.110
But sometimes you just
need to write it.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:56.190
I don't agree with Gary Trudeau.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.240
You know, I respect him,
as I said in my column.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.190
I think he's, he's really one
of the greats in our field.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:07.680
I just think he chose some very
unfortunate words, you know.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.410
To throw hate speech in there,
to, you know, to describe me

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:19.080
as a free-speech fundamentalist
extreme -- no, fundamentalist --

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.380
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: A fanatic.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.680
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: -- fanatic.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.980
That was it, fanatic.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.950
You know, I just don't
agree with that.

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.240
Like I said, I think that, you
know, it's important that we,

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.940
as a society, discuss
and debate this issues.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.640
But we're a civilized society.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.310
That's how we do it.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.870
We don't kill people
and we don't sit there

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:42.310
and somehow explain
people that kill people.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:44.510
And when he brings
up disenfranchised

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:48.380
and -- what was the other term?

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.680
Disenfranchised --

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.270
-- minorities, I mean, Signe and I,

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.910
we've done so many cartoons
about women's issues.

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:00.580
You talk about a disenfranchised
minority,

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.880
women throughout the world.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:06.110
And, unfortunately, women tend to
get the real short end of the stick

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.960
when it comes to religious
organizations.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.530
They do. I mean, I know that's
something that nobody wants

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.780
to talk about, but it's true.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.480
So, you know, like I
said, I respect him.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.530
I just don't agree with him.

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.510
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Ditto.

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:27.190
[ Laughter ]

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:32.180
I, too think he's, you
know, a master of the craft.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.380
But -- and I think
what Ann's getting

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.260
at about feeling slightly
differently as a woman --

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:45.650
the first people who get covered up
and who get told that they can't be

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:51.340 position:56%
at the altar or, you know, that they
can't go to the Wailing Wall, or,

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:55.860
you know, to offer their prayers
in the same place men do, it's --

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:59.930
I mean, this is, this
is religion in action.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:05.840
And from a woman's point of view
it's always a little difficult

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.290
to say, oh, okay, that's fine, and
please go to my state legislature

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.700
and pass some laws
based on your religion.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:21.790
I just feel like -- as Ann
said, if you're going to enter

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:26.580
into the political fray and a lot
of religions do, then you're part

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.520
of politics, and you have to
be treated as a politician.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.880
That's what cartoonists do.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.320
So I feel that at the other --

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.030
the specific problem or
the specific accusation,

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.890
both for the Danish cartoons

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:48.520
and the <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>cartoons
was these people weren't

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.920
really journalists.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:55.670
And the Danish cartoon, the
magazine was some right wing rag.

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:59.930
Well, Flemming Rose,
the Editor of that rag,

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:05.610
was a foreign correspondent based
here in Washington for many years.

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.220
And then also in Russia.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.460
He speaks fluent English
and fluent Russian.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.920
I've sat at a table with him
where he's talking about towns,

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.300
tiny little towns and their
mayors in the Ukraine.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.850
This is a serious journalist.

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:23.930
He didn't just do --
cook this up on a whim

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:26.560
which is what he was
accused of doing.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.570
So I reject that.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:33.940
It's an issue that's -- the issue
of immigration is a live issue

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.190
in many European countries.

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:39.720
This is how they dealt with it.

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:45.890
And one small sliver dealt
with it and, again, it's --

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.090
it should have been the
start of a conversation

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:51.290
between people, not the end of it.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:54.930
And I would say the same thing for
<i>Charlie Hebdo </i>except, you know,

00:54:54.930 --> 00:55:00.470
<i>Charlie Hebdo </i>-- the cartoons,
the circulation was going down.

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.610
People weren't reading
<i>Charlie Hebdo </i>.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.230
If they had just left them alone,

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.860
there would have been
one reader left.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.720
And that would have
solved the problem

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:16.310
for them before the people
who objected to them.

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:19.960
And then there's always the
ability to draw your own cartoons.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.850
And cartoonists around
the world are doing that,

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:26.720
so grab a pen, not a gun.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.500
What was that?

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.890
&gt;&gt; I have a question
on a lighter note.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:37.390
I was wondering if you all were
both news hounds growing up

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:40.900
and if you weren't doing this, what
do you think you would be doing?

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:44.100
&gt;&gt; Were you a news hound?

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.400
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Well,

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.630
at Girl Scout Camp I did
the underground newspaper

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:48.930
with a friend, but [laughter].

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:53.460
And at the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.730
where I worked to earn
money to go to art school,

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.250
we had the underground
newspaper going there, too.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:04.050
But, so I've been, you know,
interested in commentary generally.

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:08.720
But I am not -- I would not say
I'm the best informed person

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.650
in the entire United
States of America.

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:13.170
And I don't -- you know, if I --

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:16.220
I think one of the reasons I
would never live in Washington is

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.700
that that's all people talk about.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.950
It's boring after a while.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:24.270
That's why I like to do cartoons
on different aspects of life,

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.010
not just the day-to-day politics.

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:27.740
So, no, I'm not a -- I'm not

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:31.670
as big a news hound
probably as I should be.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:32.970
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: No.

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:34.740
I actually -- I didn't get
into editorial cartooning

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:37.000
until I was almost 30 years old.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.950
I started out as an animator.

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:41.210
See, everything you learn

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:44.480
when you're young comes
back later to help you.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:48.620 position:56%
Yeah. So, I -- and I actually didn't
even read a newspaper in my 20's.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:49.970
Isn't that horrible?

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:54.110
I became interested in politics

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:59.060
when I watched the Anita
Hill Hearings on television.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:04.760 position:56%
And I was, frankly, appalled at what
I saw with both sides of the aisle,

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.370 position:56%
about the questions they were asking

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.650
and things they were
saying to Anita Hill.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:13.970 position:56%
And having been a woman that worked,
you know, in private businesses,

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:17.410
and I just thought
you guys are crazy.

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.990
Of course there's still
sexual harassment

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:20.470
and of course we still
have to deal with it.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.770
So that's when I decided

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:25.200
to put together a portfolio
and send it out.

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.820
And I knew nothing about what I
was doing, which is really good

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.760
because ignorance is
bliss [laughter].

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.230
So -- and that's how I
got into the business.

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:35.530
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson:
Just one other thing

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:39.140
about women not going
into cartooning.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:43.210
I actually do think that there
is a difference between --

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:46.860
generally speaking,
it's a huge spectrum,

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:53.600
but women take things more
personally, generally, not,

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:57.340
you know, on average, I'm
not making huge stereotypes.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.630
And there're clearly
exceptions to all rules.

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:04.470
But, you know, Steve and
others in this room are --

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:09.400
have gone to AAEC conventions,
our cartooning convention.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.330
It's oh, yeah, I really -- I got,

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:14.590
I got a lot of reaction
out of that one.

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:16.980
Oh, yeah. They really
went after me on that one.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:22.950 position:56%
You know? And that's not generally
the reaction that I hear from women.

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:25.000
It's like, oh, my god [laughter].

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.340
They didn't like the color I did on
that woman's dress in my cartoon.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.940
No. I'm not saying that.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.240
I didn't say it [laughter].

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.490
Erase the tape [laughter].

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:42.370
But it is -- it's -- I'll quit
before I really bury myself, yeah.

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:43.830
Okay, fine.

00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:47.440
But I do think that that's
a little bit of an issue.

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.940
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Are we going on?

00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:51.240
Next question [laughter].

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; What about recording [inaudible]?

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.840
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Yeah.

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.510
&gt;&gt; So one of the things that I
read in Gary Trudeau's thing,

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:00.810
and I read your response
to the blog here,

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:03.980
was to talk a little bit
about responsibility.

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.970
And you used that word which
I thought was going to be one

00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:07.560
of your words that you brought up.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.930
But my question is, is
there a limit to satire?

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:15.160
Is there -- are there things
that are not satirical and then

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.190
for our paper problems
or some other ways of --

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:21.320
how would you guys define that?

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.040
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Limits in satire?

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.340
&gt;&gt; Are there?

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.640
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Well,
that's really interesting.

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.940
&gt;&gt; Because you were
pretty black and white

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.240
like there is like no red lines.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.540
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Right.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.840
&gt;&gt; There can't be any.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.140 position:56%
I have to be able to say everything.

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Well, you know, it's
funny, it's funny you should ask

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.000
that because I would
encourage everyone to go

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.800
to the C-SPAN archives and
pull up Hustler v Falwell.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.720
It's really interesting
because they actually talk

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.050
about are their limits in satire.

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:50.900
And they actually use Gary
Trudeau as an example.

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:54.140
They compare him to
what Falwell does --

00:59:54.140 --> 01:00:00.300
I mean to what Larry
Flint does in <i>Hustler </i>.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:05.360 position:56%
You know, his cartoons blasting H.W.
Bush about his manhood in a box?

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.660
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Yeah.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.960
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Yeah.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.860
And compare what Larry
Flint did in that Campari ad

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.590
to what Gary Trudeau does in his
cartoons about George W. Bush.

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:21.020
And, actually, it sounded like
the court came to the conclusion

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.620
that in America -- now we're
talking about America here --

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:29.860
the First Amendment, your Freedom
of Speech, you cannot limit that.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.120
Libel is something different, okay?

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.430
That's something completely
different.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.530
And that's what the court
was trying to decide.

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.620
But when it comes to satire,

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.550
the word they used
was you -- what is it?

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.860
You cause personal
harm or something?

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.160
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson:
Distress, emotional distress.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.460
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Distress,
emotional distress,

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.320
which basically means
you're hurting my feelings.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.130
And is there a limit there?

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:55.910
And the court came to the
conclusion that is not a limit.

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.850
It cannot be because
then you start --

01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:01.360
then it's like where is that line?

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.770
Who's deciding that line?

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:04.560
And if you -- and I encourage you.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.440
Go back and read that Campari ad.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.850
It's disgusting.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.830
It is just disgusting.

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:13.930
And the court upheld it.

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:16.600
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: That would
be the liberal William Rehnquist

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.400
Supreme Court.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.040
[ Laughter ]

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.340
&gt;&gt; Can I ask a question?

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.640
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Yeah.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.940
&gt;&gt; So to clarify.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.360
When you say that the
Campari ad was disgusting,

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.470
I believe you're saying that's
something you would not have been

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:30.770
involved with.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.280
You would not draw or -- I have
no idea what was in this ad.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.990
But that's something
you wouldn't do.

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:39.890
So, if we're talking about the
limits of satire, you're saying,

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:44.080 position:56%
and I agree with you there should
be no governmental limits on satire,

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.950
but you as the individual
cartoonist draw your own limits

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:50.200
on what you think is satirical

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.380
versus what you think is people
are disgusting or something else.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.850
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Well, we
are professionals, you know.

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:56.150
We do know what we're doing.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:58.410
I think that's why we always get
so pissed off when government tries

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.180
to tell us what to
do with our bodies.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.900
We're, you know, we're adults.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.440
We can decide ourselves.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.190 position:56%
And it's the same thing with satire.

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:07.530
You know, I -- the
thing that I want --

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:11.210
I do not want the tools
being limited to me

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:16.110
if I decide an image needs to be
used because what I believe is

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.940
so strong about the
subject matter that I need

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.140
to do something that's
going to get your attention.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.990 position:56%
It doesn't mean I'm going to use it.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.480
But I'm just saying, is I
don't want to see people limit

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.610
that because I think it's
-- I know this is a cliche.

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.940
It's a slippery slope if
you start doing that because

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:35.540
if you start telling people I don't
like that, I don't like that --

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.310
there's a lot of stuff I
don't like that's going

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:39.010
on in this world, you know?

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:40.860
And if I wanted to
start killing people

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.420
over it then you'd have a problem.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.200
But -- that the problem is,

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.510
is what people think is
and isn't acceptable.

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:52.470
So, I don't know where
I'm going with that.

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.450
But go ahead [laughter].

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:57.090
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: Well, one
thing I thought was interesting

01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:02.090
in the pieces, in response to
Gary Trudeau, was that a number

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:06.050
of cartoonists actually said
they had personal limits

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:10.140
and they've talked about
what they would not choose

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.580
to show in their cartoons.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.910
And, anyway, that's just a point
that I thought [inaudible].

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:17.300
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: But the point is
nobody's telling them what their

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.600
limits are.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.900
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: No,
what their limits are.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.200
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Yeah.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Have either of you drawn cartoons

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.220
that you wish you hadn't drawn
[inaudible] and take back?

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.510
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Oh,
only about 40% of them.

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:32.120
[ Laughter ]

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.420
No.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean at the point where you
maybe thought well maybe I did cross

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.780
that line.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.100
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.580
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: There
are a couple that people took

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.050
as way -- that I didn't mean them.

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:49.250
It wasn't that the point,
my point was so extreme,

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:53.430
but I was -- it was a bad cartoon.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:58.300 position:56%
If I didn't get my point across and
somebody felt that it was, you know,

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.590
that it was saying something
I didn't mean to be saying,

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:06.190 position:56%
that's not a good cartoon, and I
wished that I'd done it differently,

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.820
especially ones that people --

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:15.760 position:56%
and one in particular I remember was
really taken wrong by an individual,

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.470
and I didn't mean to
harm that person.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:22.530
I had meant it, actually,
in support.

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.660
So that was my --

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.160
&gt;&gt; Mistakes were made.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Yes, my -- Yeah.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Yeah, it's basically

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.060
if your cartoon isn't
the way you expected,

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.590
you want it to be, come across.

01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:37.080
But it's -- we take that
responsibility on ourselves.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.380
You know what I mean?

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.290
We'll question ourself and go,
why didn't I do it a certain way?

01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:41.590
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Right.

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.890
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Or if you
release it on a certain day.

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:44.690
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Oh,
you're being such a woman.

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:48.280
[ Laughter ]

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I was wondering whether the
reactions to your more controversial

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.340
or politically incorrect
cartoons, if the reaction varies

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.660
by age or generation at all.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.960
Like, in particular --

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.260
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Yes.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.560
&gt;&gt; -- do those under
30, do they take it

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.860
about the same as everybody else?

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.930
Or are they more accepting,
less accepting?

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:07.190
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Well, since we
don't have any newspaper readers

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:08.490
under 30 --

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:09.790
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:11.820
&gt;&gt; [Clearing throat],
it's really hard to judge.

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.570
But I think, yes, I
think you're right.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:17.140
And I think if you look at the
styles of younger cartoonists,

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.410
they're quite different than
my style and Ann's style.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:23.430
So the next generation
of cartoonists is going

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:26.380
to express things in
very different ways.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.320
So, yeah, I do think that
there's a difference.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.550
Yeah.

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:39.160
&gt;&gt; Is there any cartoonist in the
United States who is as provocative

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.730
as the cartoons [inaudible]?

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:45.930
&gt;&gt; Ann Telnaes: Mr. Fish,
Dwayne Booth, great stuff.

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:48.230
Go look at it [laughter].

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.340
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: I --

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.640
&gt;&gt; Another --

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.940
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: One
more and then we wrap it up.

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.240
Yeah.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.310
&gt;&gt; When we mention the limit
of satires, what is acceptable,

01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:02.010
[inaudible] do you mean
the powerful majority

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:03.640
of the [inaudible] minority?

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.880
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Could
you repeat that, please?

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.180
I'm not sure I --

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.130
&gt;&gt; The limit of satire
in [inaudible] --

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.990
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Uh-huh.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:13.160
&gt;&gt; -- acceptable to you by
differing in the larger,

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.740
powerful majority or
[inaudible] minority?

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.880
&gt;&gt; Signe Wilkinson: Well, I
think this actually gets to some

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.930
of the point that Gary
Trudeau was making.

01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:28.900 position:56%
He was saying that the cartoon -- as
I understand it, that the cartoons

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:33.250
in <i>Charlie Hebdo </i>punched
down on people who did --

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.580
who were not in the majority.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.960
And, therefore, it was a --

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.820 position:56%
it's a cheap shot because they don't
have the same power as the majority,

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.610
either the majority
of the cartoonists

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.800
or the majority in the country.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:57.560
But -- and I think that
generally speaking cartoons are,

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.440 position:56%
are seen as more powerful when
they're going after powerful people.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:09.250
I mean, they're the ones who are
setting the examples in the world.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:16.000
However, it's hard to say who's on
top and who's on bottom sometimes.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.720
I think in -- when you're
looking at, we'll just say Muslims

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:28.500
at this point in France,
they're a minority.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:33.070
But in the headlines when
a group that identifies

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:38.410
as a Muslim group takes over
an entire region of a country

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.920
and starts executing people
and, you know, asking for --

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.200
not asking, demanding forced
conversions, et cetera, et cetera,

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.410
it's the same overall
group but I don't feel

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:54.550
like I'm punching down
to criticize them.

01:07:54.550 --> 01:08:00.890
So I think it really depends on
what, you know, what the issue is

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:03.290
and where it is you're focusing.

01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:09.660 position:56%
But it gets back to the whole global
that, you know, the global world.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:15.040
People may feel disenfranchised
one place and quite franchised

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.160
in another place, even though the
large umbrella would put them --

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.340
they would both be under
the same large umbrella.

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:28.350
So that's, again, one of the
problems in sending cartoons

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:31.070
across cultures and countries.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:33.730
&gt;&gt; Martha H. Kennedy: Thank you.

01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:36.620
I'd like thank both of
our cartoonists again,

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.920
and I'd like to thank
all of you for coming.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.720
&gt;&gt; Yes.
