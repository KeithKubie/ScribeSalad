00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.699
Cacti and desert beetles can live in arid
environments because they’ve adapted to

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.160
suck water out of the air.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.090
So, can we do that if we’re in a drought?

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.589
Hi guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.220
We know the Earth’s climate is warming from
a mix of natural changes, including solar

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.810
activity, and man-made causes, namely greenhouse
gases and aerosols.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.820
This is taking a toll on global weather.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.820
There is more water vapour in the atmosphere
so rainfall is increasing in tropical areas,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.520
but drier areas are experiencing some of the
worst droughts in history.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.219
The thing is, even in deserts, there's humidity
in the air.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.210
So, to help tackle the world's drought problems,
a team of scientists from Harvard, with support

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.149
from the Department of Energy, looked to plants
and insects that are able to pull water out

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.239
of the air to survive in the desert.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.739
This biologically-inspired technology described
in the journal Nature involves collecting

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.399
water from air by condensing water vapor on
surfaces inspired by beetles, cacti and other

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.089
desert-dwelling organisms.

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.489
They looked at the bumpy surfaces of desert
beetles’ shells and found that, if the geometry

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.030
is right, water droplets grow faster on the
tops of convex bumps than on a raised flat

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.590
surface of the same height.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.790
They looked at the asymmetric structure of
cactus spines and found they had the best

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.220
topography to guide the condensation off the
bumps to be collected.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.290
And, the slippery surface of carnivorous pitcher
plants inspired the researches to guide those

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.260
formed water droplets down a smooth, non-stick
surface.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.890
The team combined these elements with a material
that repels liquid called Slippery Liquid-Infused

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.030
Porous Surfaces technology or SLIPS.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.040
The three nature-inspired inventions combined
with the SLIPS technology make an excellent

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.360
collector to gather water from the air!

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.710
When set up, any atmospheric moisture pools
on the bumps and flows as water droplets down

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.520
the asymmetrically pitted water-repellant
surface!

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.820
But could it make a difference?

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.320
I asked the paper’s lead author Kenneth
Park.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.770
He roughly calculates that the volume of air
the size of a house in a desert holds about

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.180
16 liters of water.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.640
That’s not a lot for people in developed
countries, but in desert regions it could

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.570
be life changing access to drinking and cooking
water.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.930
And of course in humid areas, that number
rises even more.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.130
Basically, as long as surface temperature
gets below the dew point, there will be condensation

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.480
to harness from the air.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.170
The challenge now facing the team is controlling
the size of the water droplets and the direction

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.500
in which they flow.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.109
But with the details worked out, this could
be a step towards developing a passive system

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.379
capable of collecting and transporting atmospheric
water to a reservoir.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.549
But remember, while this technology is great,
it’s a proof of concept.

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.769
We still need to conserve resources, especially
those of us living in areas affected by drought,

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.660
like California, which is experiencing the
worst drought in more than a century.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.400
So with scientists developing these kinds
of technologies, just how serious is the global

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.440
drought that we’re looking to thin air as
a water source?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:50.170
Julia’s got the information on this current
crisis in this episode right here.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.780
Some people are creeped out drinking recycled
water… would you feel weird drinking water

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.139
full from the air?
