00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:01.616
- [Voiceover] Oh, it's time.

00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:03.391
It's time for the super
hot tension problem.

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:04.837
We're about to do this right here.

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.032
We've got our super hot can of red peppers

00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:08.821
hanging from these strings.

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.761
We want to know what the
tension is in these ropes.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.077
This is for real now, this
is a real tension problem.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:16.309
And here's the deal.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.377
You might look at this,
you might get frightened.

00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:20.232
You might think, I've gotta come up with

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:22.551
a completely new strategy to tackle this.

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:24.439
I've gotta throw away
everything I've learned

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.902
and just try something new.

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:27.058
And that's a lie.

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:28.499
You should not lie to yourself.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.439
Use the same process.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.290
We're gonna use the same process we used

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.408
for the easy tension problems,

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.134
because it's gonna lead
us to the answer again.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:39.170
Be careful. Don't stray
from the strategy here.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.109
The strategy works.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.650
So we're gonna draw our
force diagram first.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.178
That's what we always do.

00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:45.031
We're gonna say that the forces are

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:48.170
force of gravity on
this can of red peppers,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.544
which is MG, and if it's 3 kilograms,

00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:52.962
we know 3 kilograms times about 10,

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:55.708
we're gonna say, let's
approximate G as 10 again

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.417
to make the numbers come out nice.

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:00.816
So instead of using 9.8,
we'll say G is about 10,

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:02.910
and so we'll say 3 kilograms

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.077
times 10 meters per second
squared is gonna be 30 Newtons.

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:12.728
And so the force of gravity
downward is 30 Newtons.

00:01:12.728 --> 00:01:14.078
What other forces do we have?

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.330
We've got this T1, remember
tension does not push.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.197
Ropes can't push, ropes can only pull,

00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:21.880
so T1's gonna pull that way.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.961
So I'm gonna draw T1 coming this way.

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.378
So here's our T1.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.447
And then we're gonna have
T2 pointing this way,

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:29.630
so this is T2.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.731
Again, T2 pulls, just like all tension.

00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.018
Tension pulls, tension can't push.

00:01:34.018 --> 00:01:37.101
So I've got tension 2 going this way.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.656
That's it, that's our force diagram.

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:42.584
There's no other forces.

00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:43.849
I don't draw a normal force,

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.276
'cause this can isn't in
contact with another surface.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:48.956
So there's no normal force,
you've got these two tensions,

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:50.436
the force of gravity.

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.155
And now we do the same thing we always do.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:54.742
After our force diagram,
we use Newton's Second Law

00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:56.809
in one direction or another.

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:57.863
So let's do it.

00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:00.687
Let's say that acceleration
is the net force

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.779
in a given direction, divided by the mass.

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:05.827
Which direction did we pick again?

00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:08.786
It's hard to say, we've
got forces vertical,

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:10.137
we've got forces horizontal.

00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:13.258
There's only two directions to
pick, X or Y in this problem.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.222
We're gonna pick the vertical direction,

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:17.094
even though it doesn't
really matter too much.

00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:19.416
But because we know one of
the forces in the vertical

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:20.909
direction, we know the force of gravity.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.089
Force of gravity is 30 Newtons.

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:25.267
Usually that's a guod
strategy, pick the direction

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:27.770
that you know something about at least.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.526
So we're gonna do that here.

00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:31.392
We're gonna say that the
acceleration vertically

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:33.896
equals to the net force
vertically over the mass.

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:34.968
And so now we plug in.

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:36.784
If this can is just sitting here,

00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:39.473
if there's no acceleration,
if this is in not an elevator

00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:42.557
transporting these peppers up or down,

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:44.447
and it's not in a rocket,
if it's just sitting here

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:47.466
with no acceleration, our
acceleration will be zero.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:50.995
That's gonna equal the net force
and the vertical direction.

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:52.377
So what are we gonna have?

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.197
So what are the forces in
the vertical direction here?

00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:57.222
One force is this 30
Newton force of gravity.

00:02:57.222 --> 00:03:00.571
This points down, we're gonna
assume upward is positive,

00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:02.194
that means down in a negative.

00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:03.608
So I'll just put -30 Newtons.

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:05.916
I could have written -MG,

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:07.462
but we already knew it was 30 Newtons,

00:03:07.462 --> 00:03:08.921
so I'll write -30 Newtons.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.583
Then we've got T1 and T2.

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:12.255
Both of those point up.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:13.648
But they don't completely point up,

00:03:13.648 --> 00:03:15.004
they partially point up.

00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:17.326
So part of them points to the right,

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.584
part of them points upward.

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:22.656
Only this vertical
component, we'll call it T1Y,

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:25.179
is gonna get included
into this calculation,

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.212
'cause this calculation
only uses Y directed forces.

00:03:28.212 --> 00:03:30.868
And the reason is only Y directed forces,

00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:34.325
vertical forces, affect
the vertical acceleration.

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.427
So this T1Y points upward,

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:39.785
I'll do plus T1 in the Y direction.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.675
And similarly, this T2.

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.113
It doesn't all point vertically,

00:03:44.113 --> 00:03:45.594
only part of it points vertically.

00:03:45.594 --> 00:03:49.138
So I'll write this as
T2 in the Y direction.

00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:50.437
And that's also upward,

00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:52.597
so since that's up, I'll count it

00:03:52.597 --> 00:03:55.314
as plus T2 in the Y direction.

00:03:55.314 --> 00:03:57.101
And that's it, that's all our forces.

00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.483
Notice we can't plug in
the total amount T2 in this

00:04:00.483 --> 00:04:02.870
formula, 'cause only part of it points up.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.340
Similarly, we have to plug in
only the vertical component

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.031
of the T1 force because only
part of it points vertically.

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:13.175
And then we divide by the
mass, the mass is 3 kilograms.

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:15.875
But we're gonna multiply
both sides by 3 kilograms,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:19.668
and we're gonna get zero
equals all of this right here,

00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:21.066
so I'll just copy this right here.

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:25.233
We use this over again,
that comes down right there.

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:29.331
But now there's nothing
on the bottom here.

00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:30.227
So what do we do at this point?

00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:31.556
Now you might think we're stuck.

00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:33.525
I mean, we've got two unknowns in here.

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:35.605
I can't solve for either one,

00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:36.938
I don't know either one of these.

00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:38.624
I know they have to add up to 30,

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:40.920
so I'd do fine, if I
added 30 to both sides,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.129
I'd realize that these
two vertical components

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.097
of these tension forces added up

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:47.308
have to add up to 30,
and that makes sense.

00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:49.319
They have to balance the force downward.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.664
But I don't know either of
them, so how do I solve here?

00:04:52.664 --> 00:04:54.193
Well, let's do this.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:57.380
If you ever get stuck on
one of the force equations

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.090
for a single direction, just
go to the next equation.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.889
Let's try A in the X direction.

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.053
So for A in the X direction,
we have the net force

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:06.198
in the X direction, over the mass,

00:05:06.198 --> 00:05:09.231
again, the acceleration is gonna be zero

00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:11.887
if these peppers are not
accelerating horizontally.

00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:14.270
So unless this thing's in
a train car or something,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.435
and the whole thing's accelerating,

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:18.076
then you might have
horizontal acceleration.

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:19.946
And if it did, it's
not that big of a deal,

00:05:19.946 --> 00:05:21.639
you just plug it in there.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.341
But assuming it's acceleration zero,

00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:24.725
because the peppers
are just sitting there,

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:25.768
not changing their velocity,
we'll plug in zero.

00:05:25.768 --> 00:05:28.206
We'll plug in the forces
in the X direction.

00:05:28.206 --> 00:05:31.193
These are gonna be T1 in the X.

00:05:31.193 --> 00:05:33.927
So part of this T1 points
in the X direction.

00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:37.566
Similarly, part of T2
points in the X direction.

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:38.706
We'll call this T2X.

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:40.833
We use these as the magnitude.

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:42.994
Let's say T2X is the
magnitude of the force

00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:45.140
that T2 pulls with to the left,

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.307
and T1 is the magnitude that
T1 pulls with to the right.

00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:53.079
So to plug these in, we've got to decide

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.585
whether they should be
positive or negative.

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.988
So this T1X, since it pulls to the right,

00:05:57.988 --> 00:05:59.696
T1X will be positive.

00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:02.835
We're gonna consider rightward
to be the positive direction,

00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:05.252
'cause that's the typical
convention that we're gonna adopt.

00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:08.229
And T2X pulls to the left.

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.033
That's gonna be a negative contribution,

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.587
so minus T2 in the X direction.

00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:14.115
'Cause leftward would be negative.

00:06:14.115 --> 00:06:16.597
We divided by the mass,
the mass was 3 kilograms,

00:06:16.597 --> 00:06:19.314
but again, we'll multiply both sides by 3,

00:06:19.314 --> 00:06:23.313
we'll get zero equals,
and then we just get T,

00:06:23.313 --> 00:06:24.502
the same thing up here,

00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:28.669
so we'll just copy this
thing here, put it down here.

00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:31.673
And again, you might be concerned.

00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:33.526
I can't solve this either.

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:37.132
I mean, I can solve for
T1X, but look at what I get.

00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:40.870
If I just multi, or if I
added T2X to both sides,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.432
I'm just gonna get T1 in the X direction

00:06:42.432 --> 00:06:45.349
has to equal T2 in the X direction.

00:06:46.224 --> 00:06:47.684
And that makes sense.

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:49.472
These two forces have to
be equal and opposite,

00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:52.137
because they have to cancel so
that you have no acceleration

00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:53.144
in the X direction.

00:06:53.144 --> 00:06:55.373
And this was not drawn
proportionately, sorry,

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.452
this should be the exact
same size as this force

00:06:57.452 --> 00:06:59.423
because they have to cancel,

00:06:59.423 --> 00:07:01.517
since there's no horizontal acceleration.

00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:02.817
But what do we do?

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:05.187
We can't solve this equation
we got from X direction.

00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:08.635
We can't solve this equation
we got from the Y direction.

00:07:08.635 --> 00:07:11.223
Whenever this happens,
when you get two equations,

00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:12.761
and you can't solve either

00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:13.995
because there's too many unknowns,

00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:16.666
you're gonna have to end up
plugging one into the other.

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.407
But I can't even do that yet.

00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:20.358
I've got four different variables here.

00:07:20.358 --> 00:07:22.275
T1X, T2X, T1Y, and T2Y,

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:25.720
these are all four different variables,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.387
I've only got two equations,
I can't solve this.

00:07:28.387 --> 00:07:30.383
So the trick, the trick we're gonna use

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.717
that a lot of people don't like doing

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:33.147
because it's a little more sophisticated,

00:07:33.147 --> 00:07:37.144
now we've gotta put these
all in terms of T1 and T2

00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:38.595
so that we can solve.

00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:41.859
If I put T1Y in terms of the total T1,

00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:44.706
and then sines of angles,
and cosines of angles,

00:07:44.706 --> 00:07:48.039
and I put T2Y in terms of T2 and angles,

00:07:49.582 --> 00:07:51.240
and I do the same thing for 1X and 2X,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.042
I'll have two equations,
and the only two unknowns

00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:57.501
will be T1 and T2, then
we can finally solve.

00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.435
If that didn't make any
sense, here's what I'm saying.

00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:02.751
I'm saying figure out what
T1Y is in terms of T1.

00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:05.629
So I know this angle here,
let's figure out these angles.

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:08.666
So these angles here are, if this is 30,

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:11.202
this angle down here has
to be 30 because these

00:08:11.202 --> 00:08:13.312
are alternate interior angles.

00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:14.696
And if you don't believe me,

00:08:14.696 --> 00:08:16.811
imagine this big triangle over here,

00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:18.692
where this is a right angle.

00:08:18.692 --> 00:08:20.401
So this triangle from here
to there, down to here,

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:24.725
up to here, if this is 30,
that's 90, this has gotta be 60,

00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:27.212
'cause it all adds up
to 180 for a triangle.

00:08:27.212 --> 00:08:29.132
And if this right angle
is 90, and this side's 60,

00:08:29.132 --> 00:08:31.291
this side's gotta be 30.

00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:34.102
Similarly, this side's a right angle.

00:08:34.102 --> 00:08:36.132
Look at this triangle, 60, 90,

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:37.841
that means this would have to be 30.

00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:40.751
And so if I come down here,
this angle would have to be 60.

00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:42.334
Just like this one,

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.919
'cause it's an alternate
interior angle, so that's 60.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:49.788
So this angle here is 60,
this angle here is 30,

00:08:49.788 --> 00:08:51.934
we can figure out what
these components are

00:08:51.934 --> 00:08:53.462
in terms of the total vectors.

00:08:53.462 --> 00:08:54.957
Once we find those,

00:08:54.957 --> 00:08:56.502
we're gonna plug those
expressions into here,

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:57.753
and that will let us solve.

00:08:57.753 --> 00:08:59.362
In other words, T1Y is gonna be,

00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:02.108
once you do this for awhile you realize,

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.604
this is the opposite side.

00:09:03.604 --> 00:09:05.440
So this component here is going to be

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.607
total T1 times sine of 30.

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:11.132
Because it's the opposite side.

00:09:11.132 --> 00:09:13.779
And if that didn't make sense,
we'll derive it right here.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:15.957
So what we're saying is that sine of 30,

00:09:15.957 --> 00:09:19.207
sine of 30 is opposite over hypotenuse,

00:09:21.588 --> 00:09:25.150
and in this case, the
opposite side is T1Y.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.150
So T1Y over the total T1
is equal to sine of 30.

00:09:30.918 --> 00:09:33.275
And we can solve this for T1Y now,

00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:36.106
we can get the T1Y if I
multiply both sides by T1.

00:09:36.106 --> 00:09:39.273
I get that that's T1 times sine of 30.

00:09:40.764 --> 00:09:42.199
So that's what I said down here.

00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:45.074
T1 is just T, oh sorry, forgot the one.

00:09:45.074 --> 00:09:46.741
T1 times sine of 30.

00:09:48.048 --> 00:09:50.506
Similarly, if you do the
same thing with cosine 30,

00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:53.506
you'll get that T1X is T1 cosine 30,

00:09:55.852 --> 00:09:57.702
by the exact same process.

00:09:57.702 --> 00:10:01.147
Similarly over here, T2 is going to be,

00:10:01.147 --> 00:10:03.564
I'm sorry, T2X is gonna be 2.

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:09.171
So T2 cosine 60, because
this is the adjacent side.

00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:12.966
And T2Y is gonna be T2 sine of 60.

00:10:15.068 --> 00:10:16.531
And if any of that doesn't make sense,

00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:19.712
just go back to the
definition of sine and cosine,

00:10:19.712 --> 00:10:22.152
write what the opposite side is,

00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:25.600
the total hypotenuse side,
solve for your expression,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.719
you'll get these.

00:10:26.719 --> 00:10:29.191
If you don't believe me on
those, try those out yourselves.

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:31.494
But those are what these components are,

00:10:31.494 --> 00:10:35.966
in terms of T2 and the
angles T2, T1 and the angles.

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:37.574
And why are we doing this?

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:39.839
We're doing this so that
when plug in over here,

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.251
we'll only have two variables.

00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:45.008
In other words, if I plug
T1Y, this expression here,

00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:48.758
T1 sine 30 in for T1Y,
similarly if I plug in

00:10:49.703 --> 00:10:53.870
T2Y is T2 sine 60 into
this expression right there

00:10:55.357 --> 00:10:57.408
for T2Y, look at what I'll get.

00:10:57.408 --> 00:10:58.987
I'll get zero equals.

00:10:58.987 --> 00:11:01.654
So I'll get negative 30 Newtons,

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:06.795
and then I'll get plus
T1Y was T1 sine 30, so T1,

00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:11.145
and then sine 30, we can
clean this up a little bit.

00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:12.334
Sine 30 is just a half.

00:11:12.334 --> 00:11:15.938
So I'll just write T1 over 2, and then

00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:17.874
'cause sine 30 is just one half.

00:11:17.874 --> 00:11:20.874
And then T2Y is gonna be T2 sine 60,

00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:26.651
and sine 60 is just root 3 over 2.

00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:30.818
So I'll write this as plus T2
over 2, and then times root 3.

00:11:33.088 --> 00:11:35.524
And you might think this is no better.

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:37.477
I mean this is still a
horrible mess right here.

00:11:37.477 --> 00:11:40.986
But, look at. This is
in terms of T1 and T2.

00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:42.266
That's what I'm gonna do over here.

00:11:42.266 --> 00:11:44.237
I'm gonna put these in terms of T1 and T2,

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:45.505
and then we can solve.

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:48.557
So T1X is T1 over cosine 30,

00:11:48.557 --> 00:11:52.798
so I'm gonna write this
as T1 times cosine 30,

00:11:52.798 --> 00:11:55.381
and cosine 30 is root 3 over 2,

00:11:56.568 --> 00:11:59.576
so this is T1 over 2 times root 3.

00:11:59.576 --> 00:12:02.909
And that should equal T2X is right here,

00:12:03.937 --> 00:12:07.354
That's T2 cosine 60, cosine 60 is a half.

00:12:08.224 --> 00:12:10.641
So T2X is gonna be T2 over 2.

00:12:12.348 --> 00:12:13.946
So T2 over 2.

00:12:13.946 --> 00:12:16.139
So what I'm doing is, if
this doesn't make sense,

00:12:16.139 --> 00:12:18.873
I'm just substituting
what these components are

00:12:18.873 --> 00:12:22.750
in terms of the total
magnitude in the angle.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.269
And I do this, because
look at what I have now,

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:26.683
I have got one equation with T1 and T2.

00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:28.663
I've got another equation with T1 and T2.

00:12:28.663 --> 00:12:30.927
So what I'm gonna do to solve these,

00:12:30.927 --> 00:12:32.843
when we have two equations
and two unknowns,

00:12:32.843 --> 00:12:34.925
you have to solve for
one of these variables,

00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:37.198
and then substitute it
into the other equation.

00:12:37.198 --> 00:12:40.127
That way you'll get one
equation with one unknown.

00:12:40.127 --> 00:12:42.220
And you try to get the math right,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.197
and you'll get the problem.

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:44.920
So I'm gonna solve this one is easier,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.572
so I'm gonna solve this
one for, let's just say T2.

00:12:47.572 --> 00:12:48.982
So if we solve this for T2,

00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:52.235
I get that T2 equals, well, I can multiply

00:12:52.235 --> 00:12:56.577
both sides by 2, and
I'll get T1 times root 3.

00:12:56.577 --> 00:13:00.947
So T1 times root 3, because
the 2 here cancels with this 2,

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.182
or when I multiply both
sides by 2 it cancels out.

00:13:04.182 --> 00:13:07.936
So we get that T2 equals
T1 root 3. This is great.

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:12.103
I can substitute T2 as T1
root 3 into here for T2.

00:13:13.998 --> 00:13:15.431
And the reason I do that,

00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:17.655
is I'll get one equation with one unknown.

00:13:17.655 --> 00:13:19.541
I'll only have T1 in that equation now.

00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:23.168
So if I do this, I'll
get zero equals negative,

00:13:23.168 --> 00:13:25.118
you know what, let's
just move the -30 over.

00:13:25.118 --> 00:13:26.690
This is kind of annoying here.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.316
Just add 30 to both sides,

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:30.804
then take this calculation here.

00:13:30.804 --> 00:13:35.326
We get plus 30 equals,
and then we're gonna have

00:13:35.326 --> 00:13:38.409
T1 over 2, from this T1, so T1 over 2

00:13:39.487 --> 00:13:42.570
plus, I've got plus, T2 is T1 root 3.

00:13:44.894 --> 00:13:48.375
So when I plug T1 root 3 in for T2,

00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:52.292
what I'm gonna get is,
I'm gonna get T1 root 3,

00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:56.893
and then times another route 3,

00:13:56.893 --> 00:13:59.560
because T2 itself was T1 root 3.

00:14:00.938 --> 00:14:02.452
So I'm taking this expression here,

00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:05.518
plugging it in for T2, but
I still have to multiply

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:08.577
that T2 by a root 3 and divide by 2.

00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:10.430
And so, what do we get?

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.226
Root 3 times root 3 is just 3.

00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:16.976
So we have T2 times 3
halves, plus T1 over 2.

00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:19.941
So I'll get 30 equals,

00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:24.232
and then I get T1 over 2,
we're almost there, I promise.

00:14:24.232 --> 00:14:29.122
T1 over 2, plus, and this is
gonna be T1 times 3 over 2,

00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:33.768
so it's gonna be 3 T1 over
2, or what does that equal?

00:14:33.768 --> 00:14:37.435
T1 over 2 plus 3 T1
over 2 is just 4 halves.

00:14:39.037 --> 00:14:42.372
So that's just 2 T1. So
this cleaned up beautifully.

00:14:42.372 --> 00:14:45.929
So this is just 2 times T1,
and now we can solve for T1.

00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:49.346
We get that T1 is simply 30 divided by 2.

00:14:51.128 --> 00:14:54.497
If I divide both sides,
this left hand side by 2,

00:14:54.497 --> 00:14:56.512
and this side here, this right side by 2,

00:14:56.512 --> 00:14:59.012
I get T1 is 30 over 2 Newtons,

00:15:00.037 --> 00:15:02.396
which is just, these should be Newtons,

00:15:02.396 --> 00:15:06.563
I should have units on these,
which is just 15 Newtons.

00:15:08.227 --> 00:15:10.910
Whoo, I did it, 15 Newtons.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.554
T1 is 15 Newtons.

00:15:12.554 --> 00:15:14.436
We got T1. That's one of them.

00:15:14.436 --> 00:15:15.881
How do we get the other?

00:15:15.881 --> 00:15:19.200
You start back over at the very beginning.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.559
No, not really, that would be terrible.

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:23.130
You actually just take this T1,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.946
and you plug it right into
here, boop, there it goes.

00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:27.977
So T2, we already got it.

00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:29.426
T2 is just T1 root 3.

00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:32.348
So all I have to do is
multiply root 3 by my T1,

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:33.181
which I know now.

00:15:33.181 --> 00:15:37.521
And I get that T2 is just
15 times root 3 Newton.

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.908
So once you get one of the forces,

00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:41.386
the next one is really easy.

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:42.884
This is just T2.

00:15:42.884 --> 00:15:46.051
So T2 is 15 root 3, and T1 is just 15.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.544
So in case you got lost in the details,

00:15:49.544 --> 00:15:52.015
the big picture recap is this.

00:15:52.015 --> 00:15:55.349
We drew a force diagram,
we used Newton's Second Law

00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:57.643
in the vertical direction
we couldn't solve,

00:15:57.643 --> 00:15:59.152
because there were too many unknowns.

00:15:59.152 --> 00:16:02.501
We used Newton's Second Law
in the horizontal direction,

00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:04.158
we couldn't solve because
there were two unknowns.

00:16:04.158 --> 00:16:06.225
We put all four of these unknowns

00:16:06.225 --> 00:16:09.376
in terms of only two unknowns, T1 and T2,

00:16:09.376 --> 00:16:12.560
by writing how those components depended

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.994
on those total vectors.

00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:17.324
We substituted these expressions
in for each component.

00:16:17.324 --> 00:16:19.256
Once we did that, we had two equations,

00:16:19.256 --> 00:16:23.190
with only T1, T2, and T1 and T2 in them.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.680
We solved one of these
equations for T2 in terms of T1,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.923
substituted that into the other equation.

00:16:29.923 --> 00:16:32.794
We got a single equation
with only one unknown.

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:34.929
We were able to solve for that unknown.

00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:37.508
Once we got that, which is our T1,

00:16:37.508 --> 00:16:39.137
once we have that variable,

00:16:39.137 --> 00:16:40.618
we plug it back into that first equation

00:16:40.618 --> 00:16:42.290
that we had solved for T2.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.560
We plug this 15 in, we get
what the second tension is.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.060
So even when it seems
like Newton's Second Law

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.896
won't get you there, if you have faith,

00:16:49.896 --> 00:16:52.725
and you persevere, you will make it.

00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:53.558
Good job.
