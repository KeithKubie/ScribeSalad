SCOTT: Hi, everyone.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.460
I'm Chef Scott.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.290
I'm introducing Chef Georg from
the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.410
He's going to do some
cool stuff for you guys.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.250
I hope you enjoy.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.289
And have a good day after that.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.830
GEORG PAULUSSEN:
The first one, we're

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.550
going to make an appetizer.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.960
First one, we have a
heirloom tomato salad.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.580
These ones are
heirloom tomatoes.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.895
And we have them growing
at the Ojai Valley Inn

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.860
and Spa in our own herb garden.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.260
And these are tomatoes with
a 5,000 year seed history.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.430
So they're really, really
cool and very flavorful.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760
Many times when you go in
a supermarket-- and people

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.832
who maybe don't know, they
see tomatoes like that

00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:47.020
and it's like, I
don't want to buy it.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.020
They don't look very
pretty, And all that stuff.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.960
But these are actually
really good, flavorful, tasty

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.460
tomatoes.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.170
Then we got some
small ones here.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.150
These are also grape tomatoes.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.700
And they're also heirloom.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.680
Then we got some other
herbs and spices,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.690
which I'm going to
show you in a second.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.510
So what we would like
to start-- and we

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.350
don't do this just
for television,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.420
we're going to put
on some gloves.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.389
And I believe that even
though-- if you maybe

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:13.430
cook at home and all that
stuff, it's always good

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.280
if you put your gloves on.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.642
And then you don't have
no cross contamination.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:18.600
All that stuff is good.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.470
So I've got a couple
of tomatoes here,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.930
which we're going to slice
in relatively big chunks.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.804
So if you have six pieces
of a tomato like that.

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:30.970
And then we want to do a
couple of different colors.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.800
Now, the flavor
profile is the same.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.460
What is different is the look.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.917
And I'll show you how
very different they look.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.080
See?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.050
And they're all ripe,
even though maybe they

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.120
have different colors.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.829
But they all still
have the same texture.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.869
And they kind of taste
the same, except that they

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.500
look different.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.230
Some small differences is
maybe the flavor profile.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.710
Then over here we have
some Meyer lemons.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.660
Meyer lemons.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.660
As you can see, these
ones are pixie oranges.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.210
Meyer lemons are almost
like an orange from the look

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.210
and from the texture of
the skin and the inside,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.040
except they're a lot sweeter.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.260
So they're a little
bit a mixture

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.810
between a lemon, a
lime, and an orange.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.029
Gives a very different
and unique flavor.

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.820
I'm going to squeeze
a little bit in there.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.610
Unfortunately, they
have about 6,000 seeds,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.130
so you want to make sure that
you don't get all of them

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.260
in there.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.080
Just take a little
bit of lemon juice.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.150
Then we have cold pressed
extra virgin olive

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.840
oil, cracked black pepper.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.285
Very simple.

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:51.750
And a little bit of salt.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.950
And then comes the fun part.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.250
I have a little bit of honey.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.200
About a tablespoon.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.470
And what's really nice with the
lemon and the pixie flavor--

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.010
and a little bit of mustard.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.990
We're going to make a dressing.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.200
And this dressing
we'll be making here

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.580
is actually part of the
salmon dressing as well.

00:03:24.352 --> 00:03:25.050
So you see?

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.730
Very simple.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.010
And it emulsifies.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.940
You want to make sure is that
the olive oil, the honey,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.690
and all the juices
really going to mix well.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.970
You take your tomatoes.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.622
And then you just marinate
them in the dressing

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:42.330
for a little bit.

00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:46.605
OK.

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:51.370
There you go.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.170
Here's one of the short cuts
I was talking about earlier.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.900
This one is a gravlax.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.250
And what it is it's basically
a line caught Pacific salmon.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.300
So it's the one which runs right
outside your waters out here.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.710
Originally gravlax
means like a grave.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.480
And it comes from Scandinavia.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.380
And why is it a grave?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.230
Yesterday, exactly
24 hours ago, I

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.260
made a mix out of
salt and sugar.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.790
Equal parts.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.440
I put juniper berries in
there, dill, black pepper,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.980
a little bit of lemon juice,
and Worcestershire sauce.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.080
I made that mix and put
the salmon in there.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.560
And, as you can
see, overnight it

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.170
has basically taken out all the
natural juices of the salmon.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.359
And as you all know,
there's ceviche.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.025
It's all this kind
of stuff out the way,

00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:41.400
you actually marinate them
with lemon and/or with spices.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.160
This one is a different
kind from Scandinavia.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.380
And the flavor profile comes
from the dill and the salt.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.550
And it does the same
thing like a ceviche.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.680
Just from a different
part of the world where

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.316
they have used them in a
different pickling way.

00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:57.190
So this salmon, even
though it's not cooked--

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.570
and you get to taste
it in a second--

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.040
feels and looks cooked.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.360
It's very, very delicious.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.490
And it has changed the color
because it has taken out

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.030
all the natural juices.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.220
And even just to show
you the back-- see that?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.610
It's completely cooked.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.580
Now the disadvantage
you have with something

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.020
like that-- if you leave it
in for longer than 24 hours

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.560
it becomes really salty.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.690
Very, very strong.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.395
And the saltier it
becomes, it's better

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.790
if you have the
juice of the lemon,

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.350
or the orange or a little bit
of lime and a little bit honey

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.760
because it counterfeits the
salty taste of the salmon.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.080
So you'll see that in a second.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.621
We have more.

00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:32.830
Just wash this off please.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.230
So we have the
tomatoes marinated.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.130
You can do that
obviously a la minute,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.110
which it means we'll do it right
now, right here for your guests

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.550
at home or for yourself.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.630
You marinate a little
bit of salmon--

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.375
a little bit of
tomatoes, pardon me.

00:05:56.375 --> 00:06:02.620
And then over here I have
some pre-washed gem lettuce.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.700
Gem lettuce is a different
kind of romaine bibb lettuce.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.620
It's very small, very unique.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.960
And it has a very
small, delicate flavor.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.230
And we'll just use
the heart of it.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.850
And we'll use that as a garnish.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.890
Every time you use a
lettuce, or every time you

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.469
use a tomato,
cucumber, whatever it

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.510
is, you want to give it
a little bit of dressing.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.120
It's not too much.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.230
And mix it all up.

00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:36.770
If you have
questions, just shoot.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.320
We don't need to
wait until the end.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.690
If you want to know something.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.920
So please go ahead.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.375
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:43.250
GEORG PAULUSSEN: Yes.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.330
GEORG PAULUSSEN: You can.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.907
You can.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.490
You don't necessarily
need to do that.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.800
The challenge is when you
do do that, you squeeze out

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.630
the juices much faster.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.960
And it doesn't take the flavor
of the actual salt and sugar

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.150
mixture.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.220
If you let it do it gradually
and slowly its own marinade,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.210
then you get the flavor
all the way through.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.820
Because if you imagine the
salmon is being squished

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.220
together, you have
no room to breathe,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.290
even though you're dead.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.998
But it doesn't go
through it all the way.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.610
So we got the dead
salmon right here.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.780
He's still all very happy.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.310
And he's all
delicious right now.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.030
And I'm going to cut
straight through the center.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.780
You have seen from the
top, from the back.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.950
And look how
beautiful that looks.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.150
And it's very easy.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.570
It's very delicate.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.824
And it's very, should I
say, very easy to slice.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.240
Let me make a
little bit of space.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.492
I want to make sure
you can see this.

00:07:42.492 --> 00:07:44.005
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:44.880
GEORG PAULUSSEN: Yes.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.420
Yes, you would refrigerate it.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.930
So there's different
ways of slicing it.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.795
You can slice it
straight through.

00:07:57.795 --> 00:08:00.030
For our purpose, for
our presentation,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.260
I like to do it like this.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:07.330
Or you slice it-- if you want
to make a nice gravlax bagel

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.390
sandwich in the
morning or something,

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.880
then you slice it like this.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:23.110
What is important as you slice
not just this, as you slice

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.020
anything at home, let
the knife do the work.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.520
Don't let your elbows-- don't
let your arm do the work.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.740
Let the knife flow
through your product.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.400
And as you can see, if you can
read a newspaper through it,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.309
you did a good job.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.610
That's how thin
it's supposed to be.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.539
If it's thicker, it's
not going to taste good.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.272
So the more newspaper you can
read, the happier you will be.

00:08:41.272 --> 00:08:42.200
All right.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.470
So we take a little
bit of salmon.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.420
Make sure there
are no bones in it.

00:08:57.654 --> 00:09:02.700
And, again, if you
don't like salmon,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.450
or if you like a different kind
of fish-- you like halibut,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.070
you like tuna-- you can do it
with all these kinds of fish.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.976
You can do it the same way.

00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:13.360
A different marinade from Asia.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.690
I used to work in
Japan for many years.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.780
In Asia and Japan they do
the same style with a salmon

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.910
or with a tuna, but you would
use soya sauce and ginger

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.640
and garlic and chili peppers.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.420
So wherever you go
around the world,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.930
the principal of a
marinated fish is the same,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.390
but the flavor profile
is completely different.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.765
So now we have these
marinated tomatoes.

00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:49.330
As you can see,
what's really nice is

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.392
the contrast of the
different colors.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:57.070
We have a couple of pieces
of a little gem lettuce.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.630
And then we take a couple of--
make sure all of this stuff

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.122
is washed.

00:10:07.122 --> 00:10:08.580
We got enough
protein on the plate.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.955
We don't want more
protein on it.

00:10:24.253 --> 00:10:24.760
OK.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.502
And then you see the
dressing is still emulsified.

00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:32.165
Take a little bit of that.

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.040
Put it on the salmon.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.930
And how fast was that?

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.888
Now if we forget about
that little sucker which

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:42.710
is 24 hours old, this
was relatively fast.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.510
That was five
minutes, 10 minutes.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.880
And you have a really cool,
great looking appetizer.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.480
It's always coming
down in a kitchen.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.840
We talk about mise en place.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.860
Mise en place is the production,
which is in its place

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.607
before we start.

00:10:54.607 --> 00:10:56.190
Once you have all
this stuff lined up,

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.610
it's going to go really fast.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.722
So what I'll do, I'll
slice a few more pieces

00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:01.930
and then Moe is going to
give you some sample plates.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.340
And you guys can take
five minutes or something

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.340
to taste it.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.810
And then I'm going to go
and start the next course.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:08.975
Sounds good?

00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:11.060
All right.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.935
So now is the music.

00:11:11.935 --> 00:11:12.685
Where's the music?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.401
Make me work for a living here.

00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:19.900
OK.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.890
More.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.570
You ready?

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.520
Any other questions?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.234
I only look like a chef,
but I'm not that mean.

00:11:35.234 --> 00:11:36.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:39.270
GEORG PAULUSSEN: I see.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.050
Now you had to do that.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.670
Who said that?

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.900
I wasn't looking up.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.805
Just kidding.

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.320
I'm from Germany.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.990
I was born and
raised in Germany.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.050
And I left the
country when I was

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.970
22-years-old to work
on a cruise ship.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.930
And some of you younger
folks maybe don't know,

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.620
but you used to have a
television show in the US.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.180
It was called "The Love Boat."

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.690
And we had the same
thing in Germany.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.040
The German "Love Boat."

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.120
And I joined that one.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.620
It was the first time
when I actually left

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.610
my village where I came from.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:14.650
And I liked it so much.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.320
And I said, wow, I get to be
able to see the whole world.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.330
And I get paid for it.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.020
So I left and I never
went back-- only to visit.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.675
OK.

00:12:24.675 --> 00:12:25.415
Here we go.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.720
I started in Germany.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.570
And then from Germany, my
first outside the country job

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.140
was New York.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.110
And I've said that
story before when--

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.510
let me start it a different way.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.360
I started in Germany.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.400
I did my apprenticeship.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.460
I did my whole stuff
with "The Love Boat."

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.510
And then I came to US.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.940
And we had 1,500 people
living in my village.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.420
So that's how small it was.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.750
And I went to a city in New
York with 15 million people.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.460
I didn't speak a
word of English.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.580
Hi, hello, that was it.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.850
That's all I could say
for the first six months.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.489
And I started learning English
on watching "Wheel of Fortune."

00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:10.030
I couldn't answer a single thing
about what they were saying,

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.945
but I was listening to the
letters, the pronunciation,

00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:14.680
the ABC, and all that stuff.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.635
And eventually it
started making sense.

00:13:16.635 --> 00:13:18.260
And then like you do
in every language,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.460
the first thing I
knew was how to cuss

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.830
in New York, and all that stuff.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.160
How to talk bad
language, especially

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.770
in the kitchen, as you know--
well, maybe as you have heard.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:28.530
So I did this.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.740
And then from New
York I went to London,

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.710
worked in London for
one and a half years.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.470
Came back to New York, and I
worked in New York and Boston,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.810
and then left the
US for four years

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.640
to go to work in Tokyo, Japan.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.820
Worked also with a couple of
stints in New Delhi, India

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.270
and in Hong Kong, Singapore.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.000
Then I was tired of Asia.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.120
Came back to the US and worked
in '97 with Caesar's Palace

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.500
in Las Vegas, was then
the Executive Chef

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.570
at the Venetian in Las Vegas,
worked there for two years

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.700
and left the US again and went
to the Atlantis in the Bahamas.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.630
And I worked there
for three years.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.570
And then from Bahamas, I
went back to Las Vegas,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.020
worked there for
seven years, had

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.850
my own restaurant
and catering company.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.447
And then as the whole economy
went down, I went down.

00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:16.780
I mean, business is still alive.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:17.780
So that's all good.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.340
But I sold the business.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.320
And then after
that, I went to work

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.010
for Trump International
in Las Vegas.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.570
And then I went one year
to the cold in Kansas City.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.850
And I didn't like that.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.370
And now I'm finally
in California,

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.090
where I believe I belong,
where I'm the happiest.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.700
It's kind of like home where
I come from in Germany.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.650
I mean, obviously, we
don't have an ocean

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.020
like you have over here.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.480
We got the cold North Sea.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.510
And it's really gray,
and that's pretty.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.568
But we got the mountains
and everything else.

00:14:47.568 --> 00:14:48.484
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:50.754 --> 00:14:51.670
GEORG PAULUSSEN: Sure.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:53.404 --> 00:14:54.570
GEORG PAULUSSEN: It's great.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.230
You have a really
great eye for detail.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.610
And the reason why I said
it's a Japanese knife,

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.990
and it's a Japanese
multi-utility knife.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.120
You can use it for seafood,
for vegetables, for anything.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.730
What is different on this
knife, as you can see,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.700
it has four different
reflections almost.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.084
Each different reflection is
a different kind of steel.

00:15:15.084 --> 00:15:16.750
So this knife has
four different steels,

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.250
and they are being
pressed together.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.690
By being pressed together,
they're much stronger,

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.880
and they're not getting as dull
as quickly as regular knives.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.050
And on the top here,
you'll see them-- there's

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:26.970
very, very small.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:27.590
You can't really see it.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.331
There's a shiny, but there's
a little bit more shiny

00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:29.914
in the middle.

00:15:29.914 --> 00:15:32.760
The one in the middle,
all the way in the center,

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.000
is the sharpest, hardest
steel of all four of them.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.550
But by having it like this,
you have a really great balance

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.720
when you cut with the knife.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.325
And it stays sharper much
longer than a traditional knife.

00:15:44.325 --> 00:15:46.160
And if you do want
to sharpen it,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.200
you get it sharp
much, much faster.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.281
You pull it over
a steel like this.

00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:53.530
And if you know what you're
doing, you do it this way.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.160
And if you don't,
you do it this way.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.368
And there are many different
ways and all that stuff.

00:15:57.368 --> 00:16:00.080
But with a regular,
cheaper knife

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.310
you can get in the supermarket,
you do this two or three times

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.707
and you have small little
ridges in the knife.

00:16:05.707 --> 00:16:07.540
And, all of a sudden,
when you cut something

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.422
it rips the meat
or the vegetables

00:16:09.422 --> 00:16:10.380
or something like that.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.670
And when you have a really
good, expensive knife,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.370
you can-- and I'm not doing
this just to prove the point.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.180
But you can hit
really hard like that,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.890
and nothing's going
to happen to it.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.170
It stays.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.220
OK.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.910
And I guess the
appetizers are ready.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.580
Whoever's first
please help yourself.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.410
Take a picture of the appetizer.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.290
What it looks like.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.804
And then we're ready to go.

00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:33.220
We got a little
bit more dressing.

00:16:35.692 --> 00:16:36.650
Please help yourselves.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.310
We got forks.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.065
We got napkins.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.460
And then right after that
we'll start the main course.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.920
So you're hungry for more?

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.610
Me too.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.380
Full mouth is a
happy mouth, right?

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.060
Or something like that.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.560
OK.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.235
Next one.

00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:57.670
Next one on our menu,
we have a halibut.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:02.900
And, again, I really believe
in marinating our seafood.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.290
We got a nice, fresh
piece of halibut.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:12.720
And we are going to
use a pixie orange.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.339
They only grow in Ojai.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.470
I don't know if you know that.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:23.069
And they only grow within
the first part of spring.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:28.430
And they have a slight
sour, orangey flavor.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.860
So we got some more lemon juice.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.385
We got this beautiful
pixie flavor.

00:17:39.386 --> 00:17:44.243
And we have some cracked black
pepper and, of course, salt.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.580
And what I like to
use for this one

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.530
is about a tablespoon
of Worcestershire sauce.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.234
Just marinate it a little bit.

00:17:59.234 --> 00:18:00.650
And if you do this
at home you can

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.050
put this in the refrigerator
for about an hour or two.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.380
And just let it rest.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.360
The best thing is like
seafood, or meat, or something,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.980
if you let it slightly come
up to room temperature.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.910
When it's too cold,
it takes too long

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.287
for the outside temperature
to get to the center.

00:18:16.287 --> 00:18:17.870
And by the time it
gets to the center,

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.689
the outside is overcooked.

00:18:19.689 --> 00:18:21.230
So if you have it
at room temperature

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.260
it's very easy for the
steak, for the meat,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.140
or whatever you want to use,
for evenly the temperature

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.260
to develop.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.630
We have just a regular pan here
with some extra virgin olive

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:35.130
oil.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.030
And under normal circumstances,
meaning normal circumstances

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.840
at home or in a
professional kitchen,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.980
I would have a big
baking oven behind me.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.680
I would take the halibut
now, and I would sear it off.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.360
It's not hot yet.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.966
Would sear it off
from all four sides

00:19:03.966 --> 00:19:05.590
because it's kind of
like a square log.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.070
If it's only two sides,
you take from two sides.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.540
And I would finish it in the
oven on the high temperature.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.320
And the best is in
a convection oven

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.260
because the temperature
flows around it.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.230
Keeps the outside
nice, closed up.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.340
The pores can't run out.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.830
And it stays juicy.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.870
All right.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.080
So with this one we're going
to sear off the halibut.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.670
And then in the meantime,
we're going to start something

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.760
where it's called a Hollandaise.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.280
A Hollandaise is a
traditional butter sauce.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.220
And for this particular one,
I am going to use egg yolk.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.806
I use white wine.

00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:53.200
Maybe some hot water.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.465
Then we are going to use
a little bit of Tabasco.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.270
Again a tick of
Worcestershire sauce.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.270
A lemon.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.070
And you will see that once I
have seared off the halibut,

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.410
I'm going to put in
some fresh butter.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.850
The fresh butter, even
though it makes it crispy,

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.350
it keeps it nice and moist.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.640
And we're also going to
put in some fresh thyme

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.190
and a little bit
of fresh oregano.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.790
Why fresh thyme and oregano?

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.260
Because we're having
some potatoes.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.760
These potatoes are
being right now--

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.370
because of time
constraints they're

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.170
being roasted in
the oven right now.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.790
And we're going to season
all of this together.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:48.250
So we have here the egg yolk,
white wine, lemon juice mixed.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.170
And the traditional way
of making a Hollandaise,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.650
you make it with tarragon.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.110
But today we don't
want to do traditional.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.140
We want to use some dill.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:02.319
And because of the application
we use-- bless you--

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:04.110
we're going to use a
little bit of mustard.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.890
So it has a nice color.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.460
And now what I'll do,
I'll put a piece of butter

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.272
in there to let it melt.

00:21:28.272 --> 00:21:29.980
Why I don't put the
butter in right away?

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.930
It's going to burn before.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.810
So that's why I'm going
to sear off the seafood,

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.430
or steak, or poultry,
whatever you like at home,

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.189
with some oil.

00:21:40.189 --> 00:21:41.730
And then you put
the butter in there,

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.430
and it makes it nice and foamy.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.190
And then you want to take a
little bit of fresh thyme.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:50.070
You don't need to
chop the thyme.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:55.441
And you can hear that
really nice crushing sound.

00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:55.940
See?

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.550
And put it a little
bit on this side.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:10.682
And you are ready to
flip the fish over.

00:22:10.682 --> 00:22:12.140
And, again, as I
was saying before,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.240
now would be the time
you put it in the oven.

00:22:19.443 --> 00:22:25.150
And let the temperature
slowly seep through.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.070
Cover it up.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.980
And now work with me.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.764
Zzz.

00:22:29.764 --> 00:22:30.430
Here's the oven.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.710
And put it in.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:31.290
And done.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:31.530
OK.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.190
Good.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.970
All right.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.500
So clean up the oven.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.610
In the meantime, I'm going
to put this on the side.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.930
We're going to start
our sauce Hollandaise.

00:22:48.956 --> 00:22:52.044
Can you give me a
little hot water?

00:22:52.044 --> 00:22:53.393
Hot water.

00:22:53.393 --> 00:22:53.892
Hot water.

00:22:53.892 --> 00:22:55.986
You got some?

00:22:55.986 --> 00:22:57.023
No, not in there.

00:22:57.023 --> 00:22:57.522
Just in a--

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.350
What's important is
with the Hollandaise,

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.990
that you don't take the
egg and the egg white

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.470
and put it straight
on a hot stove.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.887
What's going to happen, it's
going to make scrambled eggs.

00:23:11.887 --> 00:23:13.886
So we want to put a little
bit of water in there

00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:15.540
and make it kind of
like a steam bath.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.525
Then we start whipping
the egg white like this.

00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:30.070
That's the job for apprentices
in the kitchen when they just

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.830
start.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.200
When you give them to make
a Hollandaise with 400 eggs,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.530
it's going to take a few hours.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.184
Well, at that time they
look like your old Governor

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:40.767
Schwarzenegger, or
somebody like that.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.420
So it goes relatively fast.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.826
As soon as the water
is hot it starts--

00:23:51.826 --> 00:23:53.450
and I'll show you
the different stages.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.710
You see, it starts foaming.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.330
And you want to whip the base
of your Hollandaise up to a rose

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.940
And what I mean by a rose--
and I'll show in a second.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.520
You take a wooden spoon or
you take a regular spoon,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.190
and you take the back of the
spoon and you blow on it.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.600
Once you blow on it and it
starts to look like a rose,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.950
that means it has enough cooked
the egg yolk and the egg white.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:20.130
And all the flavors emulsified
enough to receive the butter.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.210
And we use clarified butter.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.820
If you would use regular
butter, straight melted,

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.680
it has too much
water content in it.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.090
And it would break
your Hollandaise.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.140
So what we do, we bring
the butter to a boil

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.880
and let the water, so
to speak, and the milk

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.099
processes sink to the
bottom of the butter.

00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:41.640
You see this?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.920
How thick this got?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.260
How fast?

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.102
All right.

00:24:46.102 --> 00:24:48.310
Now what you want to do is,
you want to take it down.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.166
You don't want to
keep on whipping it

00:24:50.166 --> 00:24:51.915
under too much temperature
because then we

00:24:51.915 --> 00:24:55.790
can still going to end
up with scrambled eggs.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.002
So that's good.

00:24:59.806 --> 00:25:00.306
OK.

00:25:00.306 --> 00:25:06.539
Now I'll show you what it
means blowing into a rose.

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:08.080
And I'm going to
put that spoon back.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.496
I don't want you guys to say,
oh, he's blowing in my food.

00:25:13.225 --> 00:25:14.600
I don't know if
you can see this.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.380
But when you blow it,
it gets these ridges.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.650
And it looks like a rose.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.600
And you see it's
sticking to the spoon.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.110
Now if you use too
much clarified butter,

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.860
it will break.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.372
So what you want
to do is you want

00:25:32.372 --> 00:25:33.580
to either do it by the spoon.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.050
If you're by yourself, you
can do a spoon at a time.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.630
And if you know what you're
doing, you can pour it in.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.515
And your bowl comes to life.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.450
Thank you.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:48.980
Thank you.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.130
Very, very slow.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.820
If you do it too fast your
Hollandaise will break.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.715
And when I say break, it means
the egg yolk and the butter

00:25:56.715 --> 00:25:57.340
won't emulsify.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.410
And it's going to look bad and
taste even worse because you're

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.436
going to have the
grizzle kind of flavor.

00:26:09.436 --> 00:26:10.290
OK.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.520
Now look how cool and
how fast it looks.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.740
It's like the same principle
as you make a mayonnaise.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.300
Except with the
mayonnaise you would

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.490
have cold egg yolks
the traditional way,

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.544
and you use with olive
oil, a little bit of salt,

00:26:22.544 --> 00:26:24.210
pepper, lemon juice,
and all that stuff.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.820
But this one is a
hot sauce, which

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.008
we're using for our halibut.

00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:31.212
Is the fish ready?

00:26:31.212 --> 00:26:32.920
And can you give me
the potatoes, please?

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.440
So as I was saying
before, our magic oven

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.260
just created some
beautiful roasted potatoes.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:47.660
And these are just regular
fingerling potatoes

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.530
you can purchase
in any supermarket.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.550
I just cooked them.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.810
Cut them in half.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.070
And then we have a herb
mix, which is just, again,

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.640
a little bit of
thyme and oregano

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.480
as I started with
in the beginning.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.210
And once they're sliced in
half, after you cook them,

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.090
you can keep them over
night for multiple days.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.325
Or you do like we do.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:09.970
You just heat it up in
the oven as you need it.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.670
And then put that in the
center of your plate,

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.180
or however you want
to make it look.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.740
Very simple.

00:27:29.394 --> 00:27:30.880
I want to show this.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.260
So our Hollandaise is ready.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.810
It has now nicely settled.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.610
And because of the
temperature difference,

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.776
it got a little bit thicker.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.930
That's our halibut.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:04.340
And then we have a few
regular heirloom beets.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.470
Now what's special
about these beets?

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.340
Nothing.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.700
These are just regular beets
you can buy in the supermarket.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.620
And all I did with these beets,
I put them in aluminium foil,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.600
a little bit of salt,
pepper, and maple syrup.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.210
So very simple.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:18.800
You take them.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.841
You put them in the foil.

00:28:19.841 --> 00:28:20.740
Make a little pouch.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.890
And bake them in the
oven until they're done.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.660
When they're done,
you want to peel them

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.454
because when they're hot the
skin comes off really easy.

00:28:28.454 --> 00:28:29.995
Again, I've done
that the day before.

00:28:29.995 --> 00:28:32.800
Or you can do it also the
same time as you cook.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.010
You take them out.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.620
And then just in
the last moment you

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.820
want to put in little
bit of fresh salt,

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.122
a little bit of cracked pepper.

00:28:42.122 --> 00:28:46.841
And just give them a
small little saute.

00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:50.655
And then just place them around.

00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:53.490
So you can see the food
we're cooking today

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.900
is not very difficult to do.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:02.180
But it's very fresh, very
healthy, and very colorful.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.324
Something easy you can do.

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:04.740
If you want to
live super healthy,

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.996
you put another beet there.

00:29:05.996 --> 00:29:07.950
There you go.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.000
And that's it.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.820
That's very simple.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.810
Very quickly done.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.700
And, again, most of this work
you can do the day before,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.800
except your Hollandaise.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.260
You'll do that
fresh a la minute.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.090
Now I'm going to do the
same thing as we did before.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.930
We'll make you a
few sample plates.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.520
The advantage from
fish to seafood

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.280
is you have these
different layers-- flakes.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.899
And if you're not 100%
when a fish is done,

00:29:32.899 --> 00:29:34.190
you can touch it from the side.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.721
You don't necessarily want
to touch it from the top.

00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:38.220
In the meat, you
do it from the top.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.469
And I'll tell you in a second.

00:29:39.469 --> 00:29:42.320
When you touch the seafood
from the side like this

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.760
and the flakes slowly
start to separate--

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.780
you don't want them to
completely fall apart--

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.238
that means your
fish is overcooked.

00:29:48.238 --> 00:29:49.780
Then it's really dead this time.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.780
But you want to have a
little bit of life in it.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.140
So you just touch it.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.900
And as you see, these small
little fish membranes,

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.670
so to speak, are falling apart.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.040
That's the right temperature.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.664
Now with a piece of meat,
with a steak or something,

00:30:01.664 --> 00:30:03.580
you touch it from the
top because obviously it

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.640
doesn't have these
flakes to break apart.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.800
Very simple.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.399
I'll show you.

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:10.190
When you hold your hand
like that-- and you

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.620
can all do it with me.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.740
If you hold your
hand totally relaxed,

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.256
and you press this
part below your thumb,

00:30:17.256 --> 00:30:20.890
that means the cow
is still alive.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.330
Now basically it's rare.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.370
That's how the steak is rare.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.300
So all you need to do now
is no pressure, no nothing.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.841
Just open your hand.

00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:29.340
Just open.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.530
No pressure.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.030
Touch that same area again.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.180
And you feel a bit of
a difference already.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.860
Now it's when the
steak is medium rare.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.060
Now open your hand
as hard as you can.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.400
Really stretch it.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.700
And touch it again.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.950
Now it's medium.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.910
Now you close your
hand like this

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.660
and put a certain
amount of pressure on it

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.460
so that your
fingernails slightly

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.119
dig into the center
of your hand.

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:55.910
And press it again.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.670
You feel the difference now?

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.150
Now it's medium well.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.180
And now you really make a fist
like you want to hit something.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.010
Now it's well done.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.210
Really easy, right?

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.380
So you can do it right here.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.700
And some other people
they do it here.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.532
You can do it also.

00:31:09.532 --> 00:31:11.240
But this is the easiest
way for me to do.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.500
Start from rare all
the way to well done.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.000
Very easy.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.100
So this was rare.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:15.925
This is well done.

00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:17.050
So you just open your hand.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.880
You're medium.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.560
So you're already half there.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.230
Make sense?

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.730
Kind of.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:21.230
OK.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.300
I'm in the Ojai.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.880
And I'm still
counting the month.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.430
I'm at 11 months.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.530
And, like I said before,
I really like it here.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.650
I really hope this
is going to work out.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.170
And my job is
very, very exciting

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.820
because we are--
our food at the Ojai

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.560
is very much driven by
the heart of California.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.159
So as you can see,
all these fresh fruits

00:31:57.159 --> 00:31:59.200
and all these fresh
vegetables and all this stuff

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.550
is relatively easy to cook with.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.980
Many times I've worked
around the world and chefs,

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.370
they have food
and they create it

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.290
into something
else what it's not.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.110
Why make a salmon taste like
a steak if it's a salmon?

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.304
Or whatever.

00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.470
Many times you go into a
fancy restaurant and people

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.560
want to be so creative.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.870
And it's like, let me make a sea
bass with a strawberry sauce.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:18.390
Why?

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.070
Just because you
want to be creative?

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.190
Just because you
want to be different?

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.690
No.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.230
So that's why I love being
in the property I'm in now.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.340
Many of these vegetables,
many of these fruits,

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.840
are being cooked on property.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.712
They grow in this
particular area here.

00:32:29.712 --> 00:32:31.670
And we're just heating
them up and just give it

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.370
a little bit of
additional flavor.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.350
Just make it a
little bit different.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.170
A little bit to maple syrup.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.250
A little bit of honey.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.250
Or a little bit of tangerines.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.890
A little bit of jalapeno.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.990
Which is all in this area.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.948
And it makes it very
different and very unique.

00:32:42.948 --> 00:32:45.094
It gives a very fresh flavor.

00:32:45.094 --> 00:32:46.760
If they're good chefs,
they don't really

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.770
do nothing different.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.080
Well, it's true.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.210
And the reason why
I say that, it's

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.710
all again in the
so-called mise en place.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.250
The mise en place,
I'll do this now

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.170
if I wanted two proportions.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.850
But if you do it in big cruise
ships or big operations,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.100
like when I worked at the
Atlantis or at the Venetian,

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.635
we would still do the
same kind of food.

00:33:08.635 --> 00:33:09.510
You just multiply it.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.070
And everything is larger.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.380
So we don't have one pan.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.450
We have a pot where
you can climb into

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.040
and you can do 600 pieces
of fish at the same time.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.770
Or we have these ovens in
these big operations where

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:25.150
I can cook 600 chicken
breasts in about 15 minutes.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.510
And that's just one oven.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.960
And you have 10 all lined
up next to each other.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.359
So it's a very different thing.

00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:31.650
But it's still the same potato.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:32.615
It's still the same beet.

00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:33.620
It's still the same fish.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.370
It doesn't matter.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.490
It's all coming down to
the preparation time.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.100
How you do it and
when you do it.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.962
Please don't be shy.

00:33:41.962 --> 00:33:42.545
Help yourself.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.610
GEORG PAULUSSEN: I have
some wild strawberries here.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.060
And I'm not going to put the
strawberries in the sauce.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.097
I'd like you to just
taste the strawberries.

00:34:04.097 --> 00:34:05.930
And so I'm going to put
them on the garnish.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.120
They taste very different.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.270
Very unique.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.803
They have a little wild flavor,
but they're extremely sweet.

00:34:10.803 --> 00:34:12.469
And they taste like
strawberries the way

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.110
they used to taste
40, 50 years ago

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.820
when it wasn't so
commercialized.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.486
And when you would
go in a field and you

00:34:18.486 --> 00:34:19.255
would pick your
own strawberries.

00:34:19.255 --> 00:34:20.046
And all that stuff.

00:34:20.046 --> 00:34:22.360
This is really the old style.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.510
100% organic.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.855
Really a delicious flavor.

00:34:25.855 --> 00:34:27.199
So I'd like you to taste these.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.210
These ones here are
not bad strawberries,

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.626
but these are the
strawberries you

00:34:30.626 --> 00:34:32.100
buy in a regular supermarket.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.830
And what we're
doing today, we're

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.340
going to make
spaghetti ice cream.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.270
Now is when you're
supposed to say, ooh.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.780
All right.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.150
OK.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.380
We're there now.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:45.980
Hello.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.179
All right.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:50.530
So I got some honey.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.423
Honey for the honey.

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:53.620
OK.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.840
A little bit of honey.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.360
And maple syrup.

00:35:01.842 --> 00:35:03.050
Let's put some more in there.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:11.710
And put some powdered
sugar in there.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.674
Powdered sugar's good.

00:35:12.674 --> 00:35:13.840
Sugar's good for the nerves.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.336
Especially chefs, they
need a lot of sugar.

00:35:16.336 --> 00:35:18.791
They have a lot of nerves.

00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:19.290
All right.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:19.460
Good.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:19.959
Honey.

00:35:19.959 --> 00:35:22.880
Honey is good.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.600
And some booze.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.819
Yeah, of course.

00:35:26.819 --> 00:35:27.735
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.204
GEORG PAULUSSEN: So this
one is a magic wand.

00:35:35.204 --> 00:35:36.620
Maybe some of you
have it at home.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.000
But if you don't
have it at home,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.541
you just put it in
a regular blender,

00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:41.500
or you chop it up by
hand or something.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:50.690
And you're just making a
fresh strawberry sauce.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:54.966
Now as I was saying before,
it's all about fresh food.

00:35:54.966 --> 00:35:57.446
Fresh and simple and fast.

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.656
There's no cooking involved.

00:36:06.656 --> 00:36:07.980
All natural ingredients.

00:36:19.596 --> 00:36:21.590
That's it.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.190
Very easy.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.350
Fresh strawberry sauce.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:34.150
So now you want to know how
we make spaghetti ice cream.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.320
Spaghetti ice cream.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.204
What do we need for spaghetti?

00:36:37.204 --> 00:36:38.370
We need a good tomato sauce.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.650
Here's our tomato sauce.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.760
We need a good Parmesan cheese.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.350
Parmesan cheese are grated
hazelnuts and walnuts.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:49.360
That's our Parmesan cheese.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.420
Then we need, of
course, ice cream.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.690
And we need whipped cream.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.070
The world I come
from a good ice cream

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.330
doesn't exist without
some whipped cream.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.230
What's cool with
the whipped cream,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:09.010
it has cinnamon and a little
bit of vanilla sugar in there.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.410
And then, you can buy these
in any house ware store.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.411
These are potato ricers.

00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:14.285
They don't cost much.

00:37:14.285 --> 00:37:16.330
They maybe cost, I don't
know, $15 or something.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.427
Say, ooh.

00:37:18.427 --> 00:37:19.260
Ice cream spaghetti.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.680
So you squeezed that out.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.210
And what's really cool making
spaghetti ice cream like this,

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:31.590
is that even though it's
still just vanilla ice cream--

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.240
there's nothing
special about it.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.330
That because you put in
there, it's very fluffy.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.639
It tastes different
because of that alone.

00:37:40.639 --> 00:37:41.430
You have air in it.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.230
And it's going to
melt relatively fast.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:48.970
And now we're going to put
our beautiful delicious tomato

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.637
sauce on there.

00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:51.136
Mm.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:38:00.360
Put a couple of chopped nuts,
which is Parmesan cheese.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.990
And then take a few of these
strawberries around there.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.700
Very simple food for home.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.716
If you want to make it
special, cut the green off.

00:38:11.716 --> 00:38:12.690
I leave the green on.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.200
I need rough edge.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:13.760
I'm a chef.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.137
I need some good stuff.

00:38:15.137 --> 00:38:15.720
And that's it.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.140
Basically very easy to do.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.274
Very quickly to do.

00:38:18.274 --> 00:38:20.690
And I'm going to do the same
thing for you now over there.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.590
I'm going to make some
spaghetti ice cream.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.010
And you can do it any other way.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.510
If?

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.680
You don't like strawberries,
either raspberry,

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.092
or if you do it at a children's
party, you use blackberries.

00:38:31.092 --> 00:38:32.800
You can do all different
kinds of flavors

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.080
and have the creativity
of your guests

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.140
or of your kids come
up what is the sauce.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.660
If it's a blackberry, you
make a black ink fish sauce,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.980
spaghetti, and stuff like that.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.700
It's really cool.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.844
It's a great interaction
with your kids.

00:38:44.844 --> 00:38:45.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.430
GEORG PAULUSSEN: Strawberries,
maple syrup, honey,

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.160
and powdered sugar.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.480
And a little bit of that.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.156
So if the party's
only for you guys

00:38:56.156 --> 00:38:58.530
and you like to spruce it up,
you put a little bit of rum

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.350
in there, or something
else, what makes you smile.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.266
And everything's good.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.140
OK.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.348
Let me make some ice cream
and you guys come forward.

00:39:08.348 --> 00:39:11.490
And we'll be done.

00:39:14.781 --> 00:39:15.280
OK, folks.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.780
That's it.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.232
I hope you had fun.

00:39:17.232 --> 00:39:19.680
And I'll see you
again up the road.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.350
6,000 miles or
something like that.
