00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For this problem, imagine that you're at a gym.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here you are and you're going to get some exercise by lifting weights,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in particular, this 25 kg weight and you're going to lift it at a height of 1 m

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you're just going to keep repeating lifting and lowering the weight to get some exercise.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Assume for this problem that you only do work when you're lifting the weight.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When you lower it, you don't spend any energy and you don't get any energy back either.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's assume you do 2/3 repetitions per second where each repetition

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is one raising and lowering of the weight, and let's assume you are doing a 4-minute workout.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now I want you to tell me how many calories will you burn

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
if 1 calorie is equal to 4200 joules--good luck.
