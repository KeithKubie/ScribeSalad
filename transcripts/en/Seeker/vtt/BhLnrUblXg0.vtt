00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.610
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the U.S. Air Force.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.280
Energy can come from anywhere!

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.069
Food, footwear, even fruit!

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:20.180
And these kids took the time to 
try it.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.670
Renewable energy is a huge issue for the United
States, and other countries.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.650
Fuels based on compressed biomatter are finite
and release millions of tons of carbon emissions.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.940
It's common to think we won't have to deal
with the consequences of dumping all this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.440
pollution into the air, but we've already
started.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.030
I don't know about YOU but when I was a kid,
I was a total environmentalist.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.920
I thought we could cure it all with a little
elbow grease, and it would seem times haven't

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.920
changed.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.310
I was looking through all the finalists of
this year's Google Science Fair and of the

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.340
115 finalist nominated projects -- 15 of them
were all about renewable energy!

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.960
A set of twins from California wanted to help
Greek yogurt companies use their microbes

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.230
to generate power.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.420
Three students from Singapore wanted to capture
excess thermoelectric heat from power planet

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
to generate MORE electricity.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.170
A kid in Indonesia who likes bicycling wanted
to create a power generator following in the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.340
technology of a wind turbine!

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.450
And those are just from the ones I understood!

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.450
There were also two high school kids from
the US who want to maximize solar powered

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.450
photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation using
gold nanostructures, or the girl from Oregon

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.450
whosw research is trying to design a feasible
multijunction quantum dot solar cell by designing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.450
a computer program to track 10 million photons
as they interact with her design.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.000
Seriously, renewable energy is big business
AND big for research and development.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.600
There are kids trying to get electricity from
tomatoes, shoes, pots and pans, floor tiles,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.560
even the bacteria in Kimchi!!

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
YES!

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.020
Kimchi, the fermented cabbage that my old
roommate Joe LOVED.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.380
I don't so much, but it can, apparently, be
useful for energy production.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.890
Their enthusiasm is contagious, and I'm happy
to say that it's not just the kids of today.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.930
For instance, experiments in using algae for
electrical power have been going on since

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.700
the 1970s, around the same time as the first
Earth Day.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
Just last year, the same design and engineering
firm that did the Sydney Opera House completed

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.259
a 15-unit apartment building in Hamburg, Germany
that’s powered by ALGAE stored in tanks

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.520
on the exterior of the structure.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.020
These large sunny windowpane-lined tanks that
line the sun-facing sides of the building

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.739
contain microalgae which converts the sun's
energy into oily lipid molecules and gases

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.450
that can be used to create energy.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.020
The algae tanks bubble with activity throughout
the day and also provide shade from the sun

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.280
for the residents.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.270
Occasionally, excess algae is gathered and
converted directly into biomass for energy.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.600
The apartment building has been operating
now for over a year, and according to a report

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.370
in Fast Company, the residents inside it are
pretty happy.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.430
The point is, the dream of renewable energy
doesn’t die - it just gets better with every

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.430
generation.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.290
One day the kids who entered the Google Science
Fair competition will take their ideas and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.000
future-facing energy solutions to their colleges,
universities and, hopefully, engineering and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
energy firms.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.160
They're going to change the world, I just
know it.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.750
Just like Google, the U.S. Air Force has an
eye on the future, too.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.310
I wanna give a quick shout out to them for
supporting DNews.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.260
The U.S. Air Force is passionate about innovation,
breaking barriers and using science and technology

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.700
to push the limits of what's possible.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.099
They were the first to break the sound barrier
in 1947, and they're still pushing today.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.620
Did you ever invent something?

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.750
A helmet with a magnifying glass holder?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:33.020
A wheelchair that could lift itself up?
