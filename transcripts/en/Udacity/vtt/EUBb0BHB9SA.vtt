00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:07.633
After writing 5,000 lines of code,
I'm finally done.

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:11.110
&gt;&gt; Hey Walter,
salami baguettes for lunch.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.740
Is that your game that
you've been working on?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Let's grab some lunch and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.290
I'll show you the game afterwards.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.470
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:32.470
[MUSIC]

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:38.460
Yeah, I mean it doesn't pretend
to be anything that it's not.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.500
It's salami on baguette, it's awesome.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.860
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.930
&gt;&gt; So, let me show you this
game that I've been working on.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.858
I think you're going to like it.

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:47.289
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.378
&gt;&gt; Wait, hold on a second.

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:53.044
[SOUND] It's crashing.

00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:55.340
I promise you this was
working about 30 minutes ago.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.808
It doesn't even look like any
lines of code have changed.

00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:58.744
What!

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:04.617
[SOUND]
[SOUND]

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:06.423
&gt;&gt; Well, that was a frustrating

00:01:06.423 --> 00:01:08.090
situation.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.160
And this was just a personal project.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.180
But imagine if this had happened while
working on important code at work.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.685
Luckily, these types of
situations can be easily avoided

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.455
using something known
as version control.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:24.625
In this lesson, you'll learn to use Git,
a popular distributed version control

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:28.485
tool to track changes and switch
between different versions of the code.
