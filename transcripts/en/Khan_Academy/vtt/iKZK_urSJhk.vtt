00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.180
- [Instructor] Let's say
that you own the only hotel

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.150
that is in a city, and for
a wide variety of reasons,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.960
maybe all of the city council
members are your friends,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.530
or whatever else, no one else
can build a hotel in the city.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.770
So there are insurmountable
barriers to entry.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.770
So in that situation, you
would have a monopoly.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.100
You are the only player in the market,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.220
and there are very, very
high barriers to entry.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.770
Now, this is a typical cost structure

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.060
and demand curve for a monopoly.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.410
We've already talked
about your marginal cost,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.080
you might dip down a little initially,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.290
but then it might go up.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170
And we could debate
whether that would be true

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.880
for a hotel or not, but this
is the typical model we see.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.990
And then, while your marginal cost

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.020
is below average total cost,
average total cost trends down

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.740
and then hits a minimum point

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.280
where marginal cost intersects it,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.460
and then it starts to trend up

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.480
as marginal cost is higher than that.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.930
And the demand curve for
a monopoly looks familiar.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.820
When the prices are high, if the prices

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.800
on the hotel rooms per night are high,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.510
very few people will demand them.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.040
And if the prices are low, a
lot of folks would demand them.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.170
Now, something that we've talked about

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.460
in a lot of detail in other videos is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.520
how the marginal revenue
curve is different

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.020
than the demand curve for a monopoly.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.130
And that's because, if you
were to charge a price of,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.690
let's say, $500 per
room, you might be able

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.940
to get one room rented out for the night,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.980
but no other rooms.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.150
And if you wanted to get
two rooms rented out,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.990
well, you would have to charge
$400, not just for that room,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.100
so now we'd get a little bit
further down this demand curve.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.410
But when you charge $400
maybe for that second room,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.150
because someone's willingness
to pay is $400, well,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.920
you might have to also charge
$400 for that first room.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.240
So in many monopoly
industries, whatever you charge

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.610
to one consumer you have to
charge to other consumers.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.780
Now, I know what some of you are thinking,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.780
hey, that doesn't always
happen in a hotel.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.210
And that's why I picked this example.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.070
Because we're going to look
at the situation where,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.500
one, you do have to charge
the same to everyone,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.030
and then we'll look at
another situation known

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.950
as price discrimination,
where you don't have

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.860
to charge the same to everyone.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.770
But let's just go with the model

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.360
where you do have to change
the same to everyone.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.430
So when you go from one room
at 500 to two rooms at 400,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.630
your marginal revenue
isn't the incremental 400,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.140
because this 500 is now 400 as well.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.380
So you go from 500 to 800,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.480
so your marginal revenue
is an incremental 300,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.590
as you go from 500 total to
400 plus 400, or 800 total.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.960
And that's why, and we go
into significant detail

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.590
in other videos on this, and we do it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.440
with tables of numbers, and
I encourage you to do that,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.290
that is why your marginal revenue curve

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.840
for a monopoly has twice the
slope, the negative slope,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.360
than your demand curve would have.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.410
So your marginal revenue
curve would look something

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.350
like this, and we've already talked about,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.160
in multiple videos, for any firm,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.640
it's rational to produce the quantity

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.250
where marginal cost is
equal to a marginal revenue.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.560
So this monopoly would
produce this quantity.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.080
And the price they would
get, well, that quantity,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.130
we go to look at the demand curve,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.120
the price would be right over there.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.080
So this monopoly firm would
be able to get that price.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.900
And we can think about what
its economic profit would be.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.673
On every room, in this
case, it charges that price.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.650
And its average total
cost is this blue line

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.210
right over here, so its
average total costs are there.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.930
So the difference is how much
economic profit per room.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.850
And then you multiply that
times the total number of rooms.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.850
And so, this area is the
firm's economic profit.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.990
Now, there is still some
consumer surplus here.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.480
This is benefit that consumers
are getting above and beyond

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.870
what they're paying for it,
so the consumer surplus,

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.970
in this situation, would be all of this.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.740
So that first person who was willing

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.490
to pay maybe $500 per room is now able

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.000
to get this market price
that everyone is able to get,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.230
which is maybe $300 per room.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.520
And so, this benefit for that
one unit goes to the consumer.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.150
And we've also seen that there
is dead weight loss here.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.750
You are allocatively efficient

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.590
when marginal cost is
equal to the demand curve.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.830
And so, we studied that in other videos,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.400
this right over here is
our dead weight loss.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.480
But now, let's imagine the other scenario.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.050
Let's say that we are a
hotel where we try to capture

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.010
as much of someone's
willingness to pay as possible.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.120
And I'll give a little bit
of a idealistic scenario

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.950
that doesn't really
exist in the real world,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.790
but just to look at an extreme case.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.330
Let's say that you were
able to get a computer

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.580
that can read people's minds,
and every time they call

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.610
for a quote on a room, you know exactly

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.210
what their willingness to pay is.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.450
So if I call, the computer says, hey,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.710
Sal's willingness to pay
for that room is $375.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.690
So you quote me, all right,
$375, and I say, okay, sure.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.180
And then, when that first person

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.210
who has a high willingness to pay calls,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.730
it says, okay, why don't
we quote them $500?

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.730
And so we quote them $500,
and so they get that room.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.360
And so, in that situation,
every incremental room,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.250
you don't have to change the
prices on all the other ones,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.290
causing this marginal revenue
curve to slope down faster.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.330
Instead, every incremental
room, you get those dollars.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.010
And so, in that situation,
your demand curve is equal

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.660
to your marginal revenue curve.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.750
You're able to discriminate on prices.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.330
Let me write this, this
is price discrimination.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.630
You're able to charge, and
price discrimination is

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.100
a general term for charging
different customers,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.450
different consumers
different rates, ideally,

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.820
based on their willingness to pay.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.190
And it might sound bad, in normal life,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.410
we don't like discriminating
against others.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.040
But price discrimination
is a very legitimate thing.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.330
And actually, you will see it happen

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.510
in things like the hotel industry,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.610
where they're going to try
to charge different prices

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.110
to different people based
on their willingness

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.290
to pay for essentially the same room.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.860
If you go stay in a
hotel, it's very likely

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.140
that the person in an identical room

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.630
next to you is paying a different rate.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.000
Airlines will also do it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.880
Now, they're not going to be
able to do it as perfectly,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.990
as I just described with
this magical computer,

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.480
but they'll do it where,
depending on how far ahead,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.390
or whether you can return the ticket,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.750
or cancel your reservation,
you could get a different price

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.220
and the prices change over time.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.810
And so, they're trying to capture as much

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.270
of consumers' willingness
to pay as possible.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.630
But if we took this extreme
situation, where you're able

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.140
to charge exactly everyone
their willingness to pay,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.870
well then, what is going
to be the rational quantity

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.820
for this profit-maximizing
monopoly to produce?

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.030
Well, once again, it would be

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.330
where marginal cost
intersects marginal revenue,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.490
but the marginal revenue
curve is now the demand curve.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.530
So it'd be right over
there, that's the quantity

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.220
that this monopoly would produce.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.670
And then, what's the price it would get?

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.380
Pause this video and think about that.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.830
Well, you might be tempted
to just go horizontally here

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.250
and say, okay, this is
the price it would get,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.740
like we did here, but remember,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.690
it's able to get a different
price for every consumer.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.120
So there isn't just one price,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.120
like in this first example,
that everyone is paying.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.380
So we can see the
quantity it is producing.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.730
You can see the average
total cost at that quantity.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.730
But the profit per room
is going to be dependent

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.040
on what people are willing to pay.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.100
This first person is
going to pay a lot for it.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.530
And so, they're not going to get much of,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.360
or they're not going to
get any consumer surplus

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.700
in this extreme example, and so,

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.060
all of this is going
to accrue to the firm.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.960
And that's going to be the case

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.650
for all of these consumers
in this extreme circumstance.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.570
And so, now you have a
fascinating situation.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.830
Notice, when this monopoly firm is able

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.860
to do price discrimination,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.410
now its economic profit is far larger.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.970
Economic profit.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.380
The consumer surplus shrunk
through price discrimination

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.630
in the extreme example, it disappeared.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.680
But you also see that this is

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.880
actually allocatively efficient,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.360
that we are actually
producing at a quantity

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.810
where marginal cost is
equal to marginal revenue.
