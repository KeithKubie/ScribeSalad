00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
 

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.460
I have this article
right here from WebMD.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.049
And the point of this isn't
to poke holes at WebMD.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.590
I think they have
some great articles

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.715
and they have some great
information on their site.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.400
But what I want to
do here is to think

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.740
about what a lot of
articles you might read

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.796
or a lot of research you
might read are implying

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:16.379
and to think about
whether they really

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.370
imply what they
claim to be implying.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.690
So this is an excerpt
of an article,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.550
and the title of the article
says "Eating breakfast

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.180
may beat teen obesity."

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.760
So they're already
trying to create

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.970
this cause-and-effect
relationship.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:40.090
The title itself says if
you eat breakfast then

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.800
you're less likely--
or you won't be obese.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.590
You're not going to be obese.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.790
So the title right there
already sets up this.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.210
That eating breakfast
may beat teen obesity.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.930
And then they tell
us about the study.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.270
"In the study,
published in Pediatrics,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.830
researchers analyzed the
dietary and weight patterns

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.880
of a group of 2,216 adolescents
over a five-year period

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.990
from public schools in
Minneapolis-Saint Paul,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.490
Minnesota."

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.031
And I won't talk
too much about this.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.690
It looks like a
good sample size.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.517
It was over a large
period of time.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.850
I'll just give the researchers
the benefit of the doubt,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.001
assume that it was
over broad audience,

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.250
that they were able to control
for a lot of variables.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.333
But then they go on to
say, "The researchers write

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.480
that teens who ate
breakfast regularly

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.840
had a lower percentage of total
calories from saturated fat

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.220
and ate more fiber
and carbohydrates."

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.652
And to some degree that
first-- "than those

00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:28.610
who skipped breakfast."

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.100
And to some degree this
first sentence is obvious.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.690
Breakfast tends to be
things like cereals, grains.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.890
You eat syrup, you
eat waffles-- that all

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.570
tends to fall in the category
of carbohydrates and sugars.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.830
And frankly, that's not even
necessarily a good thing.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.240
Not obvious to me
whether bacon is

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.330
more or less healthy than
downing a bunch of syrup

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.060
or Fruit Loops or whatever else.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.350
But we'll let that
be right here.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.480
"In addition, regular
breakfast eaters

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.120
seemed more
physically active then

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.517
the breakfast skippers."

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:00.100
So over here they're
once again trying

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.460
to create this other
cause-and-effect relationship.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.050
Regular breakfast eaters
seemed more physically active

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.650
than the breakfast skippers.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.760
So the implication
here is that breakfast

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.817
makes you more active.

00:02:16.817 --> 00:02:18.650
And then this last
sentence right over here,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.760
they say "Over time,
researchers found

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.780
teens who regularly
ate breakfast

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.280
tended to gain less weight and
had a lower body mass index

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.910
than breakfast skippers."

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.340
So you could--
they're telling us

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.390
that breakfast skipping--
this is the implication here--

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.680
is more likely, or it can be a
cause of making you overweight

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.040
or maybe even making you obese.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.450
So the entire narrative here,
from the title all the way

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.930
through every
paragraph, is look,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.570
breakfast prevents obesity.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.240
Breakfast makes you active.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.280
Breakfast skipping
will make you obese.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.530
So you just say then, boy,
I have to eat breakfast.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.571
And you should always
think about the motivations

00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:59.000
and the industries around
things like breakfast.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.374
But the more
interesting question

00:03:00.374 --> 00:03:02.310
is does this research
really tell us

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.840
that eating breakfast
can prevent obesity?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.280
Does it really tell us
that eating breakfast

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.830
will cause some to
become more active?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.160
Does it really tell us
that breakfast skipping

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.570
can make you overweight
or make it obese?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.810
Or, it is more likely,
are they showing

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.730
that these two things
tend to go together?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.640
And this is a really
important difference.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.070
And let me kind of state
slightly technical words here.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.760
And they sound fancy, but
they really aren't that fancy.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.030
Are they pointing
out causality, which

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.820
is what it seems like
they're implying.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.730
Eating breakfast causes
you to not be obese.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.790
Breakfast causes
you to be active.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.650
Breakfast skipping
causes you to be obese.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.500
So it looks like they are
kind of implying causality.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.190
They're implying
cause and effect,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.436
but really what the study
looked at is correlation.

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:53.439
 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.730
The whole point of this is
to understand the difference

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.115
between causality
and correlation

00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:58.990
because they're saying
very different things.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.175
Causality versus correlation.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:04.630
 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.310
And, as I said, causality
says A causes B. Well,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.850
correlation just
says A and B tend

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.400
to be observed at the same time.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.950
Whenever I see B
happening, it looks

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.750
like A is happening
at the same time.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.860
Whenever A is happening,
it looks like it also

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.860
tends to happen with
B. And the reason

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.360
why it's super
important to notice

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.859
the distinction
between these is you

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.920
can come to very,
very, very, very, very

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.400
different conclusions.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.530
So the one thing that
this research does do,

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.390
assuming that it
was performed well,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.810
is it does show a correlation.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.480
So the study does
show a correlation.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.950
It does show, if we
believe all of their data,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.390
that breakfast
skipping correlates

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.981
with obesity and
obesity correlates

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:41.980
with breakfast skipping.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.354
We're seeing it
at the same time.

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:46.330
Activity correlates with
breakfast and breakfast

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.080
correlates with activity--
that all of these correlate.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.790
What they don't say--
and there's no data here

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.080
that lets me know one way or
the other-- what is causing what

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.110
or maybe you have
some underlying cause

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.510
that is causing both.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.930
So for example, they're saying
breakfast causes activity,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.060
or they're implying
breakfast causes activity.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.330
They're not saying
it explicitly.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.860
But maybe activity
causes breakfast.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.899
Maybe.

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.190
They didn't write the study
that people who are active,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.439
maybe they're more likely
to be hungry in the morning.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.332
Activity causes breakfast.

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.290
And then you start having
a different takeaway.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.480
Then you don't say, wait,
maybe if you're active

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.994
and you skip
breakfast-- and I'm not

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:24.160
telling you that you should.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.052
I have no data one way
or the other-- maybe

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:27.260
you'll lose even more weight.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.926
Maybe it's even a
healthier thing to do.

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:29.620
We're not sure.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.860
So they're trying to say,
look, if you have breakfast

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.360
it's going to make
you active, which

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.660
is a very positive outcome.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.460
But maybe you can have
the positive outcome

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.390
without breakfast.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.130
Who knows?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.450
Likewise they say
breakfast skipping,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.770
or they're implying breakfast
skipping, can cause obesity.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.270
But maybe it's the
other way around.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.630
Maybe people who have
high body fat-- maybe,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.100
for whatever reason, they're
less likely to get hungry

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.160
in the morning.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.630
So maybe it goes this way.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.280
Maybe there's a causality there.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.120
Or even more likely,
maybe there's

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.760
some underlying cause that
causes both of these things

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.590
to happen.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.097
And you could think of a bunch
of different examples of that.

00:06:07.097 --> 00:06:08.555
One could be the
physical activity.

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:10.867
 

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:12.200
And these are all just theories.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.158
I have no proof for it.

00:06:13.158 --> 00:06:15.010
But I just want to
give you different ways

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.500
of thinking about the same
data and maybe not just coming

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.421
to the same conclusion that
this article seems like it's

00:06:21.421 --> 00:06:22.670
trying to lead us to conclude.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.600
That we should eat breakfast if
we don't want to become obese.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.620
So maybe if you're
physically active,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:35.150
that leads to you being
hungry in the morning,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.970
so you're more likely
to eat breakfast.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.180
And obviously being
physically active

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.930
also makes it so that
you burn calories.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.060
You have more muscle.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.460
So that you're not obese.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.850
 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.080
So notice if you
view things this way,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.166
if you say physical activity
is causing both of these,

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.040
then all of a sudden
you lose this connection

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.850
between breakfast and obesity.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:04.460
Now you can't make the
claim that somehow breakfast

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.100
is the magic formula for
someone to not be obese.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.524
So let's say that there
is an obese person-- let's

00:07:09.524 --> 00:07:11.940
say this is the reality, that
physical activity is causing

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.260
both of these things.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.120
And let's say that there
is an obese person.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.442
What will you tell them to do?

00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:18.400
Will you tell them, eat
breakfast and you won't

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.790
become obese anymore?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.460
Well, that might
not work, especially

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.080
if they're not
physically active.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.040
I mean, what's going
to happen if you

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.250
have an obese person who's
not physically active?

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.644
 

00:07:30.644 --> 00:07:32.310
And then you tell
them to eat breakfast?

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.080
Maybe that'll make things worse.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.160
And based on that,
that the advice

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.510
or the implication from the
article is the wrong thing.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.240
Physical activity
maybe is the thing

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.540
that should be focused on.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.650
Maybe something other
than physical activity.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:53.060
Maybe you have sleep,
maybe people who sleep late

00:07:53.060 --> 00:08:01.270
and they're not
getting enough sleep,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.937
maybe that leads to obesity.

00:08:02.937 --> 00:08:05.270
And obviously, because they're
not getting enough sleep,

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.978
they wake up as late
as possible and they

00:08:06.978 --> 00:08:08.680
have to run to the
next appointment--

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.600
or they have to run to school
in the case of students--

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.308
and maybe that's why
they skip breakfast.

00:08:12.308 --> 00:08:15.320
 

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.580
So once again, if you
find someone that's obese,

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.812
maybe the rule here isn't
to force a breakfast

00:08:20.812 --> 00:08:21.520
down your throat.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.519
Maybe it will become even
worse because maybe it

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:26.330
is the lack of sleep that's
causing your metabolism

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.950
to slow down or whatever.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.342
So it's very, very
important when

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.550
you're looking at any of
these studies to try to say,

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.450
is this a correlation
or is this causality?

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.951
If it's correlation, you cannot
make the judgment that, hey,

00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:39.366
eating breakfast is necessarily
going to make someone less

00:08:39.366 --> 00:08:39.960
obese.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.340
All that tells you is that
these things move together.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.290
A better study would be one
that is able to prove causality.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.080
And then we could think of
other underlying causes that

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.077
would kind of break down the
narrative that this piece is

00:08:54.077 --> 00:08:54.660
trying to say.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.890
I'm not saying it's wrong.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.070
Maybe it's absolutely
true that eating breakfast

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.350
will fight obesity.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.000
But I think it's equally or more
important to think about what

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.800
the other causes
are, not to just make

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.820
a blanket statement like that.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.030
So for example,
maybe poverty causes

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.540
you to skip breakfast
for multiple reasons.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.700
Maybe both of your
parents are working.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.500
There's no one there
to give you breakfast.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.040
Maybe there's more
stress in the--

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.330
who knows what it might be?

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.264
And so when you
have poverty maybe

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:25.180
you're more likely to
skip breakfast and maybe

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.040
when there's poverty,
and maybe you

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.717
have two-- both your
parents are working

00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:31.300
and the kids have to make their
own dinner and whatever else--

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:38.990
maybe they also eat less
healthy at all times of day

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.790
and then that leads to obesity.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.720
So once again in this
situation, if this

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.900
is the reality of things,
just telling someone

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.820
to also eat breakfast regardless
of what that breakfast is, even

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.050
if it's Fruit Loops
or syrup, that's

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.170
probably not going to
help the situation.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:59.130
Maybe it's just eating
unhealthy dinners

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.130
is the underlying cause.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.380
 

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.897
And if you eat an unhealthy
dinner maybe by breakfast time

00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:08.480
you're not hungry
still because you've

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.180
binged so much on breakfast.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.490
So you skip breakfast.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.180
And this also leads to obesity.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.590
But once again, if this
is the actual reality,

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.480
doing the advice that
that article's saying

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.730
might actually be a bad thing.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.120
If you need an unhealthy
dinner and then

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.250
force yourself to eat a
breakfast when you're not

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.717
hungry, that might make
the obesity even worse.

00:10:28.717 --> 00:10:30.300
So the whole point
of this video isn't

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.270
to say that the implications
from that article

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.900
are necessarily wrong.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.980
The important thing is to just
realize that it might be wrong.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.580
And that just because you saw
this correlation with the data,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.960
it doesn't mean that
eating breakfast is going

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.000
to somehow magically
fight obesity.
