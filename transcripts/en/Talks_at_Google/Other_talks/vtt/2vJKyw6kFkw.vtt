DACHER KELTNER:
Thank you, Jessie.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.800
One of the great privileges
of writing a book

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.600
is you get to go out
and speak to all kinds

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.740
of interesting audiences.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.870
And I love coming to Google.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.930
I should also let
you know that I

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.190
think a lot of the
thinking about what power

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.140
is in the 21st century, which
is at the heart of the book,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.980
comes from experiences I've
had consulting here at Google

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.119
and working on projects
in Facebook and elsewhere.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.940
So it's a great
privilege to be here

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.706
and to share this science
and these ideas with you.

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.330
I want to tell you
a brief story that I

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.100
came to when I was writing
the "Power Paradox"

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.370
that-- you're a young
audience, and it'll

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.750
be a little hard to imagine.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.540
But I think you'll
appreciate this.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.750
In 1970, my parents
did something

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.090
that no parent would
do in their right mind

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.590
today in today's
21st century, which

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.560
is my mom had just
gotten her PhD from UCLA,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.360
and we were living in Laurel
Canyon, where the schools are

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.510
good and the kids are
healthy, and everybody's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.460
going to college.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.500
And it was a really
strong community,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.090
as you might imagine from
that part of the world.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.900
And she got a professor job at
Sacramento State University.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.910
And so she moved us to the
foothills of the Sierras

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.050
in 1970, where we moved my
family to the poorest town

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.830
in probably the poorest county
in the state of California.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.770
And I moved there
with my brother Rolph.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.770
And in many ways, it was sort
of a Huck Finn, Mark Twain type

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.350
existence.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.130
We had a pond and five acres
and ran around in the fields

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.620
and got into trouble
with my friends.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.270
But I noticed something that
I couldn't make sense of it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.620
in 1970 when I was 10 years old.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.340
And I started to come
to make sense of it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.339
when I wrote the book
"The Power Paradox," which

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:04.180
is that people in
my neighborhood,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.300
although preternaturally
warm and kind and there

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.870
was always a spot
at the dinner table

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.020
and the parents were
working very hard,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.250
the people of that
neighborhood were dying young.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.240
If you start at
the top of the road

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.140
that I grew up on, where
there were only nine homes,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.660
the first home on the right
looked like Appalachia.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.880
The floorboards in
the kitchen were gone.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.190
The dad was out of work.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.030
The dad died really young.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.280
The boy came over to our swing,
our rope swing in our backyard,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.430
and dozens of kids
had jumped off

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.627
that rope swing
thousands of times.

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:45.460
And one of the first
times he jumped off it,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.390
he landed funny on his arm.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.590
His arm snapped in half.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.240
We now know that
as something called

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.940
child frailty
syndrome that tends

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.680
to run in really poor families.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.360
If you go across the
street there's this house,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.380
and we never saw who
lived in that house.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.240
It was like Boo Radley
in that famous book.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.460
And I later learned that the guy
who lived there had something

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.500
called agoraphobia.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.041
And I learned this
in graduate school

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.620
at Stanford, which is
the paralyzing anxiety

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.130
of going outdoors.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.860
You go down two street
houses, it was my best friend

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.520
[? Memo ?] [? Compos ?].

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.930
His sister had leukemia.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.320
His dad got cancer in
his 60s, killed himself

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.419
because he didn't want
to die a death of cancer.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.460
Go a couple houses down,
there are three families

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.100
from Oklahoma.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.130
One of the moms died in her 40s.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.630
Another dad died in his 60s.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.700
And when I grew up
in this neighborhood,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.460
at the time I just thought,
this is my crazy neighborhood.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.470
This is rural life.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.690
This is Penryn, California.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.960
And what I didn't
know and now we

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.410
know with increasing certainty,
with the science that I report

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.000
on in "The Power Paradox,"
is that these people

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.330
were dying because of the
effects of powerlessness,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.380
that they were
marginalized in society.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.090
As a very poor rural people,
no one went to college.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.610
A lot of kids
ended up in prison.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.040
And that force in
society was compromising

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.200
their nervous systems.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.829
And what I'll talk to you about
is an intellectual journey

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.530
that finally got me to
some preliminary answers

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.490
to understanding why my
neighbors were suffering

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.960
such unusual fates.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.440
And that's what I summarized
in "The Power Paradox."

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.260
It's really interesting.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.520
As Jesse said, 25 years ago,
I'd been thinking and studying

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.880
power in every imaginable
context for the past 25 years.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.200
And it's safe to
say, 25 years ago,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.070
not only in the social
biological sciences,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.100
but also in the
United States culture,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.580
we were blind to
power differences.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.690
We thought US
citizens, 25 years ago,

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.100
thought we lived in
a power-free society.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.000
We're all middle class.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And we're all moving
fast up to the top.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.630
That was kind of the
standard American myth

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.190
of the nature of hierarchy.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.530
And if you look at the
social sciences, which

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.960
I was raised in,
of economic theory,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.040
biological science, social
psychology and the like,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.550
there was very little
systematic discussion of power.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.120
Political scientists,
very interested in power.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.580
Sociologists were
interested in social class.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.090
But for the most
part, my discipline

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.870
had nothing to say about the
hierarchical dimension of life.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.550
When I began this work, I
was struck by this quote

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.690
by Bertrand Russell
in 1938, when fascism

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.620
was on the rise in Europe.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.990
And the great mathematician
said, "the fundamental concept

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.000
in social science is
power, just as energy

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.080
is the fundamental force
or concept in physics

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.690
that defines the relationships
between objects."

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.510
And he said that all
social relationships

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.392
are shaped by power as the
first principle of organization.

00:06:10.392 --> 00:06:12.600
I didn't want to believe
that when I was a young guy.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.860
I thought we would live in
a kind of an egalitarian

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.680
world of power-free dynamics.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.310
Today we know this to
be fundamentally true,

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.550
that romantic partnerships--
many of you will have kids.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.790
Jessie is soon to have a kid.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.970
She's probably believing,
rather naively,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.830
that this will be
pure love and freedom

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.100
and intimate
transcendent connection.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.517
That's true.

00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:37.600
But you are going to have
a lot of power struggles

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.891
with that person inside of you.

00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:44.710
So we now know that a
lot of maternal diseases

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.100
are based on power struggles
between the developing

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.730
fetus and the mom.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.800
They're competing
over resources that

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.310
predicts things like diabetes.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.630
Bertrand Russell got it right.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.770
And that really is what I
do in "The Power Paradox,"

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.630
is say, if this is the basic
medium, what are the laws?

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.390
What are the
principles of power?

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:12.220
And in the book, I provide
20 principles that really

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.200
relate to five questions.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.820
What is power?

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.060
How do we get it?

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.980
How do we get it, be
it in US politics,

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.380
at Google, if you're
a seventh grader

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.990
and you're dealing with the
rawest of power politics, which

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.490
is the grammar
school playground?

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.560
In power dynamics with
your children and kids,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.430
how do we get it?

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.090
Does power corrupt?

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.500
Regrettably, I think it corrupts
almost every human being.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.350
What makes for strong
social systems?

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.110
I'll just give you a kind of
a glance at that thinking.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.940
But things like
reputation really matter.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.940
And then we return
to the thinking

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.430
of the social
biological sciences,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:02.170
which is, how do we think about
the problems of today, right?

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.990
Syrian refugees, white
people in the United States

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.940
living shorter lives
than their parents

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.190
live-- white poor people--
the intractable problem

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.256
of poverty and that.

00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:16.380
How do we think about it
through the lens of power?

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.110
And I'll tell you
some answers to that.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.730
So what is power?

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:26.020
So when I dove into
the literature,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.640
and this is a lot of smart
people writing about power,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.970
the consensus would be
that power is force.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.970
It's asymmetric force, right?

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.679
So historians write about power
as like we invent gunpowder

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.120
and we get this
asymmetric advantage.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.420
In economic thinking, it's power
is really asymmetric capital

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.600
or asymmetric information.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.260
You can think about it in
political science as force

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.010
through political
voice and the like.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.940
And so there was this
sense in the literature

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.600
that powers might enforce
an advantage over others.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:09.290
But that analysis doesn't
square with history or counter

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.040
examples.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.760
So let me give you
two of my favorites

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.440
that are part tongue in cheek.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.840
Take the average
American citizen

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.670
and think about who has more
influence over that person's

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.530
nervous system, Joe
Biden, our Vice President,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.432
or Taylor Swift, the pop star?

00:09:27.432 --> 00:09:28.140
Who do you think?

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.680
When I posed this question
recently to government

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.231
officials from Hong Kong, they
were like Joe Biden, like who?

00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:40.230
Taylor Swift-- oh!

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.580
My daughter-- and
this is actually

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.940
a really serious point,
very relevant to the power

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.720
of Google, that power
scholars are making,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.790
which is the idea of force as
power doesn't account for what

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.530
Joseph Nye at Harvard called
"soft power," which is today,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.360
in our information-dense
world, the power of ideas

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.050
and art and the written word and
concepts stacks up very clearly

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.080
with the more traditional forms
of power-- who has capital?

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.010
Who has the biggest guns?

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.850
Soft power has
risen dramatically.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.180
The idea that power is about
just about force and might

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.580
doesn't account for this
photograph right here.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.780
These are my two daughters in
a younger state of existence.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.070
We were in Zion National Park.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.830
And you can do this
amazing bike ride in Zion.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.390
It's eight miles.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.220
There are no cars.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.460
You go through the canyons.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.580
It is sublime.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.940
And being a psychologist,
I had this great scheme

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.840
because they were protesting,
and you'll learn about that.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.830
I was like, all right,
for every 500 pedals,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.550
I'll give you a handful of M&amp;Ms.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.060
So we're off.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.750
Their faces are
covered in chocolate.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.910
And I was like, no more M&amp;M's.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.860
And these are the facial
expressions that I encountered.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.010
Who won that negotiation?

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.850
They did, right?

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.580
I mean, like, I was kidding.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.060
Here are the keys to the car.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.730
Have fun.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.270
Credit cards on you.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.080
But we are
necessarily, and really

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.850
a first task of the
book, and I hope

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.620
it's relevant to your guys'
thinking about the work

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.700
that you do, is
to really broaden

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.530
what we mean by power, right?

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.070
And I think, thanks to
the Googles and Facebooks

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.950
and Twitters and other forms of
technology, our sense of power,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.770
the real action of power, has
broadened dramatically, right?

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.110
And so how I define
power is, and this really

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.870
dovetails with other
people, is power

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.020
is your capacity to alter
the state of another person.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.800
The state of that
person could be

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.420
conceptual, knowledge, emotion.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.370
It could be economic,
political, physical health.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.700
It's about altering
the states of others.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.010
When you broaden out
and you move away

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.940
from capital and military
might, you suddenly

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.760
have insight into how
history changes, right?

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.860
So these are some of
my favorite examples

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.580
that I write about in
"The Power Paradox."

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.960
This is incredible.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.770
In the 17th century and 18th
century, 3/4 of the world

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.240
were slaves and literally,
technically slaves.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.740
It was the central
economic structure

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.550
of the European economy is
slavery and the famous slave

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.290
trade.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.930
Well, this guy right
here, Thomas Clarkson,

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.260
probably most of you don't know
about, was a college student,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.180
and he wrote an essay.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.690
He started hearing about
slavery, and he wrote an essay.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.830
No one knew about slavery
at the time in Europe.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.760
It won this contest.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.310
He's 19 years old.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.440
It gets passed on to
the abolitionists.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.410
He then finds his way--
no Google searches--

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.450
to start finding information
about the nature of slavery.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.790
He went to the docks
in England and learned

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.090
about the conditions
in the slave ships,

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.820
and then led a
political movement

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.160
that overturned slavery.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.210
And 3/4 of the
world's population

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.890
changed and the economic
structures of the time--

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.440
from an essay, right?

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.470
We take a lot of pride in
the civil rights movement,

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.820
the free speech movement,
the protest movements that

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.130
flowed out of that
radical shifts in history,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.250
when you think about it.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.880
And it really can be
traced back to Ella Baker

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.790
and her organizing work that no
one knows about in the South.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.120
That her basic
social influence led

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.970
to these important
political influences.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.940
Here's another great one.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.070
There is no more
significant influence

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:03.100
on human arrangements--
sexual arrangements-- probably

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.590
in human history,
I'm talking this

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.870
beats the bible and
any religious decree,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.280
which was the invention
of the birth control pill.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.820
The birth control pill was
led by Margaret Sanger.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.970
She got this crazy
Harvard biologist

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.000
who got thrown out
of Harvard-- Pincus.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.100
They started testing
hormones and its effects

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.150
on the cycle, led to the pill.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.990
Before the pill, the
average American woman

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.380
had six children,
seven children.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.350
It compromised her life
expectancy and her way

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.590
of being in the world.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.410
After the pill, 2.3, right?

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.270
Radical shift by a
simple technology.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.320
So when we broaden out
our definition of power,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.090
we suddenly get all
this new insight

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.670
into how the world really
changes, right, as opposed

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.090
to just capital and the like.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.380
Question two, how
do you get power?

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.540
It's one of these
age-old questions.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.240
And when I started my research--
and it's interesting power.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.360
How we get power
in organizations

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360
like Google or
other places I teach

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.830
has changed in the last 30
or 40 years for the better.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.850
You probably have a
lot of hypotheses why.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.940
But when I started this
research 20 or 30 years ago,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.950
and I'd pose the question,
how do you get power,

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.540
people were like,
oh, I got the answer.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.360
It's the Machiavellian
answer of it's

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.850
better to be what than what?

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.200
It's better to be feared than
loved-- classic Machiavellian

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.170
phrase.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.090
That's Niccolo Machiavelli.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.840
He has a rather
mischievous-looking smile,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.336
if you carefully analyze it.

00:15:48.336 --> 00:15:49.960
He looks a little
bit like he's pulling

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.150
the wool over people's eyes.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.800
And there's some question
about the intentions

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.630
of his intellectual work.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.010
Has anybody read "The Prince?"

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:03.580
Excellent.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.310
That's amazing.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.970
And that attests
to Wikipedia, when

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.710
I checked this,
when I wrote this,

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.230
ranks "The Prince" as like
the 32nd most influential book

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.286
in human history.

00:16:16.286 --> 00:16:17.910
It's probably the
most influential book

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.240
on power ever written.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.820
It was bedside
reading of Mussolini.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.950
Hitler was very much
influenced by it.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.090
Shakespeare had
characters that were

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.830
built on "The Prince,"
almost a contemporary of him.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.970
There are major schools of
political thought in the United

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.072
States-- I will
not tell you who--

00:16:38.072 --> 00:16:42.090
who adhere to a Machiavelli
philosophy of power,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.560
how you get power.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.470
And that philosophy--
and it's worth

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.760
a little historical context.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.810
Machiavelli wrote "The Prince."

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.810
He was a Florentine politician.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.040
He got kicked out when the
Medicis returned and was

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.860
isolated in his
second home, and wrote

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.040
"The Prince" after visiting
his mistress every day.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:12.470
And it is-- some
books, a lot of books,

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.450
are useful during a
particular historical period

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.470
and outlive their reason.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:23.230
And Machiavelli's Italy--
I suspect a lot of you

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.609
have been to Italy, and
it's this beautiful place,

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.040
where rolling hills and medieval
villages, and you drink wine,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.490
and you feel more kind-hearted
and loving than you've ever

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.990
felt in your life.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.030
During Machiavelli's period,
historians rank Italy,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.280
it's probably the most
violent place that

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.450
ever existed in human history.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.950
It would put the
Mexican drug cartels

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.150
to shame in terms of just
raw violence and power.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.560
And it's a theory of how you get
power in very violent settings.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.650
Here are some random
contemporary translations

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.690
of power from the
Machiavellian perspective.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.500
This is from a bestselling book.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.620
Law number three,
conceal your intentions.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.010
Law number six, court
attention at all costs.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.350
Make sure everybody you lead
is always thinking about you.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.570
Law number 12, use selective
honesty and generosity

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.150
to disarm your victims, right?

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.890
Sort of, use goodness
to-- and then,

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.840
what the heck, law number
15, crush everything totally,

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.310
right?

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.040
And this is a massively
influential theory

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.650
of how you get power.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.820
There are Machiavellians
everywhere I go.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.164
They're usually about one
out of eight or 10 people.

00:18:39.164 --> 00:18:40.830
For a little extra
money, I can tell you

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.970
who's a Machiavellian in
your midst, but I'm kidding.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.640
But in general, it fails today.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:54.940
And I spend time in "The Power
Paradox" talking about this.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.340
There's a pretty deep
literature on this

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.670
I got a little obsessed with.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.710
I have a whole unpublished
chapter on this.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.190
It tends to be a strategy people
prefer who are disenfranchised

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.660
in social networks.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.050
Like I feel on the
outs, I endorse

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.070
Machiavellian
strategies, which kind of

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.170
makes you wonder about
American politics.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.340
It will work in a
really violent contexts,

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.860
and it does work a little
in short-term interactions.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.340
If I get together with a
group, and I'm manipulating

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.370
and I'm deceptive and
I'm pitting people

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.770
against each other, and
behind people [INAUDIBLE],

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:37.100
I'm like putting other people
down, I'll gain a little.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.420
I'll be noticed and
have some influence.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.490
But over time, people
catch on to you.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:47.080
And then there are all sorts
of data showing that it fails.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.100
The most basic and
relevant to you

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.640
is we can find Machiavellians.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.825
We measure them.

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:55.450
And when you look at how they're
doing, they're not doing well.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.620
They don't have status.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.830
They don't have power.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.820
They're on the outs
in social networks.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.970
They are not happy.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:03.890
They're paid less.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.700
They have a lower rank.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.970
We did a study,
recently published,

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:16.210
where we coded the social
strategies of US senators

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.620
from their C-SPAN
registered speeches.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.490
We actually coded their
non-verbal behavior.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.480
And you can identify, if
you look carefully enough,

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.790
Machiavellians who actually
laugh at people's suffering

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.596
rather explicitly.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:35.348
They're like, those poor
immigrants, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:20:35.348 --> 00:20:40.770
We can code narcissism by
facial expressions that

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.730
show a lot of self-love, that
might remind you of today's

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.820
political candidates.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.450
Here's one we identified.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.642
Narcissism looks like--

00:20:49.642 --> 00:20:50.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.710
I kid you not.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.140
Then when that candidate
came became popular,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.320
I was like, oh my god.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.030
And what we find is
Machiavellian narcissists get

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.720
disrespected by their
peers in the Senate

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.090
and get less support for
the bills they advocate.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.270
The senators who are more
courageous and humane

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.110
get greater support.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.770
This is really interesting.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.110
Historians are now
analyzing protest movements.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.470
Some protest movements
are really Machiavellian.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.930
They're violent and
have dramatic forms

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.370
of torture and the like.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.140
Others are more
collaborative, build up

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.510
big audiences, gatherings
in the streets.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.640
And the more collaborative
ones are much more

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.520
likely to gain power across
cultures in historical context.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:45.700
So this philosophy, I really
feel, and a lot of historians

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.660
agree, is trending downward
as a means of influence.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.260
So how do we get influence?

00:21:52.260 --> 00:22:01.630
And this is where the
little bit of Berkeley

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.930
suffuses my thinking.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:03.860
I apologize.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:11.530
But very simply, and I'll
give you a few examples,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.380
we get power by advancing
the greater good.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.670
That your ability to have
enduring influence in the world

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.600
is most directly
dependent on advancing

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.480
the welfare of social networks.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.370
Hannah Arendt, who's a brilliant
philosopher, who came out--

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.140
and some of her
writings, controversial,

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.360
are some of the best on power.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.970
And she saw it firsthand.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.800
She was in Germany, interviewed
and interrogated by the SS,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.000
lost family, moved
to the United States,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.640
knew about authoritarianism,
went through the McCarthy era.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.410
She said, look, your
power is in your ability

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.020
to stir your social network.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.840
And I think that
nailed it in terms

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.150
of how you gain and keep power.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.430
So as a social psychologist,
I'm interested in, well,

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.560
what are the face-to-face
things you can do that advance

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.860
the interests of others?

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.896
And I'll just show
you a few things that

00:23:11.896 --> 00:23:13.270
may seem
counter-intuitive, but I

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.220
could bore you with the
data that support this.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.110
People who share resources
rise in social networks.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.180
It's now replicated
a lot of contexts.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.210
Mike Norton at Harvard
is working on that.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.751
People who are really
good listeners,

00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:30.740
and I'll show you some data,
are very good at keeping power.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.590
People who routinely
spread gratitude,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:38.800
tell good stories gain in the
ranks of the organizations

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.950
that they work in.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:48.470
So a couple of findings that are
relevant to this-- this really

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.690
says it all-- Abe Lincoln
is ranked as our greatest

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.450
president with the
most enduring legacy,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.970
and he was an unusual
guy-- didn't come

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.460
from a fancy background,
poor, really tall,

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.730
wore funny clothes.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.140
Historians are kind
of pondering why

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.250
he had such a profound
influence compared

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.420
to his rivals of the day.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.370
And Thurlow Weed, who was
a journalist at the time,

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.130
really got it right that,
and I love this phrase,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.820
"he sees all who goes there,
hears all they have to say,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.650
talks freely with everybody,
and reads whatever's

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:33.930
written to him" He was a genius
at knowing other people's minds

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:38.860
and just always gathering
out information and guiding

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.450
the complicated politics
he navigated through.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.600
Charles Darwin, the most
influential scientist

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.810
in human history, same
thing-- he compulsively

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.480
was interested in what
other people thought.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.490
And most of his
great insights came

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.060
from learning from other people.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.680
He learned about evolution from
working-class pigeon breeders,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.490
who most people
wouldn't talk to.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.670
He went out and discovered
they were experimenting

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.790
in natural selection.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.050
So this as a little side note.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.700
So one way we gain power is
just respecting and embracing

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.100
other people's emotions.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.330
Who here is in a
management position?

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.000
I've taught thousands
and thousands

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.460
of managers, and the surprising
thing about management--

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.460
what's the hardest
part of your job?

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.050
Other people, right?

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.867
Suddenly, you're a
manager and it's like,

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:38.450
wow, they're telling you about
all the problems in their lives

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.757
and all the stresses at work.

00:25:40.757 --> 00:25:41.590
Maybe not at Google.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.210
But it's just part of life.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:49.210
And so one part of the
empathetic way to power

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.500
is something that
I had the privilege

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.050
of being part of is what is
revealed in this great film

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.270
"Inside Out" at Pixar.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.080
I was a scientific
consultant on it

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.510
with Pete Doctor the director.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.530
The central message,
the wisdom--

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.130
you should be listening,
Jessie-- of these two parents,

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.310
because you will indeed have a
pre-teen some day in your life,

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.640
is they just embrace
the hard stuff

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.990
and they're empathetic, right?

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.140
They take on the tough
stuff of Riley's life.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.790
When I asked Berkeley undergrads
what they thought of "Inside

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.770
Out" last year, when we
were talking about it

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.260
in my emotion class, I have
this student who's a veteran.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.210
He was homeless.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.130
He's a brilliant guy.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.990
He's going to med school now.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.179
He's got piercing
all over, tattoos.

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:39.970
He raises his hand.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.470
He's like, it was the darkest
film I've ever seen in my life,

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.070
man.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.672
And the great thing
about these parents,

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:49.380
with some little
glitches here and there,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.730
is they kind of embrace hard
stuff, like fear and sadness.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.960
And we know if you're
empathetic, work

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.550
by James Gross at
Stanford, elsewhere,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.150
even just like saying,
wow, this is a fearful time

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.850
or this is uncertain,
calms people down

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.230
just through various interesting
processes in the brain.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.130
Just being empathetic
calms people down.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:21.110
We know that if
you are mindfully

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:25.320
accepting of difficult,
stressful times,

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:31.040
in this particular graph, you
yourself feel less stress,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.530
the more that you're just
embracing stresses of life.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.240
And you also show a
better immune profile

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.240
in the inflammation response.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.455
So empathy is part
of gaining power.

00:27:43.455 --> 00:27:47.900
A couple final points on gaining
power, this pro-social side

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:54.690
to it, this sums up a lot of
the thinking about how good acts

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.250
in organizations actually,
perhaps counter-intuitively,

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.790
get you power.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.390
And I'm happy to take
questions on this.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:07.450
And it really
summarizes this big part

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.620
of "The Power Paradox."

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.780
Let me work through a
little diagram here.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.380
So imagine at work
here at Google,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.920
Maria expresses
gratitude to Samir.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.990
She's like, thanks for helping
me out on that project.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.160
Well, what we know,
which is fascinating,

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.240
is pro-social acts, like
gratitude, sharing resources,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.330
giving your time,
cooperating with others,

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:38.720
actually activates,
in separate studies,

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.230
a very important
region of your brain,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:45.120
the reward circuit, that starts
in the ventral tegmental,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.580
produces dopamine.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.210
That dopamine projects
to your prefrontal cortex

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.300
and helps you do things
in the environment.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.800
What's remarkable
is the brain is

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.410
wired to make us
feel good about doing

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.630
good things for other people.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.920
That to me, that's stunning.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.900
But then the story
continues, which

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.560
is if Maria's
expressing gratitude,

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.220
she takes delight in
this pro-social act.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.300
And then we know, work by
Nicholas Christakis and James

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:19.090
Fowler and others, if
Samir has been appreciated,

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.550
in his next interaction, he's
going to be more cooperative.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.060
And there are amazing
studies showing

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.570
if I am generous
to Jessie, she's

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.920
19% more generous in
her next interaction.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.970
And then those people
are 7% more generous

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.940
in their next
interaction, right?

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.350
Good stuff spreads
much more virally

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:44.010
through social networks
than bad stuff,

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:45.800
producing greater pro-sociality.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.730
And then I have a section
in "The Power Paradox"

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.220
about how we develop really
positive reputations.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.070
Your power is only as
good as your reputation.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.080
We spend a lot of
money on things

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.620
that relate to our reputation.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.630
And your reputation is rooted
in are you producing good things

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.580
for the group, right?

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.320
Are you not undermining people?

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.210
Are you advancing the
welfare of others?

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.070
And then that process of
having a good reputation

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.950
leads to other people
thinking highly of Maria.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.880
And that motivates subsequent
pro-social behavior.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.690
It's this amazing cycle
that promotes your power.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.250
Now, I've tested these
ideas in different ways

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.280
in lab studies and the like.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.900
And one of the ways
in which I tested

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.410
this to see if kind
of pro-social acts

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.030
makes teams better and
you enjoy better power

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.830
is with a rather
strange experiment

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.230
we did on the National
Basketball Association.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.480
It's not really an experiment.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.430
It was a study.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:54.675
And whether really doing
encouraging forms of touch,

00:30:54.675 --> 00:30:56.300
encouraging people
for their good play,

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.500
makes teams better players.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.510
So I've always marvelled-- do
I have any pick-up basketball

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.600
players in the room?

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.120
Any former basketball players?

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.890
Good.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.370
At least two-- I
knew you would be.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.420
Of course you are.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.590
So basketball's
this amazing sport.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.590
By the way, statistics
are much more complicated

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.631
than baseball statistics.

00:31:17.631 --> 00:31:21.450
Don't let people-- it's five
interdependent bodies, so

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.990
a very complicated thing.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.960
And I've always
marveled at this thing

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.460
that I started
thinking about, which

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.410
is basketball is very
aggressive and it's physical,

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.640
and it really breaks
down your body

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.690
because you're crashing into
big people all the time.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:40.990
And I tallied it up
one day, and I'm like,

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:46.370
I've played 3,000 pick-up
basketball games, from France

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.670
to the projects of
Brockton, Massachusetts,

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.500
to Berkeley, California,
and I've never

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.100
seen anybody hit
each other or fight.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.280
I'm like, that's more peaceful
than the average family

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.580
reunion in America.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.630
It's more peaceful than
shopping at Berkeley Bowl, where

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.700
vegans go.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.880
And I saw two guys
with ponytails

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.060
get in a fist fight
over some vegetables.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.130
I'm like, come on.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.990
And I go, well,
how could that be?

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.340
And it's because of
the language of touch.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.570
That touch builds cooperation
where competition really

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.840
should be pronounced.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.820
And it's a way in which
we promote better behavior

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.460
and so forth.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.710
So we did a crazy study.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.700
This was Michael Krauss,
now at Yale, and I,

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.620
and a very devoted
team of coders

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.920
spent six months coding one
game of every team in the NBA

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.960
for how much the teammates
touched each other.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.890
And this is what we observed.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.090
And you could do this here
at Google-- high fives, fist

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:50.830
bumps, arm embraces, bear hugs.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.650
Men like to hit each
other in the head

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.290
when they say good job,
and it's a mystery.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.820
So those are two of
the greatest teammates

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.340
in basketball history, Tim
Duncan and Tony Parker.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:06.040
He's rapping him in the head--
arm embraces, chest bumps,

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.340
flying hip bumps.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.440
And if everything's
going amazingly well

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.800
and you write that great code
or do that great data analysis,

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.270
you fly through the
air and chest bump.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.930
And I hope you guys
are doing this at work.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.400
And what we found is two things.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.710
The more teams did this stuff
at the beginning of the season,

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.970
the better they played
at the end of the season.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:29.730
And then we could chart
how individual players were

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.120
these most valuable touchers.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.229
They're the great touchers,
encouraging, fist-bumping

00:33:35.229 --> 00:33:35.770
and the like.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.010
And they actually,
through certain analyses,

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:39.830
made their teammates
play better just

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:46.040
by directing this very important
resource of touch to others.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.730
So lest you think that
the idea that we get power

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:56.480
by being good-- it's more
true in the 21st century

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.700
than it was 50 years ago, a
lot of broad survey data show.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.660
But this is actually a
surprising and robust

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.438
human universal.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:18.892
Christopher Boehm at USC has
summarized 48 separate studies.

00:34:18.892 --> 00:34:20.600
They're where
anthropologists go and live

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.260
with hunter-gatherer
societies or foragers.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.139
They're living in
the small conditioned

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.290
groups in which we evolved.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.000
And then the idea is
like who gains power

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.159
in those very tightly
organized groups that

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.429
really are the
conditions in which we

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.719
evolved for 200,000 years?

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:44.320
And across continents you
see this regular pattern.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.880
And here is his summary--
that the leaders

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.790
are generous, brave,
wise, apt at resolving

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:57.020
conflicts, good speakers, fair,
impartial, tactful, morally

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.290
upright.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.710
They're also strong, of course.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.620
And they're humble,
right-- being good.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.200
And by the way, if you're a
Machiavellian and screwing

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.370
people over in the
hunter-gatherer society,

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.470
it was very common-- the
group would get your relatives

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.670
to exile you or kill you.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.750
We did not have the
luxury of that sort

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.040
of destructive
behavior for the group.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:29.380
Power-- we get power by empathy,
by being good to others.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.270
And now we buy into why I called
the book "The Power Paradox,"

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:38.020
which is that power unleashes
the more problematic stuff

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.180
of human behavior.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.420
As Lord Acton said, power
corrupts, and absolute power

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.410
corrupts absolutely.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:50.060
He was a 19th century historian,
critic of the Catholic Church

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.570
and all of its abuses,
and really questioned

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:54.973
authority-based structures.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.840
You could devote a column
in "The New York Times"

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.680
to the abuses of power,
and you would have

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.880
new material every day, right?

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.560
Roger, the Fox guy, Roger Ailes,
what happened at UC Berkeley.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.470
It just goes on and on-- the
regrettably named Anthony

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.970
Weiner.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.010
Like, oh, again?

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.310
Whatever he does.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:24.960
So it is a reliable
tendency in human behavior.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.720
And I'm going to argue it
has massive social costs.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.940
It's not just entertainment.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.140
It's not just something
we make fun of.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.430
There's a lot of cost at
the organizational level.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.670
Let me give you a couple of
examples of how power corrupts.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:43.680
We know, if you feel powerful,
you're more likely to gamble,

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.090
take risks.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:51.210
Studies by Christine
Porath show that 3/4

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:55.050
of the rude, uncivil
acts in organizations

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:56.460
come from the powerful.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.170
They're the ones who
are swearing at people,

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.740
leaving trash, expecting
someone else to-- these

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:07.150
are her observations--
someone else picks it up.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:08.870
Even in very civil
organizations,

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.260
it produces rudeness.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.850
This is a stunning one.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:14.840
Somebody sent me this paper
when they heard about our work.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.005
Who is more likely to shoplift,
wealthy kids or poor kids?

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:25.760
Wealthy kids.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.320
Who's more likely to shoplift?

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.660
White people or people
of minority backgrounds?

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.770
White people.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:33.810
That blew me away.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.610
We think about who we
think is shoplifting.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.100
It's actually the
wealthier whiter kids

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:39.960
who are shoplifting.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.480
They have the money to pay
for it, but they're doing it.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.420
Here's a study we did early in
this story of power corrupts.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.230
We brought people to the lab.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.490
We had them do something that
was by design really boring.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.880
They had to write policies
for the university they're at,

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.480
which is my job.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.450
It was a little act of
rebellion on my part.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.652
So they're writing away.

00:38:03.652 --> 00:38:04.610
There are three people.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:08.650
We randomly assigned one person
to the position of power.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.100
And they're writing away.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.290
And halfway into the study, this
is the key part of the study,

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.580
we put down a plate of
chocolate chip cookies.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.857
Everybody grabs one.

00:38:16.857 --> 00:38:17.690
Cookie, they eat it.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:18.730
OK, I feel better.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.340
There's one last cookie.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.360
Who takes that last cookie?

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.530
Indeed, the
high-powered person's

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.240
much more likely to
take that last cookie

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.850
than the low-powered people.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.990
We code how they ate.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.730
High-power people are
more likely to eat

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.310
with their mouths
open, lip smacking,

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:38.400
and crumbs falling all
over their sweaters.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.300
And I'm hoping my face
is clean, by the way.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.874
So we did another study.

00:38:42.874 --> 00:38:44.290
You may have heard
about this one.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.840
It's gotten a lot of press.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.770
It is my great graduate student,
now at Irvine, Paul Piff.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.540
We wanted to know who's more
likely to drive in an impulsive

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.240
out-of-control way-- high-power
people or low-power people?

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.320
So here's what we did.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.560
Don't take this
personally if this-- it's

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.760
a very sophisticated thing.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.030
We have this very complex
quantitative scale

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:12.190
of how powerful your car is.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.740
There is the Dodge
Colt from the '80s.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.240
There's a Ford Taurus,
which gets a 2.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.840
There's the middle, very
middle-of-the-road Honda Civic,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.090
very aptly named.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.520
There's a Honda Accord, I think.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.520
And that's a very
fancy Mercedes.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.810
And so what we did, we did
a variety of these studies.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.400
We got a Berkeley undergrad,
and he stood right

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.750
at the edge of a
pedestrian zone, which is

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.960
that series of white stripes.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.710
It's California
law that cars have

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.400
to stop for a pedestrian
in the pedestrian zone.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.580
A lot of people get killed in
pedestrian zones in California.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.270
It's a very dangerous place.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.760
So our poor Berkeley
undergrad stopped and looked

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.081
at oncoming traffic.

00:39:53.081 --> 00:39:55.330
And he looked like he wanted
to get across the street.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.890
And we waited until
there's only one car

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.820
coming toward the
pedestrian zone.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.460
And our question was, who's
more likely to violate the law

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.920
and almost injure this guy,
wealthy cars or poor cars?

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.395
Here's our data.

00:40:09.395 --> 00:40:14.850
Indeed, if you're driving a poor
car, you always stop, right?

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.459
And I've been there.

00:40:16.459 --> 00:40:18.250
Partially, it's because
it's like, oh, god,

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.660
I've got that bad tail light.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.950
I wonder if someone's
going to catch me.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:25.290
But if you're driving a
fancy car, 46% of the time,

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.940
people blaze through the zone.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.560
People emailed all
kinds of questions.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.027
Audi called us up.

00:40:32.027 --> 00:40:32.735
What about Audis?

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.380
We did a data analysis--
not sufficient sample size.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.510
But they're actually
pretty good drivers.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.890
And then we got the next
one, what about the Prius?

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:47.110
I'm sure a Prius is a fancy
car, but in actuality, Priuses

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.800
were the worst drivers
and offenders of all.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.330
I apologize.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.392
So there we go.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.890
And then there are a
lot of studies showing

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.590
that power makes us lose our
ability to take other people's

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.440
perspectives, to empathize.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.015
This study by Adam
Galinsky and Joan McGee,

00:41:07.015 --> 00:41:08.390
you're either put
into a position

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.340
of low power or high power.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.200
And you just have to draw
an E on your forehead

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.555
so the person sitting
across from you can read it.

00:41:15.555 --> 00:41:18.780
So you have to flip your
usual way of drawing it

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.610
and draw it in reverse-- take
other people's perspectives.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.370
Easy to do for
low-power people, harder

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.790
to do on the right for
high-powered people.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.130
So that's "The Power
Paradox," and then I'm

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.910
going to give you three
or four minutes of data

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.500
on where I began this
journey with the neighborhood

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.720
that I grew up in.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.670
The power paradox
is really striking.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.890
I actually think it's
the most important thing

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:48.260
you have to solve in
your life is to not fall

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.780
victim-- you guys are young.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.810
You will have a lot
of power in your life,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:58.170
over people at work, your
kids, your partners, members

00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.470
of your community.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.860
And this is the central
dynamic of do you become

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.470
seduced by your own power?

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:09.010
The power paradox is groups
want really socially intelligent

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:10.940
people to lead the groups.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.470
That's why we rise through
social intelligence.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.010
Power decreases
those capacities.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.620
We gain power
through what is good.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.490
And then a lot of
the bad stuff we

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:24.600
read about in human
history, abuses in churches,

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.460
excessive military moves, the
Holocaust, are abuses of power.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.279
So we can bring this up.

00:42:32.279 --> 00:42:33.320
I have less data on this.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.870
This is how you design social
systems to make them less

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.210
vulnerable to these abuses.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.650
Things like collective
scrutiny, accountability

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:45.940
all diminish the
tendency to abuse power.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.530
Strong ties, things
that Google does,

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.160
actually diminish
the abuses of power.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.560
But here's where I
want to end, which

00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:00.030
is how thinking about
power and powerlessness

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.220
helps us think
about, I think it's

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.640
the central problem in the
United States society today,

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.290
and in part because
for while we are

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:16.610
in such a strange political
season, the strangest in my 36

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.575
years of voting, so it
has to do with this.

00:43:19.575 --> 00:43:24.950
You know, I hope, that
we are at historic levels

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.870
of economic inequality
in the United States.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.040
Although that's shifted
ever so slightly

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.360
in the last wave
of economic data.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.740
You know that one out
of five American kids

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.750
is raised in poverty,
where the average family

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.410
income is $23,000 a year.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:47.150
We have students
at UC Berkeley--

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.250
we have a lot of poor
students at Berkeley,

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.680
which I'm proud of, who
have hunger problems.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.500
We did a big survey.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.539
A lot of our students
are not eating regularly

00:43:57.539 --> 00:43:59.080
because they don't
have enough money.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.520
And so we're working on that.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.440
It's endemic to our culture.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.420
And this is, I think, one of
the most important branches

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.980
of the social
biological sciences.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:15.160
This is your stress system, the
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.850
axis.

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.350
When you see danger
in the world,

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.120
the amygdala triggers act as
a signal to the hypothalamus,

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.160
goes to the pituitary
glands, drops

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.900
down to your adrenal
glands, which then secretes

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.130
and release cortisol
into your bloodstream.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:30.710
You've heard of cortisol.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.140
It's the stress hormone.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.020
And when you have
a lot of cortisol,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.530
you can code until
5:00 AM, no trouble.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:43.000
You're at peak fitness in
terms of highly metabolically

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.230
demanding activities.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:46.230
It's for fight or flight, right?

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:50.970
And then we started to learn
that chronic cortisol is

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.170
one of the worst
conditions for your body.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.150
It prematurely ages you.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:59.400
So here is where powerless
comes into the equation.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.500
There are these
studies first showing

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.350
the single biggest predictor
of cortisol release

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:14.270
in your body is not spiders
or the saber-tooth tiger

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:15.340
out there.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.250
It's feeling disempowered.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:20.060
It's feeling like others
are threatening you

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.200
in a dominant fashion, right?

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.370
It's when you're being
lowered by other people.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.110
That is amazing to me.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.890
A system that helped
us flee predators

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.870
in our evolutionary
past is really

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:34.620
about power dynamics today.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.360
So we know, for example,
if I'm African American

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.700
and I hear racist words, it
activates the stress response

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.390
and cortisol release.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.950
We know from empirical
studies, if I'm a woman

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:55.620
and I hear sexist jokes, that
activates cortisol release

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.180
and the stress response.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.840
Rudy Mendoza Denton
has done studies.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.750
If you're a poor kid and
you go to Columbia, where

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:07.060
most students are wealthy,
you'll feel this class dynamic,

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.310
and that activates
chronic levels

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.150
of cortisol in your bloodstream
because you feel lower

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:13.090
than others.

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:14.530
Sexual identity.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.630
Jenn Lerner, my former
student, now at Harvard,

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.330
studied managers.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.859
And if you're a manager and
you have a lot of power,

00:46:22.859 --> 00:46:24.900
but you don't have respect
from the organization,

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.740
they don't let you
do direct reports,

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.650
you have elevated cortisol.

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:34.250
So the lesson is when
I'm disempowered,

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:38.320
I become hyper-stressed
and cortisol.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.710
And then there are
new data showing

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.620
that this part of
our inflammation

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.370
response, the cytokine
response, these

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:51.180
are little proteins that
attack pathogens in your cells,

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.440
the common pathway
to most diseases

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.810
today is hyper-activated by
powerlessness, by poverty,

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:01.210
and feeling shamed
by other people.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:06.120
Powerlessness is a tremendous
threat to our health.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.730
And these are just
some of the effects.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.870
This is Greg Miller and
Edith Chen at Northwestern.

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:16.430
If I'm raised for five years in
the powerlessness environments

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:20.600
of poverty, I have elevated
cortisol and cytokines,

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.590
and a 20% to 40% chance
of dying from disease

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.200
raised by five
years of that life--

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.520
very serious issues
to be taken on.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.600
Part of why I find this
uplifting in an odd way

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.120
is what that tells us is
if we can empower people,

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.110
you can solve health
problems, right,

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:42.600
just by shifts in
their nervous system.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.660
And so at my lab in
Berkeley, with Stacey Barrett

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.270
at the Sierra Club, we're
getting inner city kids

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.280
from Oakland and
Richmond and veterans

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.980
out rafting where
they feel empowered,

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.870
and they do the rapids,
and they wipe out.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:48:00.900
And their nervous systems look
better at the end of the trip,

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.610
and a lot of interesting
interventions from there.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:08.710
We're in a radical time of
shifting power dynamics.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:13.610
We are emerging out
of serious hierarchy.

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:21.020
And that really has been
around for about 12,000 years.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.020
When you step back and
think of it historically,

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.460
we're in a very serious
power revolution,

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.160
which is really interesting.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:32.620
Women have more power today than
they've had in 12,000 years.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.990
And the trajectory
is like that, right?

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.620
People of different
ethnicities, the power dynamics

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:41.920
at the national level, and
then the information revolution

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.890
is certainly important.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:46.860
It's a really exciting time
to be thinking about power.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.650
You guys are a very important
part of that revolution.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.070
So it's a privilege to talk
to you about this work.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:55.600
And I hope you make the
most of all the power

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.177
you will have in your life.

00:48:57.177 --> 00:48:58.260
and do good for the world.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.122
So thank you.

00:48:59.122 --> 00:49:02.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.850
SPEAKER 2: Thanks.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:07.480
We have a question
from the live stream.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.860
So someone wrote
in and said, you

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.570
said that more
powerful people flaunt

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.460
the law more-- so white
wealthy shoplifters,

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.244
nice cars blowing
through intersections.

00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:16.660
How much of that
can be attributed

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.680
to not power but the ability
to afford the consequences

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.080
or knowing there will
be no consequences?

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.590
So a poor person cannot afford
the fine that they probably

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:25.360
will get.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.750
A powerful person can
probably afford the fine

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.190
they probably will not get.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.620
DACHER KELTNER:
Yeah, I think one

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.620
of the shortcomings
of psychology

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.380
and my analysis
is we don't think

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.010
about the deep systemic context.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.850
And that's really true.

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:43.930
It's like in Michael Lewis's
"The Big Short," who's

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.830
a good friend, and you
think about the trillions

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:53.040
of dollars that were
lost and the hundreds

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.720
and hundreds of millions of
dollars that some people got.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.280
And there were
problematic behaviors,

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.320
and no one has--
there's not a-- one

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.450
person has had a legal outcome.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:04.710
And that is a very
serious commentary

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.430
right now in the United States.

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.350
There is Michelle Alexander's
"The New Jim Crow"

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:12.450
and then Bryan Stevenson's
"Just Mercy," which is maybe

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:15.080
the most important book
of the last few years,

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:20.050
where they're saying our systems
of handing out punishments

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.470
are so deeply power-
and class-biased,

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.100
that that's part of the story.

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:31.670
I know if I drive through
in an inappropriate way,

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:33.477
but I'm in the
right car, I'm OK.

00:50:33.477 --> 00:50:35.560
They're not going to look
in my glove compartment,

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.976
and that's part
of the phenomenon.

00:50:36.976 --> 00:50:38.030
Wish I'd written more.

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.390
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:42.845
How do you distinguish
between influence and power?

00:50:42.845 --> 00:50:44.720
DACHER KELTNER: That is
not a quick question.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.300
That is one-- that took
me 19 years to figure out.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.515
And I'm sorry you thought
of it in 12 seconds.

00:50:50.515 --> 00:50:55.050
So, yeah, there's been
a move that most people

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.420
think of our model as
power is influence, right?

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.660
But there are other
older approaches.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.960
There are sociological
analyses of power

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.530
is just you're
part of the elite.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:08.330
So if I'm at Google and I
went to the right school

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.510
and I'm in this
position of title,

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.970
my authority from those
institutions gives me power.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.300
But we move to
influence, because I

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.310
wanted to understand
human relationships.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:20.860
And I also think it
does a fairer job

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.585
of thinking about important
social changes in history.

00:51:27.172 --> 00:51:30.000
The Silicon Valley
was created by people

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.650
who didn't necessarily
have a lot of money.

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.180
They went to good schools.

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.810
But they did unusual
things that were

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:38.490
risky that changed the world.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:41.940
So I moved to an
influence model of power.

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:43.550
So they're almost synonymous.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.050
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a little bit

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.580
about the impact
of being powerless,

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:52.010
having no power, cortisone
levels and health outcomes.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.880
When people find
themselves in a situation

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.540
where they are without
power, what can they do?

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.420
What research has
been shown to get

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.280
rid of their cortisone
levels, improve

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.350
their overall well-being?

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:08.010
DACHER KELTNER: Well, this is
one of the biggest problems,

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:08.550
right?

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:13.620
20% of our kids is in poverty.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.520
Most of our health care
costs, 1/5 of our GDP

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.610
is devoted to health
care, are what

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.200
are called frequent
flyers, who are

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.160
people who are in poverty who
don't have a sense of power.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:33.515
And so I think the
sense is that A,

00:52:33.515 --> 00:52:35.680
a new movement in
the interventions

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.810
is about empowerment.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:38.690
And that's an old idea.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.380
So take kids in the inner city
and turn them into mentors

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.080
or turn them into
agents of change.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:49.410
And then I really take heart
in a lot of the science

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:51.220
that I work in,
which is the really

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:55.570
cheap, soft interventions
that are non-ideological

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:59.200
that will really directly affect
the costs of powerlessness.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.630
So I'm very committed to
promoting getting outdoors,

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:07.240
because we know it has massive
benefits for physical health.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.580
And then there's an ecological
benefit to it as well.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.710
We know-- this will
sound like the Bay Area,

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:19.670
but I'll champion it anywhere--
which is mindfulness is free.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.170
It doesn't have a political
party attached to it.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:24.900
And now it's spreading
in a lot of contexts.

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.520
So I always take this kind
of analysis and think about,

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.860
what's an ideal system and how
do we insert those elements

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.620
into it that combat these
well-documented effects

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.510
of powerlessness?

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.840
If I could change the
tax structure, I would.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.895
If I could flow lots of
money into those places,

00:53:42.895 --> 00:53:43.770
I would do that, too.

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.470
But it's not my bailiwick.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.980
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you have

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.710
done any research
related to tying

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.010
the happiness versus the power?

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.340
Is some of the dysfunctional
behavior that we're

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.240
seeing from the more
powerful potentially related

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.700
to the less happiness,
or is it that they're

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.900
looking for some sort of hedonic
thrill or something in the like

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:06.460
there?

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.918
DACHER KELTNER:
That's really cool.

00:54:07.918 --> 00:54:09.800
That's really cool.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.950
It's funny.

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.330
I was giving a
talk-- anyway, I'm

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:17.160
starting to merge the power
hierarchy of stuff, poverty,

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.830
with happiness.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.670
It's interesting-- and
thanks for taking the class.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:26.130
We're talking about it with
Jennifer's group later.

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:26.910
It's interesting.

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.720
The well-to-do in
the United States

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.910
underperform in
terms of happiness.

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:33.820
They're not as happy
as they should be.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.320
Our culture is not as
happy as it could be.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.220
And I think it has to
do with power dynamics.

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:43.660
That people tend to be happier
in more egalitarian cultures.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.280
There are a lot of
new data showing

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.120
egalitarian cultures have
better physical health, less

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.860
ingroup-outgroup
dynamics and stuff.

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:56.784
So I think that one of the
things that I could have-- this

00:54:56.784 --> 00:54:58.700
would be a good "New
York Times" op-ed piece--

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:04.640
is to say, here's how power and
privilege and wealth cost you,

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:10.640
right, which is we show you lose
a little bit of your kindness

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.590
toward other people.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:14.780
And that's one of the most
rewarding things in human life,

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.280
right?

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.100
When you're on your deathbed--
I always think like this.

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.570
And people are like, oh, god.

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:21.390
Where's he going?

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:23.973
I get my Berkeley undergrads--
when you're on your death bed--

00:55:23.973 --> 00:55:27.517
and they're like, I
don't like this class.

00:55:27.517 --> 00:55:29.600
You're going to be thinking
about the kind things.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.270
And that's what lasts, right?

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.740
And privilege and power
deprive you of that,

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.720
as one example that
those paradoxes

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.480
that we can bring into focus.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.690
And I think the hedonic
treadmill is very true.

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.900
We just stop enjoying the
everyday joys and focus

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.590
on other things.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:48.149
Great connection.

00:55:48.149 --> 00:55:49.690
SPEAKER 2: I think
we're out of time.

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:53.350
But thank you so much to
Dacher for being here today.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.596
DACHER KELTNER: Go do good.
