so on it's about the future what people

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
so on it's about the future what people
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789
so on it's about the future what people
are doing to take care of the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
are doing to take care of the
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060
are doing to take care of the
environment and have energy produced

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
environment and have energy produced

electricity especially renewably without

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
electricity especially renewably without
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.990
electricity especially renewably without
having to burn fossil fuels so it's it's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
having to burn fossil fuels so it's it's
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240
having to burn fossil fuels so it's it's
up to you to influence your parents yes

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
up to you to influence your parents yes
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.810
up to you to influence your parents yes
very important to recycle your plastic

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
very important to recycle your plastic
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.499
very important to recycle your plastic
and your paper very important to in also

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
and your paper very important to in also
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969
and your paper very important to in also
in Washington State I'm not sure exactly

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
in Washington State I'm not sure exactly
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770
in Washington State I'm not sure exactly
where you live but you can recycle your

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
where you live but you can recycle your
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.810
where you live but you can recycle your
food waste along with your yard waste

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
food waste along with your yard waste
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.660
food waste along with your yard waste
and that becomes compost which nourishes

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
and that becomes compost which nourishes
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.330
and that becomes compost which nourishes
nourishes our farms which in turn

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
nourishes our farms which in turn
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.510
nourishes our farms which in turn
produces food part of the mythic cycle

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
produces food part of the mythic cycle
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090
produces food part of the mythic cycle
of life so you can encourage your

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
of life so you can encourage your
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.740
of life so you can encourage your
parents to do that but we need big ideas

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750
parents to do that but we need big ideas
 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.290
parents to do that but we need big ideas
big changes we

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300
big changes we
 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.030
big changes we
in Washington State there's enormous

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
in Washington State there's enormous
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.580
in Washington State there's enormous
opportunities for wind turbines and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590
opportunities for wind turbines and
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.490

for solar cells that take sunlight and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780
for solar cells that take sunlight and
 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.050
for solar cells that take sunlight and
make it right into electricity

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
make it right into electricity
 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.150
make it right into electricity
especially in eastern Washington so you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160
especially in eastern Washington so you
 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.860
especially in eastern Washington so you
can be part of that and you're in middle

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
can be part of that and you're in middle
 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.560
can be part of that and you're in middle
school that is a turning point for most

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570
school that is a turning point for most
 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.200
school that is a turning point for most
people in their science education so I

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210
people in their science education so I
 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.980
people in their science education so I
hope you Victoria will apply yourself in

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990
hope you Victoria will apply yourself in
 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.300
hope you Victoria will apply yourself in
science class in biology physics

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
science class in biology physics
 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.220

important especially for girls is
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.300
important especially for girls is
algebra and I just want to tell you al

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310
algebra and I just want to tell you al
 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.460
algebra and I just want to tell you al
Jabar is this this way to think it

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470
Jabar is this this way to think it
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.750
Jabar is this this way to think it
trains your brain to think in this way

things to to accept that you don't know
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.690
things to to accept that you don't know
the answer but you're going to find it

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
the answer but you're going to find it
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.590
the answer but you're going to find it
and so I really encourage you I just

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600
and so I really encourage you I just
 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.180
and so I really encourage you I just
tell you that I took hours where you

just have to practice there's no way
 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.660
just have to practice there's no way
around it you just got to do it over and

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670
around it you just got to do it over and
 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.690
around it you just got to do it over and
over to you to get comfortable with it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700
over to you to get comfortable with it
 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.090
over to you to get comfortable with it
and you can do it and by the way when

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100
and you can do it and by the way when
 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.810
and you can do it and by the way when
you're a girl in middle school you're

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820
you're a girl in middle school you're
 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.360
you're a girl in middle school you're
kind of better at everything than the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370
kind of better at everything than the

right now just go with it my friend
 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.040
right now just go with it my friend
go with it make sure you learn algebra

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050
go with it make sure you learn algebra
 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.710
go with it make sure you learn algebra
learn science so that you if you choose

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720
learn science so that you if you choose
 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.570
