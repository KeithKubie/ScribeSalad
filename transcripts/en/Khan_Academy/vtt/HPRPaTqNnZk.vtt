00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.733
- [Instructor] The Mayan civilization is

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.925
one of the most
long-lasting civilizations,

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.203
not just in the ancient Americas,

00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:10.672
but in the world in general.

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:14.022
You can see the rough
outline here on this map

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:17.033
of where the Mayan civilization occurred.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.800
You can see it has the Yucatan
Peninsula in the north,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.417
the Sierra Madre Mountains in the south,

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:27.584
and it covers regions of
modern-day southeast Mexico,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.273
Guatemala, Belize,

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:33.499
Western Honduras, and El Salvador.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.272
We believe that there were
settlements in this region

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:37.939
as early as 2000 ...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:43.449
As early as 2000 B.C.E., and
then we have the emergence

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.616
of the first cities around 750 B.C.E..

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:50.753
And even then there are signs

00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:53.725
of significant cultural advancements.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:57.098
There's evidence that there
was a sophisticated base-20

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:00.236
numeral system that included
the use of place value

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:02.236
as early as 1000 B.C.E..

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.238
To put that in context, the
Hindu Arabic numeral system

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:09.754
which we now use, and most
of the world now uses,

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:12.222
it wasn't devised, we don't believe,

00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:15.389
until about 1000 years later,

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:17.818
and it wasn't adopted
in Europe until about

00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:21.761
2000 years after the time
where we see the first evidence

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:24.210
of this Mayan numeral system,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.627
this base-20 system that had place value.

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:31.577
Now, around the third century B.C.E.,

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.631
so roughly in this time
period right over here,

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:38.476
we see the first writing.

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:42.643
These are examples of what
a Mayan glyph looks like.

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:46.724
So that is a Mayan glyph,

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:51.056
and you read it in order like this.

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:54.429
And once again, this is a
very early form of writing,

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.477
and it's believed to be
the first form of writing,

00:01:57.477 --> 00:02:01.635
well-established writing, in the Americas.

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:05.190
Now, on top of their
sophisticated numeral system

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.720
and the writing that they developed,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.028
they also had a very
sophisticated calendar.

00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:13.672
Their calendar was more accurate
than the Julian calendar,

00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:16.397
which was adopted by Julius Caesar,

00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:19.368
and that was the state of
the art in the western world

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:22.944
until the middle of the second millennium.

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:26.072
So their calendar was more
accurate than what was used

00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:29.989
in most of the world
until around 1500 or 1600.

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:34.886
Now, as we get into 250 in the Common Era,

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:37.533
that's considered the classical period.

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:39.806
That's when some of
their really great cities

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:42.736
start to emerge, cities like Tikal

00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:43.819
and Calakmul.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.047
My apologies ahead of time
for the pronunciation.

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:50.509
It is believed that at their peak,

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.747
these cities had 50,000 to 100,000 people.

00:02:54.747 --> 00:02:57.036
Now, what we now believe is that

00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:59.505
it was not one unified empire,

00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:03.010
that there wasn't a Mayan empire
with a centralized emperor,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.272
but rather, it was closer
to the Greek city-states,

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:09.744
where each of these cities
were their own state.

00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:13.508
Their more powerful cities,
like Tikal or Calakmul,

00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:16.759
might have had influence
or sway over others,

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.644
but it wasn't a unified empire

00:03:19.644 --> 00:03:23.046
in the sense of the Roman
Empire or the Persian Empire

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:25.854
or some of the early Indian empires.

00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:29.031
Now, it is believed that
each of these city-states,

00:03:29.031 --> 00:03:32.902
they did have a king who was
not only a political ruler

00:03:32.902 --> 00:03:34.223
but also a spiritual ruler,

00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:36.065
considered a divine king,

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:38.870
a connection between the
natural and the supernatural.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.003
We have evidence that they
practiced human sacrifice

00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:43.837
as part of their believe system,

00:03:43.837 --> 00:03:46.441
as part of their rituals.

00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:48.725
Now, near the end of the fourth century,

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:51.904
there's evidence that there
was significant influence

00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:55.142
or even conquering of some of these cities

00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:57.426
by another civilization,

00:03:57.426 --> 00:03:59.670
or maybe we could say another city,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.206
and that is Teotihuacan.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:04.236
We know that it was a very powerful city,

00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:06.205
and that, in the fourth century,

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:09.781
it started to really exert
significant influence,

00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:12.650
and just to get a sense of
the sophistication of what

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.983
Mayan cities look like, and
I'll show you what we believed

00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:18.295
Teotihuacan looked like in a second,

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:21.128
but this is a construction of what

00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:25.170
Tikal might have looked
like near its peak.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.263
And Teotihuacan, we have
significant ruins there.

00:04:28.263 --> 00:04:32.207
Teotihuacan, as you can see,
is based near modern-day

00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:36.374
Mexico City, and these are
the ruins from Teotihuacan.

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:42.957
Just to get a sense of how
sophisticated a city this was,

00:04:42.957 --> 00:04:46.473
this is a reconstruction
of the map of the city.

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:48.428
So the vantage point that
you have from this picture

00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:51.394
would have been roughly in that area,

00:04:51.394 --> 00:04:53.692
so what you're seeing right over here

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:55.460
are these ...

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.719
These buildings, or these
little squares here.

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.559
This pyramid that you
see out in the distance,

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.513
that would have been this pyramid.

00:05:03.513 --> 00:05:05.389
So you can see from this reconstruction

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.749
of what the city might have looked like,

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.886
it was a vast and significant city.

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:10.380
Pretty much everything that you can see

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.225
in this picture was
part of this great city.

00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:18.392
It was believed that it was
established around 150 B.C.E.,

00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:22.798
based on our best evidence today,

00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:27.340
and lasted until about the
middle of the sixth century.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.064
Now, they name Teotihuacan, we don't ...

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.751
That's not its original name.

00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:35.908
It's the name given to it by the Aztecs,

00:05:35.908 --> 00:05:40.421
but it's believed that at
its peak around 400, 450,

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:41.637
and remember, this was around the time

00:05:41.637 --> 00:05:45.628
that it was exerting significant
influence over the Mayans,

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:49.545
it is believed that it had
upwards of 100,000 people

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:50.767
living in the city.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.133
100,000 to 200,000.

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:55.501
I've even seen some accounts
saying 250,000 people,

00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:56.960
which would have made it, at the time,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.159
one of the largest cities in the world.

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.934
Some accounts have it ranked as

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:05.756
the sixth largest city in
the world that we know about.

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:07.832
Now, one interesting question was,

00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:11.577
was Teotihuacan an independent
city-state by itself,

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:14.272
or was it the center of an empire?

00:06:14.272 --> 00:06:16.862
This is something that
historians debate today.

00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:21.131
Now, some of the evidence
for why it was maybe a center

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.735
of an empire is it's believed
it was a multiethnic city.

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:28.341
We see its influence over the
Mayan cities, especially over

00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:32.258
Tikal, as we get into the
end of the fourth century.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:36.008
We also see this incredible
confluence of people

00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:39.091
and culture and trade at Teotihuacan,

00:06:40.303 --> 00:06:43.012
which, once again, hints
that it probably wasn't

00:06:43.012 --> 00:06:46.197
a standalone city, but it
was probably the center

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.686
of some type of regional influence,

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:49.910
or maybe an empire.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.503
We don't traditionally see
cities of that size form

00:06:52.503 --> 00:06:55.125
unless they are the
center of a larger empire,

00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:57.560
and they're able to
get tribute or taxation

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.060
from other states.

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:03.589
Now, Teotihuacan ends
up declining or falling

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.324
before the Mayan civilization.

00:07:06.324 --> 00:07:09.052
You see Teotihuacan in
this blue-green line.

00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:11.678
You see the Mayan civilization
in this light blue,

00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:12.821
and then in the classical period,

00:07:12.821 --> 00:07:15.898
this slightly darker light blue.

00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:20.896
And Teotihuacan collapses
around 550 in the Common Era,

00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:23.854
and the best theories
we have today is that

00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:26.246
it might have been some type
of an internal uprising,

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:29.371
maybe due to some type
of drought and famine,

00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:30.696
and you can imagine, people will revolt

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:32.974
if they're not able to get enough food.

00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:35.240
Now, the Mayan civilization,
it is believed,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.090
also started to collapse a
few hundred years after that.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.595
So as we get into the 800s,
the Mayan civilization,

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:46.151
we believe, might have
experienced some similar things,

00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:48.201
maybe some drought, some famine,

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.407
that similarly caused uprisings, division,

00:07:51.407 --> 00:07:53.712
and allowed that to collapse.

00:07:53.712 --> 00:07:57.481
Now, there is evidence
of some of these cities

00:07:57.481 --> 00:08:01.032
lasting beyond the classical
period, all the way up

00:08:01.032 --> 00:08:05.182
until you have the European
colonization of the region.

00:08:05.182 --> 00:08:09.890
We'll talk more about that and
some of the successor states,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.729
like the Aztecs, who considered themselves

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.121
a bit of a successor
state to the civilization

00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:18.023
or to the city of Teotihuacan,

00:08:18.023 --> 00:08:21.356
and we'll look at that in future videos.
