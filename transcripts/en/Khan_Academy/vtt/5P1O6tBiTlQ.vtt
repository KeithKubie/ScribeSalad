00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:03.131
- [Voiceover] A particle
moves along the x-axis

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:06.269
so that at any time T
greater than or equal to zero

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.722
its velocity is given
by V of T is equal to

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:12.889
negative T to the third power
plus six T squared plus two T.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.124
At what value of T does the particle

00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:19.128
obtain its maximum acceleration?

00:00:19.128 --> 00:00:20.459
So we want to figure
out when does it obtain

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.355
its maximum acceleration.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.503
So let's just review what they gave us.

00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:26.944
They gave us velocity
as a function of time.

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.440
So let's just remind ourselves.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.392
If we have let's say our
position is a function of time,

00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:35.943
so let's say X of T is
position as a function of time,

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:38.213
then we if were to take
the derivative of that,

00:00:38.213 --> 00:00:39.546
so X prime of T,

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:43.737
well that's going to be the
rate of change of position

00:00:43.737 --> 00:00:47.715
with respect to time or the
velocity as a function of time

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:51.213
and if we were to take the
derivative of our velocity,

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:53.439
then that's going to be the
rate of change of velocity

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:54.734
with respect to time.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:58.019
Well that's going to be
acceleration as a function of time.

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.514
So they gave us velocity.

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:02.318
So from velocity, we can
figure out acceleration.

00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:04.054
So let me just rewrite that.

00:01:04.054 --> 00:01:07.178
So we know that V of T is equal to

00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:11.345
negative T to the third power
plus six T squared plus two T

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.844
and so from that we can figure out

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:19.381
the acceleration as a function of time,

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:20.503
which is just going to be the derivative

00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:22.746
with respect to T of the velocity.

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:24.561
So just use the power rule a bunch.

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.113
So that's going to be, this
is a third power right there.

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:30.363
So negative three T squared

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:34.505
plus two times six is twelve

00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:37.803
T to the first plus two.

00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.945
So that's our acceleration
as a function of time

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:43.868
and we want to figure out when we obtain

00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:45.710
our maximum acceleration

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.834
and just inspecting this
acceleration function here,

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:50.650
we see it's a quadratic,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.786
it has a second degree polynomial

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:54.415
and we have a negative coefficient

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:56.552
out in front of the highest degree term,

00:01:56.552 --> 00:01:59.008
in front of the second degree term.

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:01.652
So it is going to be a
downward opening parabola.

00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:03.380
So it is going to be a downward opening,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.688
let me draw it in the same color,

00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:07.145
so it is going to have that general shape

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:09.762
and so it will indeed take on,

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:13.287
it will indeed take on a maximum value.

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:15.690
But how do we figure
out that maximum value?

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.612
Well that maximum value's going to happen

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:19.731
when the acceleration value,

00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:23.243
when the slope of its
tangent line is equal to,

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:26.474
when the slope of its
tangent line is equal to zero

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:30.186
and we could also verify
that it is concave downwards

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:32.482
at that point using the
second derivative test

00:02:32.482 --> 00:02:35.820
by showing that the second
derivative is negative there.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.155
So let's do that, let's look at the first

00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:41.322
and second derivatives of
our acceleration function.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.472
So and I'll switch colors.

00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:46.341
That one's actually a
little bit hard to see.

00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:51.041
So the first derivative, the
rate of change of acceleration

00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:53.444
is going to be equal to,

00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:56.277
so this is negative six T plus 12.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.401
Now let's think about when
does this thing equal zero?

00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:04.205
Well if we subtract 12 from both sides,

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:07.516
we get negative six T
is equal to negative 12,

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:09.599
divide both sides by negative six,

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.766
you get T is equal to two.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.753
So a couple of things.

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:16.302
You could just say alright look,

00:03:16.302 --> 00:03:19.542
I know that this is a downward opening

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:20.624
parabola right over here.

00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:23.801
I have a negative coefficient
on my second degree term.

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.044
I know that the slope
of the tangent line here

00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:28.180
is zero at T equals two.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.916
So that's gonna be my maximum point.

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:31.358
Or you could go a little bit further.

00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:34.189
You could take the second derivative.

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.058
Let's do that just for kicks.

00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:37.820
So we could take the second derivative

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.117
of our acceleration function.

00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:44.122
So this is going to be equal
to negative six, right.

00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:46.045
The derivative of negative
60 is negative six,

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:47.887
the derivative constant is just zero.

00:03:47.887 --> 00:03:51.839
So this thing, the second
derivative is always negative.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.256
So we are always, always concave downward

00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:03.775
and so by the second derivative
test at T equals two,

00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:05.324
well at T equals two our second derivative

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:07.407
of our acceleration function's
going to be negative

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:11.088
and so we know that this
is our maximum value.

00:04:11.088 --> 00:04:13.505
Our max at T is equal to two.

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:16.536
So at what value of T does the particle

00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:18.294
obtain its maximum acceleration?

00:04:18.294 --> 00:04:20.044
At T is equal to two.
