00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.050
So for this situation source cognitive architectures selected not

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.418
one goal but to.

00:00:06.418 --> 00:00:11.010
So this SOAR theory this is called an impasse.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.340
An impasse occurs when the decision maker cannot make a decision

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.180
either because not enough knowledge is available or because multiple courses of

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.160
action there are being selected and the agent cannot decide among them.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.690
In this case two actions have been selected and

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.300
the agent cannot decide between them.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.620
Should the pitch throw a curve ball or a fast ball?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.110
At this point SOAR will attempt to learn a rule that might break the impasse.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.610
If the decision maker has a choice between the fast ball and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.600
the curve ball and it cannot decide it,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.270
might there be a way of learning a rule that decides between what to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.180
throw in a particular situation given the choice of the fast falling curve ball.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.850
For this now SOAR will invoke episodic knowledge.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.360
Let's see how SOAR does that and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.910
how it can help SOAR learn the rule that results in the breaking of the impasse.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.870
So imagine that SOAR had episodic knowledge about the previous event,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.860
about the previous instance of an event.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.890
And this previous instance of an event in another game

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.510
it was a fifth inning bottom of the fifth inning, if the weather was windy it

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.980
was the same batter though, Parra, who bats left handed.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.580
It was a similar kind of situation and the pitcher threw a fastball and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.024
Parra hit a homerun out of it.

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:31.870
Now we want to avoid that.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.970
The current pitcher wants to avoid it.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.395
So given this episodic knowledge about this even set occurred earlier,

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:42.850
SOAR has learning mechanism that allows it to

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.740
encapsulate knowledge from this event into the form of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.440
a production rule that can be used as part of the procedural knowledge.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.370
And the learned rule is, if two operators are suggested, and

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.006
threw a fast ball is one of those operators, and the batter is Parra,

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:01.280
then dismiss throw-fast-ball operator.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.490
This is the process of learning called chunking.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.120
So, chunking is a process, a learning technique that's SOAR uses

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.500
to learn rules that can break impasse.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.270
First note, that chunking is triggered when impasse occurs.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.969
In this situation, the impasse is that two rules got activated and

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.362
there is no way of resolving between them.

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:27.327
So the impasse imagery tells the process of chunking,

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:29.980
what the goal of chunking is.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.670
Find a rule that can break the impasse.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.131
SOAR now searches for the episodic memory and

00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:42.210
finds an event that has some knowledge that may break the impulse.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.183
In particular, it looks like a perceptual current situation that we had in

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:47.073
previous shot.

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:51.629
And compared to the perceptions of previous situations, of the event memory,

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.125
the episodic memory, and

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:57.420
find that any information available of the current batter.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.000
If some information is available that tells, SOAR the result of some previous

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.010
action that also occurs in the current impasse, then SOAR picks that event.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.380
So now it tries to encapsulate the result of the previous event,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.890
in the form of a rule.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.850
In this case, it wants to avoid the result of a homerun, and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.050
therefore it says dismiss that particular operator.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.230
If it wanted that particular result,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.290
it would have said throw that particular operator.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.580
We said earlier that in cognitive systems, reasoning, learning and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.170
memory are closely connected.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.100
Here is an example of that.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.361
We're dealing with memory, procedural memory, we're dealing with memory that can

00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:42.380
deal with procedural knowledge and episodic knowledge.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.690
Dealing with reasoning, decision making.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.250
We're also dealing with learning, chunking.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.998
If you want to learn more about chunking then the reading by

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:52.970
Lehman Leodon Rosenblum, and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.610
the further readings at the end of this lesson gives lot many more details.
