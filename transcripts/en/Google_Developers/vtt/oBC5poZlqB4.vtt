TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.023
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.023 --> 00:00:06.400
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.670
The recent TensorFlow
1.3 release

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.830
introduced datasets
and estimators,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.590
two important features
that you should try out.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.300
This post gives
you all the details

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.820
you need to do just that.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.430
Google Play is committed to
bringing new diverse voices

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.420
to gaming.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.150
Infinite Deviation
Games is a program

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.550
that gives game designers
from all backgrounds

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.490
the chance to pitch an
original mobile game concept

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.700
and have it developed,
published, and promoted

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
in partnership with Google Play.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.450
Follow the link to
submit your mobile game

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.940
concepts by October 9.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.730
Do you wish there were an
open-sourced Firebase playbook

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.820
app that you could use to
see real-life use cases that

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.490
also demonstrates the use of
multiple Firebase products

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.330
together?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.590
Well, wish no longer.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.970
Friendly Pix is here.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.760
Head on over to the post for
the design doc, app links,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.830
and the GitHub link.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.260
Spotify and Google Cloud
recently worked together

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.590
to develop innovative security
tools that help organizations

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.740
protect GCP projects.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.880
They're available in an
open source community

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.810
called Forseti Security.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.520
And they are now open
to all GCP users.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.310
We're excited to announce the
beta release of managed SSL

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.530
certificates at no
charge for applications

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440
built on Google App Engine.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.060
This service
automatically encrypts

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.660
server-to-client
communication, which

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.490
is an essential
part of safeguarding

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.130
sensitive information
over the web.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.950
Getting started details
are on the post.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.410
We're also excited to announce
that the first Google Cloud

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.651
Platform region in Germany
is now open for business.

00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.150
You can now choose
the German region

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.940
to build applications
and store data.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.160
Having a consolidated
and comprehensive view

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.020
of how your AdWords
account is doing

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.930
helps you spend less time
creating reports and more time

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.187
identifying new opportunities.

00:01:48.187 --> 00:01:49.770
That's why over the
next several weeks

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.800
we're rolling out Dashboards,
a single place in AdWords where

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.130
you can bring together your most
important reports and unearth

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160
insights about your business.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.585
Screenshots and details
are on the post.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:02.540
Please subscribe and share.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.800

I'll see you next week.
