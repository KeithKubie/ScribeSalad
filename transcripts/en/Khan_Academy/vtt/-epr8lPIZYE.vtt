00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
The title of Thomas Piketty's book

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.890
is Capital in the 21st Century.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.330
It's probably worth having a conversation

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.810
about what capital is.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.620
If you're going to produce anything,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.000
you need some input,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.480
you need some factors for that production.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.750
You'd put them together.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.800
Let's say that you are a farm.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.000
Your output is food.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.690
What are your inputs going to be?

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.660
This is a farm right over here.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.890
Let me a draw a little circle here.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.840
Farm and your output is food.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.000
What are your inputs going to be?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.800
You're going to need some land.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.000
You're going to need some water.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.420
You're going to need some equipment.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.000
And you are going to need some seeds

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.470
and animals so, I'll just put generally here, supplies.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.490
And of course, you're going to need people to

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.750
put all these things together

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.000
and essentially work the land,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.630
to plow the soil and plant the seeds

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.000
and harvest the crops

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.480
and manage the whole operations.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.470
You're going to need labor as well.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.360
You take all of these factors of production together.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.610
They essentially represent a farm

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.000
that is going to output food.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
When people talk about capital

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
as a factor of production,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
sometimes they talk about it in a fairly narrow way.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They'll separate things like land and resources

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
or something separate and they'll say capital

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is hey, that's your equipment and your supplies.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
When people talk in more general terms,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.410
especially, in the focus of this book

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.020
when there are people talking about labor versus capital.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.000
Capital when we just group things

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.200
in only those two categories

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.140
in that context, capital would essentially represent

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.000
pretty much everything else.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This right over here would be capital

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.820
and one way to think about capital

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.490
is the things that you could maybe you,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.810
they are assets that you have

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.390
that can be valued that will give you future benefit.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.790
You can buy and sell those assets

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.450
and we could think about other businesses here.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.500
Other things that are trying to produce something.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:35.880
Let's say you have a mine.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.580
This is the operation

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.000
and it's going to produce,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.590
let's just say it's a goldmine.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.000
It's going to produce gold.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.520
What are the inputs that you would need there?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.460
You're clearly gonna need some labor.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.000
You're gonna need the miners and the people

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.560
who would manage the operation of the goldmine

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.950
but that's not all you need.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.760
You also need energy

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.530
maybe to operate your equipment

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.490
and I actually, I will put energy in here too.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.000
Some of which comes from the sun

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but some of which you might have to purchase

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.740
or have somehow

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.000
and then you would also need equipment.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And you would need supplies.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I mean we could consider energy as supply

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.650
if you like or you use supply of energy

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.000
but you also might need tires or something like that.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.690
You might need food in order to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.000
provide for the labor.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.720
Who knows what else you might need in your mine?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.000
And you also would need, of course, land.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.330
You need access to land to actually mine.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.500
Here, if we're thinking very broad terms,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.350
you could view all of this as the capital

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.640
and of course, you have your labor

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.350
and you put your labor and your capital together

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.770
and you produce the gold.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.000
Another idea that you will hear in life a lot

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.830
but obviously, in a book about capital,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.000
this will come up a lot,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.640
it's the idea of return on capital.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.000
This is just a measure of giving a value of capital

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that you've employed,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.590
how much income are you getting for that capital.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.000
For example, let's say this farm.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.420
The total value of this capital,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.000
let's just say it is,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I don't know, I'll make up a number here.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.960
Let's just say it is $1 million.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.000
$1 million is the total value of the land

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and maybe you have access to your own lake

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and the equipment and the supplies.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It's $1 million of capital.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.070
The value of that capital is $1 million.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.000
Let's say that the income of the farm

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.250
after you pay the labor.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.400
Actually, let's just do this in a little broader term.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.000
Let's say the food's value,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.350
the food that's produced has a value of $100,000

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.650
in the market.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.850
Now, out of that $100,000, you obviously had

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.800
to pay your labor.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.680
Let's say that $50,000 of it, goes to the labor.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.000
And then we're saying this is in a given year.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.230
You use the capital of the labor,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.450
You produce $100,000 worth of food.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.000
$50,000 goes to the labor was gonna

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
be returned on capital.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.780
You have another 50,000 leftover for the capital

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.370
for the owners of the capital

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.600
whoever owned the farm.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.860
The owners of the capital would get the other

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.290
$50,000.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.570
Your return on capital is going to be $50,000

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.470
that's what the owner of the capital gets

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.770
and it's thee return on their investment

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.600
of $1 million.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.000
And this is going to be the same thing

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.360
as 5 divided by 100

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.640
or it would be 5%.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.600
You have a 5% return on capital.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.760
You invest $1 million, you're going to get $50,000.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.000
It was a 6% return on capital,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.560
you invest $1 million.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.650
You get $60,000.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.000
Now, that we've thought about that a little bit,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
let's actually at a pretty neat chart

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.800
from the book and once again, it's pretty neat.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.000
If you look right over here

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.530
piketty.psc.ens.frcapital21c.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.000
He has all the charts from his book,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.710
which make for interesting analysis at minimum

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.530
and he's gathered all of this information.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.500
This is pretty interesting.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.510
There's capital and slavery in the United States.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.000
And what's interesting about that is

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.800
when you study American history,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.460
you talk a lot about slavery

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.550
but you don't realize that

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.000
in the time of slavery as abhorrent as it is

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and was, people viewed slaves as capital,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
not as laborer.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.850
They view them as something that they could buy or sell

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.000
that they own and that would create future income

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.250
for them and this just gives us a sense

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.750
of kind of the breakdown of capital over history.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.430
You see down, at least in the United States,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.520
you see agricultural land.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.000
In 1770, it was a reasonable percentage.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This is a value capital as a percentage

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
of national income.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The value of the land is a percentage

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.920
of national income was much higher than it is, today

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.860
and we see the other trend

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.140
that the other domestic capital has become

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.000
much more value.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Well, what is this other domestic capital?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.970
This could be things like infrastructure.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.000
It could be technology.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It could be mechanical technology.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.700
Things like trains and cars and trucks and buses

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.000
or, and factories or it could be software.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.150
It could be computers,

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.000
whatever else and as we see as we went through

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the industrial revolution,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.450
the value of other forms of technology became...

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.480
or other forms of capital other than land

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.750
became more and more important

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.450
for our economy and obviously, slavery ended

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.420
in the mid late 1860's and obviously, that went away

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.460
but it's just an interesting way to think

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.000
about macroeconomic trends in the United States.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.610
Land in 1770 was a major factor of production

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.160
and still is obviously.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.440
We still need land in order to produce things,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.760
especially, agriculture.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.050
Well, this is agriculture

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.600
and it's still a major part.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.000
It's not like the land has disappeared.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's just that the economy has grown

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to be much more than just agriculture.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.560
In 1770, agriculture was a big part

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.550
of our economy.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.000
Now, agriculture is a much, much smaller

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.230
part of our economy.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.000
This is just an interesting way

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to think about, well, okay, this is all of the capital

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and this both public and private capital included here.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.470
Public capital would be something

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.380
that is owned by the public, by the government

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.000
while private capital would be something

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.660
that is owned by private individuals

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.590
or corporations or whatever else

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.000
but you see on average, you have had kind of a

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.780
a fairly constant give or take a little bit

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.530
that the total value of the capital

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.000
has been around four to five times

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.580
the value of the total productive output,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.310
four to five times the value

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.500
of the total productive output of the country.
