00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi, I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course: Navigating Digital Information.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.750
When you were a kid, did you ever hear the
phrase “Because I said so”?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.200
Like, I most often say that after my kids
ask why they can’t have m&amp;Ms for dinner.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.930
The answer to which, of course, is “you
will get scurvy if you eat that way.”

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.080
But that just leads to more questions about
scurvy, and them begging to take a multivitamin

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.610
so they can eat M&amp;Ms--It’s because I said
so!

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.020
I say this because it gets results.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.740
You listen to your parents because, you know,
they’re your parents.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.920
And also because they can take your phone
away.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.890
But as you grow older, “because I said so”
no longer cuts it.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.560
If you told your boss you deserve a raise
“because I said so” you’re liable to

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.560
get fired.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.640
Also, I can’t afford raises, Stan.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.100
Do you think my fleet of lamborghinis pays
for itself?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.239
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again,
if you want a raise, you need to learn how

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.280
to change the oil in a lamborghini.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280
NO!

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.489
You need to provide evidence that you deserve
the raise, and that evidence needs to be convincing.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.899
And that’s how online information works,
too.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.710
Not only should you look for reliable sources
of information, but they should provide convincing

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.320
evidence for their claims.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.650
Solid evidence, ideally.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.140
And often, they don’t.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.030
So today we’re going to focus on how to
tell good evidence from bad evidence, and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.140
maybe importantly, how to identify “Fine
but that doesn’t actually prove your point”

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.140
evidence.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.640
The stuff that the internet is built on.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.700
INTRO

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.830
In the past few weeks, we’ve learned how
to ask and answer the questions “Who said

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.350
that and why?” when we encounter new online
information.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.229
But those two questions alone aren’t enough
to properly evaluate information.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.970
We need to add another question to our repertoire:
“What is the evidence?”

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.799
Why do we need evidence?

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.330
Can’t we just find a trustworthy source
and believe whatever they say?

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.000
Wouldn’t that just be, you know, easier?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.299
Well, yes, and it’s important to find and
trust reliable sources of information, the

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.220
credibility of their claims depends on the
evidence provided to back them up.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.020
Evidence could be anything, really -- text,
photos, videos, data -- as long as it supports

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.340
a claim and gives you a good reason to believe
it’s true.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.190
If someone is making a factual claim -- and
not just voicing a subjective opinion -- then

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.450
they need to provide proof in order for us
to believe it.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.310
This classic tweet by comedian Nathan Fielder
explains it all.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.290
In the photo you see Nathan laughing, looking
off camera.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.720
The tweet reads “Out on the town having
the time of my life with a bunch of friends.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.310
They're all just out of frame, laughing too.”

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.100
To ruin the joke by explaining it, Nathan
probably isn’t out on the town with friends,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.120
otherwise, he would show them laughing instead
of this lonely selfie.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.209
It’s funny because the evidence doesn’t
back up the claim.

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.140
But often, when the evidence does not back
up the claim, it’s not funny.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.690
It’s just misinformation.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.890
Or disinformation.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.510
As you probably know from just existing on
the internet, it is really easy to hop online

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.160
and make any claim you want.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.550
Like, I know this is going to sound wild,
but you can literally type anything you want

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.870
into this box and click tweet, and share it
with the world.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.330
Like, the only thing this box will not publish
to the public is a thought longer than 280

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.450
characters.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.450
What a system!

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.350
But the same is true across social media:
Politicians claim their opponents are bad

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.650
choices for government on facebook.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.310
Conspiracy theorists take to YouTube to falsely
claim the Earth is flat.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.620
Celebrities use Instagram to claim they lost
weight using lollipops.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.769
And of course, on Tumblr everyone is claiming
that your fave could never, and/or is problematic.

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.130
If a source provides no evidence at all to
back up its claims, we should be suspicious

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.130
immediately.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.120
I mean, without evidence, we have no way to
know if its claims are true -- and thus no

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.080
reason to believe that they are.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.180
For instance, take a look at this Facebook
post that went viral in the summer of 2018.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.290
It was shared 1.5 million times.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.549
It says, “New Deadly Spider Spreads Across
USA

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.120
The Spider From Hell.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.480
Five people have died this week due to the
bite of this deadly spider.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.530
This spider was first seen in South Carolina
in July.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.930
Since then it has caused deaths in West Virginia,
Tennessee and Mississippi.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.250
One bite from this spider is deadly.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.250
U.S.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.860
Government working on a[n] anti-venom.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.489
At this time please make your family and friends
aware.”

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.049
The source is a seemingly random Facebook
user you don’t know.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.669
Although many posts you’ll encounter on
Facebook are from friends or friends of friends,

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.369
you’ll also find posts from strangers.

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:27.539
And if they’re not public figures, you may
not be able to verify their identity outside

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.539
of Facebook.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.009
So, to determine if their information is trustworthy,
we need to look at the evidence.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.900
The post features photos of an admittedly
terrifying-looking spider.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.190
But it doesn’t include any other evidence.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.039
It doesn’t say what type of spider this
is, where it typically lives, or how it traveled

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.539
from South Carolina to West Virginia without
visiting Virginia.

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.539
Wait!

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.539
Maybe it’s a flying spider.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.779
Stan, are we sure that this deadly flying
spider isn’t real?

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.219
There are also, tellingly, no links to the
news stories about the deaths that this spider

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.629
supposedly caused, because you know, there
weren’t any.

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.899
Also, there is nothing to suggest the government
is studying an antidote.

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.520
Or for that matter, A antidote.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.090
Now, fact-checking site Snopes.com debunked
this all pretty easily.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.750
They searched reputable sources for deaths
attributed to this spider and found nothing.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.039
They also found the person who initially posted
this hoax has started other hoaxes in the

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.039
past.

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.110
In this case, the lack of evidence was reason
to be very suspicious.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.159
We didn’t necessarily need Snopes to tell
us there’s no deadly spider taking over

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:31.180
the American south, but it is nice to be able
to confirm our suspicions with another party.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.759
But of course, the mere existence of evidence
is not enough to verify a claim, though.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.539
For instance, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe
once brought a snowball onto the Senate floor

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.979
in order to disprove global warming.

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.999
It was February 2015 and he said that scientists
had claimed 2014 was the warmest year on record.

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:53.669
Then he pulled a snowball out of a plastic
bag and threw it on the ground.

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:54.669
Inside the Senate.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.529
He was trying to use the snowball as evidence
that the planet was not getting warmer because

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.669
it was cold in Washington, DC -- because you
know, it was winter.

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.660
But we know, thanks to science, that winter
continues to exist in many parts of the world,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.839
but at the same time, the planet as a whole
is also warming.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.939
A snowball does not disprove climate change
any more than a heat wave proves it, because

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:22.909
weather is what happens every day in the atmosphere,
and climate is what’s happening overall.

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.000
And what’s happening overall is that things
are getting hotter.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.889
For another example, in 2017 a conspiracy
theory cropped up on anonymous Internet message

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:36.080
boards claiming the United States Department
of Justice was secretly investigating a global

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.229
pedophile ring.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.479
The so-called evidence for this included pictures
of Hillary Clinton, her daughter Chelsea Clinton

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.219
and Sen. John McCain wearing boots for foot
injuries at different times.

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:50.930
The boots were supposedly covering up ankle
monitors tracking them all during the investigation.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.610
But, of course, all those photos actually
prove is that feet are kind of easy to injure.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.589
And get easier to injure as you age.

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:02.719
All of which brings me to perhaps the most
important lesson of this episode: Not all

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:04.839
evidence is created equal.

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:09.419
The evidence a source provides should come
from another reliable source.

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:12.610
And if you find yourself starting to believe
complicated conspiracy theories, which, by

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.110
the way, I think we all do on the internet
in 2018, you need to ask yourself, “does

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.979
this information really make sense, or am
I just making it make sense in my brain?”

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.369
And two, perhaps more importantly, ‘does
this information confirm my pre-existing world

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:30.400
view which makes me pre-disposed to believing
it?’

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.629
Take this Axios report with the headline “Climate
change may boost pests, stress food supplies.”

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:39.259
It says the global climate change could make
millions food insecure in the future.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.999
The article goes on to cite the findings of
a new study from researchers at the University

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:47.929
of Washington, Stanford University, University
of Vermont, and University of Colorado.

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:52.341
That study was published in Science, which
some quick lateral reading can tell you, is

00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:56.089
a well-respected peer reviewed journal, god
I love lateral reading.

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:57.969
But they didn’t just cite that one study.

00:07:57.969 --> 00:08:02.770
Axios also provided context in the form of
a Harvard study published in a different peer-reviewed

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.459
journal and comments from a scientist not
involved in either study.

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:08.899
In other words, they showed their receipts.

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:13.400
So really, a search for reliable information
online is a search for reliable evidence.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.719
Let’s take a closer look in the Thought
Bubble.

00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:16.719
OK.

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:18.099
Imagine this post pops into your news feed:

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:21.189
I can’t believe the mainstream media is
hiding this story.

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:23.759
The moon landing was fake this whole time.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:28.969
It’s accompanied by an image from the 1969
moon landing and includes a link to a video

00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:31.110
called: Were the moon landings faked?

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.430
At face value, this post is claiming that
the U.S. government never actually sent astronauts

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.390
to the moon in 1969.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.149
The evidence provided is a video purporting
to explain how they deceived the public.

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:47.400
But the presence of evidence, here in the
form of a video link, does not guarantee the

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.500
claim’s validity.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.970
If you follow the link, you’ll find the
video in question belongs to a channel called

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.290
“Alltime Conspiracies.”

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:58.540
It’s a channel is filled with videos about
conspiracy theories and supposed cover-ups,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.660
like “10 real life vampires.”

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.000
Not exactly a trustworthy source.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.980
There have only been 4 vampires in real history.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.311
The video itself points out both what conspiracy
theorists have said about the moon landing

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:11.620
and what official sources have said.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.149
But the video is structured to make you think
some questions have been left unanswered.

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:20.029
YouTube has also added an information panel
to the video that points to the Encyclopedia

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:22.579
Britannica article on the Apollo Space Program.

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:27.220
Because YouTube wants you to look for information
from other sources, especially around topics

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.940
that are prone to misinformation.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.350
But let’s be clear: the moon landing definitely
happened.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.170
And for it not to have happened, a conspiracy
would have needed to involve thousands of

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.680
people.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.050
Thousands of people never conspire to do anything
secretly.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.040
The video may have looked interesting, but
if you check the evidence, you will see how

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.339
clearly wrong the post is.

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:49.339
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:53.720
So sometimes, the source of evidence for a
claim will be reliable, it just won’t exactly

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.440
be relevant to the argument.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.140
Like, say you read a story online about how
e-cigarette companies are marketing their

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.480
products to be attractive to teens.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.439
Someone has commented on it, saying “It’s
totally safe for kids.

00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:07.130
After all, they help people stop smoking,
don’t they?”

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.130
But wait a minute.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.810
What does smoking cessation have to do with kids using e-cigarettes?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.810
Nothing.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.300
This is a classic case of utilizing evidence
that may be relevant to the broader topic

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.959
of conversation -- in this case, e-cigarettes
-- but doesn’t actually have any bearing

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:24.150
on the claim at hand -- that e-cigarettes
are safe for kids.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.420
And the use of irrelevant evidence like this
can be a big obstacle when evaluating online

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.420
information.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.750
Because not only must you determine whether
a source sharing information is credible,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.850
you also have to determine whether they’ve
provided evidence and whether that evidence

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.850
is credible.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.240
And this irrelevant evidence or evidence that
doesn’t quite make the right point is all

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.540
around us online.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.420
One very popular form of irrelevant evidence
is the spurious correlation.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.149
A spurious correlation is the implied causal
relationship between events that are coincidentally

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:55.149
linked.

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:56.980
And this happens constantly with data.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.339
For instance, there’s a strong correlation
between the number of people who drown by

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:06.209
falling into a pool every year and the number
of films that Nicolas Cage appears in that

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:07.209
year.

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:11.389
But Nicolas Cage movies do not, like, throw
people into pools, because CORRELATION IS

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:12.769
NOT CAUSATION.

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:17.579
For instance, plenty of blog posts and misleading
news articles have incorrectly implied a connection

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:22.250
between the rate of vaccines given to children
and the rate of autism diagnoses.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.460
In the past few decades, the number of vaccines
recommended for kids has gone up as new medical

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.790
discoveries have been made.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.459
The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder
has also increased over the past few decades.

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:37.649
Despite bountiful scientific evidence showing
there is no link between these two facts,

00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:42.689
many continue to believe and use the web to
spread the idea that vaccines “cause”

00:11:42.689 --> 00:11:43.689
autism.

00:11:43.689 --> 00:11:48.449
In fact, they’ve been so successful in spreading
this spurious correlation that a drop in vaccination

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:52.399
rates and an outbreak of measles swept through
Europe in 2018.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:55.829
So this is not only about spiders that don’t
exist.

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:59.249
This is, in some cases, a true matter of life
and death.

00:11:59.249 --> 00:12:03.810
Interrogating the evidence our online sources
provide us is incredibly important.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:09.269
We need to ask whether that evidence is reliable
and whether it actually backs up the claim

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:10.279
being made.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:14.399
The quality of our evidence, like the quality
of our information, effects the quality of

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.769
our decisions.

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.540
And also the prevalence of measles.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.620
We’ll dig even deeper into evidence next
week.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.600
I’ll see you then.
