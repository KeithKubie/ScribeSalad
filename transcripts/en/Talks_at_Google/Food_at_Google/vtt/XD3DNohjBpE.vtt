00:00:02.264 --> 00:00:03.680
CHRIS YING: My
name is Chris Ying.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.590
I'm the editor-in-chief
of a magazine called

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.791
Lucky Peach I
always forget when I

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:09.207
come to do these
that I'm supposed

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:10.670
to introduce the person.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.279
And in this case, I'm
introducing myself to you

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.070
for the first time.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.340
I've never met Chef.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.950
JOSE ANDRES: How are you, man?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.560
CHRIS YING: But it is a great
honor for someone like me--

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.580
a tremendous privilege to get
to sit here and talk to you.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.565
I think that, as evidenced
by how many cooks I

00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:27.940
see in here in chef's coats--
and people who have come up

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.050
here to take photos with
you, people who are in the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.590
know in the food world really,
really, admire and respect you,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.610
and I am among those.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.690
Jose Andres is
the chef and owner

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.380
of the Think Food
Group, which includes

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.980
innumerable restaurants
across the United States,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.280
in Miami, Los Angeles,
DC-- places like Minibar

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.980
in Jaleo and now Beef Steak,
which we'll talk about today.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.130
But when you started
cooking, Chef,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.490
did you intend to be
speaking someday at a tech

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.450
campus in Mountain View?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.474
Is that why you set out cooking?

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:09.140
JOSE ANDRES: This is
a good place to be.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.200
I've been here
already a few times.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.430
I came as a
translator and nobody

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370
could understand anything.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.320
So now, finally, they
invite me as a speaker.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830
And look, 50 people showed
up, so, that's great.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.830
But yeah, it feels good.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.290
I don't know about
you guys, but I'm 45,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.650
and I Iook so old already
with three daughters.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.740
I look at myself in the
mirror and you wonder.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.060
But since I was very
young, I knew very clear

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.120
that I wanted to be a cook.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.690
My father and my mother very
much planted the seed of that.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.910
Helping my father making
Sunday paellas for anybody

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.340
that would show up in
the middle of the forest

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.910
and helping my father gather
the wood, and helping my father

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.990
make the fire.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.490
I fell in love with
making the fire.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.781
Until one day I told my dad,
why don't you let me cook?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.240
He said, no, I need
you to do the fire.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.720
Yeah, but I know how
to make the fire.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.190
Make somebody else
make the fire.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.380
I want to cook.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.445
No, I need you to do the fire.

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:11.774
Paella and fire, hand by hand.

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:13.149
If you don't have
the right fire,

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.550
it will never be a right paella.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.950
One day, he got very upset,
very upset, a big tantrum.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.472
He sent me to the forest,
"Go to the forest."

00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:26.930
When we finished,
he came and said,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.990
"My son, I know you were
upset because I'm not

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.781
letting you cook and
you think that cooking

00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:33.120
is the most important part.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.355
But, actually, I gave you
the most important task.

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.850
That was making the fire.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.710
If you control the fire,
then and only then one day,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.954
you'll be able to cook."

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:45.412
Since then, I've
been always trying

00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:49.090
to search what really
is my fire, what really

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.080
is what holds everything else.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.810
The cooking is the obvious.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.660
When we are able to achieve
success in the non-obvious

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.470
is when things begin moving.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.544
So sorry for this
answer to your question.

00:03:01.544 --> 00:03:02.710
CHRIS YING: Don't apologize.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.603
It was poetic.

00:03:03.603 --> 00:03:04.810
It was beautiful.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.330
It's interesting you
bring up your upbringing.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.730
I tend to believe that
environment, whether it's

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.290
social, cultural, or
literal environment,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.920
has a lot to do with creativity.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.180
And you are a Spanish chef.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.010
You worked at El Bulli, and so
many great, innovative cooks

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.910
have come out of El Bulli--
out of Spain specifically.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.800
Is there something about
the Spanish culture,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.740
about the Spanish culinary
world that produces

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.940
innovative cooks like you?

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.510
JOSE ANDRES: It's very
funny because there

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.400
is this list called
the 50 best, which

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.900
is the biggest
gimmick of marketing

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.080
in the history of marketing.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.860
But I'm telling you this, and I
would love to be in that list.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.450
So on one side, I tell you it's
a big gimmick and marketing

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.440
thing.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.165
On the other side, I'll
tell you I'm working hard

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:56.290
to be one day on that list.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.440
But Ferran Adria was number one
for many years, rightfully so.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.070
And now, for three years
already, Joan Roca, number one,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.630
again.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.910
It's funny because when I was
16, Joan Roca, who has just

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.220
been named the best
chef in the world,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.195
he worked in my station one
month with me as my assistant.

00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:22.250
He was five, six
years older than me.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.480
And I really loved that man.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.630
He's from Girona, one
hour away from El Bulli,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.880
one hour away from Cadaques.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.390
Cadaques is the land where
Dali, the great painter

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.320
had his house.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.670
And he was nuts like a clown.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.900
You can only paint what
he painted and be nuts.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.290
Well, the great
Dali right there.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.690
I don't know if he's the
wind, but out of that area

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.820
has been a lot of creativity.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.310
And this will be funny to
study how the environment can

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.270
create creative minds.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.043
Ferran Adria, as much
as you say today there's

00:04:55.043 --> 00:04:57.870
many great chefs in the
world, the last revolution

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.840
we've seen in the last
15 years, 20 years only

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.670
happened because we had
two great minds born

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.175
in the same family with
the same last name, Ferran

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:08.700
Adria and Albert Adria.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.900
And everybody has benefited
from it-- everybody.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.800
We give them some
kind of-- some people

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.770
may say he's the best
chef in the world,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.150
but it's not obvious.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.780
We will only see how obvious
it is 100 years from now.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.750
But Ferran Adria and El
Bulli single-handedly,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.840
they inspire everybody around
them, I mean the Spanish chefs.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.430
Spain was the first country
having conferences, where we

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.770
all shared everything we knew.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.390
If I'm working with MIT now
on water surface tension,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.490
and I'm training
five new dishes only

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.520
on the standing principles
of water surface tension.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.640
And we're able to
develop a flour that

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.217
is able to grab
water, I will go on,

00:05:59.217 --> 00:06:00.800
I will share this
with all my friends.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.090
If the chefs of
Spain were the CEOs

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.360
of every pharmaceutical
industry in the world,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.610
today will be zero
sickness in the world.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.300
That's how big creativity
has been in Spain.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.310
Before Ferran there were others,
but Ferran single-handedly

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.650
is the person that
was like Google.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.260
Single-handedly
ignited a revolution

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.740
in culinary thinking that
is going beyond cooking.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.324
I'm very happy that I was part
of that Big Bang that exploded

00:06:37.324 --> 00:06:37.990
and I was there.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.910
I saw the star explode.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.730
I saw Ferran get
a piece of gelatin

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.610
in my station-- I had the
fryer-- almond gelatin.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.210
And I was frying-- I had the
almond gelatin for one dish

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.830
and I was frying
artichoke chips.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.970
And I could see that he
was looking at the gelatin

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.570
and looking at the hot oil.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.320
And I said, I cannot believe
this guy will not do it.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.821
He got the hot gelatin
and put it in the hot oil.

00:07:08.821 --> 00:07:10.320
Common sense, what
it will tell you?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.390
If you Google it,
water, hot oil,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.280
it will tell you don't do it.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.674
Oil is hydrophobic.

00:07:23.674 --> 00:07:24.590
Actually it's royalty.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.465
It doesn't like to be
mixed with water, which

00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:27.930
is the poor, lowly people.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.670
Well, he did it,
and it exploded.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.990
But he knew it was going
to explode, by maybe not.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.680
Nonetheless, many years
later, that gelatin of almond

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.220
looks like milk gelatin.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.695
It looks like the beschamel that
in Spain we make croquettas,

00:07:47.695 --> 00:07:49.860
the fried croquettes.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.590
Eight years later, Ferran
created the liquid croquette.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.990
You see?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.360
That's what happened there
for a very strange reason.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.330
He was not prepared.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.038
He did not study.

00:08:01.038 --> 00:08:02.405
He was at his washer.

00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:03.780
You can barely
understand when he

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.830
talks because he's
thinking so much

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.590
quicker that his
words don't make it

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.790
into his tongue
to really deliver

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.320
what he's trying to tell you.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.680
He doesn't care.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.960
He's happy with himself.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.060
He knows where he's going.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.210
And if you try to follow,
he'll be happy you come.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.410
But something happened
in Spain, and we should

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.780
be investigating what it is.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.990
I don't know if it's a
spore from a mushroom.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.240
I don't know, but
it's very funny

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.080
to understand that it's
an environment that

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.840
created a lot of creative people
in the shortest span of time

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.190
that we connect.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.020
When I bring new people to
my creative team-- like,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.541
that's not a good example, but
I read that Saddam Hussein only

00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:47.290
covered himself with
people from his town.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.750
So myself, I feel very protected
bringing people from my town,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.600
because the moment
I bring them, I

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.410
don't need to tell
them anything.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.360
But if I show them a
squash blossom and I say,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.770
you know what we should do?

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.472
I don't have to say anything
else after the question mark.

00:09:06.472 --> 00:09:08.263
Everybody's going to
get the squash blossom

00:09:08.263 --> 00:09:10.910
and is going to start
working, and we're

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.977
going to come up with a lot of
things with the squash blossom.

00:09:13.977 --> 00:09:15.935
And this is something
like this in the air that

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:18.100
is non-tangible.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.720
It's intangible.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.510
And it's very fascinating
when the click happens.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.810
I guess all of you
Googlers of the world,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.460
you are the same kind
of DNA, rare species.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.770
That's how you all come
here, and everybody

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.700
works on different things,
but it's like a common.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.940
In my world, I try
to bring people

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.735
that we kind of were
touched by the same spores

00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:46.430
and same strange things
that are in the air, water,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.000
and soil of Catalonia
and that part of Spain.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.898
CHRIS YING: We've only
just met for as long

00:09:52.898 --> 00:09:53.870
as we've been sitting
here, but I already

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.181
appreciate that you've
said 50 Best is a gimmick.

00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:58.180
You've mentioned Albert
Adria in the same breath

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.530
as Ferran, which people
always forget about.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.190
And you're into Saddam
Hussein as an inspiration.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.880
So these are all
powerful things to me.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.990
JOSE ANDRES: But things
can also show good.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.850
CHRIS YING: Sure.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.230
JOSE ANDRES: Shit.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.031
I see the title.

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:18.340
CHRIS YING: I think
it's interesting.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.535
I wanted to stay on this
on this idea of environment

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:22.500
and creativity a
little bit longer.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.830
I always think it's really
appropriate and interesting

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.680
that so many innovative
tech companies are based

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.820
in Nortthern California
in the Bay Area,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.010
not in, say, Los
Angeles or New York.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.265
And I really tend to believe--

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:34.330
JOSE ANDRES: Or Washington, DC.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.579
CHRIS YING: Or Washington, DC.

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:38.160
I think that it has to do with
whatever spores are in the air

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.660
here.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.650
I really think that.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.230
You are a decidedly
Spanish chef.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.570
Your background is in Spain,
but your empire is in America.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.200
And so what is it about
America in general

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.470
that is suitable or fertile
ground for your type of cooking

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.580
or your restaurants?

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.510
JOSE ANDRES: I have-- I
mean, I don't have an empire.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.170
I have 21 restaurants.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.190
CHRIS YING: I have none.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.370
JOSE ANDRES: But my dream is
one day to have a unicorn.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.830
I want to be worth
$1 billion very soon.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.330
Right now, I think my company's
worth-- some stupid partners

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.540
of mine pay for 30%.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.890
So technically, my company
is worth $25, $30 million,

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.250
which is kind of funny because
I came with $40 to America.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.680
So it's a good start.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.770
But then you see that some other
companies are worth $1 billion.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.870
I'm like, what the fuck?

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.095
I'm only worth $40 and it
took me all these years.

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:39.910
So I'm trying to speed that up.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.170
So [INAUDIBLE] America, I
was in the Spanish navy.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:48.230
I was the cook of the admiral
and I was like, really?

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.540
I saw when I was little
in the port of Barcelona

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.030
with my father a ship called
Juan Sebastian Elcano.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:12:00.172
It's a midshipman-training
ship for the Spanish navy.

00:12:00.172 --> 00:12:02.630
And I told my dad, what do I
have to do to go on that boat?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:08.030
Once you are old enough,
you will join the Navy.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.140
And then, if you're lucky,
you'll go on that boat.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.300
Many years later, I was lucky.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.490
I always look at the stars.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.770
I say, please, and
then things happen.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.483
I go into the Navy.

00:12:19.483 --> 00:12:22.440
They don't put me in the ship
or give me the opportunity

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.396
to choose a ship.

00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:24.895
They put me to cook
for the admiral.

00:12:24.895 --> 00:12:26.530
Are you kidding?

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.550
I'm coming from working
summer after summer

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.179
for 16 hours a day.

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:32.220
I can go to see the world,
and they're putting me

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.600
in the house of the admiral?

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.390
It was like "Desperate
Housewives" of the Navy.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.200
They [INAUDIBLE] with their
wives, which they are adorable,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.330
but you know what I mean.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.336
And finally, I went and
I knocked on the door

00:12:45.336 --> 00:12:48.770
and I told the admiral--
if you knock on the door,

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.990
things happen, right?

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.466
Like when you put any
word in your thing.

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:54.540
Things happen.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.520
I begin looking for something,
and I end somewhere else.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.330
It's magnificent.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.820
It's a very powerful thing,
if you think about it.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.650
Me, most of the time when I put
the word, I end somewhere else.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.720
Like right now, I'm
trying to tell him

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.680
what's happening in America,
and I'm going back to Spain

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.810
30 years ago.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.900
But there's an end to this.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.850
So finally, he
grants me permission.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.490
His wife is screaming.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.190
They had to bring
her against the door

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.690
because she didn't
want me to leave.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.880
Don't go, Jose.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.910
But I go on the ship.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.420
I come to America.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.470
I arrived to Pensacola.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.720
One of the flags there, they
celebrate the five flags,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.990
is the Spanish flag.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.570
I'm like, shit, I belong here.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.680
I knew it.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.740
I arrived in New York.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.650
I finished my Navy, and I'm
like, where do I want to be?

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.750
I wanted to be in America.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.720
Why?

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.370
Because I could sense
that one guy could

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:51.920
be on Fifth Avenue with an
ugly, smelly, dirty hot dog

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:59.300
stand and be his own
king in his own kingdom.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.020
And if you can
succeed in selling

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.340
hot dogs in an ugly cart, with
hot dogs that you don't know

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.890
how many bacterias
they have around them--

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.705
but then nothing happens
because technology

00:14:09.705 --> 00:14:12.309
is making those hot dogs.

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:13.350
It used to be believable.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.141
You can leave them in
the street for a year

00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:17.470
and nothing happens
to the hot dog.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.685
That simple thing of seeing
that so many people who

00:14:21.685 --> 00:14:23.970
were non-Americans--
you will go to Queens,

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.930
you will go to Little Columbia
and there would be the arepa

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:27.980
stand.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.300
So, shit, there's
things happening here.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.670
So me coming to America
became the biggest university

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.210
of my life.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.710
I left school when I was 14,
15, and my life university

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.260
has been being around places
that really motivate me.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.180
So for me, coming to New
York was a life experience.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.470
And I wish I knew 25 years
ago what I know today,

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.480
business-wise.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.240
Because once you understand
the business side, any dreams

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.630
and creativity you have, you
can make it happen on your own.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.910
You don't need anybody else.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.810
So that's-- I fell in love
with America and the dream that

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.010
anything's possible.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.230
I repeat this all the time.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.144
Winston Churchill, he's one of
my most inspirational phrases

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:12.560
that I ever heard,
that success is

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.370
going from failure to failure
without losing enthusiasm.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.695
And if you apply this
to your life, shit.

00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:22.700
Life is great.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.340
You are trying to
make an omelette,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.670
and you go up in the
air, and it breaks down.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.420
Shit, change the
name of the dish,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.240
scrambled eggs with potatoes.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.130
Simple.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.820
But you can apply this
to more serious things.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.600
And I learned that when you keep
changing the name of the dish,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.580
amazing things
happen to your life.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.820
If you keep complaining
that your omelette broke,

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.370
nothing will happen.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.810
If you all of a sudden
change the name of dish,

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.910
all of a sudden, you
create something else.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.970
Every time you
flip the omelette,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.075
take the pan out and
out let it break.

00:15:58.075 --> 00:16:01.620
It's big fucking creativity.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.130
Imagine when we apply the same
things to very serious things.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.877
Amazing things will happen.

00:16:07.877 --> 00:16:09.460
CHRIS YING: It's
always so interesting

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.930
to hear someone in
your position talk

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.010
about things like that because
Americans, we romanticize

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.410
Spain, Italy, Japan, and
Turkey as these amazing places

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.310
to eat at and go,
and we never think we

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.518
have anything like that here.

00:16:22.518 --> 00:16:26.320
But there's something romantic
about Americans' food culture

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.650
as well.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.690
I want to talk a little bit
about innovation and Minibar

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.550
and creativity.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.390
And Minibar, your
restaurant in DC,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:42.300
strikes me as the most difficult
kind of restaurant to have.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.655
It's so intensely experiential.

00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:46.570
It's not just come in,
sit down, eat, leave.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.020
And there's so much going on.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.350
People come into your
restaurant expecting something

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.600
they've never seen before.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.580
And in the wrong hands, those
are the worst restaurants

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.610
that you can possibly go
to if somebody doesn't

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.660
know what they're doing.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.290
So talk to me
about your process.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.010
And obviously, so
much of it has to do

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.332
with your experience
and the fact

00:17:05.332 --> 00:17:07.040
that you know what
the fuck you're doing.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.630
But how often do you
have to edit yourself?

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.569
Where do these ideas come from?

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:17.880
How do you push without pushing
too far and losing people?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.060
JOSE ANDRES: First, I
try not to lose myself,

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.040
and then when I achieve
that-- first it's

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.309
understanding the team.

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:26.059
If you are one brain
and one person alone,

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:29.940
it's very difficult,
especially today.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.123
I think we have so
much information.

00:17:32.123 --> 00:17:34.105
In part, you are
the problem of there

00:17:34.105 --> 00:17:35.188
being so much information.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.640
But then when you
are able to focus,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.550
really, amazing
things will happen.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.970
So in the old days, cooks,
we would go to the market.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.410
We would buy our
carrots and our chicken.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.330
We'd come to the
kitchen and we'd

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.380
repeat the traditional
dishes of the past.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.910
That's what we've always done.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.204
All of a sudden, you move
away from your comfort zone.

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:01.620
I guess everyone
of you sometimes,

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.930
you'll have to move
from your comfort zone.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.660
If you're surrounded
by the same people

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.950
from the same
expertise as you, it's

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.780
one moment that you
become part of this circle

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.162
that then nothing else comes.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.560
It's good that you
are able to-- like

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.070
it was a comet that
came from another galaxy

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:29.340
and is the one that got the
first cells of life to Earth.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.290
This is the same in creativity.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:37.680
You need to be impacted by
others to keep creating life.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.540
And if you're not
impacted by others,

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.780
you have to become a meteor on
your own or comet on your own

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.050
and leave and try to crash
against another planet

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.550
in another galaxy.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.340
And things will happen.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.700
That's what I've always
been trying to do.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.630
Still, I go to the markets.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.470
Like, put on the video.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.030
But I go to the
markets and I do this.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.430
Put on the video of the market.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.470
[INAUDIBLE] today, yeah?

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.350
Oh my god.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.640
And then I go to the market.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.802
No, the market.

00:19:12.802 --> 00:19:15.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.670
JOSE ANDRES: Quick.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.438
So I go to the market.

00:19:19.438 --> 00:19:22.210
But I'm tired of buying.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.983
This is actually a terrible
example of creativity

00:19:24.983 --> 00:19:27.190
because nothing
happened out of that.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.810
The only good thing
is on the worst

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.110
day of the market, the
coldest day of the market,

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.170
with the least amount of
vegetables in the market,

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.730
we were able to bring
life to the market.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.240
So I got these 120 kids from
Astoria, my home region,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.710
who for some strange
reason, they adore me.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.980
And they came driving all night
to be in Washington with me,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.639
because I told them,
if you come to DC,

00:19:48.639 --> 00:19:49.680
I'll invite you to lunch.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.420
Shit.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.820
They came six hours driving.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.320
And once I'm there,
what do I do with them?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.000
They had their instruments.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.610
It's very unorganized.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:04.020
I took them to the market,
and I got all my chefs,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.060
and we got pans and pots.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.860
We began making noise, but
noise began getting a rhythm.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.480
And rhythm, by
[INAUDIBLE], becomes

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.300
being surrounded by instruments.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:22.010
Some of them are
local musicians.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:27.020
And all of a sudden,
violin will start playing.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.710
Cello will start playing,
trumpets, people clapping.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.170
All of a sudden, the
everyday market that you go

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.110
becomes something else.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.069
That's what I tried
to do every day.

00:20:42.069 --> 00:20:45.840
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.270
So, said that, I try
to go to Seattle,

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.920
and I knock on the
door of Dale Chihuly.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.880
What the fuck you want?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.690
I say, I want to work with you.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.770
And I create an entire
series of dishes

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.760
inspired of Dale Chihuly.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.455
Or I go to MIT, which
I don't understand

00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:08.630
a word those guys are trying to
tell me, but I look very smart.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.310
And because now for
some weird reason

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.740
I've been teaching
at Harvard, everybody

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.281
believes that when
you are in a room,

00:21:13.281 --> 00:21:15.820
you know what they're talking
about, which is fascinating,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.430
right?

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.680
Like because you know, Jose,
what we're talking about.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.810
I say, sure, yeah.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.020
Yeah, I know.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.479
I know this question
of energy, sure.

00:21:27.479 --> 00:21:28.520
And this is what happens.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.670
I began going away
from my comfort zone

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.890
every single time,
every time I can.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:34.940
And you begin learning.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.860
And when you talk about
meat, now it's not meat.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.580
It's pH.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.950
What is the pH of meat
when they kill meat?

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.570
What is your pH?

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.640
You have no clue.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.250
You have to Google it.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.260
And probably the
information will be wrong

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.550
because there's so many
places to get the information.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.750
So I began going to places.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.260
You move away of
your comfort zone,

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.790
life changes in amazing ways.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.940
You want to see a video?

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.360
Would you like to see a video of
my mother's cheese and almond,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.090
transformed by me, or a
spring garden inspired

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.193
on Dale Chihuly?

00:22:12.193 --> 00:22:12.818
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:22:12.818 --> 00:22:14.502
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:16.210
JOSE ANDRES: What kind
of people are you?

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:17.480
CHRIS YING: Let's
see your mother's--

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.270
JOSE ANDRES: I mean,
I ask you a question

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.490
and you answer me back.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.240
Give me a break.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.240
CHRIS YING: Let's see
your mother's dish.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.630
JOSE ANDRES: Huh?

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.338
CHRIS YING: Let's see
your mother's dish.

00:22:24.338 --> 00:22:26.947
JOSE ANDRES: OK, two ingredients
only, almonds and cheese.

00:22:26.947 --> 00:22:28.280
You know what I'm talking about?

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.650
Are you understanding English?

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.490
So this is my mother's almonds
and cheese, a very traditional

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.590
tapas what I'm about to do.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.570
We fry almonds.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.070
Who can fry almonds?

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.830
Everybody can fry almonds.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:49.190
We fry almonds, Marcona almonds,
the best almonds in the world.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.130
Now, California is under
fire because you guys

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.640
are ending the
water in California

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.660
because you produce
so much almonds.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.760
Give me a break.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.970
Almonds, water, we blend it.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.120
This is a very high tech dish.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.290
We are making like
almond butter, right?

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.540
We put it on a Paco
Jet, and that machine

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.410
allows us to get even
a thinner butter, OK?

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.890
You see how cute?

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.460
Mm.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.190
Wow.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.665
That's the best almond
butter in the world.

00:23:21.665 --> 00:23:25.160
You'd have to be peanuts to
have peanut butter once you

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.040
taste this.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.110
Then we had add cream,
and we blend further.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.750
And now what we've done, we
changed the form of the almond.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.580
Why we did that?

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.300
Because the almond
tells me, Jose,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.060
I am tired to look
like my other almonds.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.222
I want to be different.

00:23:39.222 --> 00:23:40.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.580
I want to be
different for my life.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.340
I'm tired of looking
like an almond.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.640
I don't want to be recognized.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.680
CHRIS YING: It's like
Bruce Jenner of almonds.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.388
JOSE ANDRES: Yup.

00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:53.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.720
We use liquid nitrogen, that
now every single food created,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.820
finger points.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.860
Not too long ago, oh,
this chef is not natural.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.195
He's using liquid nitrogen.
Shit, we can use a microwave

00:24:04.195 --> 00:24:05.460
and it's OK.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.880
And take a look what happens.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.090
The almond is being changed.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.150
Now it's frozen.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.350
And it's frozen, and the form
has been changed completely.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:17.700
Now the almond becomes
something like you can hold

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.250
that dreams of anything else.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.330
And that is the dream of cheese.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.070
Look at what happens
when it melts.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.030
It goes back to
its natural state.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.940
But by applying temperature
and changing its form,

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.320
we were able to change an
almond in whatever we wanted.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.482
And the cheese tells
me, I'm tired of being

00:24:35.482 --> 00:24:36.760
eaten the same way.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.400
Change me.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.840
And we are changing it further.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.380
And we are making this mousse.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.760
You see nitro oxide, which is
an amazing, amazing technique.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.420
And there, we are able
to put the lightest

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.500
mousse in the history of your
life, a touch of passionfruit,

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.990
a little bit of the
almond, Marcona, grated.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.155
And those are the
cheese and almonds

00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:01.660
that my mother
serves to everybody.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.084
So did I answer?

00:25:06.084 --> 00:25:08.469
CHRIS YING: Yes.

00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:11.154
You know, so often
people look at-- when you

00:25:11.154 --> 00:25:12.320
see that, you understand it.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.870
You understand
where it came from,

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.580
why each technique happened.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.960
There's no excess move there.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.460
You're doing what it calls for.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.670
So often, modernist cooking,
avant-garde cooking,

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.050
whatever you want to call
it, gets sort of identified

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.241
as like a fringe thing.

00:25:27.241 --> 00:25:28.240
It's like a crazy thing.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.620
It's a fringe thing.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.800
But those techniques end up
trickling down all the time.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.830
And every new cooking
technique was weird and off

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.489
at some point.

00:25:36.489 --> 00:25:37.280
JOSE ANDRES: Agree.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.404
CHRIS YING: You've been
doing this for a while now.

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:43.440
Have you seen things that were
once crazy, avant-garde bleed

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.670
into normal, like
what everybody eats?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.040
JOSE ANDRES: At Starbucks when
you ask for the cappuccino--

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.190
I read that they took the
cappuccino out of the menu?

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.110
What they were thinking?

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.170
Did the CEO press the
wrong Send button?

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.925
They took cappuccino
out of every Starbucks?

00:26:02.925 --> 00:26:04.912
I didn't know that.

00:26:04.912 --> 00:26:06.370
I found out on
Google this morning.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.130
I mean it.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.980
I mean it, very recent.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.840
If you go, you'll see they have
these bottles, the same bottle.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.960
And they make whipped cream.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.220
But this is going to be
revolutionizing the world even

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.960
further, because I don't
think we began using them yet

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.740
to its full potential.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.720
But you can make mousses that
they are butterless, creamless.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:36.350
We can make a mousse out of
water-- a mousse out of water,

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.240
tasty and amazing.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.990
So this is a simple,
amazing revolution

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.150
that is going to trickle
down for years to come.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.210
And food doesn't go
to waste, because you

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.070
can conserve, thanks to
the CO2 if you are using it

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.010
for soda, other types.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.270
Or the nitro oxide,
you can keep it

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.380
for weeks, two weeks,
three weeks, four weeks.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.630
And it doesn't go bad.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.230
So it's a good, good revolution.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:08.130
But one of the revolutions, for
example, is over 200 years old

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.850
and I'm so sad we
are not using it

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.730
to feed 1.x billion people
in the world that are hungry,

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.510
would be canning.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.910
If you Google it, and
you put "canning,"

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.510
you're going to see one guy
shows up, Nicolas Appert.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.460
Initially, this was
invented in 1810.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.410
This was invented because
Napoleon Bonaparte needed a way

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.310
to feed the troops.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.100
And he was right.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:39.330
He lost the campaign of
Russia because he lacked food.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.230
He was giving 10,000
francs to anybody

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.000
who will come up with a system.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.540
Nicolas Appert came up with
a method called Apperture

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.640
and was the invention
of canning, 1809,

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.320
printed the book in 1810.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.030
I'm very proud of
this because I own

00:27:54.030 --> 00:28:00.670
one of the original
works signed by him.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.050
That was a counterfeiting thing.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.591
He didn't sign
because he was famous.

00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:06.770
It was the way to say,
this is my invention.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.396
And I hold this in high esteem.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:10.770
I wish that today
in third world,

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.720
we would be using
canning to preserve

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.520
the goodness of the Earth.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.980
I'm not an expert around the
world, but Haiti I know well.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.380
Cambodia I know well.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.180
And our culture goes
to waste because they

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.120
don't have a way to preserve
the foods most of the time.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.210
And thus I began wondering,
how did we make that happen?

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.750
Why is canning
not something like

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.410
that's more available to
that part of the world?

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.860
We were able to start preserving
the goodness of the Earth.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.760
At the very least,
they don't have

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.940
to be spending more
energy than they receive

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.530
to try to keep
searching for food,

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.780
that this is what's happening.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.190
The poor of the world,
it's a very simple equation

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.930
of more energy spent in
trying to feed themselves

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.710
than the food they're
able to feed themselves.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:00.930
So they are negative in
the calorie equation.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.150
If we are able to change
the calorie equation, all

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.030
of a sudden, there would not
be poor people in the world.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.450
And the world will be richer
because more people with money

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:14.200
and non-poor means the world
should be doing better.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.990
So imagine how technology
can be changing

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.740
the lives of the
many by only changing

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.280
the imbalance of
calorie-- simple equation,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.940
simple algorithm that you
will have to adapt depending

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.329
what part of the world you are.

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:29.870
Because if you are
in the North Pole,

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.240
you will need more calories
than if you are-- you know,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.470
because it's colder, whatever.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.887
But anyway, I don't know why
I was giving you this answer,

00:29:37.887 --> 00:29:39.345
but I thought it
was a cool answer.

00:29:39.345 --> 00:29:39.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.950
CHRIS YING: The
next way you want

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.450
to try to revolutionize
the world is

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:45.230
even older than canning.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:49.100
You want people to
eat more vegetables.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.910
And I've read you
talking about things,

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.510
and I agree
wholeheartedly about this.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.117
I love meat.

00:29:54.117 --> 00:29:55.450
But meat is a little bit boring.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.640
There's only so many things
you can do with meat.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.825
And so what is it about
vegetables that excites you

00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:02.116
as an eater and as a cook?

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:03.240
You're standing up already.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.300
JOSE ANDRES: I'm going to
give you a round answer.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.060
CHRIS YING: Yeah, here we go.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.780
JOSE ANDRES: So you ask
me about vegetables?

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.840
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.210
JOSE ANDRES: Who has seen
"Hannibal," Hannibal Lecter?

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.470
Do you know my participation
on that series?

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:18.360
All the food you see is mine.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.720
It's actually a great
woman, Janice Poon.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.000
She's the food stylist.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.060
She's the nicest,
paints, everything.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.910
So I've been behind
not only of the food,

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:35.760
but some of the conversations
through the series,

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.875
I've been in charge
of helping create

00:30:37.875 --> 00:30:41.220
who was Hannibal the foodie.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:49.120
Yeah, it's very sad that this
will be on my RIP, R-I-P.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.670
"He made Hannibal a foodie."

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:52.540
Yeah, I know.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.280
I know it's scary this happens.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.370
You don't believe me?

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.750
Take a look at this.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.240
You don't have it?

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.270
What?

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.280
It's not online?

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.480
CHRIS YING: I feel like
somebody in this room

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.640
should be able to
fix this, Randy.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.310
This seems crazy.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.670
JOSE ANDRES: Can
you Yahoo something?

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.253
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:31:10.253 --> 00:31:11.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.640
JOSE ANDRES: Hey!

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.025
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:15.025 --> 00:31:16.025
CHRIS YING: Provocateur.

00:31:18.902 --> 00:31:20.860
JOSE ANDRES: Yeah, but
it's a pain in the butt.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.590
In my iPad, some
things keep changing.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.770
What the heck?

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.900
It changes, the searcher.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.900
I have to go back
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.460
I have a bug or something there.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.127
How you call it?

00:31:33.127 --> 00:31:33.793
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:33.793 --> 00:31:36.340
--[INAUDIBLE] Still love your
little rare treats, don't you,

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.530
Hannibal?

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.500
The more expensive and difficult
they are to obtain, the better.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500
-It's a distinction that
adds some expectations.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.280
JOSE ANDRES: I put that
ham in the series, people!

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.840
I put the ham.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.820
I created that script moment.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.190
Why I did it?

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.597
A. I'm a killer for
anything in Spanish.

00:31:57.597 --> 00:31:58.180
Yeah, stop it.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.430
Out.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.013
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:59.013 --> 00:32:00.250

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.540
And I am the
importer of iberico.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:05.070
No, no, I am.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.736
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:05.736 --> 00:32:06.296
-Not always.

00:32:06.296 --> 00:32:07.170
JOSE ANDRES: Stop it.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:07.565
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:07.565 --> 00:32:07.960
CHRIS YING: Not always.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.420
JOSE ANDRES: And
with my partner,

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:17.510
we convinced the USDA to
give us the first approved

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.990
slaughterhouse in
Spain-- no bribing.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.900
It was legal.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.580
I don't bribe.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.250
I fed them good food.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.370
But that's no equal bribing.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:29.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.610
We did it by the book.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:37.590
So I have a personal interest in
business, on bringing the ham.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.300
But I have more than
business interest.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:45.370
I have a personal
love-my-country business.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.840
Imagine Mario Batali
with the white truffles

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.460
from Alba and Parmesan.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.560
Fuck Italian cooking
without those things.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.170
But if they have truffles and
Parmesan, give me a break.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.130
You put Parmesan,
it's a good dish.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.470
And I am a Spanish chef.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.530
We have iberico.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.460
So for me, when I was able to
put this Spanish thing there,

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.410
I was so like,
here we are, right?

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.000
What this has to do with
meat-- with vegetables?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.930
That's a very
interesting question.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:21.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.725
Really today, and
I do believe it

00:33:23.725 --> 00:33:28.070
has to do with our DNA
and thousands of years

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:34.580
of evolution, that we are
human in one part of our body.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.170
But another part of our
brain is totally controlled

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:38.545
by our animal behavior.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.020
And our animal
behavior, it seems,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.690
is highly attracted
to pure meat.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.820
And I believe there's a
cannibal in every one of us.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:56.380
We are highly attracted
to meat, to fat, obviously

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.410
to sugar and all those things.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.960
But we are highly
attracted to meat.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.780
We will eat a steak of a
pound in a steak restaurant,

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.719
but if I give you a
pound of cauliflower,

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:11.580
you will not eat it.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.330
It's a natural thing.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.020
I've done it.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.440
I've been at home-- here,
a pound of cauliflower.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.850
And they ate one
floret, and they didn't

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.790
eat any of the cauliflower.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.080
But I gave them a
pound, to everybody.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.469
I took it, then I
took a pound of steak.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:29.060
I put it.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.130
I had to do more steaks.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:39.130
This is my kind of research,
which I know is not empirical,

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.440
but this is my type of
research-- unbelievable.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.639
So we have to do something.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:47.130
We need to bottle-- I
mean, maybe that is true

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.179
that are aliens, that
they already kind of put

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:54.800
in our brains so they were
able to infiltrate our DNA back

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.360
when Adam and Eve were created.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.430
CHRIS YING: Mm-hm, sure.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.230
JOSE ANDRES: And now we are
really, really all getting fat.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.100
And the obesity pandemic
is just an alien strategy,

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.676
really-- we've seen
movies-- to get

00:35:05.676 --> 00:35:09.300
us so very fat so when they come
to recollect, because we are

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.434
like a flock of people-- it
has to do with Hannibal--

00:35:12.434 --> 00:35:14.850
we will be big enough that
they can take the proteins back

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:15.820
to their galaxy.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.930
So, I mean it.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.540
And McDonald's is not really
a corporation from America.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.780
It was created by aliens.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.257
So we are all getting fatter
and fatter and fatter.

00:35:27.257 --> 00:35:28.590
And they give you food so cheap.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.190
Why?

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:33.030
Because if they would, they
will give it to you for free.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.812
But then we'll be seeing
as maybe it's the aliens.

00:35:35.812 --> 00:35:36.770
CHRIS YING: Suspicious.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.210
JOSE ANDRES: Because
why they will

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.559
give anybody food for free?

00:35:38.559 --> 00:35:39.600
Because they want us fat.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.660
Now going in a serious way--
and it's food for thought--

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.670
vegetables need help.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.420
And I could do a burger
place, but everybody

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.710
has a burger place.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.790
I could to a burrito place.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:58.620
[SCOFFS] Everybody
has a burrito place.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.590
Now it's the salad gardens
that are happening.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:04.090
But I thought, let me do
the most difficult challenge

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.120
and one that I don't have
competition-- vegetables.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.839
So I created a restaurant.

00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:10.630
Can you put me the
video of the vegetables?

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:17.430
Why is "Hannibal"
still-- And I created

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:21.104
a concept called Beefsteak.

00:36:21.104 --> 00:36:21.770
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.232
And I created vegetables
that misbehave.

00:36:25.232 --> 00:36:26.190
They're not vegetarian.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.215
They're not vegan.

00:36:27.215 --> 00:36:29.840
They are cool and sexy
and fun and naughty.

00:36:33.602 --> 00:36:36.138
-Uh-oh.

00:36:36.138 --> 00:36:37.010
[GASPS]

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.801
JOSE ANDRES: Great.

00:36:40.778 --> 00:36:42.480
[ROARING]

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.558
[CHEERING]

00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:51.240
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.620
-Hey!

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.870
JOSE ANDRES: Oh, yeah.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:56.370
Why?

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.470
Because tomatoes go
to the jacuzzi naked.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:59.930
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.640
"Beefsteak"--
Vegetables, Unleashed.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.140
Why?

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.070
Because we need to do that.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.400
Somebody has to.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.800
Because I do believe--
I love vegetables.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.570
I do believe it's the right
way to be moving forward.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.450
Meat consumption is
not going to happen.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.165
I'm going to die before
everything is a mess,

00:37:19.165 --> 00:37:22.740
but at the level, at
the rate of production,

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.840
every time we eat
a steak, I don't

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.480
know how many acres of trees
are being cut in Brazil,

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.760
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.025
So I did the concept
that my company says--

00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:36.230
and you need to live
by your beliefs-- we

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.050
want to change the world
through the power of food.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.290
And this is
pretentious like hell.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.024
I only have 21 restaurants.

00:37:44.024 --> 00:37:45.440
How am I going to
change the world

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.400
through the power of food?

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.130
I wish I did it before, but
I was not ready until now.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.980
But I do believe that
a concept like this

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.280
can change the world
through the power of food.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:57.940
I have one.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.780
I have four more in there
for this year coming.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.410
We're hoping to do 10 next year.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.920
We're already gathering
the troops way ahead.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.890
If I'm going to crash,
I'm going to crash quick

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.305
so I don't notice
the pain of failing.

00:38:12.305 --> 00:38:14.180
But I don't want to go
any slower, because we

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.850
don't have time to go slower.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.770
So you come to see-- can you
find that photo on Google

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.010
of Beefsteak?

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.500
Put "Beefsteak Jose
Andres" or something.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.740
And I did the bowl of vegetables
that you boil in front of you.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.400
We cook in front of you.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.170
We put sauce.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:30.720
We put toppings.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.040
We put eggs.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.530
We put avocado.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.710
I even have some chicken.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.230
Yeah, any one.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:40.110
Chris Martin already came three
times, MC Hammer six times.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:47.550
MC Hammer is going to be one of
my partners, Gwennie Paltrow.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:50.760
But then every day,
we have lines outside.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.320
Look at-- and I went blue.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.400
You know why I went blue?

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.390
Because I did a study on all
the fast food, and the blue

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.200
was not taken as a color.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.170
Everybody's red, everybody's
yellow, everybody's green.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.630
Blue is totally uncovered.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.320
And then in my pre-K school,
my daughter's school, pre-K,

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.670
during five years
every September,

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.160
I will be there,
after the first year,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.200
because they did a voting
of their favorite color.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.715
And for five years straight
by a margin of 55%-- and this

00:39:24.715 --> 00:39:25.340
is not polling.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.290
This is real data.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.290
Polling is so yesterday.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:35.290
55% or more of every
year, the pre-K children

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.420
voted on blue their
favorite color.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.380
Who are going to be
my future customers?

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.620
These pre-K boys and girls.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.430
Why I believe blue is the color?

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.662
I just told you.

00:39:44.662 --> 00:39:45.620
So it's very empirical.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.745
I did really not blue,
because my eyes are blue,

00:39:48.745 --> 00:39:50.550
which they are.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.030
That's why my wife
fell in love with me.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.310
But we did the blue.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.460
And this is, ladies and
gentlemen-- take a photo.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.370
That's what we are
when you arrive.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:02.090
It's vegetables and toppings.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.280
And you choose.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.150
And I have no menu.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.840
Menu is making us stupid.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.295
I want a number five.

00:40:09.295 --> 00:40:10.420
What is in the number five?

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.920
I don't know, but
I like the number.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.700
Fuck it, no.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:17.087
Now people talk to each other.

00:40:17.087 --> 00:40:18.920
This lady that came
from McDonald's told me,

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.086
I learned more in a week
here than ten years working

00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:22.060
in McDonald's.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.030
Besides, I pay $3
or $4 more per hour.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.280
She learned how to chop.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.280
She learned how to look.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.510
She told tell me, I love to look
at the white boys in the eyes,

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.800
she told me.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.670
I never thought about that.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.070
Because they are all
the time like this.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.705
She comes from another
part of town where I am.

00:40:38.705 --> 00:40:40.330
All of a sudden, I
see that this is not

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.496
about the vegetable concept.

00:40:41.496 --> 00:40:43.200
It's so much bigger.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.260
We have already three
roofs on the top

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.410
where we're going to be
doing a little farming.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:52.530
So 2.5% of the vegetables
will come from the roof.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.080
And I'm trying to convince
somebody, maybe Google, maybe

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.960
Disney, to do a vertical tower,
where 25% of the vegetables

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.880
can come from the
restaurant above.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.700
That will be a dream.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.000
That will be real local.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.240
Did I answer?

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.954
CHRIS YING: What is
exciting as a cook,

00:41:11.954 --> 00:41:13.370
as an eater about
vegetables, too?

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.900
What do you love
about vegetables?

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.390
I mean, I understand--

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.220
JOSE ANDRES: How
many of you eat meat?

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.790
OK, you put the piece
of meat in your mouth.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.040
What happens the first seconds?

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.100
Besides you cannot talk.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.890
All the juices are all over.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.590
And you are like, man,
I'm a lion, a lioness.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.510
All right.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:38.890
What happens during
the next 45 seconds?

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.440
I want you to do
one thing next time.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.610
You just bite into
the meat five seconds.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.480
When it's finished, take it.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.000
Don't look at it.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.620
And then put it back again.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.275
It's the worst experience
in the history of mankind.

00:41:54.275 --> 00:41:55.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.786
It's like zombie wars
as a main course.

00:41:59.786 --> 00:42:02.270
It's terrible.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:08.650
On the other hand, a vegetable
doesn't have the peak of flavor

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:14.680
like meat gives us, but it has a
very amazing melody through it.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.580
And when you are able to eat
through entire melody instead

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.770
of a horror movie,
Alfred Hitchcock going up

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.000
in the stairs there, and
you're standing, you know?

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Anyway, it's a very
different experience.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.640
And obviously, vegetables
for many, many reasons

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.852
are the way to go forward.

00:42:35.852 --> 00:42:37.810
And I'm not going to be
here annoying everybody

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.649
with the data of the why.

00:42:39.649 --> 00:42:41.690
But that's why I did the
more challenging concept

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:47.140
I could do to do my
billion dollar, my unicorn.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.970
Which now I'm sad, because now
I discovered that there's also

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:54.770
a unicorn and dedracorn,
that your company's worth $10

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.350
billion.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.770
So I'm like, fuck.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:57.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:01.730
I just learned about unicorns,
and now it's a dedracorn?

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:05.100
Which is a $10 billion
valuation in matter of-- yes?

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.720
I do believe this
company can be worth.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.500
But if it's not worth
it, the best scenario

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:14.150
is that it will serve
as a good mechanism

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:18.350
to ignite more people to keep
trying those restaurants.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.560
Because we need more
of those restaurants.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.860
Do you want a clown
to feed the world?

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.420
Or you want a chef that
tells you a joke or two,

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.410
but we're serious about
the project of doing it.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:32.910
I rather prefer to have chefs
filling the world, not just

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.860
corporations.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.610
I have no problem.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.690
I want to have a
corporation, too.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.250
But at the top of
my corporation is

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.190
going to be changing the world
through the power of food.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.360
And that will go hand
by hand of the failure

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.715
or success of the project.

00:43:49.394 --> 00:43:50.810
CHRIS YING: I have
more questions,

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.010
but I think that we
should probably open it up

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.272
for other people.

00:43:53.272 --> 00:43:54.730
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:44:00.000
My question is around how I've
observed many chefs as they

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.530
become more and more
capable themselves

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:07.020
have a linear progression
of their time and the value

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.530
they provide society until they
start to separate themselves

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.580
from the hands-on aspect of
the day-to-day activities

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.880
of the restaurant.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.030
Where they then,
through the separation,

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.230
are able to scale
their time and effort,

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.440
but then become
more distant, other

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.160
than maybe influencing, at
an executive level, the menu.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.560
So as you attempt
to scale your time

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.490
to provide more and more
value to the world--

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.310
and thank you for
that, and it looks

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.480
like Beefsteak will be
that vehicle or at least

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.880
your main attempt to
scale your time-- how

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:45.022
are you intending to control
for that distance from the food?

00:44:45.022 --> 00:44:47.105
JOSE ANDRES: The answer
is people, people, people.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.270
I mean, I read a little bit
how Google is organized,

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.800
but organizational
charts are going

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.680
to be key for future success.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.690
And I mean, my first-- I
went to the World Bank,

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:04.740
and I gave this kind of
stupid thing of how I do it.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.780
Nobody in my company believes
me, but that's how we do it.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:11.900
But many organizations are
pyramidally organized, right?

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:17.580
There's a moron at the very
top sometimes, like me,

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.880
that sometimes you wonder
how you made it there.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.900
And then you have
people under, the CFOs

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.470
and those stupid titles
we give to each other

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:33.340
to feel powerful, and the CMOs.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.030
My CMO is here.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:42.630
And interns-- there's a lot of
interns here, right, I hear.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.900
I have interns, too.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.011
White House used to
have a lot of interns.

00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:51.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.610
And then what happens,
I am at the top, right?

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:57.500
Like at Starbucks, probably
the CEO was thinking loud

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.220
and said, shit, I
hate cappuccino.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.630
Somebody heard, and
then trickled down.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.020
And everybody began
saying, shit, he said,

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.280
shit cappuccinos.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.320
Shit, we need to take
cappuccino out of the menu, man.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.290
And this trickles down.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.050
The poor CEO just was
thinking loud, right?

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.000
But because he's at the
very top and there's

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.680
almost no connection,
the information,

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.770
what it does-- gravity-- woosh.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.860
What's happening?

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.850
Oh, they've been thinking-- wow.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.310
But the people
underneath are not

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.760
part of the thinking
in any way or form.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.700
That's what happens.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.960
Then when you have a good
guy coming with a new idea,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.850
trying to change the
world, because you

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:38.510
are at the very bottom of the
mountain, you try to come up,

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.830
and then you have everybody
else above you with the shoe.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:43.934
Come down, you moron.

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:45.600
It took me a long
time to be where I am.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.900
Now you're going to come?

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.160
So it's hard to bring good
ideas, good information up.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.430
And then when you have good
people working together,

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.330
you have people in one
side of the mountain,

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.070
in the other side
of the mountain.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.385
So you don't see each other
and instead of uniting efforts.

00:46:59.385 --> 00:47:01.260
Sometimes it's good to
have different things,

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.510
or you need to know that
different things are working,

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.080
maybe towards the same idea.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.400
So everything, I do believe,
changes dramatically

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.100
in the moment you began seeing
this mountain as just a very

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.600
flat territory,
where everybody's

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.170
more able to see
each other, where

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:19.500
you don't have the weight
of delivering information

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.950
and ideas.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:23.450
You have to work so hard,
only to deliver the idea

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.810
that at the end, you worked
so hard to communicate

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:30.240
the idea that the idea stops
being the important thing.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.690
The delivery is more important.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:34.315
There's one moment that you put
so much effort in the delivery,

00:47:34.315 --> 00:47:36.910
that you are like,
[DEEP BREATH].

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.530
You give up even on the idea
because you worked so hard

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:40.856
in the wrong thing.

00:47:40.856 --> 00:47:42.230
So if we start
creating companies

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:47.380
that minimize the
hardships of having

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.654
to communicate those
ideas-- and I'm

00:47:50.654 --> 00:47:52.320
going through that
program in my company

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.367
right now, because I've
got a lot of new people,

00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:55.450
and it's very interesting.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.510
All of a sudden, I'm like,
I'm doing a restaurant.

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.690
In the old days, me?

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.311
I'm Philippe Starck.

00:48:02.311 --> 00:48:04.060
I don't understand a
word of what he says.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.893
He doesn't understand
a word of what I said.

00:48:05.893 --> 00:48:08.630
We had a fucking
great restaurant.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:11.960
Because I told him,
rhino, rhino, rhino.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.850
He put me-- I don't know why--
a crocodile, a coco-drool,

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:17.970
an alligator.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.150
Because in French, rhino
sounds like alligator.

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.660
I don't know what
the fuck it was.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.980
But I wanted rhinos
in my restaurant,

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.690
and I end with alligators.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:27.640
That's a true story.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.630
In my meat restaurant, OK?

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.360
Talk about this bullshit.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.690
But that was me with him.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.340
Now I have 25 other people.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.970
And by the time
the sign comes, I'm

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.320
like, what the fuck is this?

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.460
Well, and you have no time to
give any idea back, feedback,

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.830
because the due date for
finishing the project

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:50.130
is tomorrow.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.570
What?

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.900
I was in charge of this
without anybody around me

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.370
before, not because
I was involved,

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.006
because it was my duty.

00:48:57.006 --> 00:48:59.640
Anyway, I believe these
organizational charts

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.730
being flatter is going to key.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:04.690
But then, they will need to
develop into three-dimensionals

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.200
as you keep growing.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.540
But keep finding ways to
these different levels

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.980
of organizational chart,
that they should be flat,

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.820
really working one
with each other.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.000
I'm not there yet,
because I'm not so big.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.050
But I know that if I emphasize
flat organizational charts,

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:26.080
success is around the corner.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.970
You got it.

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:28.330
We need to talk more about it.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:30.400
But I believe in that.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.830
I'm not in the middle.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.510
I am in the middle, but
I could move freely.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.970
I don't have to be in the
middle to feel I'm in charge.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:40.180
I can go away from the
organizational chart

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.220
and still be in charge.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.500
Actually, it's what's
happening right now.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.730
I hire a new CEO.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:49.120
She came from Ruby Tuesday's,
$1.5 billion company.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.030
She's far away, 10
times, where I am.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.250
She's going to be helping
me move in my ideas.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.790
And I'm moving myself out
of the organizational chart.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.610
But still I'm in charge.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:02.380
Or at least, that's
what I like to believe.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.970
So I hope this
answered your question.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.110
But I believe these flat
organizational charts

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:10.150
are going to be key to
help me achieve everything

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:15.410
I'm doing-- movies, a
new series, my TV show.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:18.420
And still I didn't mention your
restaurant, my work in Haiti

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.439
with Clean Cookstoves,
my work in LA

00:50:20.439 --> 00:50:22.230
that we opened a kitchen
that's going to be

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:23.570
feeding 25,000 people a day.

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:27.170
We opened it just-- we did
the first part yesterday.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.200
I'm going to Harvard
to teach in the fall,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.530
coming here to share my
crazy ideas with you.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:37.200
If I believe in this platform,
I'll be able, as a chef,

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.600
to keep delivering
in all those levels.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.870
Because I cannot
focus on one thing.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.660
My brain doesn't
allow me to do that.

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.800
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about Beefsteak.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.010
From the vegetables
that you found in the US

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.390
that are not so
common in Spain, which

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:01.680
ones you found more
surprising, like okra

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.810
or all these things that
are not so common in Spain

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.500
but are common here?

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.930
And also, which vegetables
that are common in Spain

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:11.360
you miss the most here?

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.000
JOSE ANDRES: OK so
my most amazing thing

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.610
is when my daughter
Carlotta comes to me

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:24.375
and like, Daddy, today we
went to the Potomac Park,

00:51:24.375 --> 00:51:29.360
and we went to-- oh, what's
the name of the path?

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.280
Oh, shit, it has
a very funny name.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.970
The Billy Goat Trail!

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:35.005
The Billy Goat Trail!

00:51:35.005 --> 00:51:36.630
Man, you people are
powerful at Google.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:38.910
You know everything
here at Google, right?

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:39.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.880
And that's why it's
so cool to be here.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.456
Like, look at you.

00:51:43.456 --> 00:51:44.660
You surprise me.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.590
How the fuck you know
about the Billy Goat Trail?

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:48.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:51.210
OK, the Billy Goat Trail
is the coolest trail

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:56.080
in the history of
mankind-- the coolest!

00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:00.580
Let me go back a few
centuries before.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.350
Lewis and Clark--
OK, let me see how

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.260
I unite the Billy Goat Trail
with the Lewis and Clark

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:06.760
bullshit.

00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:12.160
Because I'm trying
to create momentum.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:22.150
The National Archives-- you've
been to the National Archives?

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.350
The coolest institution,
all the great documents

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:28.370
of the history of America, yeah?

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:31.449
The archivist-- for two
years I was at the board

00:52:31.449 --> 00:52:32.490
of the National Archives.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:33.280
Don't tell me how.

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.789
Everybody was a Kennedy, a
Rockefeller, and then Andres.

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.080
I didn't fit there, believe me.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.660
I went to the
meetings like this,

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.130
and everybody-- anyway,
their archivist emails me.

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:50.049
Like, urgent, urgent,
meet me at the door

00:52:50.049 --> 00:52:51.090
of the National Archives.

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:52.200
I'm like, what the fuck?

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.250
What happened?

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.640
What I've done wrong?

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.860
I didn't take the
Bill of Rights.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:52:59.840
I didn't!

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.610
I thought about
it, but I didn't.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:04.610
I go, and he brings me a paper.

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.170
Are you with me?

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:10.110
Billy Goat Trail, but I'm--
Lewis and Clark to-- yeah?

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.330
And he brings me a document.

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:22.870
And the document
is a peace treaty

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.810
between the United
States of America

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:30.680
and the Indian tribes
of what is now Illinois.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:36.140
And somewhere in the treaty,
they agree about giving

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:41.490
an orchard-- an orchard,
like a fruit farm, yeah?--

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.850
of something called pawpaw.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:51.280
Pawpaw was what gave the
opportunity to Lewis and Clark

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.490
to really make it back
to the East on time

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:57.940
before the cold
weather hit, and they

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.600
will be suffering and maybe
die before they make it

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.750
back to the East.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:04.730
And they did it because
they ate pawpaws.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.580
What is the pawpaw
and what does it

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.190
have to do with the
Billy Goat Trail?

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.550
Because my daughter
comes to me and tells me,

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:18.130
Daddy, I found a pawpaw
at the Billy Goat Trail.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:22.630
Pawpaw, which in some
cultures is a papaya?

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.150
No, that is not papaya.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:30.320
It's the ultimate, most
iconic American fruit.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.480
All of a sudden,
I don't know, that

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.280
became for me-- I
bought 100 trees.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.600
I gave it to farmer
friends of mine.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.400
They are still growing.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.470
But pawpaws are the
American fruit that America

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:47.110
doesn't have a clue about.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:49.090
And I'm in love with them.

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.920
And it's an amazing fruit.

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.880
And I learned it
through my daughter,

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.040
which I was about to smash her.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.310
You don't have a clue,
cannot be pawpaws.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.320
Daddy.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.300
My surprise, when she takes
me to the Billy Goat Trail,

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:10.730
in the middle of the forest,
I found the pawpaw tree.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.380
It was fascinating.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.790
That's one of my
most amazing ones.

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:17.450
And when I play
golf, that finally

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:21.960
I understood why to have a hat.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.830
Especially if you
play in West Virginia.

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:29.055
I have a very expertise of
putting the ball in the forest.

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:33.720
And this should be an
algorithm about it,

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.230
because when I go
towards the forest,

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:38.400
the ball ends in the forest.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.320
But when I go
toward the fairway,

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.640
the ball ends in the forest.

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:45.540
I thought, if I go
towards the forest,

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.530
the ball will end
in the fairway.

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:50.590
Always it's in the forest.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:51.890
And the hat has had to do.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.730
Mentally, we're connected.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.230
I go in the forest, and what
do I find, in the right moment

00:55:57.230 --> 00:56:00.900
in the right season,
which is now?

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.210
Morels!

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:05.770
And I grab my hat.

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:08.760
I fill it with the
morels, and fuck golf!

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.252
So, and then I'm from Spain.

00:56:17.252 --> 00:56:18.710
Every day that
means less and less.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:20.585
I'm going to Spain next
week, because there's

00:56:20.585 --> 00:56:22.450
a friend that with
Anthony Bourdain

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:24.070
they're doing a
book about Spain.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:31.580
Matt Goulding, he has a blog
called Kingdoms and Roads.

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:36.070
If you like food and you
want to follow the best web

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:43.220
blog, the best writers ever,
besides Lucky Peach-- but you

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:43.780
are amazing.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.613
CHRIS YING: [LAUGHS]

00:56:44.613 --> 00:56:46.930
JOSE ANDRES: He
doesn't have magazine.

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.750
I love him.

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:50.842
And I'm going with him.

00:56:50.842 --> 00:56:52.300
I need to bring
you, too, and then.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.440
CHRIS YING: Yeah, fair
enough, fair enough.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.450
JOSE ANDRES: But
you are amazing.

00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:55.950
CHRIS YING: Roads and
Kingdoms is great.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.250
JOSE ANDRES: Roads and Kingdoms.

00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:57.850
Kingdoms and Roads?

00:56:57.850 --> 00:56:58.330
CHRIS YING: Roads and Kingdoms.

00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.600
JOSE ANDRES: You know Matt.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.250
So I'm going with him.

00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:04.340
And what I love is percebes.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:07.320
Percebes is gooseneck
barnacle, which

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:11.300
has the biggest reproduction
piece of equipment

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:12.480
in the animal world.

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:16.520
It's 250 times its size.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.950
I mean, it's really powerful.

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:22.020
In sex terms, it's
very powerful.

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.650
Those are gooseneck barnacles.

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:26.090
And I love them because
I'm a scuba diver, myself.

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:27.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:28.640
It's true.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.820
Are you-- you don't believe me?

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.250
Who second guessed me?

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:33.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:37.800
OK, OK, to finish,
put the scuba there.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.250
I'm going to put the
scuba diving piece.

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:43.460
So gooseneck barnacles, the
best ones, as the sea urchin,

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:47.706
are roughly at 10
meters under the water.

00:57:47.706 --> 00:57:49.830
Because that is where you
have the laminaria, which

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:53.790
is a type of seaweed, which is
the tastiest of the seaweed.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:56.259
The seaweeds you find at
one, two, three, four meters

00:57:56.259 --> 00:57:57.800
are not as tasty as
the ones that you

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.930
find between roughly 8 and 12.

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:04.550
So the percebes, the gooseneck
barnacles, coming from here--

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:06.300
but they don't eat the
seaweed themselves,

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:10.090
but all the microcosms of
food use around that is great.

00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:13.830
The sea urchin, the best
ones come from 5 to 10 meters

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:14.980
underneath.

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.800
The sea urchin on the
water level are no good.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:23.060
You go to Hokkaido, the
good ones, 5 to 10 meters.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:26.340
The ones at the sea
level, not as tasty.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.030
That's how picky I am.

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:31.224
Look at the scuba diving.

00:58:31.224 --> 00:58:32.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.990
On how a chef also
can be helping.

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:38.530
You know that problem
with lionfish, right?

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:39.540
It's a huge problem.

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.650
The lionfish has
nothing to do, people.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.810
People, we have
everything to do.

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:48.710
So now, they are doing these
championships in the Caribbean

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:51.110
that you get a group
of friends, and it's

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.070
hundreds, thousands of people.

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.820
And you go into the
ocean to see who

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.990
can catch more lionfish
in two, three, four hours.

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:01.800
And it's like the best
competition in the history.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.490
I've never done the
competition, but I'm

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:07.030
getting ready to be the
Jacques Cousteau of lionfish.

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:09.795 --> 00:59:10.984
Look at it.

00:59:10.984 --> 00:59:11.650
I love that one.

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.630
I love the-- I mean,
I never thought

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:20.310
I will be hunting
for fish, because I

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:24.764
like to be with the
fish and talk to them.

00:59:24.764 --> 00:59:26.180
But this is actually
unfortunately

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:30.100
a thing we need because they are
killing every single creature

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.600
in the Caribbean.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.836
That was me missing, yeah.

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:34.740
What the heck?

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.260
Look at these thick [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.340
You talk about technology.

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:41.000
Sometimes, technology is
what I'm showing you--

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.060
a very simple,
recyclable water basket,

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.470
water whatever you
call in English,

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:52.520
transformed with this funnel
into the best lionfish holder

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.420
in the history of mankind.

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.730
I love these.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:57.270
Sometimes technology
doesn't have

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.500
to be the biggest prototype
ever created by NASA.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.730
Something simple as that
can be changing the way
