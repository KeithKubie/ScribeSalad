findings through our research project on
the ground found that the area that was

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400
the ground found that the area that was
 

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.090
the ground found that the area that was
under cultivation had experienced a

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:03.100
under cultivation had experienced a
 

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.030
under cultivation had experienced a
decrease in food security and an

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040
decrease in food security and an
 

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.520
decrease in food security and an
increase in vulnerability in the areas

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:08.530
increase in vulnerability in the areas
 

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.500
increase in vulnerability in the areas
that were under cultivation and I was

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:10.510
that were under cultivation and I was
 

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.080
that were under cultivation and I was
wondering what interventions is the

in the near future
 

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.350
in the near future
particularly in the

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:22.360
particularly in the
 

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.880
particularly in the
during the duration of the time that the

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:24.890
during the duration of the time that the
 

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.820
during the duration of the time that the
palm oil trees are under gestation which

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:27.830
palm oil trees are under gestation which
 

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:29.550
palm oil trees are under gestation which
is for the next three to five years and

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:29.560
is for the next three to five years and
 

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.100
is for the next three to five years and
unemployment is much lower than will be

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:33.110
unemployment is much lower than will be
 

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:36.070
unemployment is much lower than will be
in over the next couple of years as well

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:36.080
in over the next couple of years as well
 

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.410
in over the next couple of years as well
as the increase to migration for the

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:38.420
as the increase to migration for the
 

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.390
as the increase to migration for the
area for people looking for jobs which

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400
area for people looking for jobs which
 

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.630
area for people looking for jobs which
creates a higher demand on food prices

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640
creates a higher demand on food prices
 

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.240
creates a higher demand on food prices
which again enhances the shock of

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:48.250
 

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:52.300
increases on food prices and yeah and so

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:52.310
increases on food prices and yeah and so
 

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.220
increases on food prices and yeah and so
in kids sorry one last bit so

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:54.230
in kids sorry one last bit so
 

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.260
in kids sorry one last bit so

fact there is a USA program as you know
that's now supporting food food security

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:32.380
that's now supporting food food security
 

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.359
that's now supporting food food security
truly support for small farmers like

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:35.369
truly support for small farmers like
 

00:51:35.369 --> 00:51:39.349
truly support for small farmers like
is a member of that a beneficiary of

00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359
is a member of that a beneficiary of
 

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:42.170
is a member of that a beneficiary of
that program and we will be stressing

I think another widely agreed upon

00:52:40.099 --> 00:52:40.109
I think another widely agreed upon
 

00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:43.150
I think another widely agreed upon
concern of development is inequality so

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160
concern of development is inequality so
 

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.370
concern of development is inequality so
given these two factors what would you

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380
given these two factors what would you
 

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:49.819
given these two factors what would you
say are the most effective ways for the

00:52:49.819 --> 00:52:49.829
say are the most effective ways for the
 

00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:51.739
say are the most effective ways for the
government to foster equitable growth

00:52:51.739 --> 00:52:51.749
government to foster equitable growth
 

00:52:51.749 --> 00:52:58.809
government to foster equitable growth
without growing too much I guess

00:52:58.809 --> 00:52:58.819
 

00:52:58.819 --> 00:53:05.960
inequality yes there is some of that you

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:05.970
inequality yes there is some of that you
 

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:10.670
inequality yes there is some of that you
