The entire OCL language has a small set of keywords. We've already seen

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.288
invariant, pre, and post. There's an if-then-else if you need that to,

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:14.920
describe conditional expressions. There are Boolean operators.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.430
There's a packaging mechanism that reflects UML's ability to

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.090
partition things into packages. The context keywords you've seen. There's,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.640
several key words that allow you to do some definitions. Definitions can be

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.050
useful to save you typing effort if define something to use the short version

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.350
there's ability to indicate that your computing the value of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.020
derived attribute the derived key word. There's the ability to indicate that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.770
you're specifying an initial value, we, and we've already seen result and self.
