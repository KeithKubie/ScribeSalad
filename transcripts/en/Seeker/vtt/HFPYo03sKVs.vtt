00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.980
Redheads aren't going extinct.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.909
They aren't soulless-- well,
any more than anyone else is,

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:06.450
scientifically
speaking-- and they've

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.060
been around for a long time.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.740
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.190
Hey, gingers and others!

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.110
Trace here from DNews to
settle some old scores

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.177
about those redheaded
people among us.

00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:22.760
Now before I dive
in, you can probably

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.647
tell I am not a redhead.

00:00:24.647 --> 00:00:26.230
Although when I let
my beard grow out,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.230
I do get little red hairs, so
I don't know what that means.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.730
Anyway, redheads
get a lot of flack,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.780
so we explored some of the
science behind their freckles.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.020
Redheads have been in
literature for a while.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.990
The Oxford English Dictionary
says the term "redhead" first

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.470
appeared in 1510
and it's associated

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.040
with a fair complexion and
Auburn or ginger colored hair.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.084
But the gene mutation
that causes redheadedness

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:47.250
has been around much longer.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.910
It came about 50,000 years ago
when humans moved from Africa

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.960
into the cloudier
climbs of Europe.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.410
The redheaded human is a
result of a gene mutation

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.627
on the MC1R gene, which is
responsible for controlling

00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.460
melanin production,
probably not a surprise.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.220
Melanin is what gives skin,
eyes, and hair their color.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.759
Blonds are also a result of
the change in the MC1R gene.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.300
New research published
in the journal

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.290
Molecular Biology and Evolution
discovered another mutation

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.144
that causes fairer
skin complexion.

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:13.810
Scientists discovered
it while analyzing

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.390
the DNA of 1,000
people from Spain

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.960
and figure it's
our body's response

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.950
to lower vitamin D production
from the lessened sun

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.880
outside of Africa.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.480
Sadly, the mutation
goes hand in hand

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.860
with lessened protection
from UV rays as well.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.660
Darker skin reflect the rays
better than lighter, so fair

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.110
skin has a higher risk for
melanoma, or skin cancer.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.950
When lab rats with comparable
pigmentation were tested,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.490
50% developed melanoma
before they were even

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.840
exposed to the UV light!

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.915
So get out there and
get tested redheads.

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:42.340
So while some of those sayings
about redheads are true,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.980
rumors of redhead extinction?

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.250
Grossly exaggerated.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.390
In 2005, the internet was abuzz
with a source at the Oxford

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.749
Hair Foundation claiming
the recessive gene was

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:52.290
disappearing.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.030
In reality 80% of humanity
carry the recessive gene

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.620
underneath their
own dominate one.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.510
It's important to note that
the gene is double recessive.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.230
So both parents must
carry it to birth

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.000
their own little gingersnap.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.585
And in total, 2% to 6% of humans
in the Northern Hemisphere

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:09.199
and only 1% to 2%
worldwide are gingers.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.030
This rare gene mutation
has been rumored

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.240
to affect other
redhead traits as well.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.090
For example, pain reception.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.640
Even the MythBusters
explored this phenomenon.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.650
Anesthesiologists
know that redheads

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.480
do need more of the
lidocaine anesthetic

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.630
before surgery, about 20%
more than dark haired people,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.300
in fact.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.175
However, when it comes
to opiate painkillers,

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:30.387
they actually need less.

00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:32.470
This has to do with pain
receptors being triggered

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.630
differently in people
with MCR1 mutations.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.740
Did you have misconceptions
about redheads before?

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.760
Be honest, everybody.
