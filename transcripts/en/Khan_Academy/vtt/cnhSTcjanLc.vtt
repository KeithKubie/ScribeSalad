00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.385
- [Voiceover] We have a writing
and language passage here.

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.008
"Dong Kingman: Painter of Cities."

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:06.688
And what's neat about this
is as we go through it,

00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:08.523
we'll have a chance to
think about how we might

00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:12.420
edit this to make it maybe
a little more grammatically

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.021
correct or a little bit easier to read.

00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:19.861
"A 1954 documentary about
renowned watercolor painter

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.101
"Dong Kingman shows the artist sitting

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:25.069
"on a stool on Mott Street
in New York City's Chinatown.

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.495
"A crowd of admiring spectators
watches as Kingman squeezes

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:32.210
"dollops of paint from several
tubes into a tin watercolor

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.459
"box, from just a few
primary colors, Kingman

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:39.012
"creates dozens of
beautiful hues as he layers

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:43.991
"the translucent paint onto
the paper on his easel."

00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:47.038
So that sentence I just
read, that felt like a lot.

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:49.973
Even when I was reading it it
felt hard to put it, to get it

00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:51.770
all out in one breath.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.463
Where I paused here, at
least when I was reading it

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:56.425
it felt like that could
be a place where instead

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:58.700
of this being a comma and keep going.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.406
This is a good place to
start a new sentence.

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:02.043
Let me just make sure that the two parts

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:03.924
of this long sentence right now

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:06.303
can stand as their own as sentences.

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:09.520
"A crowd of admiring
spectators watches as Kingman

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.446
"squeezes dollops of
paint from several tubes

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:14.663
"into a tin watercolor box."

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:16.426
Yeah, that's a sentence.

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:19.619
Then after that "From
just a few primary colors,

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.325
"Kingman creates dozens of
beautiful hues as he layers

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:25.819
"the translucent paint onto his easel."

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.068
Yeah. That's a sentence too.

00:01:27.068 --> 00:01:30.795
So I for sure, would put
a period after box here.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:33.584
And so when you see this
one, this means where,

00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:34.884
this one with this gray box around it,

00:01:34.884 --> 00:01:36.079
that means we're in question one.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.949
Question one says do we want to rewrite

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:40.683
this underlined part, and if we do,

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:41.821
how would we do it?

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.943
So we go to this question
one right over here,

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:47.346
and I wanna change it.

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:51.247
I wanna put a period there
to make this one big sentence

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:54.315
into two cleaner sentences,
and out of these choices,

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:56.834
this is the only one that
puts the period after the box.

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:59.156
It makes it very clean,
just the way I said.

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.758
The period here and then
start a new sentence.

00:02:01.758 --> 00:02:04.148
"From just a few primary colors."

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:06.493
This one over here actually
just removes the comma,

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.165
in some ways making those, what I think

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:10.568
should be two sentences even more run-on.

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:13.145
This one, they remove the comma back here,

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.631
but that doesn't help the situation.

00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.535
I definitely don't wanna keep it as is,

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.986
so I feel very confident about B.

00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:20.588
So let's keep going.

00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:23.571
So I finished with easel.

00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:26.069
"Each stroke of the brush
and dab of the sponge

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.415
"transforms thinly sketched outlines

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:32.107
"into buildings, shop
signs, and streetlamps.

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:34.916
"The street scene Kingman begins composing

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.632
"in this short film is
very much in keeping

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:40.895
"with the urban landscapes
for which he is known best."

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:42.595
Or "for which he is best known.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.699
"Kingman," and when they have
these numbers in brackets,

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.846
this is now, they're just
numbering the sentences.

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:50.100
Some of these questions, they might refer

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.459
to these sentences in some way.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.676
So the numbers in these gray boxes,

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:55.440
this is literally, "Hey,
how would you rewrite this

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.504
"underlined portion?" and
that's the question number.

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:02.138
While this is, they're
referencing the actual sentences,

00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:03.904
so the first sentence
says, "Kingman was keenly

00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:06.701
"interested in landscape
painting from an early age.

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.964
"In Hong Kong, where Kingman
completed his schooling,

00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:12.843
"teachers at that time
customarily assigned students

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:15.083
"a formal 'school name.'"

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:15.779
Alright.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.823
"His interest was so keen, in fact,

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.352
"that he was named after it."

00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:21.520
That felt a little awkward.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.400
He was named after what?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.047
After his school?

00:03:26.047 --> 00:03:27.870
Well anyway, I'll just keep reading.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.842
"The young boy who had been called

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:34.269
"Dong Moy Shu became Dong Kingman.

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.233
"The name Kingman was
selected for its two parts,

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:40.751
"'king' and 'man'; Cantonese

00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:43.783
"for 'scenery' and 'composition.'"

00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:46.241
So this is question two,
how would we rewrite this?

00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.201
And they're saying that the name

00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:51.244
Kingman was selected for its two parts,

00:03:51.244 --> 00:03:53.798
and then they give us a list of,

00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:56.363
or they kind of give us
clarification of those two parts.

00:03:56.363 --> 00:03:58.450
They say the two parts are king and man,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.818
so instead of a comma here, I would

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:02.397
I'd probably go with a colon.

00:04:02.397 --> 00:04:05.532
Hey I'm gonna enumerate the two parts.

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:07.516
I'm gonna say the two
parts, what were they?

00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:08.410
They were king and man.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.837
That's where a colon
would make a lot of sense.

00:04:10.837 --> 00:04:12.636
And so let's see if the choices hopefully

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:15.678
have that as an option, and out of

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:17.558
all of these, it looks like
this one actually does.

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:19.471
It sees two "parts: 'king' and 'man,'"

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:21.200
and then they put a comma here

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.720
because then we clarify that king and man,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.924
these are "Cantonese for
'scenery' and 'composition.'"

00:04:26.924 --> 00:04:28.339
So this one feels very good.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:30.186
I feel very confident about this one.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.404
This one is even worse.

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:32.740
It kind of gets rid of that comma.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.825
This one gets a semi-colon
right over here,

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:36.881
"two parts; 'king' and 'man.'"

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.791
Semi-colon's kind of too strong of a,

00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:42.512
it's kind of making this a completely,

00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:43.696
you know, we're kind of starting

00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:48.045
another somewhat independent

00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:52.116
clause over here, so I don't like that.

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:54.239
I definitely like putting the colon here

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:57.096
and then a comma here
because "Cantonese for

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.197
"'scenery' and
'composition,'" is giving us

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:03.256
more clarity where the king
and the man is coming from.

00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:05.578
So I definitely like, but
what really convinces me is

00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:07.121
putting the colon here
because it enumerates

00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.365
the two parts, king and man.

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:13.631
"As Kingman developed
as a painter, his works

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:15.406
"were often compared to paintings

00:05:15.406 --> 00:05:18.495
"by Chinese landscape artists dating back

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:21.607
"to the Common Era 960, a time

00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:23.649
"when a strong tradition
of landscape painting

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:26.598
"emerged in Chinese art."

00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:28.882
Actually, I, for question three, this

00:05:28.882 --> 00:05:30.262
seems reasonable.

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:31.641
"As Kingman developed,"

00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:34.160
I'm always suspicious of
myself when I do think that

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.019
something's okay, but
let me just double check.

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:38.317
"As Kingman developed
as a painter, his works

00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:40.580
"were often compared to paintings by.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.457
"His works were often
compared to paintings

00:05:44.457 --> 00:05:45.979
"by Chinese landscape artists."

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.394
Yeah that's right. His works
would be compared to paintings

00:05:48.394 --> 00:05:50.076
because his works are paintings.

00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:54.662
"Landscape artists dating
back to CE 960, a time when

00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:56.404
"a strong tradition of landscape painting

00:05:56.404 --> 00:05:58.562
"emerged in Chinese art."

00:05:58.562 --> 00:06:00.850
So for question three, I actually think,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.324
I'm actually feeling no change,

00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:03.903
but let's look at the other choices.

00:06:03.903 --> 00:06:05.365
"As Kingman developed as a painter,

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.630
"his works were often compared to

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.091
"Chinese landscape artists."

00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:11.669
No, you wouldn't compare his works,

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.143
which were paintings to other artists.

00:06:14.143 --> 00:06:16.407
You might compare Kingman
to another artist,

00:06:16.407 --> 00:06:19.343
but his works wouldn't be
compared to other artists.

00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:22.641
You're comparing an object,
a painting, to people here,

00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.346
so this doesn't make sense.

00:06:24.346 --> 00:06:26.482
The next second one, "His
works were often compared

00:06:26.482 --> 00:06:28.585
"to painters of Chinese landscapes."

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:29.965
Well, no that's the same thing.

00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:32.191
You're comparing the works to people.

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:34.292
You might compare Kingman to painters,

00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:35.871
but this is comparing "his works

00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:37.473
"were often compared to,"

00:06:37.473 --> 00:06:38.750
so it makes sense that his works would be

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.514
compared to paintings not
to "landscape artists"

00:06:41.514 --> 00:06:43.672
or "painters of Chinese landscapes"

00:06:43.672 --> 00:06:47.214
or compared to "artists," and it looks

00:06:47.214 --> 00:06:48.835
like there's a little
typo right over here.

00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:51.551
This D is probably, they
said "Hey this is D."

00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:53.549
I'm using a prototype
version of the interface,

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:55.917
so there's probably gonna be a
little, few bugs on the stuff

00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:58.104
that I'm making the videos on,
but this, you wouldn't want

00:06:58.104 --> 00:06:59.883
to compare to the artists either.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.089
So let's keep going, so

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.387
I feel good about the no change.

00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:08.150
Alright, let's keep going.

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:11.743
So we are right,

00:07:11.743 --> 00:07:13.625
we are right here.

00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:17.224
"Kingman, however, vacated
from that tradition

00:07:17.224 --> 00:07:19.800
"in a number of ways, most notably

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.924
"in that he chose to focus
not on natural landscapes,

00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:26.854
"such as mountains and
rivers, but on cities."

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:29.955
So vacated seems like a bit
of an awkward word here.

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:32.879
I mean, to vacate means to leave,

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:34.470
so I guess, you know,

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:37.924
I kind of get what they're saying,

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:40.803
but it feels more like
left from that tradition

00:07:40.803 --> 00:07:43.427
or departed from that tradition
might make more sense.

00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:45.226
But let's see what the choices are,

00:07:45.226 --> 00:07:48.686
so no change would be vacated,

00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:50.346
then you have evacuated
from that tradition.

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:51.508
That kind of, at least in my brain,

00:07:51.508 --> 00:07:53.059
I imagine like an emergency

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:55.010
where he has to leave the tradition.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.774
Departed feels right.

00:07:56.774 --> 00:07:58.608
He departed from that tradition.

00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:02.776
He moved away from it in a number of ways.

00:08:02.776 --> 00:08:04.669
Retired from that tradition?

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.689
Yeah, that also doesn't feel quite right.

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:08.976
So I would go with departed.

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:11.577
"Retired from that tradition
in a number of ways."

00:08:11.577 --> 00:08:13.643
No, I think it's much more of,

00:08:13.643 --> 00:08:16.719
I imagine like this splitting
off from that tradition.

00:08:17.938 --> 00:08:19.378
"Kingman, however, split
from that tradition

00:08:19.378 --> 00:08:21.060
"in a number of ways,"
would also be an interesting

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.777
way to say it, but they didn't
have that choice over here.

00:08:23.777 --> 00:08:26.518
So let's keep reading.

00:08:26.518 --> 00:08:29.617
So "Most notably that he chose to focus

00:08:29.617 --> 00:08:31.544
"not on natural landscapes,
such as mountains

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.285
"and rivers, but on cities."

00:08:33.285 --> 00:08:35.584
So now we have just
question five here, I guess,

00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:37.245
is probably referring
to what we just read,

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:39.346
so let's see what question five is.

00:08:39.346 --> 00:08:42.236
"For the sake of cohesion
of this paragraph,"

00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:44.245
so that's the paragraph we just read.

00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:46.322
This one right over here.

00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:47.983
"For the sake of cohesion
of this paragraph,

00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:50.141
"sentence 3 should be placed."

00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:52.614
So sentence three is
this one right over here.

00:08:52.614 --> 00:08:54.519
That's sentence three right over here.

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.981
Sentence here, and that's
actually the one that tripped me

00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:57.943
up a little bit because I said,
"His interest was so keen,

00:08:57.943 --> 00:09:00.160
"in fact, he was named after it."

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.565
And the sentence before they're talking

00:09:01.565 --> 00:09:03.364
about students assigned
a formal school name,

00:09:03.364 --> 00:09:07.401
so was he named after
his school in some way?

00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:09.862
So A is leaving it where it is now,

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:12.497
B is before sentence one,

00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:13.728
so that means that this would be

00:09:13.728 --> 00:09:14.819
the first sentence of the paragraph.

00:09:14.819 --> 00:09:16.340
"His interest was so keen, in fact, that

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.336
he was named after it. Kingman was keenly

00:09:18.336 --> 00:09:20.682
"interested in landscape
painting from an early age."

00:09:20.682 --> 00:09:21.296
No that doesn't.

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:24.803
This sentence is referring to something,

00:09:24.803 --> 00:09:25.999
so something else has to be

00:09:27.263 --> 00:09:28.400
written before.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.898
This would not be something that you would

00:09:29.898 --> 00:09:32.046
want to start the paragraph with.

00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:34.042
Let's see, after sentence one,

00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:35.876
so let's see how that would read.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:38.559
"Kingman was keenly interested
in landscape painting

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:40.323
"from and early age.

00:09:40.323 --> 00:09:43.144
"His interest was so keen, in fact,

00:09:43.144 --> 00:09:46.000
"that he was named after it.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.644
"In Hong Kong, where Kingman
completed his schooling,

00:09:49.644 --> 00:09:51.840
"teachers at that time
customarily assigned

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.179
"students a formal 'school name.'

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:56.095
"The young boy who had been called

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.172
"Dong Moy Shu became Dong Kingman.

00:09:59.172 --> 00:10:01.574
"The name Kingman was
selected for its two parts:

00:10:01.574 --> 00:10:05.382
"'king' and 'man,' Cantonese
for scenery and composition."

00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:08.006
Yeah, I actually like
this after sentence one

00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:08.982
because now it actually,

00:10:08.982 --> 00:10:10.467
that thing that tripped me up when I said,

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:13.102
"Hey if he was named after
it, he was named after what?"

00:10:13.102 --> 00:10:16.284
But now it's clear he was
named after landscape painting.

00:10:16.284 --> 00:10:17.480
"Kingman was keenly interested

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.243
"in landscape painting from an early age.

00:10:20.243 --> 00:10:21.903
"His interest was so keen, in fact,

00:10:21.903 --> 00:10:23.284
"that he was named after it."

00:10:23.284 --> 00:10:25.303
He was named after landscape painting,

00:10:25.303 --> 00:10:26.407
so it makes sense that sentence

00:10:26.407 --> 00:10:28.381
three comes right after sentence one.

00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:30.644
It's referring to what
happened in sentence one.

00:10:30.644 --> 00:10:31.945
And we get, it clarifies later on

00:10:31.945 --> 00:10:34.278
that he was named literally
after landscape painting.

00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:36.786
"'King' and 'man', Cantonese for scenery

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:40.250
"and composition," landscape painting.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.844
Now let's keep going,
so this says question

00:10:41.844 --> 00:10:43.607
six of five, so I think
this is another bug

00:10:43.607 --> 00:10:46.765
out of the early prototype
interface that I'm using,

00:10:46.765 --> 00:10:48.959
but the important thing
is we do the questions.

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.387
So it says, "Which choice most,"

00:10:50.387 --> 00:10:52.884
and so question six is referring I guess

00:10:52.884 --> 00:10:54.740
to this entire paragraph.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.900
"Which choice most effectively establishes

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.280
"the main topic of the paragraph?"

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.832
So let's read this paragraph.

00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:04.577
"His fine brushwork conveys
detailed street-level

00:11:04.577 --> 00:11:07.351
"activity: a peanut
vendor pushing his cart

00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.846
"on the sidewalk, a
pigeon pecking for crumbs

00:11:09.846 --> 00:11:12.342
"around a fire hydrant, an old man

00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:14.850
"tending to a baby outside a doorway.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.868
"His broader brushstrokes
and sponge-painted shapes

00:11:17.868 --> 00:11:21.188
"created majestic city
skylines, with skyscrapers

00:11:21.188 --> 00:11:23.221
"towering in the background,
bridges connecting

00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:25.205
"neighborhoods on either side of a river,

00:11:25.205 --> 00:11:28.444
"and enormous ships maneuvering
out of a busy harbor.

00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:31.660
"To art critics and fans
alike, these city scenes

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.588
"represented the innovative spirit

00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:36.199
"of twentieth-century urban Modernism."

00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:37.298
Alright, it's talking
about all the different

00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:39.342
ways that he's able to paint and really

00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:41.953
convey what's happening in a city.

00:11:41.953 --> 00:11:43.439
So "which choice most effectively

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:45.947
"establishes the main
topic of the paragraph?

00:11:45.947 --> 00:11:48.302
"Kingman is considered a pioneer

00:11:48.302 --> 00:11:49.302
of the California School of Style?"

00:11:49.302 --> 00:11:50.069
Well no, they're not even talking

00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:51.322
about the California Style.

00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:53.308
I don't have to even finish
reading that first one.

00:11:53.308 --> 00:11:55.165
"Although cities were his
main subject, Kingman did

00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:56.732
"occasionally paint natural landscapes."

00:11:56.732 --> 00:11:58.950
No this is really just talking
about all the different ways

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.286
that he really captured a city.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.415
They didn't say that he, you know, also

00:12:01.415 --> 00:12:02.820
occasionally did natural.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.722
This is really about
how he captured cities.

00:12:05.722 --> 00:12:08.334
"In his urban landscapes, Kingman captures

00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:10.737
"the vibrancy of crowded cities."

00:12:10.737 --> 00:12:12.235
Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:15.195
That's what this paragraph is about.

00:12:15.195 --> 00:12:17.923
"In 1929 Kingman moved to
Oakland, California, where he

00:12:17.923 --> 00:12:19.456
"attended the Fox Art School."

00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:23.438
No that is not what this
paragraph right here is about.

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:27.483
And so let's go to
question seven out of five.

00:12:27.483 --> 00:12:30.618
So once again, I think this
should say seven out of seven,

00:12:30.618 --> 00:12:32.022
but I think we get the point.

00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:33.636
Let's answer this question.

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:36.144
"During his career, Kingman exhibited

00:12:36.144 --> 00:12:39.220
"his work internationally. He garnered

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.923
"much acclaim. In 1936,
a critic described."

00:12:42.923 --> 00:12:46.023
So that just felt a little
bit robotic when I read that.

00:12:46.023 --> 00:12:49.273
"Kingman exhibited his work
internationally. Period.

00:12:49.273 --> 00:12:51.479
"He garnered much acclaim.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.776
"In 1936, a critic described
one of Kingman's solo exhibits

00:12:54.776 --> 00:12:56.564
"as 'twenty of the
freshest, most satis--."

00:12:56.564 --> 00:12:57.922
And I'm just reading this
just to finish the passage.

00:12:57.922 --> 00:12:59.710
If you're running out of time on the SAT,

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.964
I would probably just try to answer

00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:02.450
this question and move on.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.446
But "'twenty of the freshest,
most satisfying watercolors

00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:07.291
"'that have ever been seen
hereabouts in many a day.'

00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:09.508
"Since Kingman's death
in 2000, museums across

00:13:09.508 --> 00:13:11.249
"the United States and
in China have continued

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.525
"to ensure that his now-iconic landscapes

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:15.929
"remain available for
the public to enjoy."

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.901
Well let's go back to question seven.

00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:20.490
So, let's see the choices.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.590
So one is "internationally,
and Kingman also garnered."

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.910
So "Kingman exhibited his work
internationally, and Kingman

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.512
"also garnered much acclaim."

00:13:28.512 --> 00:13:29.452
Now that just seems

00:13:30.662 --> 00:13:31.440
a little wordy.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.401
You're seeing Kingman
twice very close together.

00:13:33.401 --> 00:13:35.479
You don't need to, so
I wouldn't do that one.

00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:38.589
"Kingman exhibited his
work internationally;

00:13:38.589 --> 00:13:42.129
"from exhibiting, he
garnered much acclaim."

00:13:42.129 --> 00:13:44.451
So once again, this is kind of

00:13:44.451 --> 00:13:46.273
you're using exhibited up here,

00:13:46.273 --> 00:13:47.411
and you're using it again.

00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:49.106
It feels redundant.

00:13:49.106 --> 00:13:51.370
"Kingman exhibited his
work internationally,

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.167
"but garnered much acclaim."

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.164
Well but makes it seem
like garnering acclaim

00:13:56.164 --> 00:13:57.952
is somehow something that you wouldn't

00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:00.297
expect for someone who's
exhibiting internationally,

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:01.272
but they kind of go together.

00:14:01.272 --> 00:14:03.757
You would, garnering acclaim
should go along with inter--

00:14:03.757 --> 00:14:04.977
There shouldn't be a but there.

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:07.715
It shouldn't be kind of
contradicting it in some way

00:14:07.715 --> 00:14:09.840
or going in another direction.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.012
So this would be "Kingman exhibited

00:14:11.012 --> 00:14:14.193
"his work internationally,
garnering much acclaim."

00:14:14.193 --> 00:14:15.981
Yeah, just nice and simple.

00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:17.920
Exhibiting his work
internationally, and in doing so,

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.218
he's garnering much acclaim.

00:14:20.218 --> 00:14:22.377
Makes all the, feels nice and clean

00:14:22.377 --> 00:14:24.839
and gets to the point
without being redundant

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:25.839
or in some ways

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:29.606
contradicting in a weird way.

00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:32.317
Yeah, feel good about these answers.
