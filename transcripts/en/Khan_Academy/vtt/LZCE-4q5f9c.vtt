00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.180
- [Instructor] In many videos
when we've discussed evolution

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.290
and natural selection, we've
talked about how variation

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.920
in a population can fuel
natural selection and evolution.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.900
So if you have a population of circles,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.060
obviously a very simple model here,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.760
maybe some of these circles
are that off-white color,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.650
maybe some of them are blue,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.860
and maybe some of them
are this salmon color.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.270
For certain traits, your environment

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.590
might make certain of them
better for reproduction,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.480
better for survival, evading predators,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.160
better for finding food.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.880
Now let's say these circles
for whatever reason,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.900
they're in an environment
where maybe being blue

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.880
makes it a little bit
easier to evade predators

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.060
and a little bit easier to
reproduce and find food.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.410
Well then, in the next generation,
in the next generation,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.350
because the blue's more likely to be able

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.890
to get to reproduction,
because they weren't eaten,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.690
you're likely to have more blues.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170
So we draw a few more blues.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.410
And maybe a little bit
less of the other ones,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.410
because they're also
competing for resources

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.770
amongst each other, at least
in this model that I'm doing.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.550
And so over time, if this blue phenotype,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.160
remember, phenotype is the expressed trait

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.870
that's actually observable,
versus a genotype,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.550
which is the overlying
genetics, which is sometimes

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.780
observable and sometimes
not, but as you can see,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.440
if in this environment,
blue seems to carry

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.180
some advantage, even if it's a slight

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.260
probabilistic advantage,
over many generations,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.730
blue will start to dominate.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.730
And so you start to see that
evolution of this population

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.350
to being more blue as a species.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.770
So, you have these blue circles.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.650
One way to think about
it is, you have variation

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.760
in a species is really
what natural selection

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.593
is based off of.

00:01:58.593 --> 00:02:02.240
Certain variants might be
more favorable than others,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.240
so that is what's really
necessary for natural selection

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.530
to fuel evolution.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.223
To fuel evolution.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.580
Now, a key question is,
where does this variation

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.600
in a population come from?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.520
And to think about that, we
just have to remind ourselves

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.820
where our phenotypes come from.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.310
How do these expressed
traits get expressed?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.760
Well, in all the living
organisms we're aware of,

00:02:31.773 --> 00:02:32.606
we have DNA.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:35.390
As human beings we have
23 pair of chromosomes,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.910
and each chromosome you can view

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.450
as just a very very
very long strand of DNA,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.890
and sections of that DNA
code for various traits,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.160
and each of those sections that code for,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.510
say a certain protein
or a part of an enzyme,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.120
we call those things genes.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.160
We call those things genes.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.330
We have multiple chromosomes.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.650
As human beings, different
species have a different number,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.170
but as human beings we have
23 pair of chromosomes.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.260
Each chromosome you view
as a long strand of DNA.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.250
Parts of that DNA code for specific genes,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.150
and then if you were to zoom in,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.190
if you were to zoom in on those genes,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.700
you would see those nucleotide sequences,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.560
and this is all a review.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.540
We've seen this in other videos,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.990
where you see your adenine, your guanine,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.120
your cytosine, your thiamine,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.580
in order that carries the information

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.660
that will eventually be coded into MRNA,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.000
which then gets coded into protein.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.630
Now there's two primary
sources of variation.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.670
One source of a variation
is sexual reproduction.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.470
Sexual reproduction.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.130
Now, not all organisms reproduce sexually,

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.890
but many of the ones that we know,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.820
including human beings, do,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.477
where a male member of the species

00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:56.780
and a female member of the species

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.090
each contribute a random
half of their chromosomes

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.570
to the next organism.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.620
So one way to think about
sexual reproduction is

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.780
it keeps shuffling the
different versions of the genes

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.330
that you have in the population
into different combinations

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.000
of those versions of genes, and
so that generates variation.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.630
But sexual reproduction
by itself will not create

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.150
new versions of genes,
which we call alleles,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.980
or new genes entirely,
and so the primary way

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.970
that that happens is through mutations,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.360
and you might have guessed
that we were gonna talk

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.530
about that, 'cause I
had this title up here.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.100
So, another source of variation,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.440
and you could almost view
this as a more fundamental one

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.760
because this would
happen even in organisms

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.290
that aren't reproducing sexually,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.670
is that over time, there
can be just random mistakes.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.160
There could be edits to these genes,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.380
and it could be a random, maybe this G

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.470
gets turned into a C randomly,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.940
or maybe this T and A gets cut out

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.360
during the DNA replication process.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.710
These mutations, which
are all about genotype,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.810
and let me make this very clear,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.800
so when we're looking at the sequence,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.990
we're thinking about genotype.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.120
Differences in genotype
are not always obvious

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.300
from expressed traits.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.060
Sometimes they do change phenotype

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.380
where they're observable in phenotype.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.890
Sometimes they're not.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.350
But when they are observable in phenotype,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.820
as I just mentioned,
many times it could be

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.260
a negative change in phenotype

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.350
where it makes it less
viable for that organism

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.870
or it's harder for them
to survive and reproduce,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.870
but every now and then it could result

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.610
in a variation in phenotype
that is maybe neutral

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.470
or even confers some type of advantage.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.810
So it might have been a random mutation

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.540
that somehow turned one
of these white circles

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.840
into a blue circle, and
there might have been

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.440
another mutation that
turned a white circle

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.530
into a square, and that
just wasn't even viable

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.800
as an organism, but the blue circles

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.790
happened to be, in the
environment they're in,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.953
happened to be a favorable variation.
