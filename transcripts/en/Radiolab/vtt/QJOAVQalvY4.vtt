00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.080
You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.980
from W N Y s

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.920
n p. R. Hey, here we are post hurricane.

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.930
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab podcast. And today,

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.380
nope. You Ain't call this a character study, I suppose. Yeah,

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.280
it comes from our producer Sean Cole. Hello. Hey. So, uh,

7
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.200
start us off stories about Mel Blanc. Very man of,

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.720
of many. You know who that is? No, I don't. He,

9
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:37.950
you don't know who mill blank is? Why should I know who he is? No,

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.080
you do know who he is because of what he did. What did he do?

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.780
He was the voice of

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.430
bugs bunny and

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.640
porky pig. Yosemite Sam.

14
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.520
That'd be the Pew. You smelled me out to little sandy pale.

15
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.820
Bester. Oh, can you put it back? I'll say go away, boy. You me. Oh, corn.

16
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.320
Leghorns that was all one guy.

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.270
Shit. Wow. Okay. So what's, uh,

18
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.220
what's the story dude? I'm nowhere near done with this woody woodpecker.

19
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.710
Mel Blank, Barney rebel, Nell blank. Dino the dinosaur.

20
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.910
Mel Blank. And on the other side of the anachronistic spectrum,

21
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.050
you guys won't believe this. He was Mr Spacely for the Jetson? Yes. Czechian.

22
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.420
Let's see. I'll put the antifreeze speed bug in the cupboards. Secret Squirrel,

23
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.340
right? Chief captain, Caveman.

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.310
It's with you from buck Rogers if you ever watched that. Yeah.

25
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.100
What about the bomb coli? This guy was like the voice of my childhood voice says

26
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.250
[inaudible] a crowd. Oh my gosh.

27
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.450
My Dad got so many requests to do so many voices. This is no blank.

28
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.610
Mel's son is only kid. Actually,

29
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.050
kids would come to the door literally every single day and he answered the door

30
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:14.110
and talk to the kids and then up at big bear where we are now.

31
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.220
When the tour boats come, just like they do now, we'd get on the megaphone,

32
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.180
do the characters and say hi to all the tourists, you know, 12 times a day.

33
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.650
Holy Long. That's how many tour boats we have. No, and you do voices too?

34
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.930
I do a few of the voices that they might be easy to daddy it. It does.

35
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.010
And did. He did. He did 1500 voices. 1500 yeah.

36
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.080
I copy a few of them and there's a bunch of us that do different voices and we'd

37
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:43.690
never been able to really sound like exactly like him.

38
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.170
So it took many of you to be one of whom? I can't. Oh my gosh, yes.

39
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:49.090
I do bugs porky Daffy tweety Sylvester.

40
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:53.200
But there's other people that do it too and all of them sound, you know,

41
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.460
if he goes, he went jump doc, you know,

42
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.300
it can sound real close to him, but then when you start to do sentences,

43
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.320
it becomes very difficult for anybody to sound like him because everybody has

44
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.154
their own voiceprint.

45
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.370
<v 2>And Mel had his own voiceprint.</v>

47
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.410
<v 0>But this isn't really a story about voices or it is,</v>

49
00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:17.360
but not in the way that you think.

50
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.010
It's really about what it's like to breathe life into a character and whether

51
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:24.710
that character can breathe life back into. You

52
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.180
see back in 1961 dad and I had smell and knoll went into business together

53
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.620
producing radio commercials.

54
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.250
Funny commercials cause humorous commercials weren't really being done at that

55
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.070
time. Very few. So we decided to start to do that.

56
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.280
We send out all the brochures and that's the week.

57
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.980
<v 3>Yeah, the same week that mill</v>

58
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.860
<v 1>[inaudible],</v>

59
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.540
<v 2>he had a head on collision and dead man's curve at UCLA.</v>

60
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.430
Where was, where was he headed?

61
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.280
He had just finished a recording session in San Francisco.

62
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.670
He had flown to San Francisco early in the morning, came back,

63
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.000
ate dinner with my mom and then rushed back out to do another recording session

64
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.170
and a a kid in a 98 Oldsmobile gigantic car,

65
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.460
lost control on dead man's head. On collision.

66
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.100
My Dad was in an Aston Martin, which was an aluminum

67
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.460
<v 0>bodied English car and it folded right up. They had to cut him out of there.</v>

68
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.470
Luckily he was only a block from the UCLA Hospital.

69
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.050
Is that like the jaws of life kind of mapped there? Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.650
They gave him a thousand to one chance of survival and he broke virtually every

71
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:36.520
bone in his body. Well, I think that was more than a slight exaggeration,

72
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:39.280
but from his point of view, it probably felt just like that.

73
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.940
This is Lewis Conway, Louis W. Conway. Uh,

74
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.060
I do very little these days. He's a doctor. Before I retired,

75
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.470
I was a neurosurgeon and he was on the floor at UCLA Medical Center back then.

76
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.870
I was a resident, he was like 29 at the time.

77
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.250
I think I was the first one to see, know blank in the emergency room,

78
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.670
completely unrecognizable at the time, you know,

79
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:07.790
blood and Gore and so forth. So we cleaned them out and uh,

80
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.870
then it became clear that he was, uh, going to be a major, um,

81
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.120
celebrity in the place providing I kept him alive.

82
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.290
<v 1>No.</v>

83
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.840
<v 2>When you show up at the hospital, what's the first,</v>

84
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.590
how are you greeted there by a lot of flashing cameras and that,

85
00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:27.830
that all of a sudden I knew something was really bad. I met my mom.

86
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:31.470
We went inside. There were a lot of people there, the papers and uh,

87
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.350
because they thought it was going to die. In fact,

88
00:05:33.351 --> 00:05:37.700
there was an obituary written in the Honolulu Harold that said,

89
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:40.880
bugs bunny's dead. That was the headline headline.

90
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.100
And it must have been really frequent. Yeah.

91
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.610
<v 0>Oh yeah, totally. So was my mind. I remember just, we couldn't believe it.</v>

92
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.270
And he was Ashen Gray. He didn't look like he was gonna make it at all.

93
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.930
The doctors didn't manage to get him stabilized, but he was unconscious.

94
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.890
He was in a coma. So

95
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.690
<v 2>we just stayed there, ran home, take a shower,</v>

96
00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:05.350
come back for one day and then the next and then the next,

97
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.390
we were at the hospital for about two weeks and, uh, trying to talk. Yeah.

98
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.900
Can you hear us man? It was always, can you hear me dad? Can you hear me?

99
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.920
I mean, deeply unconscious, not responding. I Call Him Dad, pop father,

100
00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:21.760
whatever it is. Male. We try to do any, anything, not opening his eyes.

101
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.000
And there was really no response and it became possible that he would never

102
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:28.240
respond. But, uh, after about 14 days,

103
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.320
<v 0>a doctor came in, he was a resident, Dr. Conway, this is me, the resident,</v>

104
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:38.060
he was a resident and he went over to Mel's bed and for whatever reason,

105
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.140
maybe just to mix things up, I said to him, uh,

106
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.830
without any real reason to suspect he would know what I was saying.

107
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.700
I said to him, bugs, bugs bunny.

108
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:55.760
How are you doing today? And I'll be darned if mail didn't go

109
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.783
my stamp.

110
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.550
GOC He responded as bugs quite clearly.

111
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.970
What anyone porky. Are you there? Dad said I can g I can hear it.

112
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.780
I can eat. Tweety are you here tiny? I put each hand popcorn.

113
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.580
Lakehorn I pay attention son.

114
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.120
You see that house over there that says d o g that spells chicken.

115
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.990
He said all that you have bugs. Daffy, porky,

116
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.490
tweety Sylvester. All these characters you went through about six characters.

117
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.170
Are you standing there watching this? Yeah. Oh yeah.

118
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.010
And what's going through your mind at that? Well,

119
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.880
I'm so excited that he's able to, that he came out of the coma. How so?

120
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:44.010
You're going to feel when he hasn't done anything for 14 days,

121
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.700
really hasn't been conscious and then all of a sudden he's conscious doing these

122
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.620
characters and then according to Noah,

123
00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:53.820
after doing the characters for a few moments, he just came back. Where am I?

124
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:58.380
What happened as Mel. Oh, okay. You're at UCLA or in a traffic accident. Oh,

125
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.450
was anybody else hurt? No, the boy had a scratch knee. I see what?

126
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.410
We're just a sec here. When he said, uh,

127
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.670
what's up doc was do, do you,

128
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.420
was that Mel Blanc talking or was that bugs bunny inside Mel Blanc?

129
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.950
That's the the question. And then,

130
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.980
and it's a question that actually came back again 23 years later,

131
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.550
Mr. Bell Blank,

132
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.080
this is your life on TV on this show.

133
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.640
This is your life that you've heard of.

134
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:32.140
And they bring out a celebrity and then they take to this liberty's family and

135
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:34.340
everybody they work with and they say like, Hey,

136
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.910
remember this and remember or that now's funny.

137
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:41.590
Voices used to drive our high school principal crazy. And you know,

138
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:46.591
it's all very light marrying and fun until at 8:29 PM January 24th,

139
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.930
1961 it all comes to a crashing halt.

140
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.650
They start talking about the car accident and they call the doctor out to the

141
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:54.790
stage surgeon,

142
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:59.791
Dr. Lewis Conway interstage right to tell the full comma story and the host says

143
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.720
doc, like, what did you think when this all happened? I was astonished.

144
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.820
Mel was dying and it seemed as though bugs bunny was trying to save his life.

145
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.770
<v 4>That,</v>

146
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.770
that is the idea that has survived more than any other part of the story.

147
00:09:18.821 --> 00:09:21.970
That's the thing that keeps coming back and back and it's like, wait a second.

148
00:09:21.971 --> 00:09:25.210
Like what? What does it mean? What does it mean?

149
00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:29.080
And it just presents all of these questions like,

150
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.580
who is Mel Really? Who is bugs bunny?

151
00:09:33.581 --> 00:09:38.581
Really is when you make somebody up d do they compete with you in some way

152
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.110
compete and win, right, exactly.

153
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.030
Is that more deeply in Male than Mel is? Do you know what I mean?

154
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.610
Yeah, totally. I brought Dr. Conway back to that moment.

155
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.060
<v 0>The same as though bugs bunny was trying to save his life.</v>

156
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.710
I don't remember saying that,

157
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:55.440
but [inaudible] do you think there's anything to that?

158
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.900
Well, uh, I, I don't really know that bugs bunny was that skillful,

159
00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:06.130
but, uh, so I basically say not much to it.

160
00:10:06.131 --> 00:10:09.780
I don't think so. Ask Noel. It's, it's an interesting headline.

161
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.840
Bugs bunny saves mill. Um, he didn't save his life,

162
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:14.370
but he certainly got him out of the coma.

163
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.350
Then he told me something that does feed into the idea that these characters to

164
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.470
had minds of their own. Well, uh, he says as a kid,

165
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.570
he would watch his dad perform and every time he became those characters,

166
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.720
I could turn the sound off in a booth where you couldn't hear him,

167
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.010
just turn the speakers off and watch him and know exactly what character is

168
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:42.990
doing because his whole body would metamorphosize to that character.

169
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.650
He looked like bugs bunny when he was doing bugs. He looked just like you,

170
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.540
somebody, Sam, when he was doing a 70 Sam,

171
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.170
he became really small and timid when he was doing tweety.

172
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.230
Tillys he was sort of like a method actor. Yeah, sort of. I mean,

173
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.400
the way no described it. It was like these characters momentarily inhabited him.

174
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.460
So I think they were part of him basically. But still,

175
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:05.850
what I don't want to get though is why would he respond to what's up the bugs

176
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.440
rather than like, what's up Mel? Or what's up dad or what's up honey.

177
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:15.090
You know what I mean? That's, that's a difficult question. Uh,

178
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.440
you know, I, I wish I could answer it. No.

179
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.790
[inaudible] really want to go there anyway. What,

180
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.080
what other questions do you have? I'm like,

181
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.980
you were stuck on that one and I kind of am stuck on it. Um,

182
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.800
and I know that it's not a question anybody can ultimately answer,

183
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:29.970
but I called up this guy,

184
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.100
<v 5>this is Orrin Devinsky at NYU Medical Center,</v>

185
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.840
<v 0>a neurologist that we sometimes throw questions like this too.</v>

186
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.590
And I ran them through the whole scenario that this guy comes into the room and

187
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:43.850
says, hi bugs bunny, how are you doing today? And he says, oh,

188
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.170
what's up deck?

189
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:46.880
<v 5>Interesting.</v>

190
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.080
<v 0>So he batted around in his head for awhile and then he said, well, you know,</v>

191
00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:53.980
I might have something to do with queues

192
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 4>like getting, getting the cues mixed up. What do you mean? Well,</v>

193
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.943
first of all,

194
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.160
<v 5>her for a few weeks speaks to a very significant brain injury.</v>

195
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.210
<v 4>And what orange often sees with people who have had brain injuries like males,</v>

196
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.930
is that they lose the ability to read the cues that tell them who they're

197
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:15.040
supposed to be. When dad at home, boss at the office, bugs in the studio,

198
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.550
whatever.

199
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.550
<v 5>Here's a man who no longer has his ability to differentiate social cues of right</v>

200
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:25.510
and wrong of, of when to be bugs bunny and when not to be bugs bunny,

201
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.360
where he is and where he isn't.

202
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.470
<v 4>You have to keep in mind that when he was working,</v>

203
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.560
this is a guy who was getting queued all the time.

204
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.900
<v 0>He was doing 18 radio shows a week at one time. Wow.</v>

205
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.340
So he just be running down the street from ABC to CBS to NBC and uh,

206
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.400
they'd hand him a script and he'd run on stage and do it.

207
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.530
<v 1>I'm a little tech</v>

208
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.110
[inaudible] a private side side.

209
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:57.180
<v 0>We had those characters buried in himself that could come out surface incredibly</v>

210
00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.360
fast on a dime. Yeah. Here's the script. That's the character. Yeah.

211
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.720
<v 4>So if he's got all these characters hanging around in his head,</v>

212
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.780
just waiting for the right queue and in his head,

213
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:13.020
that part of the brain that interprets the cues is all messed up. Oh No.

214
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.060
Maybe in a way when Dr. Conway said Bugs Bunny, how are you doing today?

215
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.320
Maybe the way Mel heard it was, hey Mel,

216
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.203
you're wrong.

217
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.530
<v 1>In his mind time, I have been the director at the time for all I know,</v>

218
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.750
even the good doctor went along with this one.

219
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.760
It's as though he was given permission to talk now because it was his time to

220
00:13:38.761 --> 00:13:39.594
talk. So,

221
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.820
<v 4>so on one level it,</v>

222
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.010
it's obviously crazy to think that bugs bunny saved his life because after all

223
00:13:46.011 --> 00:13:50.720
he was just a cartoon character. But whether or not those characters saved him,

224
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.290
I mean in that moment they were the most essential part of him you could say.

225
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.500
Because when the rest of Mel was adrift and sort of lost in the ether,

226
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.110
bugs was there. He was ready to go to work,

227
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.930
which makes perfect sense to Orrin Devinsky.

228
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.540
<v 5>I mean that was a rehearsed thing that he did once.</v>

229
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.940
Once you practice things long enough, they,

230
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.610
they kind of become automatic and lower portions of the brain.

231
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.130
And that's why when the higher brains injured,

232
00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:21.590
sometimes these lower brain functions can come out so,

233
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.540
so beautifully because they have been kind of wired in over time.

234
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.160
So the bugs bunny voice was, was perfectly preserved. Deep inside

235
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:34.390
<v 4>bugs bunny is like crystallized and kept over here and a protective jar away</v>

236
00:14:34.671 --> 00:14:36.830
from the rattling cage of the brain.

237
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.650
<v 5>Exactly. You went down into the safe.</v>

238
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.320
<v 4>So what had ended up happening to Mel? Well,</v>

239
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.440
he took a long time to recover and then I was in a body cast for, Gosh,

240
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:55.010
seven months. And, but he, he worked the entire time. I mean,

241
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:59.950
he never stopped working there bringing the equipment.

242
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.370
<v 0>I brought the equipment in, dangled a mic over the bed and uh,</v>

243
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.480
he started to work there.

244
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.970
<v 4>In fact, the first 65 Flintstones,</v>

245
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.600
you would never know this Barney in real life. What's on your mind, Bonnie?

246
00:15:13.601 --> 00:15:16.780
I'm kind of busy. Was flat on his back in a body cast,

247
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.750
just passing by on my way to shoot a doctor. The doctor.

248
00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:24.580
What's the matter with you, Bonnie boy. And then in 1989 for the first time,

249
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.120
Knoll and Mel both were starring in this commercial for Oldsmobile.

250
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.580
Mel's 81 in the shtick. They did a bunch of these. The shtick was, you know,

251
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.900
not your father's Oldsmobile.

252
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.260
<v 0>We did the commercial. It took us all day to do it,</v>

253
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.130
and he had just gotten over the flu. So he wasn't feeling that great.

254
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.740
And I says, dad, why don't you run over to the doctor?

255
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.180
So he goes over the doctor and I called the doctor. I says, what's his story?

256
00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.510
He says, well, he's okay. He's fine. I can give him a shot and send them home,

257
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.640
but I'd love to clear his lungs out.

258
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.870
So why don't we just put them in the hospital overnight, clear his lungs out,

259
00:15:58.871 --> 00:16:02.350
and then send them home. So I talked to my dad as soon as you want to do that,

260
00:16:02.351 --> 00:16:06.640
he says, well, okay, what the heck? I'll see you in the morning. Pop. Oh yeah,

261
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.310
got there the next morning about seven 30 I says, how do you feel? He says,

262
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:11.144
my leg hurts.

263
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.980
This is why the nurses at the hospital forgot to put up the bed rails on the

264
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:21.850
side of the bed. Well, you know how high a hospital bed is.

265
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:27.450
He had fallen out of the bed and broken his femur fat envelope had got into the

266
00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:32.671
brain by that time and within 48 hours he was basically almost brain dead.

267
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:37.923
Yeah.

268
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.430
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

269
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.390
<v 0>during the next couple of days, he'd come in and out of his coma</v>

270
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.770
<v 2>or in and out of his sleep and</v>

271
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.200
I tried to rouse him with the characters like the doctor had 30 years earlier.

272
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.330
Yeah. Bugs. Are you in there? Yeah,

273
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.890
it was very difficult at that time because he's 30 years older now.

274
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:03.070
He's 81 years old and uh,

275
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.120
it was difficult to revive him after each time that he would fall back to sleep

276
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:08.954
again.

277
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
<v 0>And just before his dad passed away and all says that Mel looked at him and in</v>

278
00:17:14.311 --> 00:17:19.020
the voice of Yosemite Sam, he said, no, I love you. And that was about it.

279
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.450
Oh my God.

280
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:27.120
It was the last character he did and the last character on film or recorded

281
00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:27.810
character,

282
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:32.220
which was in that ultimate Beal out I told you about was porky saying that's all

283
00:17:32.221 --> 00:17:36.390
folks. And that's what his tombstone says too.

284
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.943
That's all folks.

285
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.503
<v 1>Wow.</v>

286
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.430
[inaudible]

287
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.130
<v 4>thank you, Sean Cole. Shawn does some good voices himself. He does,</v>

288
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.160
<v 0>but we won't share them with you. Not In the company of Mr Mel Blank.</v>

289
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.700
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

290
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.500
<v 0>very, very big. Thanks to uh, no blanc, Mel blank son and to Dr. Lewis Conway,</v>

291
00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:10.990
the doctor and to Roberts boyfriend or an Devinsky. That's an inside joke.

292
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:15.290
Do like Gordon. Oh. And a huge thanks to Mel blank himself,

293
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.550
