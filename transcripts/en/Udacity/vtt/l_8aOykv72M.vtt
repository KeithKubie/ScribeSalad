00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here's the function card_ranks.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It takes a hand, pulls out the ranking for each hand,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
makes that into a number, sorts them so that the highest numbers are first,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and returns that, and now I'm claiming

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we can make 1 change to card_ranks

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so that it will handle the case of an ace-low straight

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and come up with the right representation for that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in terms of ranks that will allow the rest of the program to function properly.

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Can you come up with that change?
