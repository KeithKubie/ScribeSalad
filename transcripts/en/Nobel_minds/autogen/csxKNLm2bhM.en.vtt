model the advantage of this is that you
 

00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:41.680
model the advantage of this is that you
reduce the number of particles and when

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:10.190
is something which cannot easily be
 

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.670
is something which cannot easily be
provided by the experiment but from the

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680
provided by the experiment but from the
 

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.090
provided by the experiment but from the
calculations that we do we can say why

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.100
calculations that we do we can say why
 

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.230
calculations that we do we can say why
is this reaction proceeding what is the

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240
is this reaction proceeding what is the
 

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.150
is this reaction proceeding what is the
reason for the reaction barrier can we

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160
reason for the reaction barrier can we
 

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.829
reason for the reaction barrier can we
lower the barrier by some technique

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839
lower the barrier by some technique
 

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:26.470
lower the barrier by some technique
maybe it has an electrostatic origin

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480
maybe it has an electrostatic origin
 

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.870
maybe it has an electrostatic origin
does it require a lot of energy to bring

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880
does it require a lot of energy to bring
 

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.480
does it require a lot of energy to bring
the reactant and the product I mean the

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.490
the reactant and the product I mean the
 

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.130
the reactant and the product I mean the
part to reacting molecules together

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.140
part to reacting molecules together
 

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.850
part to reacting molecules together
maybe okay then maybe we could put

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:36.860
maybe okay then maybe we could put
 

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.889
maybe okay then maybe we could put
something with facilitate that some

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:38.899
something with facilitate that some
 

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:41.110
something with facilitate that some
charge particle would facilitate that

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120
charge particle would facilitate that
 

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.860
charge particle would facilitate that
so the immense success of this basically

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:44.870
so the immense success of this basically
 

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.490
so the immense success of this basically
is that it gives us understanding and

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:48.500
is that it gives us understanding and
 

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.760
is that it gives us understanding and
with that I think I should stop here and

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:51.770
with that I think I should stop here and
 

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.360
with that I think I should stop here and
I hopefully we have some of the laureate

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.370
I hopefully we have some of the laureate
 

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.560
I hopefully we have some of the laureate
on the line well we got hold of all

00:14:59.560 --> 00:14:59.570
on the line well we got hold of all
 

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.889
on the line well we got hold of all
three laureates and then now I hope that

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:02.899
three laureates and then now I hope that
 

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:05.920
three laureates and then now I hope that

theoreticians would come to us with

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:32.770
theoreticians would come to us with
 

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.940
theoreticians would come to us with
ideas about how system behaved and if

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:35.950
ideas about how system behaved and if
 

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.030
ideas about how system behaved and if
they if their predictions would scan

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.040
they if their predictions would scan
 

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.480
they if their predictions would scan
with our experiments they would be happy

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:42.490
with our experiments they would be happy
 

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.000
with our experiments they would be happy
if the two did not agree

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.010
if the two did not agree
 

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.440
if the two did not agree
we were always sure that that their

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:46.450
we were always sure that that their
 

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.010
we were always sure that that their
teachers were wrong again today when

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:50.020
teachers were wrong again today when
 

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.810
teachers were wrong again today when
theoreticians come with the prediction

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:51.820
theoreticians come with the prediction
 

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.470
theoreticians come with the prediction
that we cannot prove is correct or

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480
that we cannot prove is correct or
 

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.780
that we cannot prove is correct or
disprove well normally we as

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:57.790
disprove well normally we as
 

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.000
disprove well normally we as
experimentalists go back and check our

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.010
experimentalists go back and check our
 

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.880
experimentalists go back and check our
experiments again because it may just as

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:02.890
experiments again because it may just as
 

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.690
experiments again because it may just as
likely be we who are in the wrong today

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700
likely be we who are in the wrong today
 

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.610
likely be we who are in the wrong today
this is how far theoretical chemistry

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:08.620
this is how far theoretical chemistry
 

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.100
this is how far theoretical chemistry
has come to become one of the tools I

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:11.110
has come to become one of the tools I
 

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.360
has come to become one of the tools I
would say of experimental science

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:12.370
would say of experimental science
 

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.000
would say of experimental science
because the sort of theoretical

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.010
because the sort of theoretical
 

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.060
because the sort of theoretical

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.070
chemistry that this year's laureates
 

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.360
chemistry that this year's laureates
have been laying the foundation for our

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:20.370
have been laying the foundation for our
 

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.770
have been laying the foundation for our
simulations they're really numerical

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:22.780
simulations they're really numerical
 

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.130

experiments that tell us a lot about how

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:26.140
experiments that tell us a lot about how
 

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.790
experiments that tell us a lot about how
chemical systems work so I would say to

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:29.800
chemical systems work so I would say to
 

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.910
chemical systems work so I would say to
us theory has become the new experiments

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:34.920
us theory has become the new experiments
 

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.950
us theory has become the new experiments
what's made the theory

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960
what's made the theory
 

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.090
what's made the theory
in this role now definitely the

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:42.100
in this role now definitely the
 

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.980
in this role now definitely the
contribution of this year's laureates is

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:43.990
contribution of this year's laureates is
 

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.289
contribution of this year's laureates is
central to that because what they have

00:29:46.289 --> 00:29:46.299
central to that because what they have
 

00:29:46.299 --> 00:29:49.289
central to that because what they have
done is marrying the two worlds of

00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:49.299
done is marrying the two worlds of
 

00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:51.680
done is marrying the two worlds of
quantum physics and classical physics

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:51.690
quantum physics and classical physics
 

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.600
quantum physics and classical physics
quantum physics will really provide us

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:54.610
quantum physics will really provide us
 

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.700
quantum physics will really provide us
with all the answers that we could

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:56.710
with all the answers that we could
 

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.399
with all the answers that we could
possibly look for quantum physics has

00:29:59.399 --> 00:29:59.409
possibly look for quantum physics has
 

00:29:59.409 --> 00:30:03.299
possibly look for quantum physics has
the wonderful ability to stop time and

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:03.309
the wonderful ability to stop time and
 

00:30:03.309 --> 00:30:06.450
the wonderful ability to stop time and
to expand space so that we can look at

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:06.460
to expand space so that we can look at
 

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.509
to expand space so that we can look at
the tiniest detail of a system and we

00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519
the tiniest detail of a system and we
 

00:30:09.519 --> 00:30:11.970
the tiniest detail of a system and we
can look at this during any fraction of

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:11.980
can look at this during any fraction of
 

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.749
can look at this during any fraction of
time that we choose the problem is that

00:30:15.749 --> 00:30:15.759
time that we choose the problem is that
 

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:18.060
time that we choose the problem is that
the demands on computer power are

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.070
the demands on computer power are
 

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.999
the demands on computer power are
immense and it's completely impractical

00:30:20.999 --> 00:30:21.009
immense and it's completely impractical
 

00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:24.769
immense and it's completely impractical
to use this for any system of our size

00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779
to use this for any system of our size
 

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:27.570
to use this for any system of our size
therefore we have to use classical

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:27.580
therefore we have to use classical
 

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.909
therefore we have to use classical
physics to describe the bulk of the

00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919
physics to describe the bulk of the
 

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:34.769
physics to describe the bulk of the
system and it turned out that to marry

00:30:34.769 --> 00:30:34.779
system and it turned out that to marry
 

00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:38.039
system and it turned out that to marry
these two is no simple matter it really

00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:38.049
these two is no simple matter it really
 

00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:40.080
these two is no simple matter it really
took a large concerted effort over a

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.090
took a large concerted effort over a
 

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.759
took a large concerted effort over a
number of years to show that it was even

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:41.769
number of years to show that it was even
 

00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:43.560
number of years to show that it was even
possible which is of course what the

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:43.570
possible which is of course what the
 

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:53.509
possible which is of course what the
laureates did yes

00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519
laureates did yes
 

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:57.350
laureates did yes
quantum physics is one way of

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360
quantum physics is one way of
 

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.869
quantum physics is one way of
parametrizing the world classical

00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:00.879
parametrizing the world classical
 

00:31:00.879 --> 00:31:03.239
parametrizing the world classical
mechanics is a completely different way

00:31:03.239 --> 00:31:03.249
mechanics is a completely different way
 

00:31:03.249 --> 00:31:08.399
mechanics is a completely different way
of giving a model for basically the same

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:08.409
of giving a model for basically the same
 

00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:12.180
of giving a model for basically the same
system now one thing is that you can

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:12.190
system now one thing is that you can
 

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.879
system now one thing is that you can
make the two and compare them and that

00:31:14.879 --> 00:31:14.889
make the two and compare them and that
 

00:31:14.889 --> 00:31:17.730
make the two and compare them and that
works beautifully the problem is to take

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:17.740
works beautifully the problem is to take
 

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.310
works beautifully the problem is to take
one part of a system and describe it in

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320
one part of a system and describe it in
 

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.009
one part of a system and describe it in
terms of quantum physics and another

00:31:23.009 --> 00:31:23.019
terms of quantum physics and another
 

00:31:23.019 --> 00:31:24.899
terms of quantum physics and another
part of the chemistry out of the system

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:24.909
part of the chemistry out of the system
 

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:27.749
part of the chemistry out of the system
and describe it in terms of classical

00:31:27.749 --> 00:31:27.759
and describe it in terms of classical
 

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:30.239
and describe it in terms of classical
physics you then have to find the

00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:30.249
physics you then have to find the
 

00:31:30.249 --> 00:31:32.940
physics you then have to find the
correct boundaries to put between the

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:32.950
correct boundaries to put between the
 

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.419
correct boundaries to put between the
two systems

00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:34.429
two systems
 

00:31:34.429 --> 00:31:37.269
two systems
and to use the input from the classical

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279
and to use the input from the classical
 

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:40.029
and to use the input from the classical
mechanics as boundary conditions for the

00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039
mechanics as boundary conditions for the
 

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:43.049
mechanics as boundary conditions for the
quantum mechanics and vice versa and

00:31:43.049 --> 00:31:43.059
quantum mechanics and vice versa and
 

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:46.779
quantum mechanics and vice versa and
this means that we can look at systems

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:46.789
this means that we can look at systems
 

00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:48.999
this means that we can look at systems
of I shouldn't say any size but we can

00:31:48.999 --> 00:31:49.009
of I shouldn't say any size but we can
 

00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:51.940
of I shouldn't say any size but we can
look at vastly more larger systems and

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:51.950
look at vastly more larger systems and
 

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.129
look at vastly more larger systems and
more complicated systems and this is of

00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:54.139
more complicated systems and this is of
 

00:31:54.139 --> 00:31:56.259
more complicated systems and this is of
course what we need in order to

00:31:56.259 --> 00:31:56.269
course what we need in order to
 

00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:58.419
course what we need in order to
understand the systems that chemists are

00:31:58.419 --> 00:31:58.429
understand the systems that chemists are
 

00:31:58.429 --> 00:32:00.759
understand the systems that chemists are
