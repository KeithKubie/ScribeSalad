00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
I want to tell you about a generalization of a problem

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.200
that was first popularized by Al Cohen of York, who was an anglo-saxon

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.000
really smart dude. The problem is: you have a farmer who comes to your river and with him he has a wolf,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.320
a bundle of cabbages and a goat; and there's a boat,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.220
that's there and it carry-- it can carry him, and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.780
one of his charges. Obviously the farmer has to be there because he has to be rowing,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.160
and he wants to bring everything to the other shore safely. So that means that he cannot leave

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.540
the cabbage with the goat, because the goat would be eating the cabbage,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.320
and he cannot leave the wolf with the goat because then the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.079
wolf would eat the goat. So how can he do it?

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.020
And so of course we're assuming that the wolf cannot swim

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.340
which is a question I get all the time, when I'm speaking

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.980
to kids. So the wolf cannot swim neither can a goat or the cabbage.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.220
So the only thing you can do at first is to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.750
bring the goat.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.240
Okay, so then, okay, the farmer goes back,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.420
and he--

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.560
takes, let's say, the wolf; but now he cannot leave the wolf with the cat--

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.060
with the goat. Otherwise the wolf would eat the goat back. So what if he brown the cabbage instead?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.129
Well, same thing if he brings the cabbage now,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.180
the goat would eat the cabbage. So the only way it can be done

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.779
is you have to have this clever moment of saying "Oh, I can bring back the goat". So, okay,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.409
he brown the cabbage over

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.920
and now he brings back the goat, and now takes the wolf, brings it to the other side as well,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.360
and now he goes back just to get his goat. So...

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.480
Then you can generalize, you can say "Well, Let's say that this farmer had more things

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.080
that he wanted to carry across the river".

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.500
So let's say that I added a rabbit, so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.780
What can I do first?

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.740
Brady Haran: What does a rabbit day with what?

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.280
Oh.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000
Brady Haran: Who is in danger from who here?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.040
Yeah good question right, so the wolf would eat the rabbit,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.829
and...

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.829
Ah well the rabbit would eat the cabbage.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.760
We assume that the rabbit and a goat together are fine.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.140
There won't be too much violence there. The boat can hold the farmer and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.920
one of these guys. That's it, the farmer still has to be there.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.080
We're still assuming also that the revit cannot swim. So what can I bring first?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.580
Can I bring the wolf? Well, no obviously the rabbit and the goat would eat the cabbage.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.700
Can I bring the rabbit?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.800
Well, no again the goat would eat the cabbage, if the wolf doesn't catch the gold first.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.420
Okay, can I bring the goat? Well,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.620
no, the rabbit will eat the cabbage again,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.100
if the wolf doesn't catch the rabbit first.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.420
And can I bring the cabbage? No, because the wolf would eat the rabbit and the goat.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.480
Brady Haran: Carnage.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.280
Carnage, yes. Blood everywhere no matter what we do

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.669
or shreds of cabbage, one or the other. So the question becomes: Okay,

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.580
How big of a boat do I need? So if I'm given

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.900
different things, and I know there's certain conflicts how big does my boat have to be? So here if I have space for

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.500
my farmer plus two other things, I'll be fine. I could just say fine, I'll bring the wolf and cabbage first

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.059
I'll leave them on the other side, come back, and get my rabbit and goat

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.120
and I will be done.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.200
Super easy!

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.629
So the question is how big does it have to be? Well, now we kind of want to start doing math, right?

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.480
So how do we bring math in there? So we want to think about the conflicts as making a graph. So I have my--

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.360
wolf, and I have my goat; and so I cannot leave my wolf with my goat

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.580
so I'll put an edge, the line, between these two points which are really

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.420
normally called "vertices".

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.940
Brady Haran: So edge represents bad news.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.620
Yeah conflict, that these two things cannot be left alone unsupervised.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.429
The wolf can also not be left

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.089
with the rabbit. The goat cannot be left with the cabbage and the rabbit cannot be left

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.470
with the cabbage either.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.429
But the wolf can be left with a cabbage so I don't draw an edge there,

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:52.620
and I don't draw an edge between my goat and my rabbit because it can be left together.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.100
Okay, the point that we see is that let's say that I first took my rabbit, well,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.459
there's still some lines remaining, right? I am left with a

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.100
graph with the wolf, goat and cabbage and there's still some lines that are remaining.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.489
And that's tree firing remove any of the corners.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.400
So what I want to do is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.960
take a set of my things, that will remove all of the lines, and that's actually a really important math concept.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.960
It's called a "vertex cover".

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.820
So, maybe let's write down, what is the vertex cover.
"A vertex cover and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.460
a graph G is a set of vertices such that any edge is

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.940
adjacent to at least

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.310
one

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.280
of these services". Okay,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.280
so what does that mean? That means that

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.289
if I want to take a set of points, where

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.580
every line is touching at least one of these points, my goal is that by taking the vertex cover,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.289
I'm removing all the lines so maybe we can just draw a simple example.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.560
So, let's say that I have this graph.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.509
So, this is a graph so a graph is really just a set of points and set of lines called vertices and edges,

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.418
and so I might ask myself "What is a vertex cover?" So I could start building one. So I could say "Okay

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.720
I'll take this vertex within my

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.389
vertex cover".

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.469
But that's not enough, right? So these five edges now are covered by this vertex right they're touching...

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.080
this vertex, but the other ones aren't yet.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.820
Now so I could ask "I could add this vertex to my vertex cover, and so I'm getting closer".

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.400
But I still have this line that is not covered yet.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.079
So I could add this one now. And so these three vertices from a vertex cover

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.000
every single line is adjacent to one of these vertices.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.320
Brady Haran: It's almost like how many hands did you need to cover the right number of spots?

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.580
Yeah exactly, exactly.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.580
So here in a vertex cover...

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.220
What was it? Well, yeah one is not sufficient, right?

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.452
A single vertex is not a vertex cover. If I cover the rabbit and the goat,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.100
then they're covering all of the

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.780
edges. There's no edges remaining so this forms a vertex cover.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.740
So that's why I need to have at least

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.799
two seats, because the minimum size of a vertex cover in there is 2. So there's no way that I can do it if I

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.800
don't have at least two extra places besides the place for the-- farmer. So in general

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.920
I know that my boat has to have at least the minimum size of a vertex cover.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.560
Right? Otherwise

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.780
I won't be able to make my first trip, because there will be some lines remaining in my graph,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.259
And lines represent conflict.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.680
Brady Haran: I imagine you could do overkill though,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.540
there must be as these things get more complicated. There must be--

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.640
vertex covers that cover too many vertices.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.040
Oh yeah, that's a really good point, right? So in this graph for example--

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.100
So if I add this vertex, this is still a vertex cover,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.330
right? So, I really want the minimum one. So I want to say that the

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.650
"number of

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.210
extra places

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.739
needed in my boat is at least the

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.579
size of the minimum vertex cover". So in this graph here that was three.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.580
I needed to have at least three--

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.920
Brady Haran: Because that final the smallest possible.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.580
Yeah, you don't want to overkill as you said. So that's nice, but now you might ask yourself: Will that always be enough?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.060
Right? Like-- Sure you can do the first trip across the river,

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.280
but will you be able to do all of them?
And so now you could check with some examples.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.149
So, I mean, we could try with a big example and see if it works out,

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.960
and then...

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.799
Try with some other examples. Does that sound good? Okay,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.109
so maybe we need another piece of paper. Okay

00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:43.900
so now we have way more things. And so now we need to think for a second, what is actually going to eat what.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.880
And we might disagree on some of these. I am NOT a farm girl

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.500
So I would go with what I think. The wolf would eat the goose.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.420
Potentially, the mouse if it's really hungry. Told eat grass.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.920
It... won't eat the cat either, I don't think so. Carrot or cabbage

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:08.540
It's not a vegetarian. It's a carnivore so set a goat and the rabbit; and the goose will eat

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:15.100
Ahhh... the grass, I see geese eating grass all the time. I don't think it's gonna eat carrot or

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.420
cabbage because it doesn't really have-- does it have teeth?

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.260
Does I don't think... I mean certainly if it's not cut up,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.340
you know, like it will have trouble it doesn't have hands to--

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.640
Brady Haran: Maybe this does not the taste of cabbage.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.160
Fine. I think the mouse will eat carrot,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.120
and...

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.660
the cabbage and...

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.180
the cat will eat the mouse, certainly.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:46.640
The grass will probably be eaten by the goat. I know that you can use them as long Moore's. The rabbit might eat some grass?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.440
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.567
Cat I think it will just eat the mouse and nothing else will eat it

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:52.120
Brady Haran: The rabbits gonna eat the carrot

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.840
Yes, so the cabbage yeah, that's true.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.520
So the rabbit will eat the carrot and the goat will probably eat the carrot too,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.900
and the rabbit will also eat the cabbage, and so will the goat,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.020
and then the goat and a rabbit are fine. I think that's that looks reasonable to me.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.640
Brady Haran: Okay that will be air I guess...

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.000
Do you agree? Okay, so let's say that I have a river

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.520
How big it boat we need, and will the minimum vertex cover be enough? The first point

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.380
I really want to make is that finding the minimum vertex cover is not easy.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:29.440
Right. So, here we only have nine things. right? It's not that much, and to figure out

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.880
what it is, well since this graph has some meaning,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.200
I'm going to use the meaning to help me. So I basically have like my carnivores, my herbivores,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.900
and then I have the poor vegetables and herbs. And so these three categories

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.100
kind of help me determine that oh, maybe

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:47.999
the

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:49.999
goat rabbit

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:57.960
goose and mouse. So my herbivores might form a vertex cover, and I think if I look at it,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.280
carefully, like if I were to really look at every single

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.220
line, so actually yes, the mouse the goose the rabbit and a goat do form a vertex cover

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.800
It's unclear if that is actually the smallest, I claim it is.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.800
It's not an actually such an easy thing to check, so let's just assume that I'm right. So what I'll do is

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.680
I'll say: Okay for my first trip, I will take my minimum vertex cover.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.240
Right? So if I remove my goat, rabbit, boots and mouse;

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:33.679
and bring them to the other side. I am left. I removed all of the lines, here,

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.290
and so, okay, that's fine.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.240
So then my farmer will come back.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.140
We can only take four things, it will leave a thing behind. Let say it leaves the cat behind

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.639
And so he brings these guys.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:53.780
But certainly the wolf will attack these guys, and these guys will eat all of the vegetables and grass.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.640
So I'll bring them back

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.850
So it's the same trick as we've seen before. I'll carry my cat over so that it doesn't eat my mouse just itself, right?

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.860
It's just four places, but you can just bring one thing. That's completely fine.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:11.660
And then I will finally go back, so there's no conflict here. All right this was the

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.840
original things that I had left at first so no problem there, and then I'll bring my four leftover...

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.400
herbivores and leave them there.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.220
And I'm done!

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.700
So I succeeded in this case, right? But that's not a proof, right? Maybe...

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:32.700
Maybe I wouldn't need more, and certainly We've just seen okay finding your minimum vertex Cover is not necessarily so easy

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.100
So maybe let's do one other example.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.120
So let's say that I had just--

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.120
my wolf

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.340
and--

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.000
my--

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:49.140
four herbivores that would get eaten by my wolf.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.960
If he has a chance. So my wolf would eat all of these,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.400
and none of these would attack each other, right? So I have my river

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:05.460
So, I know that I need to have at least... The number of extra places should be at least the size of

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.500
my minimum vertex cover, which here is easy to calculate. What is it Brady? Do you know?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.180
Brady Haran: It's one.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.960
It's one...

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.100
Brady Haran: You should ... the wolf

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.899
I'm very impressed. Okay, so my wolf is my minimum vertex cover, so I need to bring my well first, right?

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:24.059
That's the only thing I can do if I bring anything else. I'll be left with some conflict. So I bring my wolf over.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.340
I Come back as I can only take one thing

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.580
So let's say that I take the mouse.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.479
But they all really look the same, like the graph all looks the same for all of them,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.269
and these are cold different things, but it could have been called--

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:41.800
you know goat one, goat two, goat three and goat four. Really, so I bring my mouse over

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.080
So now I have no choice, but to bring the wolf back, right? Otherwise my wolf would eat my mouse

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.440
So... I bring the wolf back...

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.420
and then, well, I'm kind of stuck, right? So either I bring one of these guys.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.060
But then my wolf would eat the two remaining guys.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.280
Or I bring the wolf again, and I keep going like this, and I'm stuck.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.740
Okay--

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.280
Brady Haran: Minimum vertix cover doesn't work.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.720
It doesn't work. It doesn't work.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.869
So how much do you need how much bigger does it have to be?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.680
And the amazing thing is, you just need one more! at

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.920
Whatever the graph of conflicts is

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:27.580
You will only need at most one more than your minimum vertex cover. And so the way to do it, is very simple

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.040
You have these

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.000
conflictual things that, you know, like, like your wolf here.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.760
So you just put all these conflictual indivi-- individuals in the boat with you at all times.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.740
So you can watch them, and then one by one you carry everything else. So here

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.080
Okay, my minimum...

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.840
Brady Haran: So the wolf does every trip?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.700
Yeah the wolf is with you the whole time. It does every trip back and forth.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.520
So, now let's say that I have the minimum

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.860
vertex cover plus 1 seat extra, so I have 2 seats plus a farmer's seat. So I'll take my

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.280
wolf in my mouse first,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:06.420
I'll leave the mouse there, bring back my wolf, take, now my goose with my wall leave my goose.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.980
Come back with my wolf. Take my goat in my wolf.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.360
But my go there, come back with my wolf,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.340
and then carry finally the last 8. And this will work no matter how big your vertex cover is, right?

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.920
So, no matter how big it is you just keep it with you in your boat, and then one by one you carry everything else.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.860
That's pretty amazing, so you know that you need at least a minimum vertex cover,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.800
and you need at most the minimum vertex cover plus one to be able to do it.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.340
And the amazing thing is that distinguishing between both,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:44.800
knowing one you need one and not the other, is actually really hard. It's NP-hard. So this is a recent result by

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.360
three Mathematicians:

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.820
Csobra , Woegunger and Hurkens.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.299
And Yes, it's an amazing thing, this small difference of one

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.440
is hard to determine.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.400
Brady Haran: So sometimes minimum vertex cover will do the trick.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.120
Yeah, just like in the previous example.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.640
Yeah.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.820
Sometimes you need to go plus, one and to know which is which, just by looking at the graph.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:13.980
It's hard. So for certain classes of graphs we do know it, but for a general graph, we don't. And it's very hard.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.860
Hard problem, actually if you can solve it so you'll not be a millionaire. So you know.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.680
Something to try at home.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.680
Brady Haran: What's this problem ?

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.640
So this is the alkene number of the graph?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:32.940
But so it relates because it's NP-hard to determine whether you need a minimum vertex cover our--

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:39.840
the minimum vertex cover plus one, if you were able to come up with a polynomial time algorithm to determine for any graph,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.980
what it is. Then you would prove that P is equal to NP.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.420
So

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.040
big problem.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.500
 

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.500
This video was brought to you by the

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.260
Mathematical sciences Research Institute, one of the top places for mathematics in all the world.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.580
And whatever you think about the mathematics they do there...

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.680
they must have the best of you of any maths Institute in the world.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.400
San Francisco Bay, Berkeley--

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.960
unbelievable. If you'd like to find out more about MSRI, I'll put some links in the description under the video. It's worth a look.
