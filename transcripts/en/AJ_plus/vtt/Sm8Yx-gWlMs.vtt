00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
This is me sprinkling a secret
ingredient ...

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.020
Bam!

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.440
on some dumplings I'm
making for my roommates.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.560
That ingredient is:

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.240
but I'm not gonna tell them that

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.820
because I know a lot of folks are still afraid of MSG

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.820
which is short for:

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.080
It's a savory,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.260
satisfying seasoning

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.620
that's in a lot of things you
probably eat every day

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540
like chips, canned soup and KFC.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.580
But for some reason when it's used in 
East Asian cuisine.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.460
especially Chinese food people
freak out.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.360
There was even a condition named after it :

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.100
Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.300
Some symptoms supposedly included:

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.720
heart palpitations, headache, chest pain

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.180
But study after study has shown

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.480
MSG isn't the cause of any of these symptoms.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.080
The FDA, the EU and the UN all say it's safe to eat.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.020
And we certainly don't hear about
1.4 billion people in China

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.560
experiencing any side effects.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.760
So why do so many people think
MSG is a dangerous ingredient?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.700
And why was Chinese food
targeted?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.540
The late Anthony Bourdain had one theory:

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.320
I decided to investigate by eating, cooking
and breathing MSG for a few days.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.120
Hi, I'm Yara.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.760
And I absolutely love Chinese
food.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.240
I eat a lot.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.160
But I've never experienced this so-called Chinese Restaurant Syndrome ever.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.360
So I went to New York ...

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.880
to meet a Chinese American chef who isn't shy about publicly using MSG.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.280
And he has a rad Brooklyn accent.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.320
Hi, I'm Chris.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.420
Chris is known for his dumplings.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.400
This is incredible.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.280
And uses MSG specifically in his stir frys.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.320
So we poured some raw MSG out on the
table.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.240
And I tasted this one kind

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.040
And then this MSG filled chicken powder.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.880
If you go to diners where they have soup,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.840
they're not boiling bones for eight
hours, they're using this.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.160
But you don't come out of there saying,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.960
"I have a headache."

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.920
This stuff is so damn tasty, but why?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.440
Monosodium glutamate is one part sodium

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.714
and one part glutamic acid.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.960
When it dissolves in your mouth the two separate

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.920
and once that glutamic acid is free

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.560
it causes a flavor explosion on your tongue.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.400
And brings out a unique hyper-savory,
meaty taste that consumes your whole mouth.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.980
That taste is called umami.

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:12.880
Aside from sweet, sour, salty and bitter

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.560
it's the fifth flavor the human tongue
can sense.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.920
And it was discovered by Japanese scientist

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.360
who basically extracted MSG from seaweed in 1908.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.480
And that Umami flavor bomb, that free,
unshackled glutamic acid,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.920
is also naturally found in things like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.580
tomatoes

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.100
mushrooms

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.920
and Parmesan cheese.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.620
But MSG in its powdered form

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.800
that's basically pure,
unadulterated umami.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.340
Chefs these days love adding umami to their food,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.320
which is what we did.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.280
And then we sprinkled on one final source of umami:

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.320
It's as a finisher.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.740
You wanna just ... a little bit.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.900
And use it sparingly.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.560
When I was in China though they
were a little bit more generous.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.400
I was always a little bit, a
little cheap with it.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.140
And they'd go:

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.080
Scoop, right?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.080
That's so good.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.200
Absolutely nothing happened.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.278
No headaches no palpitations, no
nausea.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.280
If you go to China and you go to the supermarkets in China,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.740
you're gonna see aisles of MSG 
like you would see here for cereal.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.240
We're talking about MSG,
there's a little bit of

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.380
... to it.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.120
You know some of the older
crowd come over,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.060
and they'll be right to your face.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.260
They'll be like, "You don't cook
with that MSG stuff do you?"

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.260
"I know you're from China, but you're in America now,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.880
so you got to do things the way we like it."

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.680
But how did MSG come to get such
a bad rap?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.819
I wanted to know

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.100
is there actually any definitive science that
links MSG

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.000
to those negative symptoms we've read about?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.160
And Dr. Ken Lee is gonna help us get
to the bottom of that science.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.720
Yara, please call me Ken.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.300
Alright.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.260
Ken is a food scientist with a passion for MSG.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.260
And New York's Chinatown is
his old stomping ground.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.460
That used to be my uncle's meat market it's now a poke bowl.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.440
Whaaat?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.920
Did your parents cook with MSG?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.000
Absolutely. It's just like salt and
pepper.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.540
MSG is an essential ingredient of Chinese cooking.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.420
Is there any like double-blind scientific study
that proves any of the health symptoms?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.440
I can say absolutely not.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.460
In a scientific study where people don't
know what they're eating,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.560
so they're fed msg or a placebo, meaning sugar pill,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.060
Sure.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.580
People on the sugar pill develop symptoms as well.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.020
It could even be psychosomatic.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.040
A little bit of chemistry here,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.800
glutamic acid is a component of protein, okay?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.300
You and I are both made out of protein.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.800
It's already in you.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.300
Yeah it's in you too and it's in
everyone that's watching this video.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.200
So how did the stigma against MSG come
about?

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.900
In 1968, a Chinese-American doctor wrote a letter to a major scientific journal.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.480
He claimed that whenever he ate at Chinese restaurants in the U.S. he experienced:

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.520
numbness all over his body,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.620
general weakness and heart palpitations.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.400
His letter was titled "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome."

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.490
He suggested it could be caused
by a number of things including MSG.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.700
Readers then wrote in talking about their own symptoms and scientists started studying it too.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.120
But a lot of the initial research was faulty.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.260
Scientists messed up by:

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.040
assuming MSG was already the culprit,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.820
using ridiculously high doses of it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.220
and failing to use placebos
properly.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.520
But it was one study in 1969 that caused a massive panic.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.580
If famously injected MSG under the skin of mice 
leading them to develop brain lesions.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.340
No human would actually consume MSG that way?

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.120
No, but actually a good point.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.120
If you just took common table salt and injected it under your skin you could induce a real toxic state.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.660
Right.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.520
Solid scientific research came out debunking MSG myths in the next few decades.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.940
But it was too late,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.780
"no MSG" signs had already popped up
around the country.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.520
Everybody hears the accusation and nobody tunes in when they hear the verdict of not guilty.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.220
So that's what happened
with MSG.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.900
It's amazing just one letter

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.300
a bunch of flawed science and an entire
cuisine, an entire people, stigmatized.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.960
But here's the thing there's a huge double
standard.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.740
We actually eat lots of non-Chinese foods with MSG,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.940
but you don't hear about people getting sick from them.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.000
We're gonna go pick up some foods and snacks that have MSG in them very openly.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.340
All of these have MSG in them.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.460
However when it's in these it doesn't seem to generate a controversy.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.180
You won't find a label on any of these products, you know, "MSG free"

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.840
because MSG is accepted as a Generally Recognized As Safe substance by the Food and Drug Administration.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.720
What are you feeling?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.860
A Dorito.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.780
Doritos? Okay.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.480
Clink.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.300
Oh God.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.060
I'm not having any reaction.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.400
Is there like a small percentage of people that have reactions?

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.380
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.600
What's more likely they're reacting to other ingredients that are in that wonton soup

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.020
or whatever they attributed the MSG to.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.150
Why do we distrust foods like MSG
because it's used extensively by Asians?

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.640
It's just ignorance.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.300
So if MSG is in all these Western foods why do people freak out when it's in Chinese cuisine?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.880
I met up with Sarah Lohman

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.360
Sarah wrote a book about the eight
flavors that make American cuisine

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.000
and MSG is one of them.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.840
We met up with her at the Museum of Food and Drink,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.720
which has an exhibit on Chinese food and MSG.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.360
MSG is to savory as like a sour patch kid is to sour.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.540
It's like the most pure form
of savory.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.920
This is the bowl of MSG right?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.180
Yes. Should try it?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.040
Yeah let's do a little ...

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.560
Nothing happened.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.400
But first we had to order some Chinese takeout.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.880
Is the food here?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.600
– The food is here.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.200
Oh my God!

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.860
Yes!

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.140
So, Sarah explained.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.180
Like that's xenophobic.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.540
You're essentially blaming an immigrant culture

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.900
for making people sick.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.080
A lot of racism against other cultures revolves 
around this idea that

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.500
like you're not even
human.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.940
Look at what you're eating it's full of this poison MSG.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.650
But how did MSG
get to the U.S. in the first place.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.760
After it was discovered in Japan MSG made its
way to China became super popular.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.080
And Chinese immigrants then brought it
with them across the Pacific

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.760
But one of the main ways MSG actually entered
America was through canned food.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.480
By the 1930s, the U.S. had become one of the largest buyers of MSG in the world.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.240
And the seasoning eventually found its way into military rations, condiments, TV dinners, you name it.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.800
The major consumers of MSG in this country aren't Chinese restaurants

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.920
it's American processed food.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.460
Every brand from Kraft a Kentucky Fried Chicken.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.700
And I've never heard someone say that they have Doritos syndrome, that is not happening.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.780
Americans like to blame
immigrants for things.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.200
When Italian immigrants first came here they were villainized for their use of garlic

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.920
and garlic was – I know it's laughable right
now what American doesn't cook with garlic

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.640
– the smell the flavor was really
symbolic of not wanting to become American.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.420
Four, five, six generations later
we love Italian food.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.440
So could MSG one day be as widely accepted as garlic?

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.500
Perhaps, but there's a long way to go.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.760
The stigma is still very much here,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.440
which is why a lot of chefs are still hesitant to use it at their restaurants.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.540
And that's why we're here to talk to Chef Lien.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.540
– Hi.
Hi.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.820
She runs a ...

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.600
modern Vietnamese restaurant.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.360
Lien and her family are from Vietnam

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.960
but their ethnically Chinese and came 
to the U.S. as refugees.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.060
My parents cooked with MSG so I'm very
familiar with the ingredient,

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.980
but as a professional chef growing up in the
industry,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.060
because of a stigma, there was a lot of pressure not to use the MSG.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.880
Lien is afraid that she'll lose clientele if she starts using MSG in her restaurant,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.320
but she still finds other ways to add 
umami to her food.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.910
Add a little bit of fish sauce. Now you got some umami in there. Yeah?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.060
And the stigma against MSG has even touched
Lin's family.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.200
Her dad still uses it,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.780
but her mom doesn't cook with it anymore.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.080
So, we went to Lynn's house to cook with her parents.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.800
You cook together with your wife.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.580
Yeah.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.680
That's so nice.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.260
High five! Yeah.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.820
You don't use msg in cooking today?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.360
No. Somebody said MSG is not very good.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.140
I like this disagreement between mom and dad.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.440
Then we cooked two
dishes, one with MSG ...

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.720
Alright, here it comes. Yeah!

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.620
And one without ...

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.760
to see which one tastes better.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.280
Let's try without.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.300
OK.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.280
Yeah this one definitely has I think a
little more fuller feel to it.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.720
Kind of coats your mouth. It really brings out the other flavors that are in there.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.040
I can't imagine if like food from my culture,
if I had to tell everyone like

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.740
"Oh I've had to remove an ingredient from it." you
know?

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.860
I feel like that would just be really sad day  for me.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.180
The experiment we did at Lien's house of course brings me back to the experiment I started the video with:

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.280
secretly feeding MSG to my roommates.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.600
So what's the deal with these dumplings? What's in them?

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:24.140
So, I basically put one teaspoon of this into the filling of those dumplings.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.540
One teaspoon per dumpling?

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.080
No, no, no.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.520
One teaspoon in the entire dumpling filling.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.940
I mean it's a great flavor.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.540
How do you feel after eating MSG?

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.800
Perfectly fine.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.280
Satiated, satisfied.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.700
My roommates loved the taste and didn't get sick.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.180
And of course they didn't

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.980
because well the science says MSG is perfectly
safe.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.220
What I learned by making this video

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.975
is that people are afraid of MSG for a
number of reasons.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.120
There's the initial flawed research, there's the rumor
mongering or ...

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.340
But things are looking up.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.440
A new generation of Asian-American chefs are taking back the narrative.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.220
So I hope the next time you
order some Chinese takeout

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.640
and someone starts talking about getting a 
headache or something else

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.700
You'll be able to tell them

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.220
it's not the wonton soup

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.203
and it's not the MSG,

00:11:05.203 --> 00:11:06.720
it's probably just in your head.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.940
I hope I've convinced you guys there's nothing to fear about MSG

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.660
but that doesn't mean you should just go about dumping tons of it all over your food.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.560
Just like salt, or really anything in life, consume it in moderation.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.840
Anyway share this video with friends and family who think they get headaches from MSG

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.840
and see how they react.
