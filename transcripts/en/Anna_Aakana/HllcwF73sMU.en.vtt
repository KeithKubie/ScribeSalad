00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
It's no secret that I'm a time-lord

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.300
scheduling, planning, time management

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.340
These are my strengths

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.720
but with every strength, there is a flipside

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.720
so although I can schedule myself within an inch of my life and be prolific as all hell,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.920
I can also spread myself way too thin

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.620
and realize it way too late

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.020
ohh nooooo, wait noo

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.340
I don't, no, I don't like this

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.740
So, having been someone who takes on too much, too often

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.540
Here are the signs that I look for that usually trigger this realization for me and some helpful ways to adjust

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.700
Number one

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.120
you're exhausted

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.360
all the time

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.320
Whenever I find myself exhausted all the time,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.340
I try to always schedule relaxation

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.600
whether that means I have to cancel or reschedule a previous commitment

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
it's worth it, because if you're dead tired, you're not going to do anything productive

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.080
Two

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.300
you're stressed out, all the time

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.620
Whenever I'm stressed out, I know that that means I have to slow down

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.260
So my favorites right now are: drinking a cup of tea, and going for a small walk outside

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.320
or sitting down and petting my cats for five minutes

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.780
'cause normally when you get really stressed out, it also comes with headaches right?

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.400
So, you really just have to slow down and breathe

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.060
Three

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.320
you forget to eat

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Oh! It's 6PM already? Pfft! Time for breakfast!

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.560
Don't forget to eat!

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.280
I do this all the time, it'll be like so late in the day

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.520
and I feel really upset and sad and angry and I'm like "Why do I feel this way?" and then you're like "Oh yeah, I forgot to eat"

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.520
Don't do this

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.300
Four

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.820
You're forgetful and drop the ball on things

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.680
[smack]

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.300
I hate, hate, hate whenever I'm not at the top of my game

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.540
If I'm missing meetings or I'm forgetting things that are said in emails

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.220
I know that it's time for me to take a look at everything that I'm doing and start trimming some stuff

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.320
because if you're doing everything horribly, you don't want to be doing it at all

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.000
Five

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.060
you wish for the sweet release of death

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.260
or at least a nap

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.860
Please time, *sob*, just slow down or stop and I swear I will worship you as the one true god of all gods

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.620
*cries*

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.840
I don't wanna...*cries*...I don't wanna, *cries*

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.960
This one's really hard for me, my tendency is to stay up all night and try to finish all the work that I have to do

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.860
but now I'm trying to go to sleep at a decent hour and just wake up earlier and more refreshed to finish it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.780
because lack of sleep is a nightmare and you become a monster for the rest of the day

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.720
I wanna do everything all the time

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.420
but life is long, you know? You have to pace yourself

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.480
Realistically, you can accomplish three to five goals every day

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.500
and it is quality over quantity.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.860
You want to be giving one hundred percent of yourself to everything that you're doing

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.540
Not ten percent to a bunch of stuff because you've taken on too much

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.960
I hope this helps

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.480
I'm Anna Akana

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.700
Stay awesome, Gotham

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.200
Thank you so much to Skillshare for sponsoring today's episode

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.860
I love learning, you know whether it's taking

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.720
a pole class,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.000
an aerial class,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.280
learning a new instrument,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.560
or even just knitting

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.200
I love expanding my skillset and challenging myself

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.220
so Skillshare is an online learning community for creators with over 15,000 classes

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.140
in photography, design, art and more

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.200
Everyone can take a class, try a project or even teach a class themselves

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.540
I've been really wanting to get into painting lately

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.500
so taking the fine arts classes has been great to kind of learn acrylics and see all the ways you can use this very diverse paint

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.040
