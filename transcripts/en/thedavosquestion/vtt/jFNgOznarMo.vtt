00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.649
&gt;&gt; The question being asked here today is
can India become a superpower?

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.459
I think we need to ask ourselves first, what
is a superpower?

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.959
Can India grow in economic size?
Of course, it will grow.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.700
I mean, I think that's pretty obvious right
now.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.400
Can India be a leader in the region?
To some extent it already is and will get

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.950
bigger in the future.
Can India grow militarily?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.390
I guess we already have a large-sized military
which is considered one

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.510
of the finer ones in the region and many say
in the world.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.030
So what we have to address is the challenge
of poverty that still

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.261
plagues us since Independence.
If we can address the needs of education and

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:48.780
health care of 215
million people in India, and many of them

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.520
don't get two square meals a
day, I think India's well on its way to becoming

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.440
a leading nation of
the world in many different ways.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.380
We have enterprise, we have innovation, we
have people who want to live

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.591
with diversity.
We have extreme diversity as a nation, and

00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:09.630
that is strengthening the
nation, actually strengthens India.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.380
In fact, that's a lesson that many in of other
parts of the world can

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.350
learn as well.
And our diversity in many ways is something

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.000
which will help India cope
with not just the current, but we hope also

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.420
in the future and build it
into a leading nation, as many of believe

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.060
it should be.
