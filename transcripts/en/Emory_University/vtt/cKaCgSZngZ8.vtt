00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.000
The CDC's Anne Schuchat and Emory's Dr. Matthew Keady

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.480
recently met with local reporters at Emory University Hospital.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.960
They were on hand to explain how President Trump's

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.600
recent announcement on national policy concerning the opioid crisis

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.000
might flow down to hospitals like Emory.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.800
"We're in the middle of a fast-moving, tragic epidemic.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.220
of opioid overdoses and other complications of opioid use disorder.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.460
The announcement today is about putting a stop to the epidemic."

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.095
The CDC has reported a 30% increase in

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.165
emergency department visits for opioid overdoses nationwide.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.620
Emergency doctors like Keady confirm an alarming increase in cases.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.940
"We see it on a daily basis.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.020
People will come in with overdoses or the consequences of opioid overuse."

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.000
"What we think is going on is a lot of over-prescription

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.600
with opioids followed by a wave of the epidemic

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520
related to heroin, and a third wave related to

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.440
illicitly manufactured fentanyl and other fentanyl-like drugs.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.260
Over 42,000 people in the U.S. died in 2016 of opioid overdose,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.520
more than any other year on record.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.520
"One of the goals of this announcement is to reduce

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.240
opioid prescribing by 30 percent in three years.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.480
A second of the goals is for all federal prescribers

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.240
to be using best practices for pain management within five years.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.140
Experts are also looking at enhancing systems like

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.280
Georgia's prescription drug monitoring program

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.640
to better track patients' prescriptions.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.880
"So that in any state that you're prescribing

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.400
you have access to the prescribing data from other states

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.400
and that within the state, your prescription drug monitoring

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.920
program information talks to the other systems."

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.820
For its part, Emory is on board to significantly

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.940
reduce the number of opioid prescriptions it issues.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.940
"Using best practices and making sure that when we

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.900
talk about prescribing patterns at Emory,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.440
we're all speaking the same language,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.960
specifically for opioid use. I think that's the biggest impact we can make."
