00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:00.589
No.

00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.332
&gt;&gt; No, what?

00:00:02.332 --> 00:00:04.360
&gt;&gt; Nothing.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.980
I'm just shopping for
some shoes and found this site.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.320
It looks pretty good, but it's asking
me to register before viewing.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.230
So, I bounced out of there.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.640
&gt;&gt; Let me see.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.158
Man your phone is blank.

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:16.360
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.050
But this kind of thing happens.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.910
Registration gates really
only push users away.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.080
It makes it more difficult to
view products and buy them,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.710
and that just is bad.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.040
Very, very, bad.
