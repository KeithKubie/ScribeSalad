Deeplearn.js is an open source
WebGL accelerated JavaScript

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.480
library for machine
learning that

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.260
runs entirely in your
browser with no installation

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.520
and no back end.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790
Some cool screenshots and
links for getting started

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.290

We recently added three
new subscription reports

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.130
