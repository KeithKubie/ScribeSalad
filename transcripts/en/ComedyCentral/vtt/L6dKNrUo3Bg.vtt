00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.836
- The Cleveland Browns this
week signed Kareem Hunt,

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.739
the former Kansas City
Chief who was released

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.508
during last season
when a video came out

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.711
of him assaulting a woman.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.179
- This is big news.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.749
This is big news
for Cleveland fans,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.117
and for football in general.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.051
You know what I mean?

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.753
'Cause Cleveland has really,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:23.156
really upgraded at
the kicker position.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.058
You know, Janikowski
was the number one guy.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.127 align:start size:88% position:13%
Vinatieri was the number
one guy for a while.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.696
And then they've
kind of faded out.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.498 align:start size:84% position:16%
Janikowski might never
play a game again.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.067 align:start size:94% position:6%
Vinatieri's doing one last
season, then he's gone.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
But now the best
kicker in the league,

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think it's Kareem
Hunt once he gets back.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.141
- Right, well, there's
a suspension looming.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.642
- Sure.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.277
- He's supposed to miss the
beginning of the season.

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.946
So, how does this
play out, you know,

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.115
with their current
kicker Greg Joseph?

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.084
- I think Joseph's gone.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.585
- But who's gonna kick
early in the season?

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.853
- They're gonna go for two,

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.089
there gonna be going
for it on fourth down.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.191 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because once Kareem
gets in there,

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.026
I don't know how much
a football weighs,

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:03.263 align:start size:88% position:13%
but it weighs less than
a 21 year old girl.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.264
(laughs)

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.733
So, I think he could go from 60.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.203
I think in a dome,
he could go from 70.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.671
And really knock that.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.675
They might change the rules
on how field goals work.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.178
They might move the posts
back, make it thinner.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.247 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because Kareem Hunt is
gonna be kicking the bejesus

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.417
out of more than just women.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.653 align:start size:97% position:3%
When he gets back on the field
for the Cleveland Browns.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:30.490 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't know, he
could change the game.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.326
It's gonna be touch back city.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.230
- You watch the
FC North closely.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.833 align:start size:94% position:6%
Any concern, you know
that the windy conditions,

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.701
like not an easy place to kick

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
Cleveland,
Pittsburgh, Baltimore.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.505
Am I worried about him,

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.240
like missing from the
right or the left?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't know if
you've seen his aim.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.111
But he, I mean as long as
the ball's on the floor,

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.312
like that girl was.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.013
Then what's the problem?

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.549
Okay, I don't care which
way the wind is blowing.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.886
He's gonna kick it.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.121
He's gonna kick it.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.356 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think he might,
honestly he could be

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:07.060
the highest scorer in the
league next year, no doubt.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.429
- Even after missing
a chunk of the season.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.898
People think he might miss,
you know six to eight games,

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.900 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is why there
was a lot of surprise,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.502
about the timing of this.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:18.505 align:start size:81% position:19%
Like, not only
are you giving him

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.507
a spot back in the
league so quickly.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.575
And, okay second
chances yada yada.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.111 align:start size:97% position:3%
But they were like, The Browns
were essentially racing,

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.014
to get him signed before
any other team could do it.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.482 align:start size:84% position:16%
They didn't wait, they
didn't do anything.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.751 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I know you look at people
compared to Ray Rice.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.054 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, Ray Rice just
slapped his wife unconscious.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.190
He didn't reveal a
new set of skills.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.424
(laughs)

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.993
You know Kareem Hunt
as a running back,

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.261
I don't know, I don't
know if you put him

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.962
back in the league
after what he did.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:47.800 align:start size:94% position:6%
But when you add that
he's like, likes to kick,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.269
and is a tremendous kicker.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.770
I don't know how
you don't do that.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.073
I think if like, honestly if
Kareem Hunt was on the peanuts,

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.576
and Lucy put the ball down,

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.144
(laughing)

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.313
he's kicking them both
through the uprights.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.651
Alright we've got one more
headline Greg and this one,

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:07.720
not as like much fun and
(speaks foreign language)

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.888
as the last one.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.056
(laughing)

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm sure I'm pronouncing
that incorrectly.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.027 align:start size:97% position:3%
(speaks in foreign language)
I don't even know what

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.329
it means but I know I said
it right the second time.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.031 align:start size:84% position:16%
What's our last
headline of the day?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.134
- Our last headline comes from
Harlem, where a New York man

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:25.171 align:start size:97% position:3%
is facing charges of criminal
mischief after breaking

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:28.107
a store front window
with a cinder block

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.777
to attack a Barack
Obama mannequin.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.780 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Mmhmm and here's my
favorite part of the story.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.449 align:start size:97% position:3%
Greg, what's the name of
the lingerie shop in Harlem?

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.850
- Romantic Depot.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.118
- Yes.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:39.919
- That's your favorite part?

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.154
- Yes.

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:42.655 align:start size:84% position:16%
- There's so many
parts to this story.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.524
- When I saw Romantic Depot,
I was like this is hilarious.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:48.928
This guy is just walking by and
Obama has not been President

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:53.333
for quite some time but he is
also, he's been not President

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.169 align:start size:97% position:3%
long enough that you can
make a sexy mannequin of him.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.771
That barely looks like him
and drape it in lingerie.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.608 align:start size:97% position:3%
And stick it in Romantic Depot
and this guy wasn't gonna

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.344
put up with that, that
in your face politics.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.778
That he had to break the window,

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:10.650 align:start size:97% position:3%
and gave the Obama mannequin
a bit of a beating.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.218
So much so that a crowd formed

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
and tried to kick him,
'cause they were so upset.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:17.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
And people were like,
pro-Obama people,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.359
were fighting this guy.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.261
I was like, I think if you
just saw a guy smash a window

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.996 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a cinder block
on the street.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.464
And start tearing up
your neighborhood,

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.965 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you would
fight him for that.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:30.069
I'm sure people weren't like
see that torso of a mannequin

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.138
on the street, that's Obama.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:35.441 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Right, especially I
really like that they talked

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.778 align:start size:84% position:16%
about kind of a crowd
of pro-Obama people
surrounding him.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:42.081 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's like, what is a
crowd of pro-Obama people.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.716
What are they like, really like,

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:46.419 align:start size:84% position:16%
cool and calculated
and rational.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.256
- Yeah, there's like
an alarm that goes off.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:53.059 align:start size:88% position:13%
And people are just
like oh my God (mumbles)

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.229
of Obama in lingerie
is being kicked around.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.497
We've got to go do something.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.532
- Yeah they're like, you
know in honor of Obama,

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:02.735 align:start size:84% position:16%
they like calmly
assess the situation.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.437 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then make
practical decisions

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.638
on what they are gonna do next.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:09.142
- Mmhmm, mmhmm, yeah,
people were upset.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.677
- But it didn't look
anything like Obama,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.513
it looked like a
25 year old guy,

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:17.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
like who, you know, is going
out clubbing in Chelsea.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.284
The mannequin.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.819
- It kind of reminds me
have you guys ever seen,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.020
you're probably too young.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
Have you guys ever seen
the move Mannequin?

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:22.955
- Yes.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.190
- I don't think so.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.591
- I think I've seen
it multiple times.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's a movie Kim Cattrall
plays the mannequin.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.029 align:start size:97% position:3%
Who plays the guy, it's
one of the brat pack dudes?

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.863
Andrew McCarthy?

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.398
- Yes.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.701
- Andrew McCarthy plays the
guy, he's walking by a store

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.870 align:start position:0%
and Kim Cattrell is a mannequin
and she comes to life.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.807 align:start size:94% position:6%
And he smashes the window
with a cinder block,

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:43.910 align:start size:97% position:3%
drags her out on the street
and kicks the hell out of her.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.114 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then a mob of Kim Cattrell
fans come, and stop him.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:51.284 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's a great movie,
Mannequin 2 is not as good,

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.453
but Mannequin one is.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.987 align:start size:81% position:19%
- There really
was a Mannequin 2?

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:55.922
- Yeah.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.323
- Who would have thunk it?

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.591
- Well 'cause Mannequin
I think was rated R,

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.126
and Mannequin 2 was PG-13.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:01.627
- Wow, you know everything.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.129
- I used to watch it all the
time on HBO when I was a kid.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It was one of those movies
that was on all the time,

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.632 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I watched a
lot, well I liked,

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.202
you know for a little more
context there was an Obama

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:13.806 align:start size:84% position:16%
mannequin next to like
a Trump mannequin,

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:16.943 align:start size:84% position:16%
and this guy who threw
the cinder block,

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.678
and there is video
of the entire thing.

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:21.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
It looks like he just
kinda walks by, sees it,

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.517 align:start position:0%
and then like gets really angry
and then there just happens

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:26.285
to be a cinder block
like five feet away.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:29.222
That he goes picks up and
throws through the window.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:32.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
He said he's a pro
Trump guy, and he thinks

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.628
Obama ruined the country
but my favorite detail

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:40.633
was he said he was hearing the
Obama mannequin speak to him.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:43.202 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he didn't like
what Obama was saying.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.971 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Was the Trump mannequin
speaking to him too?

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.706
They were having a conversation,

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:47.940
and he just like interrupted?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.610 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think the Obama
mannequin was speaking

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.378 align:start size:81% position:19%
to the guy walking
by, kinda like

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:54.614
you're in the wrong part
of town buddy or something.

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:57.216
What do you think the Obama
mannequin was saying to him?

00:06:57.216 --> 00:07:00.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He's probably like,
you can't afford

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.654
this lingerie that I'm wearing.

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:03.823
(laughing)

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.324
You know what I mean
he's probably like,

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.527
hey I bet you like this
but you'll never have it.

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.928
(laughs)

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.130
I'm married to Michelle
and he just lost it.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.299
Like what kind of lingerie

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.535 align:start size:88% position:13%
were either one of those
mannequins wearing?

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:18.371
Trump or Obama, like what
were they silk boxers?

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:21.474 align:start size:97% position:3%
Or were they totally done
up, wearing bras and panties,

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:22.975
at Romantic Depot?

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.812
'Cause if you've ever been
to Romantic Depot in Harlem,

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.815
I mean all shapes and sizes,
they can cover everything.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:32.518 align:start size:94% position:6%
I would say go to Victoria
Secret if you wanna,

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.756
if you wanna fight
Obama in lingerie.

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:40.393 align:start position:0%
- I like that the store manager
at the end of the article,

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:41.961
as an aside was like,

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.997 align:start size:94% position:6%
she believes the assailant
was mentally ill.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.032
I was like you think?

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.233
- Yeah.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.435
- You think the guy who thought,

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.571
the Obama lingerie
was talking to him,

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.873 align:start size:88% position:13%
you think he's a
little, he's in trouble?

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:57.443
- Listen, I've walked
by lingerie mannequins

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:00.480
I thought were talking to
me, but I kept walking.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.148 align:start position:0%
You know what I mean, you
don't have to break the window.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.850 align:start size:84% position:16%
And where did he find
the cinder block?

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.686 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's part of the
amazing thing of the video.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:11.057
He walks by, he sees
it, he kicks at Obama.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:14.727
And then he walks like two more
steps, and just to his left,

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.597 align:start size:97% position:3%
he sees like a little fence,
he pushes it to the side,

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.831
picks up a cinder block,

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
that just happens
to be sitting there,

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.101
and throws it through the
window like just was there.

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're gonna end on this,
this is great because this guy

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.508 align:start size:97% position:3%
takes a cinder block,
smashes a store front window,

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.877
pulls out a mannequin of Obama.

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:34.780 align:start size:97% position:3%
Which, I don't even know they
make those, pulls it out,

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.785
beats it up, how much is he
charged, what's the damages?

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.421 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Somewhere between
250 and $1,000.

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.656
(laughs)

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:46.425
- When I saw $250
I was like man,

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:49.128 align:start size:84% position:16%
Romantic Depot has got
to get it together.

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.063 align:start size:84% position:16%
Maybe they just have
great insurance,

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.298
on their Obama mannequin.

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:53.599
But like, you would
think that's like,

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.067
that's not a lot of money.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.903
If you were like Anthony
you could smash this window

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:59.705
for 250, I would smash
every window I walked by.
