it requires all that commitment and
 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.879
it requires all that commitment and
energy it it doesn't come easily I guess

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889
energy it it doesn't come easily I guess
 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.649
energy it it doesn't come easily I guess
that's the point but when you do get

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659
that's the point but when you do get

challenge for Apple was to take really
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.349
challenge for Apple was to take really
cool products and really cool

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359
cool products and really cool
 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.559

simplicity requires that kind of that

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870
simplicity requires that kind of that
 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.209
simplicity requires that kind of that
that brutal assessment of what is really

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:47.219
that brutal assessment of what is really
 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:49.399
that brutal assessment of what is really
really good versus what's good enough

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:49.409
really good versus what's good enough
 

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:51.649
really good versus what's good enough
and what's good enough isn't good enough

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:51.659
and what's good enough isn't good enough
 

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:55.159
and what's good enough isn't good enough
it's got to be really really good okay

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:55.169
it's got to be really really good okay
 

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:58.010

and the answer is not at all really and
 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.290
and the answer is not at all really and
I'm working on it but I think simplicity

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.300
I'm working on it but I think simplicity
 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.839
I'm working on it but I think simplicity
is something that works in business and

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:08.849

life is complicated that simplicity
stands out so we got to take the good

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:38.190
stands out so we got to take the good
 

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.180
stands out so we got to take the good
with the bad you know we live in this

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.190
with the bad you know we live in this
 

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.980
with the bad you know we live in this
complicated world but that actually

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:42.990
complicated world but that actually
 

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.860
complicated world but that actually
gives us an opportunity to be more

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:45.870
gives us an opportunity to be more
 

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.259
gives us an opportunity to be more
noticed by being simple so whether it's

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:48.269
noticed by being simple so whether it's
 

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:51.439
noticed by being simple so whether it's
business or personal simplicity has that

00:08:51.439 --> 00:08:51.449
business or personal simplicity has that
 

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:53.570
business or personal simplicity has that
kind of power

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580
kind of power
 

00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:01.980
kind of power
