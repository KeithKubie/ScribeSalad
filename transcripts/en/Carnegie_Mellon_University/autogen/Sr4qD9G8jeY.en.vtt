certain engineering public policy I

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270
certain engineering public policy I
 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.850
certain engineering public policy I
teach electric power systems and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860
teach electric power systems and
 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.130
teach electric power systems and
undergraduate course teaching the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
undergraduate course teaching the
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.790

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.839
semester I teach the graduate level
course optimization in energy networks

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
course optimization in energy networks
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.470
course optimization in energy networks
so I'm mostly focusing on the optimal

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
so I'm mostly focusing on the optimal
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.020
so I'm mostly focusing on the optimal
operation of the electric power system

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
operation of the electric power system
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.660
operation of the electric power system
looking at how do we coordinate best

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
looking at how do we coordinate best
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.590
looking at how do we coordinate best
different elements in the system such as

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600
different elements in the system such as
 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.470
different elements in the system such as
generation load storage devices and so

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
generation load storage devices and so
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.740
generation load storage devices and so
on so in the past we had mostly large

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
on so in the past we had mostly large
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.920
on so in the past we had mostly large
power plants which were producing the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930
power plants which were producing the
 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.029
power plants which were producing the
electric energy and then it was

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
electric energy and then it was
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.619
electric energy and then it was
transmitted to the loads and the loads

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
transmitted to the loads and the loads
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.650
transmitted to the loads and the loads
were just fixed we supplied them as as

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
were just fixed we supplied them as as
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.959
were just fixed we supplied them as as
needed but now moving towards

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
needed but now moving towards
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.079
needed but now moving towards
distributed generation having hopefully

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089
distributed generation having hopefully
 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.040
distributed generation having hopefully
having more storage in the system and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050
having more storage in the system and
 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.590
having more storage in the system and
flexible loads meaning that you might be

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
flexible loads meaning that you might be
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840
flexible loads meaning that you might be
able to tell the utility ok you can

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
able to tell the utility ok you can
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.480
able to tell the utility ok you can
adjust my thermostat such that you're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
adjust my thermostat such that you're
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370
adjust my thermostat such that you're
becoming a flexible which they can

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
becoming a flexible which they can
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440
becoming a flexible which they can
adjust most of my work focuses on

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
adjust most of my work focuses on
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.720
adjust most of my work focuses on
developing methods and algorithms to

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730
developing methods and algorithms to
 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.690
developing methods and algorithms to
optimally use elements that we have in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
optimally use elements that we have in
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.870
optimally use elements that we have in
the system so what I'm basically trying

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
the system so what I'm basically trying
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.030
the system so what I'm basically trying
to do is let's say you have a storage

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
to do is let's say you have a storage
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.460
to do is let's say you have a storage
device but the storage device itself

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
device but the storage device itself
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.010
device but the storage device itself
doesn't help you much yet you need to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
doesn't help you much yet you need to
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990
doesn't help you much yet you need to
know when to charge when to discharge

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
know when to charge when to discharge
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.760
know when to charge when to discharge
storage device and so on so I'm

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
storage device and so on so I'm
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830
storage device and so on so I'm
providing the method to get the most out

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
providing the method to get the most out
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140
providing the method to get the most out
of that storage device the goal of my

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
of that storage device the goal of my
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810
of that storage device the goal of my
work is basically to minimize the cost

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
work is basically to minimize the cost
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.970
work is basically to minimize the cost
by optimally using the existing

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980
by optimally using the existing
 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.190
by optimally using the existing
components that we have in the system as

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
components that we have in the system as
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
components that we have in the system as
well as integrating new technology has

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
well as integrating new technology has
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.560
well as integrating new technology has
make optimal use of these technologies

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570
make optimal use of these technologies
 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.940
make optimal use of these technologies
especially in the viewpoint when we

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
especially in the viewpoint when we
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.430
especially in the viewpoint when we
think about well we want to move towards

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440
think about well we want to move towards
 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.900
think about well we want to move towards
a renewable energy future and often the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910
a renewable energy future and often the
 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.070
a renewable energy future and often the
counter-argument towards that as well

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080
counter-argument towards that as well
 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.730
counter-argument towards that as well
it's so much more expensive and so on so

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740
it's so much more expensive and so on so
 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.560
it's so much more expensive and so on so
especially in in this situation it's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
especially in in this situation it's
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.680
especially in in this situation it's
it's highly critical that you're making

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690
it's highly critical that you're making
 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.660
it's highly critical that you're making
on yourself of what you what he have in

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
on yourself of what you what he have in
 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.910
on yourself of what you what he have in
the system
