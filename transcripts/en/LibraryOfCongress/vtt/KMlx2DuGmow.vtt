[ Pause ]

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.790
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
Good morning everyone.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.480
I'm Fenella France, Chief
of the Preservation Research

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.850
and Testing Division,
and it's we appreciate

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.150
to have you here this morning for
this Tops Presentation entitled

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.050
"From Words to Diagrams
in Automated Visualization

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.610
of Historical Book
Binding Structures".

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.970
Our speaker today is
Dr. Alberto Campagnolo,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.130
who is the CLIR/DLF/Mellon
Fellow for Data Curation

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.630
and Medieval Studies

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.490
in the Presentation Research
and Testing Division.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.250
He's here from 2016 to 2018.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.370
He trained as a book conservator
in Spoleto, Italy in 2001,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.800
and has worked in [inaudible]
in various institutions,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.670
including the Guildhall Library,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.450
the London Metropolitan
Archives and the Vatican Library.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.800
He studied conservation of library
materials across Foscari University

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.890
in Venice in 2006, and holds an MA
in Digital Culture and Technology

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.780
from King's College, London 2009.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.010
He then decided to pursue
a PHD in Digital Humanities

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.160
that automated visualization of
historical bookbinding structures

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.770
from the University of the
Arts, London, then [inaudible],

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.240
completing that in 2007 to 2015.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.360
He served on the Digital
Medieval Board since 2014,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.760
and is the Director, and
has directed since 2015.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.050
He is especially interested
in the digital representation

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.310
of the physicality of books and
book bindings in particular,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.000
and we're delighted to have you
here for two years as the postdoct,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.300
and I'm delighted to see some

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.360
of the CLIR colleagues
in this audience also.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.030
So, I'll hand over to Alberto.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.830
Please welcome.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.680
[ Applause ]

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.980
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo:
Thank you, Fenella.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.700
Thank you very much having me
come here for the presentation.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.800 position:56%
So, yeah, I'm here as a DF fellow in
Data Curation for Medieval Studies.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.320
However, today, I'm not
going to present you

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.550
with post doctoral
project I'm doing here,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.280
but I will present the
PHD research that I did.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.420
I will try though to
put it into perspective,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.760
because I see the two projects
as it matches one to the other,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.860
so we'll see in the end how the
two things greatly fit together.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.210
And, so the talk today will
develop in three main parts.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.800
First we look into how binding

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.950
and binding structures are
traditionally presented in the web

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.420 position:56%
and catalogues, then we'll look more
specifically into the project I did

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.660
for the PHD, and then as I said,
we'll try to put it together

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.940
for the end for the conclusions.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.580
Normally when I present, I kind
of, I use the slide to try and put

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.390
into one big picture my
kind of unusual career,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.020
because as Fenella said, I was
born as a book conservator,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.070
and I studied conservation
in Spoloto University

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.880
and Ca' Foscari University, Venice,
but I always had a kind of interest

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.060
into [inaudible] humanities,
and then I did the Master

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.520
in this regards at Technology
at King's College, London,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.410
and I started bringing everything
together, where with the PHD

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.600
at the Ligatus Center,
University of the Arts, London.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.470
So, the two careers might
see like they are kind

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.770
of the opposite of the other.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.500
One is very much analog and the
other one is by definition digital,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.020 position:56%
but I actually see them as very much
complimentary, one of the other,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.270
and in fact, as a consequence,
the result of my experience

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.880
as a book conservator for many
years, then my research interest

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.450
in digital humanities is focusing
on the way in which books are

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.360
and can be portrayed in these
projects, books as objects.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.840
And of all the different aspects as
the book as an object [inaudible],

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.490
book binding structures
are a prominent one,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.840
mostly because if it weren't
for the binding structures,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.100
we wouldn't have the object to
start, and so that's how we look

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.160
at how binding structures
are traditionally presented.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.510
It is true that now a days,
we do find some information

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.550
about the bindings in
these type projects.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.310
We didn't used to be
like this in the past,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.590 position:56%
but now we do have information, as
in we do have pictures of the covers

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.990
of the books; the left and right
covers, the spine and the edges.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.050
However, what we do have is just
the images without metadata,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.880
so we cannot do any
kind of research on it.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.480
There are some real exceptions,
and the binding catalog

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.740
from the Folger Shakespeare Library
is one of these few exceptions,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.930
where we do find some
information about the structure.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.910
But for the most part, all we get
is the images without metadata,

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.590
and when we have some of these
pictures, it's literally skin deep.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:12.850
This is not just for wet
projects and catalogues in mind,

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.220
but it is very much engrained
into the tradition of this picture

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.200
of books in the catalogue
for libraries and archives.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.390
This is because, if we
look at the literature,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.250
we see that there are two main ways

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.900
in which books are
analyzed in the literature.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.450
One focuses more on the exterior
of the book and the binding,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.120 position:56%
and the other one focuses on the way

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.240
in which the object
is being constructed.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.440
So the first one concentrates on
what is visible and the decoration

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.120
for the most part, and
follows an artistry approach.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.370
On the other hand, the second
approach follows an archeological

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.750 position:56%
investigation and looks at what kind
of structure and elements you have

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.780
within the book and
what materials are used.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.790
Both approaches are useful and
important, and both can lead

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.470
to some information
about the history

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.140
of the book and their problems.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.230
However, the problems
up to the 1970s,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.210
the history of the binding
was basically virtually equal

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.450
to the history of the binding
in the creation, as if you look

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.010
in the literature, most

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.400
of the binding experience
will concentrate exclusively

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.390
in binding decorations.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.270
So we have a lot of
information about different tools

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.410
that have been used, and
some of them have been traced

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.340
down to a specific
bindery of binder,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.910
which can give us information
about the providence of the book.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.350 position:56%
And we do have online resources that
are devoted to the one decoration.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.210
One prominent one is
the Ion Bond Databank,

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.860
and there you see here the link.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.670
However, if all we can see and
say about books is something

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.200
about the decoration,
what about these?

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.290
These are four books.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.600
They have no decoration
whatsoever in them.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.170
However, they are very
different structures.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.620 position:56%
What you normally find in
catalogues is that they're described

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.940 position:56%
as [inaudible] bindings, which is
true, it's what they are, I suppose.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.660
I won't even get into the problem
of using term value of that.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.340
However, without any
information about the structure,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.060
we are left with this
main major category

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.080
that doesn't tell us anything
about the history of the object.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.920
If you were to be given some
information about the structure

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.670
and how the binding works, you will
be able to identify the first one

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.040
as a French example, then
a second one as an Italian.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.340
The third one, it's
a Spanish example,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.990
and the fourth one is a German.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.230
So, by looking at the structure, we
can actually get some information

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.680
about the etiology of the book,
which if we only concentrate

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.820
on the decoration, then we
will have absolutely nothing

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.080
to say about these books.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:22.730
So, what would it mean to
try to describe the bindings

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.520
as material object and in a way
that's actually informative;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.380
we understand how the object
works as we can introduce it

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.180
and understand it and study it?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.800
First, we need to define what
objects we are talking about.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.360
Books over the ages took many
different shapes and form.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.160
However, the form in
which we are most familiar

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.010
with in the Western World is
the books and products format,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:54.450
which can be roughly defined as
a collection of sheets folded,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:59.260
fastened together at
the spine and covered.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.870
This is actually a kind of
a, is a complex structure,

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.440
it actually is a result of a
series of different elements

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.850
and structures that's come together
to make the functioning work.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.460
We need to remember this.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.400
When we see an object and
we describe an object,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.980
we need to be able to differentiate
between a pile of elements

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:30.020
and working with, and [inaudible]
working order, that need to be able

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.380
to define both the elements
that make up the objects,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.100
but also the way in which
the objects come together

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.740
and function as an object.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:43.660
So, we need to be able to describe
both the material components

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.600
that make up the object
and the form;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.950
the way in which the
elements come together,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:55.120 position:56%
how they are related specially and
how they integrate one to the other.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.280
So, let's have a look of how some
examples of binding description

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.580
that we can find in the literature.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.300
We'll look into binding description

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.860
that use exclusively lateral
language, then we'll look

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.220
at the one example that uses
the very specific [inaudible]

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.020
vocabulary, and then
we look into databases.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.810
So this first example, it's
take by, from a German article

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.950
that describes a very particular
kind of sewing structure.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.680
It's kind of a rare structure,
which ends up; it's not very clear

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.670
in the picture, but you
basically have in the middle

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:40.820
of the two centers of force, we
have a knot, which is very unusual.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.060
This sewing structure was described

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.140
by Erin Auclair [assumed
spelling] in 1978.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.550
She found one example of this
structure in a collection,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.030
and she understood how the
sewing structure was formed,

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.840
and described it in her article.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.060
She only describes it by word,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.240
and then attaches a photograph
of the sewing structure.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.540
It has to be said that after
she described the book,

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:17.360
the book went into conservation,
and the structure has been changed.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.190
So now a days, this book doesn't
have the sewing structure anymore,

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.660
so we cannot go back
to it to understand it.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:33.210
A few years later in 1989, sorry, I
skipped one, Dorsey gets his hands

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:41.010
on the German article by Flint
and has it translated into English

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.150
and it [inaudible], so
to try and be as true

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.030
to the original German as possible.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.360
And following the steps, comes
up with the interpretation

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.510
of the sewing structure,
and makes a drawing

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.360
of what he thinks the class said.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.180
It was in an article.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.390
However, he says, even
though I follow those steps,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.160
what comes out of it doesn't
resemble actually the picture

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.190
from the articles, so it's actually
not correct, but he publishes

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.890
that anyway in order
to see what's there.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.500
A month later, Wilfill [phonetic
spelling] reading the same

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.730
translation of the
German article comes

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.750
up with a completely
different interpretation of it,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.440
and one he says resembles
more the sewing structure,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.060
but actually again, is
actually not correct.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.520
So the problem here in that the
description, the verbal description

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.580
of the binding structures tell
us what we need to look for,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.250
so we know there are the two sewing
supports, we have the thread,

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.240
we have the knot in the
middle, but we are not able

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.100
to understand how the
four thing works together;

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.670
the form of the structure.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.780
Just to conclude the
story, a few years later,

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.280
some examples of these particular
sewing structures came up in Italy,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.510
and Claudia Van Vestito
[phonetic spelling] a conservator

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:09.420
of the National Marciana
Library in Venice was able to,

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.140
by looking at the example
that she found,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.750
she was able to understand
how did the structure works,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.370
and she reproduced it, and she
published an article in Italian

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:24.750
about it in 2012, but she also
presented us with a series

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.540
of drawing that allows us actually

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.120
to understand how the
sewing structure is made.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:36.660
And this is because the drawing is
actually able to show us the form

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.510
of the object, and allows us

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:44.600
to understand both the material
elements and the structural data.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.180
So, that's great; now we do
actually know how it works.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.480
And these are still there.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.660
They're not being substituted.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:14:03.480 position:56%
And, a second example is a
description of the sewing structure,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.050
but it utilizes a very complex

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.820
and very well-defined
[inaudible] vocabulary.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.260
So, even though the
sentence might read

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.950
like a natural language
sentence in English almost,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.250
all the words that
you see on the lines,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.330
on the screen are actually
precisely defined

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.930
in the [inaudible] vocabulary.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:32.850
And when it comes to describing the
actual sewing structure and the way

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.920
in which the thread moves around
to produce the kind of structure,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.990
the [inaudible] vocabulary is
basically composed of a series

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.740
of verbs that describe the
action that a binder would do

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:52.370
to actually do that kind of sewing
structure, and by doing this,

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:59.650 position:56%
the [inaudible] vocabulary preserves
the specialty of the thread moving

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.760
around to produce the
sewing structure,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.690 position:56%
and it kind of works, which is good.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.910
However, it's doubtful that such
as approach will actually work

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:15.620
for something more complex and
normally for which is true for most

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.500
of the rest of the
binding structure.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.010 position:56%
So, we have the [inaudible] of the
thread that allows us to follow step

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.090
by step the way in which the thread
moves around the sewing structure,

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.230
but not all of the structures

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.500
in material are actually
as linear as this.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:37.180
So, our third example is
taken from a database.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:44.630
This is a [inaudible], that
was developed by Ligatus

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.790
to describe the binding structures.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.090
Now, a little bit of history here.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:56.350 position:56%
If you ever find yourself in London,
if you go to the Tate Region,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:02.240 position:56%
next to it is the Chelsea College
of Arts, and there at the red dot is

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.100
where Ligatus' office is.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.650
Ligatus is one of the research
centers of the University

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.670
of the Arts, London, and it's
focused on the history of binding

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.980
and book conservation,
but with the use

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.720
of research technology and tools.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.330
And that's where I did my PHD.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:26.350
One of the first projects that
Ligatus lead was the survey

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:35.440
of the books in the Library of the
Mass of St. Catherine of Mt. Sinai.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.360
The monastery is a Greek
Orthodox Monastery in Egypt.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.590
It's from the Fourth Century.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.790
The structure during the war, you
see is from the Sixth Century,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.970
and the library is built on top

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.890
of the walls there
where the red square is.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.890
It's very remote.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.630
This is a picture I took
from the, it's basically

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.100
in the middle of the desert.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:06.920
It's the, the monastery is on
the site of the burning bush.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.240
And the library; this is the view
of the library as it was inside.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.400
Now it's being renovated,
and it's being rebuilt.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.710
But the library is very important,

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.430
both from the manuscript
that you find there.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.720
Many of them are priceless, but
they're also very important,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.670
it's also very important
for the bindings,

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.110
because most of them
are original bindings,

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.640
which is unusual and
very interesting.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:37.530
So the survey proceeded
in two main phases.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.860
The first one was the
survey of the manuscript,

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.580
and this happened using
a paper form.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.320
So teams of conservators
were sent down to Sinai,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.070 position:56%
and in a couple grouping in Paris
that would fill in the form by hand,

00:17:54.070 --> 00:18:00.210
and then by taking in the boxes
and the writing within the form,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:05.070
and then the information would be
automatically scanned and uploaded

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.470
into a relational database.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:14.900
When it came to do the survey
for the printed books collection,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.660
Ligatus decided to
change their approach,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:26.130
and they developed an XML schema,
which was based on the information

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:31.900
that was gathered on the paper
form by developing the XML schema,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.890
they were able to have the
conservators input the information

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:41.280
directly into the database through
an electronic form, and this way,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.780
they didn't have to scan the
paper forms anymore to upload

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.790
into a database, but also
they had improved accuracy

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.850
because the computer will
allow you to a [inaudible].

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.910
It will tell you whether the kind
of information that you are putting

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.150
into one field was valid
or not, which is not true

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.460
for paper forms, of course.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.380
So what the XML schema
does, it allow us,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.750
it gives us like a
description of methodology.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.260
It tells us what to describe
and how to describe it,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.220
and also gave us, gives
us a terminology.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.880
What this schema does
is it follows the ways

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.040
in which a book would be
put together by binders,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:33.390
so it starts from the book block,
and then it goes out to the,

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.250
to the end lifts, the
sewing structure,

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.540
whether the edges have
been treated or not,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.210
whether there are borders added
to it, the shape that was given

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:48.440
to the spine, spine lining,
the indents and after the cover

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.360
and the finish and decoration.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.990
And if people are interested,
the schema is online.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:01.530
You can download it from the
website, and most importantly,

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.300
every year Ligatus
has a summer school.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.480 position:56%
I believe this year will be in Rome.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.130
The call is not out yet.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:16.020
In one of the two weeks, they take
the time to teach the students how

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.240 position:56%
to describe book bindings according
to the schema and to use the schema.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.930
So, if you're interested, do apply.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.500
It's very good.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:30.350 position:56%
And I actually did the summer school
in 2008, before I started my PHD,

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.770
and that's where I started thinking

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.770
about the research
project for my PHD.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:41.930
Because I was aware of the ways in
which data was gathered according

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.560
to the Ligatus schema, and I
knew that it was very accurate

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:51.300
and precise, and it was describing
the structures in a very good way

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:57.960 position:56%
and active way, but I also knew
that normally when book conservators

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.690
and binding historians talk about
books and book binding structures,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:07.620
they tend to use and jot down some
kind of graphic representation

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.750
of it, because it's
easy to understand.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.780
And we see, it's actually a good
way to preserve both the elements

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.680
and the form of the object, so
what I was thinking is that,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.040
we have all formation
within the database

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.610
that describes the
binding structures

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.950
down to a very good level.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:31.130
Would it be possible
to take these files

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.170 position:56%
that describe the binding structure,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.990
and have a computer take
the information from them,

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.260
and then just form that into
drawings; the same kind of drawings

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.690
that we will use in order to
understand the structures,

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.890
and that's what I set out to do.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:50.760
So, I had the XLM schema and I had
the database from St. Catherine.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.980
They described the book
according to those schemas,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.470
and I started writing a
series of Xcel T sheets,

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.600
basically just computer
algorithms to take the information

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.050
from the XML document and
transform that into SVGs file.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.400
SVGs stands for scalable
vector graphics,

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:17.220 position:56%
and these are basically just
textural XML files that when are fed

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.590
into a browser are interpreted
as drawings; the kind of drawings

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.110
that you see here on this screen.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:28.780
So basically on the SVG file,
you have a series of vectors

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:35.400
that are prescribed in the XML,
and the computer draws the vectors

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.480
for you on the screen straight.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:44.540
Oops. At this point, we have
a video that doesn't work.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.170
I need to go on this.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.570
Let's see how the system works.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.950
Okay, so here is the, an example
of the FI from St. Catherine's,

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.240
and a few thousand lines of
code, you have the description

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.390
of the binding structure.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:10.290
Then this is one of
the XSLTI [inaudible].

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:16.770
This one is specifically written
for the [inaudible] structures,

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:24.670
and when you apply this
algorithm to the XLM file,

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.020
in a matter of seconds,
actually fraction of seconds;

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.370
this time it was 0.4 seconds,
you end up with an SVG file,

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:41.310
and when you feed that SVG file;
let's go back to the presentation.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:48.900
So when you feed the SVG file
into the browser or any other kind

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.950
of software that is able to
understand and interpret SVG files,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:24:00.410
these are the kind of
drawings that you see.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:06.580
Now when the conservators in
St. Catherine were inputting

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:13.160
within the XML database
for the electronic forms,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:19.970
they also had these A3 paper forms
where they still had to input

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.120
by hand some drawing, some
information about some

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:28.460
of the structures, and if we
compare our automated drawing

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.220
with the drawing that a
conservator did of that book,

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.900
it's still actually quite similar.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:40.010
So the system works, and but
our automated drawing was

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.460
down in a fracture of seconds,
using the same information

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.970
that was already recorded
in the database.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.880
And the system works because
the XLM schema is able

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.660
to mirror both the material
components of the structure,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.200
but also their form, and this is
the kind of thing that we need.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.440
Because we are dealing with
a very specific domain,

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.880
this is variable specifics
to apply this for other kind

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.840
of material objects, you also need
to be able to have an understanding

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.010
of the rules of the composition, of
the objects and the typical shapes,

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:25.150
but that's not going to
match the data today.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.470
So the system works.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.660
We were able to produce
the drawings,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.640
and they're very much
similar to the ones

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.190
that the conservators
would be doing.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.050
So I was happy about that.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.320
However, because the drawings were
automated, you can now actually,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:48.000
there was some kind of added value
to these that I wasn't foreseeing

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.340
and expecting when I
started the project.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:58.940
So, sometimes when I was developing
the, why is it skipping once;

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:04.830
when I was developing
the algorithms,

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.410
sometimes I would be faced with
drawings that made no sense,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.190
like the one on the
top of the screen here.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:18.440 position:56%
At the beginning, I thought, and it
actually was, it was due to problems

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.320
with my algorithms, so
I fixed that, but then,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.380
actually some of these problems
were actually due to the fact

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:29.670
that the information within
the XML files were incorrect.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.330
They had some mistakes there.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.540
So for example, in this case, there
was a problem with interpretation

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:40.220
of the ways in which the
schema wanted the conservator

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.930
to describe the end of structures
and the order of the lifts,

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:49.570
and you see that the automated
drawing, it's very different

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:54.460
to the drawing that the
conservator was trying to describe.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:01.270
But within the XML file,
the data was wrong.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:06.830
And by looking at the algorithm
drawing, it's very easy

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.690
to spot immediately what, that
there are some problems there.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:14.070
If we were just to look at the
database, the same database,

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.130
it would be very difficult to
actually stop the problems,

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.930
because the data is
scattered throughout a series

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.550
of different fields, and sometimes
these fields are actually quite

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.580
apart one from the other, and our
human brain is actually not able

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.110 position:56%
to process that kind of information
and incorporate into one big picture

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.530 position:56%
to understand what's going on
there, but the computer can do that,

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.280
and presents us with a
drawing which is synchronic,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.710
and we see all the
information there in one.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.410
So, the fact that we have
these automated transformation,

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:57.010
allows us to give to take the
information and present it back

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:01.660
to us directly from the database,
and it presents this information,

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.830
which is being in a different
format, we see it better,

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:12.620
understand better what we
actually input into the XML file.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:18.950
So, if that, if what we see
doesn't resemble what we wanted,

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:24.050
we can go back to the XML
document and correct that.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.670
Sometimes, so yeah, we
can correct the XML file

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.670
and then obtain a drawing.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.750
This is skipping.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.560
Okay. And we can obtain a
drawing, which is correct,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.470
which means that the data with
the XML has been corrected,

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.780
and we have a better
file within that.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.700
Now, sometimes the drawings
will actually show us something

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.160
that is possible.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.830
This is a very feasible
kind of description.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:03.080
However, still is a mistake,
and this is due to the fact

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.160
that sometimes we are human beings,
and we take on the wrong box,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.510
and that data will remain
within the XML file unchecked.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:19.240
But again, if the system were
in place during the survey,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.090
then this kind of mistake
can be corrected on the fly,

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:26.040 position:56%
and we did try a little trial at one

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.320
of the summer schools
a few years back,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.730
and when we were teaching the
students how to use the XML schema

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.780
and then they described
some of the structures,

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.630
then we fed that information into
the drawings, into my algorithms

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.030
to produce the drawings, and
then they had eureka moments.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:49.310
It was like sometimes what they
found was consistently what they

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.610
wanted to describe.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.660
Other times, they said,
that's not what I wanted,

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.810
and that was because sometimes
they didn't understand how the

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.110
schema worked.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.410
Other times it was
because they made mistakes

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.020
like checking the wrong box.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:04.860
By the having the image fed back to
you immediately, it's, as I said,

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.420
it's kind of the eureka moment.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.270 position:56%
That's, it's only then that you
actually understood the data you put

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.570
into the XML, and understand
that's how the whole things work.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:20.770 position:56%
So, it's basically that the drawings
that are being automated provided us

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:25.490
with visual validation
which I didn't foresee

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.130
when I started the project, but is
actually quite valid and useful.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.360 position:56%
Because, as I said, in that way,
you can go back to the XML document,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.480
and you end with improved
accuracy within the database.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:45.480
Now, another thing that came
out of the project is not all

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.160
of the bookbinding
structures are described

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.800
as well with the XML schema.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.970
Sometimes, the drawings that
I was able to produce were not

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.230
as detailed, and as
well done as they were

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.530
for me in other structures.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:14.840
And this is because not
always the schema was able

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.930
to mirror both the elements and
in the form of the structure,

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:25.860
but by thinking terms of SVG
drawings that may be produced

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.590
after the data's input
into the XML database.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.620
We can go back to the
schema and improve that,

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.940
so that actually we end
up with a better XML file

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.900
that describes the object in a
better way, because we are able

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.000
to preserve the information that
we need to describe it for all

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.940
of the different structures
in a better way.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:59.300
Now, as I said, Lugato's
schema goes from the book block

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.320
down to the cover, but it
doesn't really doesn't look

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.850
into one other structure that
is actually quite important,

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.660
and that's the [inaudible]
structure.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.480
This information is actually not
related code within catalogs.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.010
You have it both for manuscripts

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:22.950
and printed books with
collation formulas.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:28.730 position:56%
As I was working on my PHD, a
project started, led by Doug Porter,

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:32.360
University of Pennsylvania,
and now in collaboration

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.120
with the University of Toronto.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.270
And what the project
wanted to do was

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:45.510
to be able describe the collation
structures within manuscripts

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.570
in a better way than collation
formulas and to visualize this.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.420
And one main element of the
project of the, of the project

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.860
since its very beginning
was the generation of,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:07.280
a generation of the diagrams of
the collation footage gathering,

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.340
and I collaborated with
Dalt [phonetic spelling],

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.430
starting collaborating
with Dalt on this,

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:18.850
and by using the same principle
that I had for, set out for my PHD,

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:22.500
I wrote the script that will take
information from the description

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.670
of the gathering structure, and
just hold that into serial diagrams

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.510
for each, for each gathering.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.390 position:56%
Now, these are very simple ones,
but you can get to very complex ones

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:37.330
that are actually quite useful
to visualize in a dramatic way.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:43.320
Now, the project site is still
going on, and the data is all

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.550
on the [inaudible] this July,
and it's very interesting now

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:54.240
that in [inaudible] things are
very exciting, and, you know,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:01.300
keep on looking to this, because
it's a very interesting project.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:08.300
So, as I said, my interest,
academic interest is in the way

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.100
in which we can represent the book

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.960
as an object within
digital projects.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:19.420
And bookbinding structure was
what I looked into for the PHD,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:24.440
and with the collation
project with this code,

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:29.440
then I kind of added an
extra leaf into my interest.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:36.290
Now, I'm here in the lab,
and I'm not really much

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.840
with collation formulas or
with binding structures,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.360
but I'm still looking into
the [inaudible] of the object.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.540
My notoriety here will mean about
the actual material will offset

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.550
within the documents that we
studied, so this can be the pass

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.520
for other people in the substrate,
the inks used for the writing,

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.990
space where you can find all
the manuscripts, pigments used,

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:04.770
and all of these kinds of
information can be teased

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:09.500
out by using a technology that is
normally thought of as a way to go

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.380
for polysyntex, but is actually,
it can actually be used also

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:18.730 position:56%
for teasing out and categorizing
different materials that we can find

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:23.490
on the documents, and we are
working with Fenella in a way

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.490
to present this information to
the reader using the technology

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.880
such as the cheaper framework.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.780
But more on these in the next
episode I suppose [laughter].

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.830
I just wanted to throw
this into the specter

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:41.250
because basically this allows me to
add an extra leaf into my interest,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.610
and put them into the whole thing
is actually working together

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.960
for the notoriety of the
book and these projects.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.340
And that's it.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.140
Thank you.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:36:02.390
[ Applause ]

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:03.690
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So I also want

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:08.650
to thank the very many people
we have on line as well.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.650
Do we have any questions
for Alberto?

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.550
What I'd like to do is, since
I don't have much voice,

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.270
I'm going to ask Alberto
to rephrase that question

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:21.940 position:56%
so that the people online, and I
believe we have 72, 77 people online

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.690
from all around the
world, which is fantastic.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.010
Congratulations.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:27.600
And so, we'll take some
questions from the audience first,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.380
and Alberto will rephrase

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.280
so that our online participants
can hear the question,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.870
and then we'll take any
questions from our online people.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.170
Questions for Alberto?

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:45.620
&gt;&gt; Is there any way to
incorporate an actual photograph

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.860
of the book in your schema.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.260
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: Uh, so is
it possible to put any photograph

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.560
of the book within the schema?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.850
In what sense?

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.820
&gt;&gt; Well, you're translating the
information into a digital design.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.120
Right?

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.420
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: Yeah.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.950
&gt;&gt; Is there any way to add to
that file an actual picture

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.930
of the book for the record?

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.200
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: Yeah, I mean
the drawings can be input into kind

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.460
of system, so yeah, it's fine.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.710
The algorithm that I wrote
only went from the description

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.080
to the drawings, but then those
drawings are normal files you can

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.760
put into any webpage, and so, yeah,
you can integrate it with pictures

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.580
without problems online, yeah.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.390
Any other questions?

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.690
Yes?

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.410
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering how the
picture deals with very unusual

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:48.330
or any structures since they
rely on having [inaudible].

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: So, how the
system works for unusual structures.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:56.290
That all depends on the
modeling behind the XLM schema.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:05.600 position:56%
So if the schema was able to foresee
that kind of unusual structure

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.280
in problems, then the system works.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:16.000
I'm trying to think
of some examples.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.430
Basically, the problem is
that the schema has to be able

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:25.730
to mirror what's sometimes referred
to in philosophy as the logical

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.270
from of the object, which is
basically all of the different ways

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:33.320
in which the different
elements can come together

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.330
and be embodied into the object.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.580
So for the [inaudible]
structure for example,

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:46.950
I think that works quite well,
so because the model is able

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:51.320
to foresee all the different
elements that can come together

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:57.720 position:56%
for the structure, and tries to tell
you the ways which these are related

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.300
to each other, I think that
works as well also for stuff

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.950
that we didn't think it would
be possible for or even foresee

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:09.040
for any structures, so it
goes all back to the model.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.350
If the model is good,
than the algorithm is able

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.510
to take information well and do it.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:19.510
[ Pause ]

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:27.530
[ Poorly-Mic'd Question ]

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:31.580
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: So
if the language that I use

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:36.530
to produce the drawings
and the artist.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.470
So, the schema was
developed by Lugato's,

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.350
and that can be downloaded
from the website.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:48.170
The rest of the technology is a
standard schematic technology,

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:51.430
and the XSLT so that the
algorithms that are wrote;

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:56.710 position:56%
I should have put actually the link,
I forgot, they're all on gatehub

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:01.180 position:56%
as well, so I can give you the
link, but those algorithms only work

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.820
with the Ligato scheme, of course.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:06.160
So you need to have an XLM 5

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.460
that describes the binding
structure according to the schema.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.510
More questions?

have one question from online,

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.460
and will the schema be
available to conservatives

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.840
and libraries and museums.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.510
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: Well, if we
get funding [laughter], as usual.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:51.070
[ Pause ]

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.900
&gt;&gt; Can this model describe
the condition of a binding;

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:58.280 position:56%
not just the description, of do you
have any plans to expand it to allow

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.530
for the description of damage
or material deterioration?

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.830
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: So,

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.130
if the system describes also
the condition of the object.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.800
So, the schema does;
the schema was developed

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.040
to describe both the structure
of the binding and the condition

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.890
of the books, because it was done

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.990
for the condition survey
of the other books.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.150
My system, my drawing's only
look into the structure,

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.020
not the condition, so they go

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:28.360
for the ideal representation
of the object.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:35.510
The principle was that we wanted
to be able to have a way to compare

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.520
and communicate the different
structures with the other examples.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.380
So, by going into the prototypical
shapes and prototypical idea

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.430
of the object, it's
actually easier to compare

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.690
and see whether the
structure are the same or not.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.900 position:56%
So, I don't look into the condition.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.510
Yes?

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:58.940
&gt;&gt; Can you explain one more time
why you think your algorithms works

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.520
better for visualizing
any structures other

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.250
than the [inaudible].

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.600
Did you say that?

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: No, basically
the [inaudible] structures work very

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.220
well, because the schema
worked well in that sense.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.110
It wasn't working well for
other kind of structures,

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:22.860
like the fastenings or other
elements within the bindings,

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:27.680
because I didn't have
enough information.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.420
It doesn't work so well for
[inaudible] for example,

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:37.600
because the information
recall is not precise enough

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.560
or granular enough for me to be
able to actually gather information

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.680
and transform that
back into the drawings.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.590
It has to be said that the
computer is very unforgiving,

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.980
and so are the drawings, so if you
have any problems with the data,

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:58.510
then the drawings would not
come out particularly well.

Can you repeat?

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.200
Yeah.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, I'll break it into two parts.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.270
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: Yeah.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.150
&gt;&gt; So the first part is how has
the data been carried or assessed

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.890
to identify trends or rarities?

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:34.670
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: The data
being the, I suppose the database?

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:47.000
Database, it hasn't been published
yet, because of copyright issues.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.270
So we're not; we haven't
been looking into that yet,

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:53.550
and the second part
of like doubling code?

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:58.200
&gt;&gt; Basic external metadata
standards being modified

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.270
for the attached schema?

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.490
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: I
suppose you could if you were

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:10.730
to use a name space, but doubling
code is very much not good enough

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.520 position:56%
to be able to do anything like that.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.460
So you can use mets, as
opposed to actually have

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.130
within one XLM file all the
information that you want,

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.410
and using different name spaces,

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:25.790
you can incorporate all the
information within one XLM file.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:29.480
If that answers the questions.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:41.040
[ Poorly-Mic'd Question ]

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.870
&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo:
In a way, yes.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:51.150
If one is possible, the schema
gathered that kind of information,

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.040
for example for the
sewing structures,

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.790
it will ask you whether the station

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.750
that you are describing is the
current one or the previous one,

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:05.000
and so some information
can be gathered there,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.590
and can be [inaudible]
into a drawing.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:14.390
At that point, it will only be
the preparation of the gatherings

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:18.050
to [inaudible] in the sewing, so
whether it was just a punch hole

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:25.240
or if it was like a cut through
the spine of the gathering.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.070
In other cases, I suppose,
if you were describe,

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:32.250
if you have enough
information of the object;

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:38.010
an idea of how the object was, and
you were to describe into details,

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.220
then the drawings can
present that you to.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:45.370
So it all goes back to what
you put into your XML file,

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:50.370
and whether you're able to describe
something that's not there anymore.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.370
So, that's a problem.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:00.140

developed in your schema,

we going to implement the system.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:15.720
So, yeah, we were looking
into funding,

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.830
because what would be
a year we would be able

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:23.350
to actually give the people
there, the conservators of there,

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.400
in a line form that allowed them to
describe the books that are coming

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.010
through the schema without
having to deal with the XML

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.150
and downloading the
XML and installing

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:40.250
on their system the electronic
form, and using the drawings that,

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:45.100
as I said, translate to you the
data you put into the XML directly,

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.020
allows to understand
better the data and the way

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.320
in which the schema work.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:58.330
So, when we try to the
algorithms at the summer school,

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:02.390
it was quite eye opening
to see how the students

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:06.770
who thought they understood the
schema when they were taught

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.640
about it, and then they actually
saw the results, they said,

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.530
oh that's not, and
that's at that point

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.060 position:56%
where they understood what they were
doing, and then went to the schema

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.360
and sort of back to the source.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.910
Actually, the drawings
functional, function as a way

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.870
to actually train the people
to understand the schema.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.390

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:28.630 position:56%
in a way then you have this data you
can compare with other structures,

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:32.080
but as implementation, what's
really important there is

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.190 position:56%
that the drawings allow you to get
to a better description of the book,

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.470

actually the description

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:42.360

visualization of the drawings.

&gt;&gt; Alberto Campagnolo: So if we are
developing a centralized database,

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:03.890
again, the idea is that
regardless after the schema went

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:10.680
on to develop what is known as
the language of binding thesaurus,

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:16.770
and that uses the same technology
that was developed for the schema,

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.440
and amplifies this
to cover a lot more,

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.240
and it uses schematic
graph technologists.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:28.260
So, it would be ideal if we were
able to actually get funding

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.550
to allow people to
describe books and input

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:35.060
that into the center database using
schematic graph technologists,

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.720
and the drawings would be there to
actually help understand the schema

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.480
and then describe the books, to
actually get to a better database.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.210

thank you so much, Alberto.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.670
I know there was a number of
links here, and so I think

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.950
if people are interested in
some of the web links that were

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.280
on the pamphlet, let us
know, and we can send those

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.580
out to you, some of those.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.470
Please, I just want to remind
everyone that next Tops work

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:22.400
on April 25 is the preservation
week, and then on May 22,

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.030
Dr. Eric Monroe will be talking
about [inaudible] cylinders,

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.640
and how we figured out
why they are cracking.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.020
But please join me,
and thank you, Alberto,

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.510
