00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
right right right and now I would say
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.060
right right right and now I would say
would be the majority of Muslims

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
would be the majority of Muslims
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.160
would be the majority of Muslims
worldwide I'm not sure you agree with

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
worldwide I'm not sure you agree with
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.720
worldwide I'm not sure you agree with
that but it seems to me that it isn't

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
that but it seems to me that it isn't
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.640
that but it seems to me that it isn't
self-evidently the case that the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
self-evidently the case that the
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.279
self-evidently the case that the
majority of human beings are violent and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
majority of human beings are violent and
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100
majority of human beings are violent and
warlike and so ice my sense is is that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
warlike and so ice my sense is is that
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.040
warlike and so ice my sense is is that
given the essential peace peacefulness

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
given the essential peace peacefulness
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.720
given the essential peace peacefulness
of most people they're going to take a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
of most people they're going to take a
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.639
of most people they're going to take a
look at the Islamic doctrine and extract

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
look at the Islamic doctrine and extract
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.020
look at the Islamic doctrine and extract
from it those elements that are

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
from it those elements that are
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420
from it those elements that are
supportive of that more individual peace

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
supportive of that more individual peace
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.100
supportive of that more individual peace
but that still leaves open the question

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
but that still leaves open the question
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.100
but that still leaves open the question
of exactly what the doctrine means as a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
of exactly what the doctrine means as a
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959
of exactly what the doctrine means as a
set of motivational principles and that

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
set of motivational principles and that
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.490
set of motivational principles and that
seems to be a big part of the current

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
seems to be a big part of the current
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.979
seems to be a big part of the current
problem and also the need for current

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
problem and also the need for current
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.590
problem and also the need for current
discourse what I would hope is that it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
discourse what I would hope is that it
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.970
discourse what I would hope is that it
would be possible to undertake a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
would be possible to undertake a
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.310
would be possible to undertake a
dialogue with Islam let's say between

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
dialogue with Islam let's say between
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990
dialogue with Islam let's say between
Islam and the West or between Islam and

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
Islam and the West or between Islam and
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570
Islam and the West or between Islam and
judeo-christianity and to find within

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
judeo-christianity and to find within
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.090
judeo-christianity and to find within
Islam itself the seeds that would enable

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
Islam itself the seeds that would enable
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.460
Islam itself the seeds that would enable
that dialogue to occur so that some sort

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
that dialogue to occur so that some sort
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.100
that dialogue to occur so that some sort
of long term negotiated conceptual and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
of long term negotiated conceptual and
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380
of long term negotiated conceptual and
practical peace could be attained but

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
practical peace could be attained but
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090
practical peace could be attained but
the more I've read about Islam the more

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
the more I've read about Islam the more
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.890
the more I've read about Islam the more
difficult it is for me to understand how

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
difficult it is for me to understand how
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719
difficult it is for me to understand how
that might be managed especially because

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
that might be managed especially because
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820
that might be managed especially because
of its well because of the warlike

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
of its well because of the warlike
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740
of its well because of the warlike
tradition that emerged from from Medina

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
tradition that emerged from from Medina
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.160
tradition that emerged from from Medina
and then at a staggering rate from that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
and then at a staggering rate from that
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.760
and then at a staggering rate from that
and also the thing that's quite quite

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
and also the thing that's quite quite
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.140
and also the thing that's quite quite
disconcerting to me I mean it's not like

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
disconcerting to me I mean it's not like
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149
disconcerting to me I mean it's not like
Christianity hasn't been rife with

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
Christianity hasn't been rife with
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.280
Christianity hasn't been rife with
internal divisions like that between the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
internal divisions like that between the
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.490
internal divisions like that between the
Cubs and the Catholics but I mean it it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
Cubs and the Catholics but I mean it it
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380
Cubs and the Catholics but I mean it it
also was the case that what you might

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
also was the case that what you might
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179
also was the case that what you might
describe as the civil war that's been

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
describe as the civil war that's been
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249
describe as the civil war that's been
occurring within Islam more or less

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
occurring within Islam more or less
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109
occurring within Islam more or less
started as far as I can tell more or

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
started as far as I can tell more or
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.730
started as far as I can tell more or
less started the day that Muhammad died

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
less started the day that Muhammad died
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.920
less started the day that Muhammad died
and has never stopped since then and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
and has never stopped since then and
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.230
and has never stopped since then and
that also seems to be well obviously

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
that also seems to be well obviously
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090
that also seems to be well obviously
it's a problem for the Islamic community

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
it's a problem for the Islamic community
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310
it's a problem for the Islamic community
itself but it also seems to be a problem

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
itself but it also seems to be a problem
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440
itself but it also seems to be a problem
an increasing problem for the West is we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
an increasing problem for the West is we
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.800
an increasing problem for the West is we
can't not be tangled up in that yeah we

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
can't not be tangled up in that yeah we
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.020
can't not be tangled up in that yeah we
have to share the planet with one fifth

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
have to share the planet with one fifth
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.869
have to share the planet with one fifth
of humanity and it's very clear that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
of humanity and it's very clear that
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.440
of humanity and it's very clear that
things have to change and that is beauty

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
things have to change and that is beauty
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.559
things have to change and that is beauty

the theological underpinnings of the

the theological underpinnings of the
 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.380
the theological underpinnings of the
religion and as far as I'm concerned

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390
religion and as far as I'm concerned
 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780
religion and as far as I'm concerned
this is being pushed by those that I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
this is being pushed by those that I
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.140
this is being pushed by those that I
call reformers or modifiers yeah and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
call reformers or modifiers yeah and
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.199
call reformers or modifiers yeah and
these are individuals maybe now a little

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209
these are individuals maybe now a little
 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.300
these are individuals maybe now a little
bigger there are groups we are forming

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310
bigger there are groups we are forming
 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.000
bigger there are groups we are forming
groups and maybe even being led by

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
groups and maybe even being led by
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.399
groups and maybe even being led by
summation States leaders of countries

summation States leaders of countries
 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.220
summation States leaders of countries
for that change the big question is are

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
for that change the big question is are
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.979
for that change the big question is are
they going to agree on what to change so

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989
they going to agree on what to change so
 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.819
they going to agree on what to change so
what is inbuilt into Islam is this idea

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829
what is inbuilt into Islam is this idea
 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.809
what is inbuilt into Islam is this idea
that men cannot argue with God you

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819
that men cannot argue with God you
 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.690
that men cannot argue with God you
cannot unsubmitted and edit to the Quran

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700
cannot unsubmitted and edit to the Quran
 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.670
cannot unsubmitted and edit to the Quran
and it's the same thing you know

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680
and it's the same thing you know
 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.240
and it's the same thing you know
Mohammed was is seen by Muslims as

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
Mohammed was is seen by Muslims as
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.360
Mohammed was is seen by Muslims as
infallible yeah never made a mistake

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
infallible yeah never made a mistake
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.300
infallible yeah never made a mistake
so it's an uphill battle for those

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310
so it's an uphill battle for those
 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.750
so it's an uphill battle for those
Muslims inside Islam who were seeking

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
Muslims inside Islam who were seeking
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.409
Muslims inside Islam who were seeking
modernization or seeking the power to

modernization or seeking the power to
 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.720
modernization or seeking the power to
agree on you know how to edit score how

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
agree on you know how to edit score how

don't get the theological underpinnings

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
don't get the theological underpinnings

don't get the theological underpinnings
for that yeah that's the click button

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449
for that yeah that's the click button

danger there too is that I mean when
 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.619
danger there too is that I mean when
that sort of thing is attempted often

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629
