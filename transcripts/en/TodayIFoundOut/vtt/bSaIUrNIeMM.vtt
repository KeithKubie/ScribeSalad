00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:14.539
As you seem to have noticed, in the “Humpty
Dumpty” nursery rhyme, nowhere does it say

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.660
that Humpty is an egg, yet he is often presented
as such in pictures and stories.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.429
The version of the rhyme that most children
learn today goes like this:

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.710
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.669
All the king’s horses and all the king’s
men

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.609
Couldn’t put Humpty together again.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.540
The first known publication of Humpty Dumpty
was included in Juvenile Amusements by Samuel

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.540
Arnold in 1797.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.370
In that version, the last lines read “Fourscore
men and fourscore more / could not make Humpty

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.390
Dumpty where he was before.”

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.150
Over the next century, the rhyme appeared
in numerous books with variations on the lyrics.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.050
These publications did not include the first
use of the term “humpty dumpty,” though.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.820
According to the Oxford English Dictionary,
“humpty dumpty” was first used in the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.910
17th century and referred to brandy boiled
with ale.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.970
In the 1700s, it was also a term used to describe
a short, clumsy person.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.080
It has also been a nickname attributed to
someone who has had too much alcohol (perhaps

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.360
imbibing the drink of the same name).

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.420
As the popular nursery rhyme is neither a
bottle of alcohol nor a person, it is most

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.790
likely that the nursery rhyme was intended
as a riddle.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.030
The answer to the riddle, of course, is “an
egg”—something that, if it rolled off

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.480
a wall, could not be mended by any number
of people.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.170
Today, the answer is so well known that the
character of Humpty Dumpty has taken on the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.760
appearance of an egg and the rhyme is not
considered to be a riddle at all, but a story.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.659
Because of this switch from “riddle” to
“story”, many people today believe that

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.260
there is more meaning to the nursery rhyme
than is given in the lyrics.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.479
Perhaps, in this instance, we could take advice
from Humpty Dumpty himself, as seen in Through

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.240
the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll: “When
I use a word, it means just what I choose

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.140
it to mean—neither more nor less.”

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.610
People will always attribute more meaning
to nursery rhymes than was initially intended.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.409
Nursery rhymes are commonly linked to historical
events, but it is difficult to prove that

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.590
imagery in the nursery rhymes represents historical
places and figures.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.739
Most modern rhymes, after all, are created
with the intent of being silly, repetitive,

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.390
and enjoyable for children to repeat rather
than for their historical significance (think

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.670
“Miss Mary Mack” and other clapping games).

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.939
Two of the most popular theories link Humpty
Dumpty to two separate historical events.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.019
The first is the Fall of Colchester.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.799
During the English Civil War in 1648, the
town of Colchester was under siege.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.780
Supposedly, a man named Jack Thompson was
stationed on the walls with a cannon nicknamed

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.969
“Humpty Dumpty.”

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.409
Thompson and the cannon managed to do a lot
of damage to the advancing Parliamentarian

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.640
troops, until the cannon eventually tumbled
to the ground.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.340
Given the size and weight of the cannon, the
dozens of men who attempted to lift it back

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.190
to its place on the wall were unable to do
so.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.640
Eventually, Colchester was forced to open
its gates and surrender.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.959
While the siege of Colchester did happen,
it is unlikely that Humpty Dumpty refers to

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.919
anything in the siege as it happened over
a century before Humpty Dumpty was recorded

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.109
and there is no documented connection between
the two.

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.500
The other popular theory is that Humpty Dumpty
represented King Richard III.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.230
, called the “humpbacked king”.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.220
(He supposedly was a hunchback, though recent
evidence seems to indicate Shakespeare was

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.060
wildly exaggerating on this point, with Richard
actually apparently having scoliosis which

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.569
made his right shoulder higher than the left,
but otherwise no hunch).

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.669
In 1485, Richard III fought at the Battle
of Bosworth.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.769
In this “humpty dumpty” origin story,
it was said that either his horse was named

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.239
“Wall” or his men, who abandoned him,
were representative of the “wall.”

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.199
Either way, the king fell off his horse and
was supposedly hacked to pieces on the field—thus

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.419
no one could put him together again.

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.010
Several problems exist with this theory, the
least of which being that the term “humpbacked”

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.049
didn’t exist in King Richard’s day, nor
for several centuries after.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.269
(The term “hunchback” also didn’t first
pop up until the 18th century).

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.829
Much more importantly was that the king’s
remains were recently found largely intact

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.900
save for a bludgeon to the head which probably
killed him.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.500
Additionally, other than pure speculation,
as in the previous “siege of Colchester”

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.370
theory, no solid historical evidence has been
found that shows that King Richard III was

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.980
the inspiration for Humpty Dumpty.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.650
And, indeed, one of the reasons it’s so
often connected, because of the “all the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.340
king’s horses and all the king’s men”
bit, as noted, wasn’t even in the original

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.090
version, being the more generic “fourscore
men and fourscore more”.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.550
The historical events that have been linked
to “Humpty Dumpty” provide excellent stories,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.960
but are based on pure speculation.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.290
Given the actual evidence at hand, it is far
more likely that Humpty Dumpty was not intended

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.150
to be a story, but rather just a riddle posed
to children for their amusement.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.590
The answer to the riddle, as stated, is “an
egg”, which is why Humpty Dumpty today is

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.900
nearly always depicted as such.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.340
The first time the character of Humpty Dumpty
was represented explicitly as an egg was in

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:46.159
Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass
in 1872.
