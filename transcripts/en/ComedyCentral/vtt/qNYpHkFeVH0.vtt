00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:16.409 line:85%

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:19.879 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S ONE OF THE COOLEST
SPORTS OUT THERE.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.481 line:91%
&gt;&gt; ICE IS FROZEN WATER. BLACK
PEOPLE DON'T MESS WITH WATER

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.484 align:start position:0% line:91%
HALF OF US CAN'T SWIM, YOU KNOW

NO

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.641 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU CAN GET IN A FIST FIGHT
AND IT'S A TIME OUT.

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:53.312 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY SPORT WHERE YOU GET
A TIME OUT!

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:58.384 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALREADY LOSING WITH
BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE WE BEAT OUR

00:01:58.417 --> 00:01:59.185 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SMART ASS.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.301 size:81% position:41% line:91%
DO YOU NEED ME TO DO THAT?
&gt;&gt;NO, I CAN DO MY LACES.

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:18.437 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LAST TIME I HAD SOMEONE TIE
MY LACES I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.541 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOT NECESSARY.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO YOU SEE THAT?

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:24.310 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, SERVICE NOW.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:25.645 align:start position:0% line:85%
THERE YOU GO.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:26.712 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M NERVOUS.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:27.847 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SHOULD BE.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.549 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE LIKE A DEAD MAN WALKING
NOW.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.783 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.954 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME THAT?

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.609 line:91%
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE CHEATING
BECAUSE I'M BEATING YOU AT YOUR

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:57.743 align:start position:0% line:85%
