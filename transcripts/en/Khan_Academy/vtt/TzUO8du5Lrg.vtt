00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.143
- [Voiceover] Hello, Grammarians.

00:00:01.143 --> 00:00:04.347
We are once again learning
how to master time

00:00:04.347 --> 00:00:06.728
and become Time Wizards,

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:07.541
which is, of course,

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.445
what you will be if you master all

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:11.140
the tenses of English.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.718
But, if you want to become
an additional Time Wizard,

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:16.111
if you want to get, I don't know,

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:17.434
a second hat,

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.617
because everyone knows
all wizards wear multiple,

00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:21.961
simultaneous hats.

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:23.755
If you want to wear a second hat on top of

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:25.496
your other Time Wizard hat,

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.486
that's the silliest thing I've ever said,

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:31.054
then you will have to learn
the Prepositions of Time.

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.863
Now here's something weird and cool about

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:36.464
Prepositions of Time is
that once upon a time

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:40.876
all of these were physical prepositions.

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.397
Like "Before" and "After"

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:48.275
just used to mean behind and in front of.

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:52.902
They later took on this
additional connotation of time

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:56.708
just over the course of
English-Speaking history.

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:01.708
People took this literal
meaning of "Before" and "After"

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:05.799
and made it representational.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.253
This moment occurred

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:11.459
in front of this one in time,

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.455
but behind this other one in time.

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:14.384
It's a metaphor.

00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:17.380
We're using space to represent time.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.151
Anyway, I just thought
that was really cool.

00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:21.542
Let's talk about how all of these work.

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:24.632
I'm just going to list
a couple of the most

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:28.370
famous Prepositions of Time
and write an example sentence.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.603
So let's go through these.

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:32.014
"After" and "Before,"
as we've established,

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:35.020
these are time relationships that refer to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.761
something happening after.

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:38.779
So when something is completed,

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:43.779
say, "The bats come out
after the sun goes down."

00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:49.011
And before this occurs
prior to some point in time,

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.924
so it is behind an action.

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:56.431
So you can say, "Can
you take out the garbage

00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:00.495
"before you leave the house?"

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:03.880
"At" is very precise.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.291
When we're talking about
"at" we're talking about

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.776
a single moment in time.

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:11.471
We could say, "The
vampire wakes at 10 p.m."

00:02:13.604 --> 00:02:14.774
There he is

00:02:14.774 --> 00:02:16.329
emerging from his coffin.

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.620
There's the,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.644
oh that's not the sun.

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:20.875
The sun would burn a vampire.

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:23.596
No that's a little clock.

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:28.682
It's got a tail because it's
like a little wacky cat clock.

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:31.962
No, Bat Clock.

00:02:31.962 --> 00:02:32.928
That doesn't have a tail.

00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:35.454
It's got a little stubby tail.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.739
Doop.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.572
Ah, I really want a Bat Clock now.

00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:40.751
Anyway, okay.

00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:45.606
"By," this is a really precise end time,

00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:49.135
but not a very precise beginning time.

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.175
So you could say something like,

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:56.050
"This place had better be
clean by 3 p.m., buddy."

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.112
If you say something like that,

00:02:57.112 --> 00:02:59.260
you're not especially
concerned that the place

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.703
might be clean before three.

00:03:01.703 --> 00:03:03.119
That would be nice,

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.694
but it's only relevant to you that the

00:03:04.694 --> 00:03:06.714
cutoff time is at three o'clock.

00:03:06.714 --> 00:03:08.224
So the end is precise.

00:03:08.224 --> 00:03:09.454
That's the connotation there.

00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:11.839
But the beginning is not.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.750
"For" denotes duration.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.235
How long something has been going on.

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:17.744
So you could say,

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:21.436
"I've been a chef for 40 years."

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:22.086
I haven't,

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:24.810
but that would be cool and difficult.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.368
But you know what,

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:26.180
this is Khan Academy,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.015
you can cook anything.

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:30.704
"In" denotes a bounded duration.

00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:34.382
So it's something that lasts
for a specific amount of time,

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:36.352
like a limited period.

00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:41.352
Okay, so let's just say bounded duration.

00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:45.632
So that covers usage like,

00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:50.632
"In March" or "In the Middle Ages."

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:54.674
Both of those things are like set periods.

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:57.554
March has a beginning and an end.

00:03:57.554 --> 00:04:02.478
The Middle Ages have a
beginning and an end.

00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:06.157
It's a bounded duration.

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:09.980
"On" has a specific connotation.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.384
It's something that
happens on a specific day.

00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:15.287
You could say something like,

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:16.727
"On the 4th of July,

00:04:16.727 --> 00:04:20.953
"many Americans watch fireworks
and eat encaged meats."

00:04:20.953 --> 00:04:24.111
Mind you not everybody eats
hot dogs or likes fireworks,

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:27.872
so I said many not all.

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:32.050
"Since" is kind of like "By"

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.800
except it's more about the precision of

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.399
the start point rather than the end point.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.436
So, precise beginning.

00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:42.253
"Since 1974, our company has made

00:04:42.253 --> 00:04:45.318
"nothing but toasters."

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:49.242
"Until" is also precise,

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:52.719
but it's a precise ending time.

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.947
"You have until midnight
to rescue the Ambassador,

00:04:55.947 --> 00:04:59.636
break the curse and save Prince Wilbur.

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:02.037
All right. So there's
a precise ending there.

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:03.319
You have "until midnight,"

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.408
and then you can't rescue the Ambassador,

00:05:05.408 --> 00:05:07.774
break the curse or save any princes.

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:11.576
But what you can do is learn anything.

00:05:11.576 --> 00:05:14.619
These are some of the most
essential Time Prepositions.

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:15.885
David out.
