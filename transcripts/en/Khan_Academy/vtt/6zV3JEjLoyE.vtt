00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.820
You've probably
heard the word parsec

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.240
before in science fiction
movies or maybe even some things

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.420
dealing with astronomy.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.878
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:13.510
is really just tell you where
the word and the definition

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.770
of the word really come from.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.350
And just to kind of
cut to the chase,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.790
it's just a unit of distance.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.952
It's just about
3.26 light years.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:25.410
But what I want to
do is just think

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.390
about where did this
weird distance come from,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.010
this distance that is
roughly 3.26 light years?

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:40.734
It comes from the distance of
something, probably a star.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:42.400
But let me say
"something" because there

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.180
are no stars exactly
this far away from us.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:01:01.790
The distance of something that
has a parallax angle of one

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.069
arc second.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.910
And the word comes from
the "par" in parallax

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.980
and the "second" in arc seconds.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.660
So it's literally par-- let me
do this in a different color.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.370
It's literally parsec.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.000
You could think of it as kind
of the parallax arc second.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.720
How far would this thing be?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.084
It turns out it's
3.26 light years.

00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:27.500
So we can actually
calculate that.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.791
And that's actually what I'm
going to do in this video.

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.810
So let's say there is something.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.950
So this is the sun.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.520
This is the Earth at
some point in time.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.840
This is the Earth
six months later

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.300
at the opposite
end of the orbit.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.180
And we are looking
at some distance.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.310
We are looking at some
object some distance away.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.230
We know that this distance right
here is one astronomical unit.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.950
And what we want
to do is figure out

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.190
the distance of this object.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.010
And all we know is that it
has parallax angle of one arc

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.510
second.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.840
So let's remind ourselves
what this means.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.380
If we're looking
right at-- remember,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.160
we're looking from
above the solar system.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.190
So the Earth is rotating in
this direction in either case.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.396
And so in this
point in the year--

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:18.520
we don't know when this is.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.470
Depends on what star that is.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.040
At this point in the
year right at sunrise,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.890
right when we first catch the
first glimpses of the sun's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.310
light, if we look
straight up, the angle

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.120
between that object in the
night sky and straight up

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.210
is going to be the
parallax angle.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.350
So this is going to
be one arc second.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.950
And just to make it consistent
with the last few videos

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.950
we did on parallax,
let's just visualize

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.720
how that would look
in the night sky.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.400
So let me draw the
night sky over here.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.670
Let me do that in purple maybe.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.520
Let me draw the
night sky over here.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.440
This is looking straight up.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.530
This is north, south,
west, and east.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.370
And so you can imagine
in this situation,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.840
the sun is just
rising on the east.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.740
Let me make it the
color of the sun.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.410
The sun is just
rising on the east.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.670
And so this will be towards
the direction of the sun.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.939
You can imagine that to some
degree, well, this is north.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.980
North is the top of the
Earth right here, kind of

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.870
pointed towards us
out of the screen.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.830
South is going into the screen.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.710
Hopefully that helps
the visualization.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.085
Or another way to
think about it,

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:36.840
the sun is rising in the east.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.800
This is going to be towards
the direction of the sun,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.920
of a certain angle
from the center.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.870
In this case, it's
on arc second.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.510
So it's going to
be right over here.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.600
So this angle right over here
is going to be one arc second.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.150
And then if we were to
see where that object is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.980
six months later,
it'll be the opposite.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.880
We're going to be looking in
the center of the universe.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.420
Or I should say, the center of
the night sky at that point,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.030
the same direction
of the universe.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.580
The universe actually
has no center.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.267
We've talked about
that many times.

00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:10.350
If we look at the same
direction in the night sky,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.840
we will be looking
six months later.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.850
And instead of it being at
dawn, it will now be at sunset.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.829
We'll be just getting the
last glimpses of the sun.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.960
And so the sun will be
setting in the west.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.280
And so this angle--
this angle right here,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.510
which is also the same
thing as a parallax angle--

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.220
will also be one arc second.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.890
So let's figure out
how far this object is.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.990
What is an actual
parsec in terms

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.480
of astronomical
units or light years?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.840
So if this is one
arc second, this

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.230
is going to be-- and
remember one arc second is

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:01.490
equal to 1/3600 of a degree.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.170
So this angle right over here
is going to be 90 minus 1/3600.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.260
And we just use a little
bit of trigonometry.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:19.100
The tangent of this angle, the
tangent of 90 minus 1/3600,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.310
is going to be this distance
in astronomical units divided

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.850
by 1.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.350
Well, you divide
anything by 1, it's

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.070
just going to be that distance.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.440
So that's the distance
right over there.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.560
So we get our calculator out.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:44.630
And we want to find the tangent
of 90 minus 1 divided by 3,600.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.230
And we will get our distance
in astronomical units, 206,264.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.390
We're going to say 265.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.080
So this distance
over here is going

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.430
to be equal to
206,265-- I'm just

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.670
rounding-- astronomical units.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.970
And if we want to convert
that into light years,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.690
we just divide.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:17.250
So there are 63,115 astronomical
units per light year.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.590
Let me actually write it down.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.660
I don't want to confuse you
with the unit cancellation.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:29.620
So we're dealing with
206,265 astronomical units.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.820
And we want to multiply
that times 1 light year is

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.507
equal to 63,115
astronomical units.

00:06:37.507 --> 00:06:39.715
And we want this in the
numerator and the denominator

00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:41.160
to cancel out.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:50.170
And so if you divide 206,265,
this number up here, by 63,115,

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.530
the number of astronomical
units in a light year--

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.750
let me delete that right
over there-- we get 3.2.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.490
Well, the way the
math worked out here,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.830
it rounded to 3.27 light years.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:10.490
So this is equal to
roughly 3.27 light years.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.880
So I should just show it's
approximate right over there.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.620
But that's where the
parsec comes from.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.240
So hopefully now you just
realize it is just a distance.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.020
But even more, you actually
understand where it comes from.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.580
It's the distance that an object
needs to be from Earth in order

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.571
for it to have a parallax
angle of one arc second.

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:29.070
And that's where
the word came from.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.420
Parallax arc second.
