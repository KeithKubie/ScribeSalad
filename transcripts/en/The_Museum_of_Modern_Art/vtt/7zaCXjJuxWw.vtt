00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:03.436
My name is Patricia Spears Jones.

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:05.936
The poem is “Lave.”

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.743
Where is the lavender,

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.278
the purple scent

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:16.148
that says the world is fresh
and ready to receive

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:19.185
the woman who walks into whatever room

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.253
she walks into.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.756
What room will she enter?

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:27.593
How will the female worker smell?

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.796
Lemon, mint,

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:32.398
roses crushed for homemade soap.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.268
No place
here for the boiling recipe.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.703
There is no room.

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:42.075
And her extra money,
how will she make it?

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.045
Who will she do for?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.916
How will she get there?
Will she find her old friends, her lovers?

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.018
She is lonely.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:56.255
The artist says in Panel 57

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.525
that the female worker
(not Negro,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:00.993
not migrant)

00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:04.998
is the last group to leave the South.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.268
One woman is her own group?

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:13.606
Was she ready to leave or was she
left behind?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.775
Caring for: baby, grandfather

00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:18.678
brother, sister, cousin,

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.413
an elderly aunt?

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:24.050
Was her garden
where the family sought nurture?

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:27.520
Were her skills
at picking cotton so great

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.390
the bosses did
all they could to keep her?

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.123
Was there a fourth child,

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.195
not wished for?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.265
Much about the South
is unseen or not shown—

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.170
the painter understands
the usefulness of obscenity

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.508
lynching, hunger,
the crops failing

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.545
(boll weevil, boll weevil).

00:01:52.113 --> 00:01:55.013
And so we see the cotton ball

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.483
but not the bleeding hands that pick.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.186
We see the rope dangling.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.725
We see the meager rations of meat
and bread.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.261
And the table set—no plenty.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:13.600
Is this the start
of a woman’s true blues?

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:16.568
The men go ahead.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.771
The women stay behind

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.273
and everyone is lonely?

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.980
In many of the painting’s planes,
she is not seen

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:30.483
preparing the meals, cleaning,
sewing, packing clothes

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.653
to last for as long as they can last

00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:38.591
in the distant cities of
Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.361
She is not seen crying
at the preacher’s table

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.326
or burying her head into the broad chest

00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:49.601
of the man
who gets up before sunrise

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:52.771
to make it to the station
ticket in hand.

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:57.343
The men knew the hardships ahead,

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:01.313
others were ignorant
enough to believe the stories of plenty:

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.075
WORK FOOD SHELTER.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:07.853
Women put no truck
in these White men’s promises.

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:09.821
They
wanted out of Dixie

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.626
on a very bad day. Wanted out of stuck.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:16.396
She will leave for the north

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.798
and go to the cities.
She will find

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:23.436
the church where her bible meets
the preacher’s Holy hollering

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.706
and the music sounds as sweet
as in the back-woods.

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:31.645
She will see the kind of dresses
she wanted to make

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.815
from the Butterick patterns
at the notions counter,

00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:38.851
the same counter
where she finds the yellow ribbons

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:43.723
that tie the braids
of the young girl in Painting 21

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:48.428
who arrived early
to get on that North bound train.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:53.200
Is this the start
of another woman’s blues

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.603
to journey north and find the men mired?

00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:59.973
To journey north
and find her skills unknown?

00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:05.278
To journey north
and discover an even greater loneliness?

00:04:07.483 --> 00:04:11.685
The female worker gets that ticket
and joins that motion forward—

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.920
the many shoulders, legs,

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:17.290
hands stretched across
the paintings’ frames

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:19.906
counting
the rails away,

00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:23.063
away, away from Dixie Land.

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:27.433
Head bowed, holding an orange dolly,

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:30.903
the laundress is charged with purgation,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.141
removing the dust
and dirt and stains of city living

00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:40.346
the marks of many sins: sex, drink,

00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:42.048
the opium den.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.918
These swirling oblongs

00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:48.755
colors rest
beneath her gaze

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.585
as if she has the power

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.260
to make this job seem better than

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:56.186
picking cotton or hog butchering

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.631
or taking
in washing for the old gentleman

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:03.303
who pinches her breasts for that extra
nickel.

00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:06.640
Last to arrive north.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:10.008
But first to see the way home,

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.945
to make a home.

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:14.948
Put her skillets on the hot plate;

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280
shelves her mason jars

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.055
full of peach preserves,
pickles, tastes of home.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.891
Chenille spreads on the lumpy mattresses

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:29.495
the Chicago Defender on a kitchen table.

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:33.166
Biscuits rising before sunrise.

00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:37.136
Greens found in an Italian market.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.173
She stands in this painting

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:46.078
a cruciform of desire
in a center of beauty

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.880
dressed in white,

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:50.716
the orange stick,
her cudgel,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.965
her sword,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.321
the laundry
her step on that ladder to the future.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.026
A migrant from the back of the bottom

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:04.898
or a town just big enough
for the railroad to notice

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:09.761
gone to the city
and its bitter possibilities

00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:12.938
so that
church is a hearthstone

00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:17.543
and eau de cologne—
lavender, roses,

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:19.980
vanilla, hints of —

00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:21.915
a necessity.
