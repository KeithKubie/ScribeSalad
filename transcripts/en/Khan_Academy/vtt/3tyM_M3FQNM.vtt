00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:04.240
If the transformation matrix T is equal to

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.423
three zero zero three, choose
which sketch can represent

00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:12.273
this transformation when applied
to the red quadrilateral.

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:13.556
This is fascinating!

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:17.445
They don't give us any coordinates,
save for the vertices of

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:19.877
the quadrilateral, which are
really the most useful points

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:23.620
to use when thinking about
potential transformations.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.176
So let's just make up some
just to see what would happen

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:28.738
to the particular coordinates
that we're looking at.

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:30.036
And I think that will give us enough

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:32.189
information to think about this.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.714
I encourage you to do
it on your own first.

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:35.951
Pause the video.

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:40.753
Come up with some coordinates
for this red quadrilateral.

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:43.246
Then, see what transformation
you get and which of these

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:46.273
seem to be closest to
the one that you got.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.722
Let's just say for the sake of argument

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:53.834
that this point right over here.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:56.401
That right there, you could
say that's the position vector.

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:58.828
I'll represent it as a column vector.

00:00:58.843 --> 00:01:01.471
Let's say this is a square.

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.732
So this is one comma one.

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:09.582
I'll just write that as
a column vector one one.

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:16.395
And let's say this one then
would be one negative one.

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:18.606
One negative one.

00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:23.834
Then, this one over here
could be represented

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:27.267
by the position vector
negative one negative one.

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:28.762
Negative one negative one.

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:31.978
Negative one negative one.

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:35.891
Finally, this point
right over here could be

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:40.259
represented by the position
vector negative one one.

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:42.261
Negative one one.

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.719
So let's see what the
transformation matrix would do

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.802
when it transforms these four points.

00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:47.989
The way I'm gonna think about it,

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:51.001
let me just take our
transformation matrix.

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:55.853
So, three zero zero three.

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:59.134
And I'm gonna multiply it
by a two by four matrix

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.668
that represents all of
these position vectors.

00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:08.765
I'm gonna multiply it by,
we have this point one one.

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:10.229
That's our first point.

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.414
We have the point one negative one.

00:02:12.414 --> 00:02:14.601
One negative one.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.023
We have this point which
is negative one one.

00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:19.872
Negative one one.

00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:23.193
And then we have this point
which negative one negative one.

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:25.974
Negative one negative one.

00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:27.866
These were convenient points to pick since

00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:29.166
they didn't give us the points because

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:32.202
it'll make the math
fairly straightforward.

00:02:32.447 --> 00:02:33.785
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:35.466
We have a two by two.

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.044
Two by two.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.193
Times a two by four.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.314
Matrix multiplication is defined here

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:44.521
cause we have the same number of columns

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.258
as we have rows, right over here.

00:02:47.273 --> 00:02:51.448
This is going to result
in a two by four matrix.

00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:53.660
This is going to give us
another two by four matrix,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.644
which makes sense, cause
we're going to need four

00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:59.516
column vectors here for our
four new transformed points.

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:01.403
Let's figure out what it is.

00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:04.796
The first column vector, right over here.

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:07.509
We can think about this
row and this column.

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:10.436
Or actually, the first
position right over here

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:12.627
the first row, first entry
is this row, this column.

00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:14.103
The second one's going to be

00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:15.986
the second row and the first column.

00:03:16.223 --> 00:03:20.779
So let's see, three times
one plus zero times one.

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:25.309
Well that's three plus zero
so this is going to be three.

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:29.645
Then over here, zero times
one plus three times one

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:32.470
is going to give us three as well.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.300
I think you see already a pattern here.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.917
To get the the x-coordinate for each

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:42.177
of these vectors, we're
involving this row.

00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:46.708
And this row, we really just multiplied

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:48.732
the three times the x-coordinate here

00:03:48.732 --> 00:03:50.453
and then we don't involve the y-coordinate

00:03:50.453 --> 00:03:52.220
because we're multiplying it times zero.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.989
We'll see that over and over again.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.621
So over here you have three times one.

00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:01.352
Three times one plus
zero times negative one.

00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:04.250
So it's just really three
times one, which is three.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.649
Then over here you see
this for the y-coordinate

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.042
each time we're only
involving the y-coordinate

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:12.131
of the point before transformation.

00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.554
You see zero times one is zero.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:17.934
So we're essentially not
thinking about the x-coordinate.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:19.197
And then it's just three times

00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:22.234
negative one, which is negative three.

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:24.441
You see what its doing, it's just scaling

00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:27.133
each of these up by a factor of three.

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:31.914
Three times negative one is negative three

00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:35.080
plus zero times one,
so it's negative three.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.044
Then, it's going to be
zero times negative one

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:39.543
is zero plus three times one is three

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:44.182
and then finally, three
times negative one.

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:45.682
Three times negative one plus

00:04:45.682 --> 00:04:49.187
zero times negative one is negative three.

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:50.997
And zero times negative one plus

00:04:50.997 --> 00:04:54.156
three times negative one
is negative three again.

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.988
So what's going to happen to it?

00:04:55.988 --> 00:04:57.735
Well, each of these
coordinates essentially

00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:02.738
get pushed out by a factor of three.

00:05:02.738 --> 00:05:05.578
Actually this one seems to be the closest

00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:06.814
to the one we're thinking about.

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:07.742
How do I know that?

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:08.987
Well look at this.

00:05:08.987 --> 00:05:13.679
This is the point one
comma one right over there.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.339
One comma one.

00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:17.747
It gets mapped to the
point three comma three.

00:05:17.762 --> 00:05:20.250
So, one two three.

00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:22.011
One two three.

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:24.201
This is three comma
three right over there.

00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:27.543
This got mapped to that and
we see it with each of them.

00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:29.245
One negative one.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.305
One negative one gets mapped
to three negative three.

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:36.946
Then, we have negative one one.

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:38.807
Negative one one.

00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:43.990
Negative one one is getting
mapped to negative three three.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.100
Finally, of course,
negative one negative one.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.615
Negative one negative one gets mapped

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.605
to negative three negative three.

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:54.778
It's definitely the second.

00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:58.166
The second diagram is the one that

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:03.865
represents the transformation matrix T

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:07.435
being applied to the red quadrilateral.
