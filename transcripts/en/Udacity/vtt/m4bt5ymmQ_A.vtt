00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, the best answer is that we should aim slightly higher.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That seems pretty intuitive.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If I'm trying to throw a ball to my friend who's far away,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't throw horizontally.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I throw slightly into the air.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, the question is how much higher do we aim?

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
As we always want to do in physics, let's quantify.
