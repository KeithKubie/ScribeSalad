00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And here's my implementation for the cancerous case.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You don't have to plug in the measurement probability to see a negative test result,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is one minus the sensitivity and in the normalizer,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we copy the first term over in the second term of the noncancer hypothesize.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we just put in the specificity and when you put this all together and run the procedure,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we indeed get 0.013698 and so on.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's the number I gave you for the first example.
