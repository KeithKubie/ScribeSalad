00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Go!

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.550
My girls and I have had a great time making

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.360
and racing these cars. In a moment show you how to make a basic one.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
One of the things I love about these cars
is they work just like a rocket.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.900
The air comes out the back and it pushes
the vehicle forwards.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.510
Lots of things work like that. When a
bird flaps its wings,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.150
what the bird is doing is pushing down
on the air, and that makes the bird lift up.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.100
Now, you can't fly because you're too heavy,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.220
and, you know, you don't have wings! But you might be able to swim.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.739
If you swim, and go into the water, if you
do the breast stroke, when you push backwards

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.410
on the water

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.000
that makes you go forwards. It's just the
same as for the rocket when hot gases

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.280
come out the bottom of the rocket they push it upwards.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.080
With the balloon racer, the air in the
balloon goes through the straw and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.100
is shooting out backwards.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.500
That pushes the whole balloon and
the car in the opposite direction,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
which is forwards.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.761
Crash!

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:37.441
So what you do, is blow through the straw...

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.420
...and then, what do you think is going to happen when I let go?
It'll move!

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.340
Which direction? That way!

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.840
Making and racing balloon cars

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.540
is a great way to get children thinking like scientists and engineers. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.060
Handling the different bits

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.759
and pieces used to make the cars gives
children an opportunity to think about

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.220
the properties of materials.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.259
Trying to make the cars go faster or
further

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.830
challenges them to solve problems and think how changing one thing

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.060
affects another. 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.140
This is your basic model balloon car

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.180
and it's really easy to make. I've got everything I need in front of me here.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.760
Two straws, which are going to be my axles,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.160
and this piece of cardboard is going to be my base.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.940
The first thing I do is Sellotape my axles to the base of my vehicle.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.459
Tape that on there,

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.559
and another bit of tape here.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.820
That's my axles on the bottom of my cardboard. Now I need to affix my wheels.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.920
I'm using these wooden kebab skewers - you can see that I've trimmed the length down. 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.100
For the wheels I'm using these green
milk bottle lids.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.370
The really good thing about these lids is these skewers go through them really easily

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.410
and they also seal on it as well.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.769
They stick well. That's one,

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.500
And make hole in the other one,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.799
and push it through.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.130
And put that one on there, and push that through the straw,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.790
and there's my other wheel.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.160
There you go, there's one.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.100
For the other one, exactly the same. So there's my vehicle, and as you can see,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.410
it rolls backwards and forwards. Now I've got to put the engine on!

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.720
What I'm using is this balloon, and a straw.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.340
The good thing about this straw is it's bendy, so I can tilt it up.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.530
What I'm going to do is connect the balloon to my straw with a bit of masking tape.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.699
Put the straw in, and now

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.190
I have to tape my engine to my
vehicle. You have to do it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.320
so that you've got the end of your pipe
hanging over the end of your car.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.079
I'll tape it on with a bit of masking tape.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.979
One, and two.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.200
There we go. Now all I've got to do is start the engine!

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:11.579
Three, two, one...

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.660
I knew it! Bash! Who's went further?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.350
Me! And which one went faster? Mine!

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.650
Are you sure? Yes! Do you think we should have a race and see? Yes!

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.930
Three, two, one, go!

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.559
Mine went fastest! Mine went slower second time. Do you think it was faster the other time?

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:07.999
Yes, definitely faster! Shall we try it again, best of three?
