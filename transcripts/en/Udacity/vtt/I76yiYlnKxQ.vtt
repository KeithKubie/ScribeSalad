00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.256
We are now ready for
the climatic big theorem of this lesson.

00:00:03.256 --> 00:00:06.360
The Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.126
It's states that
the following are equivalent,

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:13.002
f is a maximum flow in a flow network G.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:17.094
The residual graph Gf
has no augmenting paths.

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:21.663
And there exists an s-t cut (A,B) such
that the value of the flow is equal to

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:23.730
the value of the cut.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.273
This is the realization of
the strategy outlined earlier

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:30.518
where we're going to introduce
the notion of a cut,

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:33.761
show that it served as an upper
bound on the flow, and

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:38.520
then show that Ford-Fulkerson produced
a flow with the same value as a cut.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.566
So as an immediate corollary,

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:45.980
we have then that the Ford-Fulkerson
approach returns a maximum flow.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.710
Let's see a proof of the theorem.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.670
We start by showing that if
f is a maximum flow in G,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.890
then the residual graph
has no augmenting paths.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.430
Well, suppose not.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.820
And let f' be an augmenting flow.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.390
Then, we can augment f by f', and
as we've argued this will be a flow.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.810
And the value of the flow will be
the sum of the values of the individual

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
flows, which must be strictly
greater than the value of f.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.120
But we assumed it was a maximum,
so that creates a contradiction.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.920
Next, we show that the fact that the
residual network has no augmenting path

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.500
implies that there is a s-t cut

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.520
who's capacity is the same
as the value of the flow.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.430
This is the real heart of the theorem.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.170
We let A be the set of
vertices we can reach from S.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.100
In the residual graph Gf and
we let B be the complement to that.
