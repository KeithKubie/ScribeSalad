gauge aluminum wire that I then covered

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190
gauge aluminum wire that I then covered
 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.000
gauge aluminum wire that I then covered
with a thin aluminum tubing to give it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010
with a thin aluminum tubing to give it
 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.880
with a thin aluminum tubing to give it
sort of you can keep the shape but it

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890
sort of you can keep the shape but it
 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.790
sort of you can keep the shape but it
still bends just jointed the way it

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800

yeah I'll get little things like the tie
 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.100
yeah I'll get little things like the tie
is actually duct tape to that I painted

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110
is actually duct tape to that I painted
 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.950
is actually duct tape to that I painted
red and there's a wire in it so that I

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960
red and there's a wire in it so that I
 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.540
red and there's a wire in it so that I
could animate the tie too but that's

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550
could animate the tie too but that's
 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.700
could animate the tie too but that's
basically it I'll show you a little

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710
basically it I'll show you a little
 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.060

what it looks like before I covered it
up

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260
up
 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.790
up
but the heads themselves I sculpted with

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800
but the heads themselves I sculpted with
 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.000

white sculpey just the Skokie original
 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.320
white sculpey just the Skokie original
basically and I kept the original shape

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
basically and I kept the original shape
 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.990
basically and I kept the original shape
once I I wanted the original color once

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000
once I I wanted the original color once
 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.450

that sort of almost bone kind of color
 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.370
that sort of almost bone kind of color
used a really thin mixture of paint and

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380
used a really thin mixture of paint and
 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.010
used a really thin mixture of paint and
ink to get the details kind of

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020
ink to get the details kind of
 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.750

the fingers are made out of like a thin
 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.480
the fingers are made out of like a thin
copper wire essentially does you can get

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490
copper wire essentially does you can get
 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.630
copper wire essentially does you can get
it any hardware or half as well but yeah

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640
it any hardware or half as well but yeah
 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.360
it any hardware or half as well but yeah
this is just like a plumber's putty or

the screw so the puppet has to be able

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.140
the screw so the puppet has to be able
 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.220
the screw so the puppet has to be able
to hold its entire weight for a lot of

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.230
to hold its entire weight for a lot of
 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.340

filming on just one foot a lot of times

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.350
filming on just one foot a lot of times
 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.980
filming on just one foot a lot of times
especially if it's making a a step or a

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990
especially if it's making a a step or a
 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.140
especially if it's making a a step or a
leap or something so you have to make

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150
leap or something so you have to make
 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.460
leap or something so you have to make
sure that you keep the weight of your

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.470
sure that you keep the weight of your
 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.820
sure that you keep the weight of your
puppet pretty low that's why I use

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830
puppet pretty low that's why I use
 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.220
puppet pretty low that's why I use

from demo reel and found the the

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.180
from demo reel and found the the
 

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.320
from demo reel and found the the
yellowest bits of fabric and cut it out

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.330
yellowest bits of fabric and cut it out
 

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.750
yellowest bits of fabric and cut it out
and essentially just glued it to the

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760
and essentially just glued it to the
 

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.219
and essentially just glued it to the
falls so so that's how that was made the

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:37.229
falls so so that's how that was made the
 

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:39.589
falls so so that's how that was made the
difference kind of with this puppet as

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599
difference kind of with this puppet as
 

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.719
difference kind of with this puppet as
opposed to the Jack puppet the Jack when

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:41.729
opposed to the Jack puppet the Jack when
 

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:44.810
opposed to the Jack puppet the Jack when
I made our dog I should say the dogs

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820
I made our dog I should say the dogs
 

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.480
I made our dog I should say the dogs
going to it was made with several

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.490
going to it was made with several
 

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.920
going to it was made with several
replacement heads with different

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:48.930
replacement heads with different
 

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.380
replacement heads with different
expressions this one because he was

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:51.390
expressions this one because he was
 

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.960
expressions this one because he was
basically I wanted to pop out and he

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:53.970
basically I wanted to pop out and he
 

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.310
basically I wanted to pop out and he
does the laughs I wanted to animate that

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320
does the laughs I wanted to animate that
 

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:04.730
does the laughs I wanted to animate that
so how I made this one as I sculpted the

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740
so how I made this one as I sculpted the
 

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:11.830
so how I made this one as I sculpted the
face out of sculpey and made a mold and

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:11.840
face out of sculpey and made a mold and
 

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.170
face out of sculpey and made a mold and
pour the mold for the kwid latex in the

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180
pour the mold for the kwid latex in the
 

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.210
pour the mold for the kwid latex in the
mold and peel it off and basically got a

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220
mold and peel it off and basically got a
 

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.210
mold and peel it off and basically got a
mask and just put the mask over a scout

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220
mask and just put the mask over a scout
 

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.190
mask and just put the mask over a scout
like a basically a head that I had

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200
like a basically a head that I had
 

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.260
like a basically a head that I had
sculpted to keep the retain the shape

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:24.270
sculpted to keep the retain the shape
 

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.250
sculpted to keep the retain the shape
and then underneath the jaw just cut it

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260
and then underneath the jaw just cut it
 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.130
and then underneath the jaw just cut it
in half and the jaw is just a piece of

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.140
in half and the jaw is just a piece of
 

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.450
in half and the jaw is just a piece of
sculpted epoxy with some wire so that I

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:35.460
sculpted epoxy with some wire so that I
 

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.660
sculpted epoxy with some wire so that I
could open the mouth and close the mouth

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:38.670
could open the mouth and close the mouth
 

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.400
could open the mouth and close the mouth
and an animated you know frame by frame

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.410
and an animated you know frame by frame
 

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.700
and an animated you know frame by frame
so yeah that's about I add a little

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:46.710
so yeah that's about I add a little
 

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.340
so yeah that's about I add a little
mount here in case the the face broke or

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.350
mount here in case the the face broke or
 

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.050
mount here in case the the face broke or
something like that and I didn't want to

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060
something like that and I didn't want to
 

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.390
something like that and I didn't want to
remake an entire puppet so I just made a

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:56.400
remake an entire puppet so I just made a
 

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.300
remake an entire puppet so I just made a
little knot so I could pop the head back

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310
little knot so I could pop the head back
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.630
little knot so I could pop the head back
on and if I needed to change the face I

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640
on and if I needed to change the face I
 

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.340
on and if I needed to change the face I
could but it's still fully articulate he

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:04.350
could but it's still fully articulate he
 

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.890
could but it's still fully articulate he
turns his head and up and down and all

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:06.900
turns his head and up and down and all
 

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.780
turns his head and up and down and all
that jazz and mouth so pretty cool now

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:11.790
that jazz and mouth so pretty cool now
 

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.070
that jazz and mouth so pretty cool now
initially I thought I was gonna have to

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080
initially I thought I was gonna have to
 

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.200
initially I thought I was gonna have to
do the entire thing green-screen

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.210
do the entire thing green-screen
 

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.390
do the entire thing green-screen

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:20.400
so Barney and Rob Walker actually they
 

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.280
so Barney and Rob Walker actually they
built that set that you see with the

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:22.290

trees and stuff like that and I had some
 

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.760
trees and stuff like that and I had some
cardboard tubing so what Barney did was

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:31.770
cardboard tubing so what Barney did was
 

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.770
cardboard tubing so what Barney did was
he took the cardboard tubing and cut it

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:33.780
he took the cardboard tubing and cut it
 

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.220
he took the cardboard tubing and cut it
up and covered it with the stuff called

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:37.230
up and covered it with the stuff called
 

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.680
up and covered it with the stuff called
Durham's rock-hard putty and he was

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:39.690
Durham's rock-hard putty and he was
 

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.470
Durham's rock-hard putty and he was
covered they basically just one half

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480
covered they basically just one half
 

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.670
covered they basically just one half
because we weren't gonna see if we get

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680
because we weren't gonna see if we get

Doug Skellington walk sequence when he's

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:38.690
Doug Skellington walk sequence when he's
 

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.400
Doug Skellington walk sequence when he's
watching the forest looking around I

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.410
watching the forest looking around I
 

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.020

that was super long or a friend to walk

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.300
that was super long or a friend to walk
 

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.760
that was super long or a friend to walk
through it I thought it'd be easier if I

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:48.770
through it I thought it'd be easier if I
 

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.040
through it I thought it'd be easier if I
just showed all green screen and put it

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.050
just showed all green screen and put it
 

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.630
just showed all green screen and put it
in the background and then I could shoot

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:52.640
in the background and then I could shoot
 

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.090
in the background and then I could shoot
him stationary and just move him as if

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.100
