bird snap will be an iPhone app in the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
bird snap will be an iPhone app in the
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.140
bird snap will be an iPhone app in the
App Store and it also is a site bird

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
App Store and it also is a site bird
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.480
App Store and it also is a site bird
snap comm and so if you go to that site

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
snap comm and so if you go to that site
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.269
snap comm and so if you go to that site
what you'll see is you'll see 500 of the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
what you'll see is you'll see 500 of the
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.210
what you'll see is you'll see 500 of the
most common North American bird species

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220
most common North American bird species
 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
most common North American bird species
accompanied with the bird songs and then

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
accompanied with the bird songs and then
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.099
accompanied with the bird songs and then
pictures of the birds out in in wild

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
pictures of the birds out in in wild
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.839
pictures of the birds out in in wild
it's a really exciting time to be

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
it's a really exciting time to be
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.060
it's a really exciting time to be

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
working in computer vision and machine
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.410
working in computer vision and machine
learning and one of the things that's

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
learning and one of the things that's
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330
learning and one of the things that's
changed since when I sort of started

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
changed since when I sort of started
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.450

working in this area is the explosion in

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
working in this area is the explosion in
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700
working in this area is the explosion in
images so there are just so many photos

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
images so there are just so many photos
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.100
images so there are just so many photos
that people are taking that there's this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
that people are taking that there's this
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660
that people are taking that there's this
real need to kind of figure out

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
real need to kind of figure out
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130
real need to kind of figure out
automatically what's happening within

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
automatically what's happening within
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990
automatically what's happening within
those photos so you can do things like

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000
those photos so you can do things like
 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910
those photos so you can do things like
search through photo collections or

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
search through photo collections or
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.189
search through photo collections or
organize photo collections or kind of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
organize photo collections or kind of
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380
organize photo collections or kind of
figure out what's there what it is that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
figure out what's there what it is that
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.490
figure out what's there what it is that
you're looking at and that's sort of the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
you're looking at and that's sort of the
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260
you're looking at and that's sort of the
some of the stuff that we do for Leisha

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
some of the stuff that we do for Leisha
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.260
some of the stuff that we do for Leisha
happen and bird snap so when we start

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
happen and bird snap so when we start
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060
happen and bird snap so when we start
designing the bird snap app we wanted to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
designing the bird snap app we wanted to
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.039
designing the bird snap app we wanted to
do something that we thought was very

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
do something that we thought was very
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660
do something that we thought was very
different from what had been done before

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
different from what had been done before
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820
different from what had been done before
we wanted to see whether or not we could

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
we wanted to see whether or not we could
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370
we wanted to see whether or not we could
use computer vision and machine learning

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
use computer vision and machine learning
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.190
use computer vision and machine learning
technology to automatically generate a

technology to automatically generate a
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830
technology to automatically generate a
field guide so in other words field guys

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
field guide so in other words field guys
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.660
field guide so in other words field guys
are usually constructed by hand where

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
are usually constructed by hand where
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730
are usually constructed by hand where
people go in and they write all the text

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
people go in and they write all the text
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.630
people go in and they write all the text
and they decide how they're going to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
and they decide how they're going to
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.690
and they decide how they're going to
layout the pages and they decide on sort

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
layout the pages and they decide on sort
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.039
layout the pages and they decide on sort
of what order the species are going to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
of what order the species are going to
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590
of what order the species are going to
be shown in and what we wanted to do is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
be shown in and what we wanted to do is
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569
be shown in and what we wanted to do is
to see whether or not we could use this

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
to see whether or not we could use this
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.390
to see whether or not we could use this
technology to automatically lay this out

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
technology to automatically lay this out
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340
technology to automatically lay this out
in such a way that we could almost teach

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
in such a way that we could almost teach
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170
in such a way that we could almost teach
people how to recognize different

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
people how to recognize different
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.020
people how to recognize different
species of birds so to do visual

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
species of birds so to do visual
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
the website you you take a picture when
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.190
the website you you take a picture when
you're using the app you would take the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
you're using the app you would take the
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.660
you're using the app you would take the
picture directly with your phone or if

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
picture directly with your phone or if
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.289
picture directly with your phone or if
you're using the website you may have a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
you're using the website you may have a
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.260
you're using the website you may have a
nice camera and you've taken the picture

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
nice camera and you've taken the picture
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.429
nice camera and you've taken the picture
and you've downloaded it to your

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
and you've downloaded it to your
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.789
and you've downloaded it to your
computer but in either case the image is

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
computer but in either case the image is
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.219
computer but in either case the image is
uploaded to our servers and we also ask

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
uploaded to our servers and we also ask
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.090
uploaded to our servers and we also ask
the user to either tap or click on the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
the user to either tap or click on the
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.300
the user to either tap or click on the
head and the tail of the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310
head and the tail of the
 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.530
head and the tail of the
and then our algorithms find all the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540
and then our algorithms find all the
 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.210
and then our algorithms find all the
different parts of the bird the beak the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220
different parts of the bird the beak the
 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.350
different parts of the bird the beak the
eye the wings the the legs the tail and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360
eye the wings the the legs the tail and
 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.420
eye the wings the the legs the tail and
extract features from those different

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430
extract features from those different
 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.970
extract features from those different
parts of the bird that then the machine

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
parts of the bird that then the machine
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.920
parts of the bird that then the machine
learning algorithm is used to recognize

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930
learning algorithm is used to recognize
 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.200
learning algorithm is used to recognize
the species so the first thing is that

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210
the species so the first thing is that
 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.830
the species so the first thing is that
is that we automatically figure out

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840
is that we automatically figure out
 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.410
is that we automatically figure out
visually similar species so that the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420
visually similar species so that the
 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.110
visually similar species so that the
user can kind of nail down what species

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
user can kind of nail down what species
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.330
user can kind of nail down what species
they're looking at the second thing that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340
they're looking at the second thing that
 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.750
they're looking at the second thing that
we do is we give in visually similar

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760
we do is we give in visually similar
 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.740
we do is we give in visually similar
species we can show automatically where

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
species we can show automatically where
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.050
species we can show automatically where
they should look on the bird to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
they should look on the bird to
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.480
they should look on the bird to
differentiate them so if one bird has a

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490
differentiate them so if one bird has a
 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.010
differentiate them so if one bird has a
yellow beak and the other has a black

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020
yellow beak and the other has a black
 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.200
yellow beak and the other has a black
beak we'll highlight that and this is

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210
beak we'll highlight that and this is
 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.790
beak we'll highlight that and this is
done fully automatically there's there's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800
done fully automatically there's there's
 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.670
done fully automatically there's there's
no user in the loop right our algorithms

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
no user in the loop right our algorithms
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.650
no user in the loop right our algorithms
figure this out automatically and then

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
figure this out automatically and then
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.050
figure this out automatically and then
the third thing that we do as part of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060
the third thing that we do as part of
 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.160
the third thing that we do as part of
the visual recognition is we analyze

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170
the visual recognition is we analyze
 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.320
the visual recognition is we analyze
sightings data to figure out what the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
sightings data to figure out what the
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.380
sightings data to figure out what the
likelihood is that a particular species

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
likelihood is that a particular species
 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.290
likelihood is that a particular species
is at a place in the United States on a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300
is at a place in the United States on a
 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.140
is at a place in the United States on a
particular date and we use this to

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150
particular date and we use this to
 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.210
particular date and we use this to
better the recognition algorithms so for

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220
better the recognition algorithms so for
 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.729
better the recognition algorithms so for
instance we know what all the bird

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739
instance we know what all the bird
 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.580
instance we know what all the bird
species are in New York today and we

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590
species are in New York today and we
 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.860
species are in New York today and we
know what all the bird species will be

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
know what all the bird species will be
 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.729
know what all the bird species will be
in say San Francisco in December next

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739
in say San Francisco in December next
 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.390
in say San Francisco in December next
year here's the birds neck website and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400
year here's the birds neck website and
 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.370
year here's the birds neck website and
in terms of being location aware right

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
in terms of being location aware right
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.259
in terms of being location aware right
now it's it's showing all the birds of

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269
now it's it's showing all the birds of
 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.180
now it's it's showing all the birds of
the United States so this is the full

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190
the United States so this is the full
 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.750
the United States so this is the full
set of 500 birds around a wheel here you

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
set of 500 birds around a wheel here you
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.729
set of 500 birds around a wheel here you
can you can scroll through them and look

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739
can you can scroll through them and look
 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.870
can you can scroll through them and look
at their images and actually

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880
 
 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.980
 
you can also hear them it's sort of the
