00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.535
All right, here's the question:

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.670
does modern-day Georgetown
University have a responsibility

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:06.606
to take care of the descendants
of the slaves

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.342
whose sale essentially
saved it from going under?

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.077
A lot of thorny issues here,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.679
so let's talk to our resident
black egghead, Felonious Monk.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.049
(cheering, applause)

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.817
-Felonious, welcome to the show.
-Thanks. Thanks.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.353
All right.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.256
I want to try to talk this out,
Felonious, so...

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.258
should Georgetown do something

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.827
for the great-great-great-
grandchildren of these slaves?

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.130 line:0%
Well, Brother Larry, when one--
be it institution

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.498 line:0%
or singular corporus--

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.234 line:0%
partake in the odious
reprobation that is tenancy

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.803 line:0%
over another's very anima,

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:40.640 line:0%
an ovule is sown in Gaia's
breast that burgeons not only

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:44.010 line:0%
in the immediate, but for
an unknowable epoch thereafter.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.348
Right, right, right, right.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.350
Right, okay, so you're saying

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:54.921
we're still feeling
slavery's effects today.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.890
Be you a parrot?

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.760
That is what I just said.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.128
Oh, I know, totally.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.464
I'm just clearing it up
for the audience, man, you know.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.532
They might have...
I get it, I get it. Okay.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.068
But, okay, but what about
the fact that<i> The New York Times</i>

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:11.504
says, uh, Georgetown
should set up scholarships

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.706
for the descendants
of all these slaves?

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.342
Well, if Georgetown's
halls of academe found salvation

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.411
in the traffickment of their
fellows in the brotherhood

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.446
of man, then there be
a blot upon

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.248
each certificate
endowed therein.

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.884
And until amendment is made,

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.387
no esteem can be lent
to its conferment.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.794
Okay, okay. So...
Oh, so you're saying

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:35.995
some form of repar...

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.330
-Ah, ah, ah.
-Uh...

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.500
That vocable remains
unuttered in our colloquy.

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.170
Right, colloquy.

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.072
Uh, sorry about that.
My bad.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.474
Uh, but-but, I mean,
still, this seems like

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:49.709
a clear-cut case where repara...

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.611
And yet...

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.247
you recapitulate with that word.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.849
Your unceasing constancy
would be risible

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.887
if it weren't so temerarious.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.856
I'm just trying to say
"reparations."

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:09.262
One must be disposed
for ferment and tumult

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.031
when the notion finds itself
conjected aloud.

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:15.168
Wait, you just don't
want me to say "reparations"

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.637
because it
freaks people out, right?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.939
I plaintively beg
that you preclude

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:21.874
further use of the R word,
Brother Larry.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.110
WILMORE:
Sorry, sorry.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:27.046
When one invokes compulsory
fiduciary redress

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.649
using that appellation,
the anglo-hominidae

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.251
feels awakened
within the primal,

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.253
ominous presentiment.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:36.622
Are you saying
white people get scared?

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.058
Yo...

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.594
Yo, white people
flip the (bleep) out

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.963
if you say "reparations". 

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.432
-(cheering, applause)
-Uh... Uh... Uh, Broth...

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:50.102
Hey. Now I... I understand
that. I understand that.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:51.571
Okay. Okay, so, all right,

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.472
so, if we're not calling them
"reparations," then what?

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:54.574
What do we...

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.009
Uh... I propose
an idiom of equal meaning

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.979
possessing of less enmity
in its associations.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.148
Something akin to...

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:03.749
"compaymensement."

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.319
Yes, Georgetown should pay
a hefty compaymensement

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.688
to every descendant it can.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.691
Compaymense... Wh-Wh... But why
don't we just say "reparations"?

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.559
You just made up
a fancy-sounding word

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:15.561
to distract from what
you're actually saying.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:19.365
Uh, yeah, Larry.
That's kind of my whole deal.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.531
Right. Felonious Munk, everyone!
