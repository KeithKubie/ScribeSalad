00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.509
With a shared movie universe potentially hanging
on every key moment, scene, or battle, Marvel's

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:18.340
movie superheroes are fine-tuned and polished
by dozens of talented artists and producers.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.786
Fans would be surprised to see just how different
- not necessarily better, or worse - the movies

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:28.850
could have been if they had stuck with their
original endings.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:40.140
Here are Screen Rant's Secret Marvel Movie
Endings You Didn't Know About.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.989
Iron Man 2
The movie may not have been as big a critical

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.379
hit as the original, but the final showdown
didn't disappoint, with Iron Man and War Machine

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.600
tearing through an army of drones, before
battling Whiplash in his own massive armor.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.539
But the movie almost ended with just a fraction
of that energy.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.199
Originally, Whiplash just took Pepper Potts
hostage, with Tony counting on his friend

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.480
Rhodey to blast the villain to pieces.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.899
Pretty anticlimactic, if you ask us.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.160
Ant-Man
You almost couldn't tell that the movie was

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.130
created and shaped by different writers and
directors, but there are a few dangling plot

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.500
threads - and one is bigger than the others.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.150
When the final fight kicks off, HYDRA Agent
Mitch Carson snags to Yellowjacket tech, and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.220
makes a break for it... never to be seen from
again.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.550
The villain's fate, just like the Ten Ring
nods in deleted scenes, was going to be explored.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.770
But a mid-credits stinger wasn't possible,
with Marvel inserting a scene from Civil War,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.700
instead.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.790
Iron Man 3
The big twist of the movie, that the evil

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:44.650
terrorist mastermind The Mandarin was just
an act, got a mixed reaction from fans.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.180
The critics of Ben Kingsley's 'Trevor Slattery'
would have loved the original ending, which

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.730
saw him inject a bit of the Extremis formula
before being blown to pieces in the reaction.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.840
But fans got more of a compromise than they
knew.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.280
When Aldrich Killian reveals that HE was the
true Mandarin, it's actually a re-write.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.970
He originally never spoke the line, which
would have left the Mandarin as a completely

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.610
made up character, not an alternate title.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.220
X-Men: The Last Stand
Most fans are happy to just forget the third

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.599
entry in the X-Men movie series, but its closing
scenes actually did help end the instalment

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.639
on a happier note.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:27.599
Not only does Rogue return to the Xavier School
- with her powers returned - 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.049
but the school itself welcomes more mutant
children than ever before - meaning a whole

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.590
new crop of X-Men to choose from.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.340
Thor
The god of thunder had no choice but to destroy

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.569
the Bifrost to save the day, which meant he
couldn't return to Earth, or his new girlfriend.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.499
The original ending actually seemed to hint
at a solution, with Jane Foster developing

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.629
a beacon to help Thor find his way back.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.550
Not to mention Dr. Erik Selvig dropping a
reference to S.W.O.R.D., another division

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.469
of the ultra covert S.H.I.E.L.D. agency.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.120
The Avengers: Age of Ultron
Marvel's hero team made sure to save each

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.319
and every innocent bystander from Ultron's
attack, guaranteeing Marvel wouldn't get slammed

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.379
with the same criticism over collateral damage
that Man of Steel had to deal with.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.030
But one Avengers didn't make it out alive:
Quicksilver.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.620
But that wasn't always the case.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.379
Fans of the speedster may be happier, or more
disappointed to hear that Joss Whedon originally

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.250
planned to have him return safe and sound
in the final shot of Cap's New Avengers.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.889
But deciding that it undercut the actual cost
of the story, decided against it.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.390
The Wolverine
It's hard to believe: over a decade and a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.029
half of Wolverine appearing as Fox's biggest
superhero star, and he still hasn't worn anything

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.159
close to his iconic comic costume.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.620
We couldn't leave the scene that solved that
problem off our list, since the hero's second

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.779
solo movie was going to end with Logan receiving
the yellow mask and suit as a gift.

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:49.219
For some reason, the scene was cut, leaving
fans to wonder if Wolverine's next movie role

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.409
will finally deliver - just as they always
have.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.290
The Amazing Spider-Man 2
The first Spider-Man reboot earned some enemies

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.560
when it promised to tell "the untold story"
of Peter Parker's origins, and then didn't

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560
in any real way.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.340
But the sequel actually planned to double
down on dividing fans, with Peter's father

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.299
returning from the dead, having spent Peter's
life in hiding, not in a grave.

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.180
It was a massive change to the hero's nature,
but with the scene deleted and the movie leading

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.329
to a brand new reboot, it's probably better
off left on the cutting room floor.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.910
The Amazing Spider-Man 2
Since the movie's final act was dominated

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.160
by the death of Gwen Stacy, fans probably
forgot that Peter's actual fight with the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.130
villain, Green Goblin, was pretty anti-climactic.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.810
Goblin is knocked unconscious, and that's
that.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.670
In the original version, Gwen's death was
met with maniacal laughter from the villain,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.630
sending Peter into a rage, beating his former
friend to within inches of his life.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.190
It was probably seen as a little too dark
for the film, and cut out completely.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.400
Guardians of the Galaxy
The tears were flowing when Peter Quill read

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.120
his mother's final letter, but the actual
ending of Guardians of the Galaxy kept the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.750
sadness going even longer.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.950
Aside from confirming that the villain Nebula
was alive and angry, the final scene returned

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.090
to Earth, showing Peter's grandfather from
the start of the movie looking to the stars.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.170
He apparently saw Peter get abducted into
space, and was waiting, hoping he would eventually

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.410
return as a grown man.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.720
Director James Gunn admitted it was beautiful,
but too sad a note to end the story on.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.820
Those are the alternate endings and original
conclusions to some of Marvel's biggest movies,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.350
but which ones are your favorite?
