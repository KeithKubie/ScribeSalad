[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:10.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.770
KIM CAMERON: Thank
you for coming.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.120
I'm impressed and
flattered that you'd

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.820
come, number one, to hear me.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.860
And number two, I
mentioned to Mark earlier,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.484
the world would come to a
screeching halt without Google.

00:00:23.484 --> 00:00:24.900
I'm just pretty
convinced of that.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.170
We are all so dependent
now on Google.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.080
So it's actually pretty
much of an honor to be here,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.111
to talk to you.

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:35.610
What I want to do is talk to
you a little bit about the work

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.170
we're doing at the university.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.840
And we have a
research center there.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.880
And I want to
share with you some

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.240
of what I think is
important for organizations,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.600
for leaders, and maybe
for parents, and friends,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.980
and colleagues, even.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.970
That is, I want to talk
to you about the power of

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.410
and the importance of positive
leadership, positive practices,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.080
positive dynamics,
for individuals

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.550
and for organizations.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.990
So I want to have you think
about a line across this slide

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.750
as representing a
deviance continuum.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.990
Now, in English,
the word "deviance"

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.610
has a negative connotation.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.382
So normally deviance
means you're in trouble.

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:22.590
You're doing something wrong.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.710
If I call you a deviant,
normally a criticism.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.690
But deviance just
means an aberration

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.560
from the norm, unexpected,
not normal behavior.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.350
So there are
several implications

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.460
of thinking of deviance
on a continuum.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.190
So you can think of
negative deviance,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.690
but you can also think
of positive deviance.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.700
Several implications,
one of which is,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840
all organizations exist
to eliminate deviance.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.060
The reason we organize
is to eliminate

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.950
unexpected, aberrant,
not normal behavior.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.960
So Mark stands up,
everybody stops talking,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960
everybody looks forward.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.840
We organize,
otherwise it's chaos.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.040
We can't get anything done.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.230
So all organizations
aspire, by definition,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.900
toward the middle
of that continuum.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.640
That is, we don't want deviance,
unexpected, aberrant behavior.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.480
So for the most part,
organizations, or organizing,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.650
puts us in the middle.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.080
Another important
implication is,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.540
we know a lot more about
one end of this continuum

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.200
than the other.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.490
So for example, think
of physical health.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.370
On the left hand side,
we call that illness.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.210
I got the flu.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.130
I got diabetes.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.310
I got heart disease.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.480
90% of all medical
research focuses

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.410
on the gap between the left
hand side and the middle.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.910
Right?

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.170
If I'm sick, if I'm ill,
if I'm having difficulty,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.250
I will get studied.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.710
There will be pharmaceutical
products produced for me.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.320
People will do all
kinds of tests.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.500
As soon as I'm healthy, I
mean, I get a physical exam

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.230
once in a while.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.840
But for the most
part, medical science

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.482
doesn't pay much
attention to me.

00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:02.190
So we know a lot more
about the left hand

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.710
side than the right hand side.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.580
Another important implication
is that hardly any research

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.940
is done in psychology
on anything

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.860
except the left hand
side of that continuum.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.700
So for example, physical
health gets a lot of attention.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.140
But psychological health
gets a lot of attention too.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.510
For the most part, psychologists
are in the business--

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.100
95% of publications focus
on schizophrenia, stress,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.580
depression, anxiety.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.170
I'm not doing so well.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.977
Emotional difficulties,
that's where we focus.

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:45.060
But see, on the right hand
side of that continuum,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.170
there is something called
positively deviant health.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.730
Physically, it's
Olympic fitness levels--

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.560
5% body fat for men,
15% body fat for women.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.280
The ability to run an
Iron Man competition.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.910
Somebody different than me.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.610
You know, some
research, not much.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.410
Psychologically, it's similar.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.380
Some years ago there was a
book written called "Flow."

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.230
It describes a condition
where you're so

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.190
immersed in a task you care
about, you lose track of time,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.519
you lose track of
physiological needs.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.019
If you put electrodes
on your brain,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.420
you're using more of your
brain capacity than normal.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.400
It's not zoning out
in front of a screen.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.650
It's hyperactivity mentally.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.000
Not much research on that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.890
Little bit, not much.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.170
So there is positively
deviant phenomena.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.390
We just don't pay
much attention to it.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.536
Organizationally,
it's very similar.

00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:38.160
If you go to the business school
at the University of Michigan,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.830
many of the courses, half
the courses, probably,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.020
will hand you a case study.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.240
The normal assignment is, all
right, what are the issues?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.250
What are the challenges?

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.420
What is going wrong?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.920
Come up with some
recommendations,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.869
and defend yourself.

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:52.160
How are we going to make money?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.500
How are we going to
overcome the competition?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.210
And so on.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.540
That is, we go from the left
hand side to the middle.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.360
Just fine, but on
the right hand side,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.550
there is positively deviant
organization performance.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.480
Now, there are several
important implications

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.630
of thinking of the right
hand side of that continuum.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.500
I refer to the right hand
side as abundance gaps.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.620
I refer to the left hand
side as deficit gaps, problem

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.020
solving gaps, challenge gaps.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.350
Almost everything we study
is focused on the left hand

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.100
side of that continuum.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.660
On the right hand side, I refer
to that end of the continuum

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.630
as a virtuous condition.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.780
Now, virtuousness,
as a concept, is not

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.660
really acceptable in scholarly
rigorous circumstances.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.880
Too religious,
too philosophical.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.380
But in the original
Latin and Greek,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.430
virtuousness just means the
best of the human condition.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.130
The highest aspirations
we have for ourselves

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.050
is a virtuous state.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.210
So when you're at your
very best, at your peak,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.470
that's virtuousness.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.530
See in music,
virtuosos are the best,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.810
most inspiring performers.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.350
Virtuosity-- in fact, if
the world was virtuous,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.266
there would be no
war, no poverty,

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.640
everybody would
be well educated.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.630
It's the best we can imagine.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.800
So the whole point
of this introduction

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.990
is to get to this slide.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.020
That is, to separate
problem solving deficit gaps

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.010
from abundance gaps.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.800
Here's the most important point.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.720
When you focus on
abundance gaps,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.790
you unleash something called
the heliotropic effect.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.450
Do you know what the
heliotropic effect is?

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.210
You do, you just
don't know you do.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.190
You put a plant in the window.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.950
Over time, it will lean
toward the light, which

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.740
is an example of the
heliotropic effect, which

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.970
is defined as follows.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.820
Every living system,
everything alive,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.940
has a tendency toward the
light and away from dark,

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.210
or toward positive energy,
away from negative energy.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.030
See, in nature, the sun is
the source of positive energy.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.520
It's the life-giving force.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.060
So most accurately defined,
the heliotropic effect

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.080
is, every living
system has a tendency

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.260
toward that which is life
giving and away from that

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.144
which is life depleting.

00:07:10.144 --> 00:07:11.560
Now, that makes
sense, doesn't it?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.000
You think of evolutionary
processes over time.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.270
Every species is
attracted to that

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.390
which gives life and
is repelled, or avoids,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.240
that which endangers,
or detracts, from life.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.320
Now, if that's true--

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.820
if every human being--

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.140
not to mention every system,
every living system--

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.820
if every human being flourishes
in the presence of the positive

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.300
and languishes in the
presence of the negative,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.480
it has big implications for
how we rear our children,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.660
what kind of incentive systems
we have in organizations,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.590
how we treat our colleagues,
how we manage the folks who

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.050
report to us, and so on.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.500
So what I want to do
is try to prove to you,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.274
convince you, that the
heliotropic effect exists.

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:56.440
And then if it does, then
we're going to talk about,

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.250
therefore what?

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.470
What's the relevance to Google,
to parents, to colleagues,

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.040
to friends?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.320
I'm going to share with you
a very small percent, maybe

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.260
1% or 2%, of the
research available.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.060
So very little,
but a few studies.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.030
So here's one study.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.320
Let's assume that
I am a researcher,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.820
and you are all students.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.340
But let's say
you're 10 years old.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.950
Just a normal every day,
a group of students.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.710
I have three teachers who
are naive to the experiment.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.159
They don't know this is
an experiment, but it is.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.700
So I say to teacher
number one, look,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.575
we have a group of
students in this class who

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:38.380
are incredibly bright,
IQ points off the charts.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.684
They are really
aggressive students.

00:08:40.684 --> 00:08:42.100
It's going to take
a great teacher

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.266
to help these kids flourish.

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:44.410
Can you do it?

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.425
You bet.

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.050
Teacher number two,
a group of students

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.940
in this class who have
enormous diversity of ability

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.620
levels, some really smart,
some really challenged,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.137
lots in between.

00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:57.970
It's going to take a
great teacher to handle

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.770
real variety of ability levels.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.060
Can you do it?

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.899
Sure.

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:03.940
Teacher number three, we
have a group of students

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.023
in this class who come
from difficult backgrounds,

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:09.004
failed a lot, struggled,
have not done well.

00:09:09.004 --> 00:09:10.420
It's going to take
a great teacher

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.590
to help these kids flourish.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.670
Can you do it?

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.900
Sure.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.340
Then I simply ask the teachers
to teach for one year.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.890
Now, the students
are all the same.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.480
I simply ask the
teachers to teach

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.752
for one year, same subject.

00:09:21.752 --> 00:09:23.710
At the end of the year,
I give all the students

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.730
a standardized test, and I
find statistically significant

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.410
differences in the results.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.320
Who scores the best?

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.220
Above average scores, average
scores, below average scores.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.480
If I think I'm teaching
geniuses, I am.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.970
I've learned from
US army generals,

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.580
with whom I spend
several days a year.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.130
60% of the outcome of
Navy SEALs training,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.350
Army Ranger training,
Special Forces training,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.966
is due to the expectation
of the instructor.

00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:51.340
It's called the
Pygmalion effect.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.006
Happens with airline
pilots, all the way

00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:55.724
through preschoolers
learning shapes and colors.

00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:56.890
All right, that's one study.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.620
Another study done
here on our campus

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.810
has been replicated
several times.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.060
So a physician puts
a drop of liquid

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.265
at the bottom of your nostril,
in which there's cold virus.

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:09.100
They call it rhinovirus.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.750
You breathe in the virus.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.690
Some people get sick,
and some people don't.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.130
And the question
is, well, how do

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.320
you explain who
succumbs to the virus

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.450
and gets a cold versus not.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.480
Turns out, the temperature
at the back of your throat,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.000
where your esophagus
meets your nasal passage,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.950
a half a degree difference
in that temperature

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.550
causes you to succumb to the
virus versus be resilient,

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.830
and your emotional state
affects the temperature.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.080
Happy, optimistic,
positive people

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.620
become sick significantly
less often, half as often,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.960
as depressed, angry,
cynical people.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.120
But the classic study
that illustrates this

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.460
is called the nun study.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.860
It's a study of 678 Catholic
nuns living in a convent.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.710
Now, this was originally
designed as an Alzheimer's

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.220
disease study.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.770
So these women were between
the ages of 75 and 104,

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.200
and some of them had
Alzheimer's disease.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.290
But see, they had the same diet,
same regimen, same environment.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.140
You can control for
a lot of factors.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.640
Well, there was a
side finding that

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.780
emerged from that research.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.405
And here it is.

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:14.050
It was especially
interesting to me.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.090
They found the journals or
diaries of 180 of these women

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.110
when they entered the
convent 60 years before.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.700
Some of these women
are saying things

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.660
like this in their journal.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.540
This is a culmination
of my life's dream.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.980
I'm so happy to enter the order.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.930
This is such a blessing.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.187
Some are saying, this is
going to be a real challenge.

00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:35.395
It's going to be a sacrifice.

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.840
It's going to be difficult.
But I'm committed.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.480
I'm going to follow through.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.910
Difference?

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.370
They simply put
nuns in two groups,

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.850
depending on which type of
journal they were keeping.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.320
Then the study was, at
the end of 60 years,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.174
they simply counted the number
of nuns alive in each group.

00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:56.590
Now, these numbers
aren't precise,

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.006
but they're very close, and
they represent the difference.

00:11:59.006 --> 00:12:02.200
Of the 90 nuns in the
first group, 70 were alive.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.062
Of the 90 nuns in the
second group, 20 were alive.

00:12:05.062 --> 00:12:07.270
And in every decade, there's
a significant difference

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.170
in mortality rates.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.090
13 years difference,
as it turns out.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.930
I mean, you live longer on that
happy, optimistic, positive

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.520
perspective.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.750
Another study.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.780
Let's assume that for a minute,
I'm interested in having all

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.860
of you become better bowlers,
B-O-W-L-E-R-S. All right.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.810
And I'm so committed
to this, I'm

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.670
going to give you
a big incentive.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.780
In fact, I'll give you $1,000
if you can improve your bowling

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.510
score by an average of 10 pins.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.010
All right, pretty
good incentive.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.040
The challenge is, I'm going
to give you only 30 days.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.930
So we got to get a baseline.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.660
We're all going to go
down and bowl three games.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.030
I'm going to film
you as you bowl.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.111
Then for you folks, I'm going to
show you when you were bowling,

00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:51.610
I'm going to show you only when
you made strikes and spares,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.977
when you knocked all
the pins down, OK.

00:12:53.977 --> 00:12:55.810
I'm going to show you
when you were bowling,

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.610
I'm going to show you
only when you did not

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.410
make strikes and spares.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.940
So square up, work
on your approach,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.860
try to improve, all right.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.110
30 days later, we
come back together,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.660
we all go down and
bowl three more games.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.930
Some of you get the money.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.250
Who'd get the money?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.780
These folks would get the money.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.607
The question is why.

00:13:15.607 --> 00:13:17.440
Would these folks do
better just by watching

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.600
themselves make
strikes, versus these

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.580
who are trying to improve?

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.210
That's kind of easy, isn't it.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.490
Getting comfortable,
I'm getting confident.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.490
Except think about this.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.740
The first time you went
out and played basketball,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.200
didn't you mostly miss?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.390
What didn't you
learn how to miss?

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.180
Because most of the data
is coming back wrong.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.950
First time on the golf course,
went this way, went this way.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.290
First time in a tennis court,
bounced off your racket,

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.760
went over there in the net.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.890
Why didn't you learn
how to do it wrong?

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.740
The answer is
heliotropic effect.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.910
Inherent in your DNA is a
tendency to learn the positive.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.949
If you didn't, you
wouldn't be this old.

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:58.240
You would have died before now.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.032
You would not have adapted.

00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:01.240
So you don't have to choose--

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.110
I'm going to show
you in a minute.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.220
You don't have to choose.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.380
You have an inherent
inclination.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.420
It is in your DNA.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.160
I showed you a picture of
a cell in the last slide.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.920
It's at every cell
in your body has

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.160
the receptors to
light, which transforms

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.510
into life giving energy.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.660
It's at the cellular DNA level.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:25.180
The heliotropic effect creates
an inclination in all of us

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.320
toward the positive.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.630
I'll show you some more
data in just a minute.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.637
One more study.

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:31.970
I used to do this in my classes.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.200
I don't do it anymore, but
it's done all over the world.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.930
Let's assume all of
you are in my MBA class

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.489
at the University of Michigan.

00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:40.780
And I say to you, OK, students.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.690
In my class, you are
required to keep a journal,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.590
and you have to write in
your journal every day.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.250
OK?

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.610
However, you folks,
every day, are

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.110
going to write in your journal
three things for which you're

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.520
grateful.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.570
All right?

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.019
So five minutes before
you go to bed tonight,

00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:59.560
just write down the
three best things

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.000
that happened to you
today, or three things

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.170
for which you're grateful.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.780
You write down three
events, or three things

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.330
that were frustrating,
or problems you faced.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.190
So I got a journal group.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.080
I've got a gratitude
journal group.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.596
All right.

00:15:11.596 --> 00:15:12.970
Now, at the end
of this semester,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.303
I'm going to do several studies.

00:15:14.303 --> 00:15:17.000
All of these studies
are published.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.590
For example, I'm going to
give all of you a flu shot.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.350
Seven days later,
I'm going to test

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.170
for the number of
antibodies in your system.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.240
You're going to be
healthier in seven days,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.600
detectably, physically
healthier, more antibodies

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.447
in your body, than are you.

00:15:34.447 --> 00:15:36.030
Now look, this is a
gratitude journal.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.863
This is just putting
yourself in a virtuous,

00:15:37.863 --> 00:15:40.830
or in this case, a gratitude
condition, once a day.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.329
I can get a physical difference.

00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:43.870
This is not something
difficult. This

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.110
is not losing weight, or
giving up coffee, or training

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.360
for a marathon, or something.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.860
This is put yourself in
a virtuous condition.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.550
Another.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.940
I give you a mental acuity test.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.620
What's that?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.130
You have to memorize
information.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.080
You have to remember
information.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.090
You have to come up with
sophisticated decision

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.340
rules for complex data.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.220
More mental acuity
here than here.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.570
I can affect your test scores.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.610
I'm going to show
you in a minute.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.430
I give you a creativity task.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.610
What's that?

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.070
Well, think of all the
things you can use this for.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.250
Or a ping pong ball, or a brick.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.340
More ideas here, and a
broader variety of ideas here.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.900
It's called mental flexibility.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.330
Here than here.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.430
This is a gratitude journal.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.130
This is a pretty
easy intervention.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.860
There's a study done
about six months ago, now.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.580
They claimed it's the
only one of its kind.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.150
I can detect if you have heart
disease on the basis of blood

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.096
chemistry.

00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:44.470
I'm not a medical doctor, so
I don't know how that works.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.990
But that's apparently the case.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.976
So what they did is took
heart disease patients,

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.600
and they simply put
them in two groups.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.690
One's a control group.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.070
The other one, they asked them
to keep gratitude journals

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.220
for eight weeks, every day.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.040
At the end of eight weeks, they
simply tested blood chemistry.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.050
Those people who were
keeping gratitude journals

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:05.890
were healthier.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.680
Their blood chemistry
was healthier

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.300
than those who did not.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.400
I mean, they said, holy cow.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.880
First study of its kind to
show that kind of evidence.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.599
And then I've learned
from these military folks,

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:23.700
if you lose a spouse
to death or divorce,

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.869
zero deep depression
six months later here.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.620
30% deep depression
here six months later.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.810
So the whole notion is, this
virtuous, positive practices

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.860
has physical differences,
cognitive differences,

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.270
academic differences, and so on.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.090
I'll show you some more.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.760
Earlier this year, I
was on a group of--

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:52.000
I had a chance to select the
best doctoral dissertation done

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.730
on the planet in
this general area.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.300
This is the winner.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.980
Done by guy who went to Bhutan.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.330
And he selected high schools.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.200
So he had 11 high schools in
an experimental condition,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.120
nine high schools in
a control condition.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.911
What did that mean?

00:18:07.911 --> 00:18:10.330
In 11 high schools, he
changed the curriculum,

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.000
so students were
exposed to virtuousness,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.860
positive practices,
positivity, and so on.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.180
He then measured one year
later, and then two years later,

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.160
simply a measure of well-being.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.910
How are you doing?

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.500
Are you feeling
good about yourself?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.401
Do you like school?

00:18:27.401 --> 00:18:28.900
You getting along
with your friends?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.400
And so on.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.310
Well-being.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.570
Significant improvement in those
exposed to this positive stuff.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.900
Then here was the real surprise.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.150
He then measured scores
on standardized tests.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.810
Now in America, that
would be SAT, ACT tests.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.020
Significant differences a
year later, two years later.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.920
Academically, they
performed better.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.503
The only difference
is they're getting

00:18:53.503 --> 00:18:54.910
exposed to positive practices.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.500
Then he went to Mexico.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.670
Approximately 70,000
students in that study.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.980
That is 35 high schools
in each condition,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.130
experimental condition,
control condition.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.530
Significant improvement.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.330
Well-being, academic
performance.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.860
Then he went to Peru.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:18.040
700,000 students, 347
schools in each condition.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.360
Significant differences.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.430
And we can affect
your test scores.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.970
I mean virtuousness
actually has an impact.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.980
And here's why.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:32.740
There are interesting studies
done of heart rhythms.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.099
So for example, I
have a good friend

00:19:35.099 --> 00:19:36.640
at an organization
called Heart Math.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.740
They study heart rhythms.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.720
In a frustrated, angry,
upset, depressed condition,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.050
your heart rhythms are very
unpredictable, go like this.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.590
In a positive, virtuous
state, like for example,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.130
inducing gratitude, your
heart rhythms go like this.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.230
You don't have to choose it.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.880
It's heliotropic.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.760
So now, you know why after 60
years, some nuns are alive,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.260
and some are dead.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.630
Their heart just works better.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.840
Another study, they
simply asked people

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.980
to contemplate, ponder, a
positive, optimistic future

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.090
versus a neutral
or negative future.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.240
So now I have you
in a mental set.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.310
Now I'm going to put you
through an MRI machine

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.860
and scan your brain.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.450
Turns out, those in the
positive, optimistic mental set

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.570
had more areas of
your brain activated.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.260
And of those activated, they're
activated to a greater extent.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.864
You literally are smarter in
that positive, virtuous state.

00:20:35.864 --> 00:20:37.030
You don't have to choose it.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.050
It's heliotropic.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.160
Your brain works better in
that virtuous, positive state.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.850
Sorry I don't have these
slides to show you.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:46.570
Another study.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:01.210
There was a study done of
kidney dialysis patients, people

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.030
who were hooked up to a
kidney dialysis machine.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.330
So they can't go anywhere.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.680
And the question is--

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.870
I mean, the assignment
was, we want some of you

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.370
to receive a phone call
from other people expressing

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.790
love, support, and concern.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.480
That is, you're going to receive
a phone call for some people.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.410
And for some people, we want
you to place a phone call

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.720
expressing love,
support, and concern.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.430
At the end of that
period of time,

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.860
at the end of a two
year period of time,

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.210
those people who had
placed the phone call,

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.210
those people who had
received support, and love,

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.080
and concern from other people
were significantly better off

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.820
than those who did not.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.000
And here's the
explanation for that.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.430
If you are significantly
overweight,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:53.120
the probability of
dying early is 20%.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.730
If you are an excessive drinker,
probability of dying early,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.512
30%.

00:21:59.512 --> 00:22:00.970
My MBA students
always want to know

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.900
what the definition
of excessive means.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:10.270
If you're a smoker, probability
of dying early, 50%.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.050
If you are in poor
social relationships,

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.710
probability of dying early, 70%.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.500
Bad social relationships
trump the physical factors

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.450
we normally pay attention to.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.600
I mean, it matters a lot.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.210
And there's a whole
bunch of research

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.780
that suggests that
that's the case.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.390
If you're in a conflicting,
difficult relationship,

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.070
you're going to
have a hard time.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.040
That is, your body,
for many reasons,

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.310
is not going to do well.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:46.210
All right, well, the
question is, why is that?

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.000
Well, most of the time,
we say, well, it's

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.780
because I'm getting
my needs met.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.100
I mean, I want to be popular.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.040
It feels good to have somebody
care for me, and so on.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.420
Except that's not
the explanation.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.680
Here's the explanation.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.770
And these studies were all
done in our university.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:10.390
So I have a colleague
who's a psychologist, who

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.310
took entering freshmen at
the University of Michigan.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.520
These are all 17-,
18-, 19-year-old kids.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.530
She simply asked them
to identify their goals

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.150
for the year.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.620
Now, everyone has lots of goals,
but she categorized the goals

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.460
into two types.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.700
One type were called
achievement goals.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.840
I want to get good grades.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.720
I want to be popular.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.553
I want a girlfriend.

00:23:30.553 --> 00:23:32.080
I want to make the
team, and so on.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.294
The other kind of goal was
called contribution goals.

00:23:35.294 --> 00:23:36.460
I want to make a difference.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.126
I want to have something
better, because

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:39.790
of what I've contributed.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.770
Now, she put people
in two groups,

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.190
depending on which type
of goal was dominant.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.250
Then the study was, she
simply followed these students

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.986
for approximately a
year, academic year,

00:23:51.986 --> 00:23:53.860
measuring things like
how well they get along

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.760
with their roommates; how many
minor physiological symptoms

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.970
they've experienced-- cold,
headache, nausea, flu, cramps,

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.450
stuff like that; how many
times they missed class; what

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.210
their grade point average
was; how many times they

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.160
made the team, or got elected
to a club office, or something.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.750
See, social factors, academic
factors, physical factors.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.160
On every single dimension,
contribution goals

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.130
trumped achievement goals
in predicting performance.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.290
It's what they contributed,
more than what they got.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.250
Second.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.780
This is one of my
favorite studies.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.600
It's a study of multiple
sclerosis patients.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.480
These folks, half of them
were assigned to place a phone

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.120
call once a week to somebody.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.460
Half of them were asked
to receive a phone

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.650
call from somebody once a week.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.190
Two years later, they
measured well-being--

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.430
you can see on the right
hand side of that slide--

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.700
self-efficacy, confidence,
competence, physical activity,

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.860
hope, depression.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.400
Those who placed the phone
call were eight times

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.130
healthier at the end
of two years than those

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.450
who received the phone call.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.880
It was the contribution
that caused

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.210
them to flourish physically.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.330
You know Borders bookstore.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.310
It used to be in Ann
Arbor, now bankrupt.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.636
World's largest bookseller.

00:25:16.636 --> 00:25:18.010
While they were
in business, they

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.309
created the Borders Foundation.

00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:22.600
The Borders Foundation was
simply a unit within Borders

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.974
where you could
contribute money.

00:25:23.974 --> 00:25:26.507
And then if people had a
sick child, or an accident,

00:25:26.507 --> 00:25:28.090
or needed financial
support, you could

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.050
apply to the Borders
Foundation, get results,

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.580
or get financial support.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.790
One of our doctoral students
did a study, the hypothesis

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.270
of which was, if you have
received money from the Borders

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:45.340
Foundation, loyalty, commitment,
engagement, will go sky high.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.055
Turns out no difference.

00:25:47.055 --> 00:25:49.180
If you receive money, if
you hadn't received money,

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.800
didn't matter.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.690
What did matter
was the opportunity

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.430
to contribute to the
Borders Foundation.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.160
If you had given money to
the Borders Foundation,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.280
commitment, loyalty, sky high.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.260
Borders is bankrupt.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.320
The Borders Foundation
will not die.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.129
It still exists.

00:26:05.129 --> 00:26:06.670
Now they're trying
to get mom and pop

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.211
bookstores around
the country to join

00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:09.850
who don't have safety nets.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.540
People will not stop giving
if they have a chance to give.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.760
Turns out contribution in
relationships is the predictor.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.090
So when we think about
positive leadership, it's not,

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.090
I want to be famous.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.770
I want to get.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.900
Make sure you give me things.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.690
It rather is, what can I
contribute to the well-being

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.619
or flourishing of other people?

00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:33.160
And there is a whole bunch of
ways to think about doing that,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.310
because almost all
organizations, when

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.030
you do especially
well, give you stuff.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.686
You're giving them
financial incentive.

00:26:41.686 --> 00:26:43.060
You get your
picture on the wall.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.600
Somebody gives you some
recognition in a newsletter.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.530
You're a receiver.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.660
Turns out, if you
have an opportunity

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.690
to give or contribute
to somebody else,

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.240
that's a much better incentive.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.529
Like for example, if Mark
does especially well,

00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:59.320
I'm going to ask him
to coach somebody else

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.600
because they need to
become as good as he is.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.750
That is his reward, is he gets
a chance to teach or coach.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.470
That's just one example
of many that you can use

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.810
to contribute in organizations.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.640
OK, and I'm going to skip these.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.761
Now, the question is--

00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:17.260
all right.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.859
I've got the brainwaves camera,
and I got the heart rhythms,

00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:20.650
and all that stuff.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.540
OK, but wait a minute.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.940
Organizations are much more
complex than are individuals.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.190
That is, you can get a bunch
of happy people together.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.140
It does not make for
a great organization.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.050
So the question is,
does this actually

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.990
work in organizations,
when I'm held

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.350
accountable for profitability,
and productivity, and quality,

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.960
and customer
satisfaction, and so on?

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.210
That's been my
research for 15 years.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.770
That's been the question.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.720
Yeah, but does it
work in organizations?

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.370
Turns out, after 15
years, the bottom line

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:58.330
is if you implement
in an organization

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.980
positive practices--

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.740
we haven't talked about
what that is at all.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:09.200
But virtuous practices,
compassion, kindness,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.150
forgiveness,
gratitude, and so on.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.450
You will get higher
levels of profitability.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.990
You make more money by far
than the industry average.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.020
Productivity is
significantly improved.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.190
Quality goes up, fewer errors,
less waste, fewer mistakes.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:33.460
Innovation, new product ideas,
creativity, all improve.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.590
The scores on creativity go up.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.640
Customer satisfaction, customer
loyalty, customer retention

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.690
goes up.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.870
Employee satisfaction,
employee retention all go up.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.350
That is-- that's what
you're held accountable for.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.570
All of those are
significantly improved

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.970
when you implement
positive practices.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.900
I'm going to not show you
hardly any of the research.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.350
But let me just give
you a couple of studies.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.240
One of the most
surprising studies

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.620
is this one, because we said,
where is the least likely place

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.630
anybody would care about this
positive, virtuous, saccharin

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:15.780
sweet, soupy, syrupy,
touchy feely, naive--

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.630
eww-- pollyannish stuff?

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.060
Likely, Wall Street.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.876
I mean, if I got $100 million
invested in that portfolio,

00:29:24.876 --> 00:29:26.500
and I'm in a hedge
fund, I want to know

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.666
if it's going up or down,
because I've got one goal.

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:29.950
Show me the money.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.367
That's all I care about.

00:29:31.367 --> 00:29:32.950
I don't care if you
treat people well.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.030
I don't care if you downsize.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:34.670
I don't care if you--

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.830
I don't care what you do.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.820
I want a return.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.910
So we picked 40 firms.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.114
When they implemented
positive practices,

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:43.280
some did better than others.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.371
So we measured change.

00:29:44.371 --> 00:29:46.370
Or in other words, how--
are you getting better?

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.460
Are you getting worse?

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.730
Are you staying the same?

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.900
When organizations improved,
got more and more virtuous,

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.580
essentially, we could
account for almost 50%--

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:03.040
0.45-- 45% of their
financial performance.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.350
Now, I don't know anything
that predicts Wall Street

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.259
performance by 45%.

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:08.800
But we could.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.890
Plus a bunch of other
things, turn over,

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.920
and you know, satisfaction,
and all those kinds of things.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.570
That is, even in the least
likely and most hostile

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:22.210
environment you can imagine,
positive performances paid off.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.410
And in the health care,
you sort of expect that.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:25.950
But over a two-year
period of time,

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.605
double digit improvement,
where the industry average

00:30:28.605 --> 00:30:31.290
is 1% or 2%, double
digit improvement

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.960
on these various dimensions
that really count,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.760
that people want to improve.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.560
So the whole point is, with
only a very small sampling

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.730
of the information, what
we know is actually,

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.730
positive practices pay off
physically, cognitively,

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:52.800
socially, and they pay
off organizationally.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.390
When you implement
positive practices,

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.000
organizations do better.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.916
We improve what we want--

00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:01.290
what we're held accountable
for, what we want to improve.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:01.920
All right.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.730
There's a bunch of resources
that are available,

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.730
if you want to get them.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.760
There's a website that
we have for our research

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.480
center where there's
long lists of videos,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.041
and references, and papers,
and syllabi for courses,

00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:19.290
and all those kinds of things.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.410
I'm going to stop
here, because I've just

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.970
talked for 32 minutes.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.080
Questions, comments, yeah buts.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.040
Anything on your mind?

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.390
AUDIENCE: Hey, my
name is Dominique,

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.410
and I do have a question
about if you ever

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.040
did a study on Google.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.450
I feel like a lot
of the brackets

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.020
you talked about in
positive leadership,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.810
and quite a few of
our pillars, I think,

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.319
our senior leadership
takes pretty seriously.

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:53.360
Have you ever looked at--

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.460
KIM CAMERON: I
have never done a--

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.920
I've never done a
study on Google.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.102
I'd love to.

00:31:57.102 --> 00:31:58.396
AUDIENCE: I just was curious.

00:31:58.396 --> 00:31:58.895
[LAUGHS]

00:31:58.895 --> 00:32:04.690
KIM CAMERON: I--
well, I would like to.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.580
My prediction-- I'll
finish the thought.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:12.100
My prediction is that there are
pockets that are spectacular,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.700
extraordinary, and pockets
that are-- could be improved,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.970
I would guess.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.970
And one of the nice things
about studying Google

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.560
is to try to find
out where those are

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.020
and what the practices
are, specifically,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:29.530
here that would create the
spectacular performance.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.080
So far, there is no
disconfirming evidence

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.480
that this pays off in
organizations, so far.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.380
I can disconfirm any evidence
about anything, but not this.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.015
Thanks.

00:32:39.015 --> 00:32:40.390
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.240
for coming out here
and speaking to us.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.580
I was wondering if you have--
similar to the question

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.038
about Google-- but have you
done any research around, like,

00:32:48.038 --> 00:32:50.650
nonprofits and those
who work there?

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.260
Or maybe are in some
sort of service,

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.270
such as nursing or firemen.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.059
You know, just
helping the community.

00:32:59.059 --> 00:33:01.100
KIM CAMERON: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.320
How about not-for-profits?

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.230
It turns out, we've
done a lot of work

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.230
in the following industries.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.600
There's a lot of
work in education.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.760
That is, implementing
these positive practices

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.980
changes test scores, changes
academic performance,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.570
and so on.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.236
We've done a lot of
work in health care.

00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:22.870
I showed you one little, quick
study of that in hospitals.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.480
We've done a lot of work in
the national intelligence

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:32.110
agencies, CIA, FBI,
NSA, DIA, 16 agencies.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.530
See, you can't
manufacture enough bullets

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.071
to keep the world safe, can you?

00:33:38.071 --> 00:33:39.820
So there have got to
be some alternatives.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.320
They get it.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.560
And it's been pretty
inspirational to me

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.690
to see how the FBI is
trying to figure out a way

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.170
to implement positive practices,
or positive leadership,

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:50.740
you know.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.820
So that's another.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.490
Military, army generals,
especially US army generals--

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.725
I'm not working
on any, you know,

00:33:56.725 --> 00:33:58.600
the non commissioned
officers, and so on.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.050
But from that one, two,
three, four star level, boy,

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.300
I'll tell you what.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.250
I'm impressed with them.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.610
From their perspective,
setting strategy for the world,

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:10.981
this resonates and matters.

00:34:10.981 --> 00:34:13.480
So they've been working on this
for seven, or eight, or nine

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.739
years, you know,
this whole topic.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:18.580
So that.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.880
We did a big study
of nursing, nurses.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.570
Similar kind of outcome
with nursing care.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.020
And probably some others.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.639
But there's a lot of
not-for-profit work

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.610
that's being done.
