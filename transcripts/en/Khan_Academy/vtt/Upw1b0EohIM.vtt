00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.139
- [Voiceover] So we're told g of x

00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.489
is a transformation of f of x.

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:07.269
The graph below shows f
of x as a solid blue line.

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.125
So this is the graph of
y is equal to f of x,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:11.820
and the g of x is a dotted red line.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.259
So that's the graph of
y is equal to g of x.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.255
What is g of x in terms of f of x?

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:17.792
And they gave us some choices here,

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.394
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.991
and see if you can figure this out.

00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.522
Well there's a couple of ways
that you can think about it.

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:26.588
One is if you just eyeball it,

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:28.701
it looks like if you flipped f of x

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.091
over the x-axis, it looks
a little bit like g(x),

00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:33.688
but g(x) looks like a version of that

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:35.435
that's diminished a little bit.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.573
So for example, if you were to

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:38.988
flip it perfectly over the x-axis,

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.031
you would get something--

00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:42.935
you would get something that looks like--

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.025
and I'm just going to sketch it.

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:47.092
So if you just flipped
perfectly over the x-axis,

00:00:47.092 --> 00:00:50.644
you would get something
that looks like this,

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:54.870
and trying my best to eyeball it.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.610
It would look something like this.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.764
If you perfectly just flipped it over.

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:04.544
It would look something like that.

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:06.294
I might not get it perfectly right.

00:01:06.294 --> 00:01:08.128
But that would be-- this right over here.

00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:09.336
So let me be clear.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:13.933
If this is y is equal to
f of x, then this line

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.048
right over here that I just drew,

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:18.508
that would be y is equal
to negative f of x.

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:20.528
Because whatever f of x would give you,

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:24.057
just take the negative of it
you're flipping over the x-axis

00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:26.658
and now g of x looks like a
diminished version of that,

00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:28.283
and if I were to just eyeball it,

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:31.348
it looks like it's roughly 1/3 of this.

00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:32.788
So my initial guess - and we can

00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:35.399
verify this little bit - is that this

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.953
right over here is 1/3 the value of this.

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:42.694
So I would say it is...

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:47.694
So g of x is equal to
1/3 of negative f of x

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:52.826
or negative 1/3 of f of x.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.442
And that is not one of the choices,

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:56.928
which makes me extra cautious,

00:01:56.928 --> 00:02:00.249
but let me just emphasize
why I like this choice.

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.687
Because we said this is
negative f of x right there,

00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:04.846
and it looks like for any x value,

00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:06.982
what g of x is is 1/3 of that.

00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:08.376
So instead of getting to four,

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:09.769
we're getting to a little bit over one.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.091
Instead of getting to
three right over here,

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:13.739
we're getting to one.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.060
Instead of getting to one right over here,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.521
we are only getting to 1/3.

00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:22.749
So it looks like it is 1/3 of this line

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.280
that I just hand drew,
which is negative f of x.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.905
So it would be 1/3 of negative f of x,

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:29.947
which would be negative 1/3 f of x.

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:31.410
Once again, not a choice here,

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.151
but let's actually look at some values.

00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:35.752
So if we said, "Let's
see some values where

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:39.165
"it looks like we're
hitting integer values."

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:46.201
So for example, right at this point,

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:51.201
right over here, it looks
like f of negative seven

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.653
is equal to negative one.

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:58.245
It looks like g of negative seven...

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:02.916
So it looks like g of negative seven

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:07.398
is equal to positive 1/3, positive 1/3,

00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:11.136
if I am just eyeballing it.

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:12.646
So that seems consistent with this,

00:03:12.646 --> 00:03:15.780
because if f of negative
seven is negative one,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.800
you take the negative 1/3 times that,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.403
and you get positive 1/3.

00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:21.144
We can do that in a
couple of other places.

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:23.721
If we look right over...

00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:27.896
If we look right over here,

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.291
it looks like f of negative one.

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:34.378
f of negative one is
equal to negative three,

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:38.906
and it looks like g of one
is negative 1/3 times that.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:42.621
Negative 1/3 times that is
that point right over there.

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:46.290
Negative 1/3 times negative
three is positive one.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.097
So g of... g is colored in that red color.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:54.022
So we get for that point right over there,

00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:58.388
we get g of negative one
is equal to positive one.

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:00.779
So once again, this is negative 1/3

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.289
times this right over here.

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:04.239
So I feel pretty confident in my answer.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.513
g of x is equal to
negative 1/3 times f of x.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.626
Once again, negative f of
x would just flipped over,

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:12.273
and then multiplying it by
the 1/3 diminishes that,

00:04:12.273 --> 00:04:14.061
which we see right over there.

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:17.567
So I feel pretty confident with my

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:18.769
none of the above.
