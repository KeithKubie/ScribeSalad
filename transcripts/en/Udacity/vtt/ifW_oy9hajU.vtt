00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.510
I mentioned previously that you
shouldn't add tab index to site

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.790
content as a general rule.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.560
But there is one exception to this and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.570
that's when you're manipulating
the page, in response to a user action.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.110
A scenario might be that a user goes and
clicks on one of these menu items.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.390
And the page then does an animated
scroll, down to that particular section.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.060
Or, if you are building
a single page web app,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.830
clicking on one of the navigation
links changes the content of the page

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.850
without doing a full page refresh.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.409
In either of these situations, you'll
want to pick an appropriate header,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.550
give the tab index of negative one so it
doesn't appear in the natural tab order,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.530
and call its focus method after
the user has taken their action.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.340
This process is known as Managing Focus,
and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.550
it's an extremely important technique
that keeps the user's interactive

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.230
context in sync with the visual
representation of the site.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.800
Let's go through that single page
app scenario I just discussed and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.230
I'll highlight what happens
when we don't manage focus.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.620
And then demonstrate how the experience
can be improved when we do manage focus.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.019
So here we are back at our site.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.620
I'm going to go click on this.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.880
What is Vegemite link?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.020
And when I do that I'm going to
want to start clicking around some of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.430
the anchors in the main page content.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.560
So using my keyboard,
I'll navigate over there.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.140
I'll press enter.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.540
And now I'd like to click this link.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.590
But in order to get there I'm going to
have to tab back through my navigation.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.600
Now, there's only a few
navigation items here.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.300
So it's not the biggest
deal in the whole world.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.100
But you can imagine on a complex site
with a lot of navigation going on in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.970
the header, that could be a lot of
work to get through all of that.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.790
Furthermore, as a screen reader user,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.510
I might not even know that the page
content has loaded in and changed yet.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.160
I may just be sort of
sitting around waiting for

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.850
something to happen after
I've clicked that link.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.170
Let's see if we can improve
upon this a little bit.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.970
So what I'm going to do is,
take this heading right here.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.401
I'm going to give it a tabindex of -1.

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:51.110
If you recall, that means the element
won't be in the tab order, but

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.860
I can programmatically
focus it using JavaScript.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.990
Now, I can listen for my anchor clicks.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.070
I can tell the page content to update.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.270
And lastly, I can call the focus
method of that header.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.370
Once I've done that, the user
will then be moved down in here,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.270
inside of our main page content,
and then can then quickly Tab,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.550
or Shift+Tab to whatever they want.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.920
So let's run through that.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.550
I'm going to go over to
the recipe section, hit Enter.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.110
You'll see the header is focused, and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.209
I can very quickly jump down into
these additional anchor links.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.710
Now you might notice that as we do this,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.740
the header itself gets a large
focus ring placed around it.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.280
I'm going to talk more about
styling focus in a future lesson.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.950
But if you'd like, you can click
the link down in the instructor notes to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.070
jump ahead and
learn how to work around this issue.
