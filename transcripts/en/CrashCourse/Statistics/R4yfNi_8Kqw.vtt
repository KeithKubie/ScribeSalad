00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.060
Hi I’m Adriene Hill, and welcome to Crash
Course Statistics.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.000
So in the last episode we talked about the
“middle” of sets of data, what statisticians

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.640
call the central tendency.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.590
Today...we’re heading to the data on both
sides of that middle.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.330
What statisticians call “measures of spread”.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.020
Not to be confused with how I gauge the quality
of my peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.020
Measures of spread?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.020
Get it?

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.880
Cause you spread the peanut butter and jelly.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.880
Anyway, statistical measures of spread...or
dispersion... tell us how data is spread around

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.720
the middle.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.980
That lets us know how well the mean or median
represents the data.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.500
And how much we trust conclusions based on
the mean and median.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.790
And, I can hear you saying to the screen...come
on Adriene...when would anyone use this in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.400
real life.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.040
I may or may not have said that too at some
point.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.460
I have no official comment.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.110
But Measures of spread are all around.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.220
From test scores.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.520
Like when you find out you scored in the 99th
percentile on the LSAT!

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.119
Economists use measures of spread to study
income inequality.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.580
Investors use them to try to identify price
bubbles...bubbles they might want to avoid.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.960
Gamblers use them to try to figure out how
much they might win or lose.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.800
Pollsters use measures of spread to help calculate
margins of error.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
So yeah.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.870
They come in up real life.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.020
And, heads up, there is some math coming your
way.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.660
We’re not going to spend a lot of this series
doing calculations but for this one it’s important.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.560
INTRO

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.940
Let’s do a thought experiment to compare

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.670
measures of spread, and since you’re probably
watching this on YouTube right now, we’ll

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.580
talk about YouTube viewers and their ages.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.250
You’re a YouTuber, with big dreams and amazing
content, but as a growing channel, you need

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.330
to know more about your audience.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.420
YouTube will give you some information about
this, usually in the form of a fancy chart.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.920
One of the pieces of information you could
calculate is the Range of your audiences’

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920
age.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.860
Range takes the largest number in our data
set and subtracts the smallest number in the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.840
set to give us the distance between these
two extremes.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.260
The larger the distance, the more “spread
out” our data is.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.190
With the range we’re able to quantify the
distance between our most extreme points.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.190
We can often sense that groups are different,
and our ranges confirm it.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.010
If we looked at the range of your audience’s
age, we’d get a better idea of the full

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.080
spectrum of the people who watch your content.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.020
If you have 13 year olds watching you might
want to limit the ‘adult’ content, but

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.390
if you also have people over 40 watching,
you may need to explain some of the slang

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.370
you’re using--#lit #Fam---am I doing that
correctly?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.569
But the range won’t tell you about your
*core* audience.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.070
These are the people who you appeal to the
most.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.260
This might be better summarized by the InterQuartile
Range (or IQR) which doesn’t consider extreme

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.330
values.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.160
The IQR looks at the spread of the middle
50% of your data.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.810
So in this example the ages of your audience.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.860
The IQR will give you a better idea who is
the primary group watching you.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.930
A lifestyle guru like Bethany Mota might have
an IQR of 13-25, whereas I might guess someone

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.880
like John Oliver has an IQR that’s older.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.099
Maybe in the range of 22-40.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.180
Their overall range could be similar.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.690
I’m sure there are 13 year olds and 60 year
olds watching both these channels.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.150
But the IQR gives us a better idea of their
core audience.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.910
So let’s introduce some numbers so we can
do some math.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.160
Let’s say 10 basketball players have scored
the following number of points in the first

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.790
part of a game: 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8,
and 8.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.260
The median is 5.5.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.930
That divides the data set into two halves.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.990
To divide it further, into quarters, we find
the median of each of those halves.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.500
Which are 3 and 7.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.810
Q1 and Q3 respectively.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.520
The four quartiles here are from 1-to-3, 3-to-5.5,
5.5-to-7, and 7-to-8.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.709
The IQR is the difference between Q3 - Q1.

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.310
Or in this case 7-3...which is 4.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.500
If the median is closer to one of the ends
of the interquartile range, it means that

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.750
quartile has a smaller range.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.300
Since each quartile has the same number of
data points, it means that for that quartile,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.670
the same amount of points are closer to each
other.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.960
But, we’re still losing a lot of information
about how spread out all of the data is since

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.630
only two of the data points are used to calculate
both the range and interquartile range.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.380
There are measures of spread that include
all of our data, just like the mean.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.800
Take the variance ...which can give us a better sense of how spread out the whole data set is.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.020
Let’s take a scatterplot of all of our data
points and draw a straight line across the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.060
graph at the mean then draw lines from each point straight down to the mean line.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.780
Those lines represent the deviation--or difference--from
each point to the mean.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.020
Now imagine a square with sides the length
of the deviation line.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.540
The area of all the squares for every point
divided by the number of data points is the variance.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.100
But it turns out that if you use this same
formula to calculate the variance of a *sample*,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.100
it would be “biased”.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.599
That is, the sample variance would consistently
be a *little* smaller than the real variance

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:57.650
of the population.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.900
We divide by the number of samples minus 1
in order to get the sample variance to be

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.720
unbiased--or a better guess for the population
variance.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.480
For example, say that the Mets, the Yankees,
The Angels, the Dodgers, and the Astros have

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.619
2, 2, 5, 8, and 8 wins each.

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:18.699
The mean number of wins for the group of teams
is 5 (25/5).

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.099
To calculate the variance we take each number
and subtract the mean, square this difference,

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.819
then add all of these squared differences
together and divide by the number of data

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.160
points minus 1.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.880
The variance of this set of baseball teams
is 9+9+0+9+9 all divided by 4, which equals

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.200
9 squared wins.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.760
And, yes, I know 9 squared wins doesn’t
mean anything but when we square our numbers,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.229
we’re also squaring our units right along
with them.

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.400
Even though squared wins isn’t an understandable
unit to us, the variance is still a really

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.469
useful number to have because it tells us
how much “variability” is in our data.

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:00.610
In our baseball example, it tells us roughly
how far each team’s win record is from the

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.610
mean.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.340
We’ll see it pop up quite often once we
get to inferential statistics.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.869
For now, let’s go to the thought bubble.

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:12.229
Professor Hooch has hired you to analyze students’ broom speeds for the Hogwarts Quidditch teams.

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.749
There are fifteen new Gryffindors, so you
measure how long it takes them to fly around

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.749
the field twice.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.280
And here’s the plot of the times (in seconds) that it takes each student to complete the trip.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.440
Looks like a few of the muggle-born studentswho didn’t grow up using magic brooms took

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.040
a lot longer than their classmates who grew up in wizarding families.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.640
Our mean of all students is 36.47 seconds

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.800
but if we take out the muggle-born students,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.840
the mean is down to 29.67 seconds

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.000
Means are very easily changed by extreme values

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.720
But, the median does not change as much.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.000
It only goes from 30 seconds to 29.5 seconds when we pull out the muggle-borns

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.040
The range changes greatly, going from 46 seconds

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.840
to 20 because the extreme values

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.379
determine the high number in our range calculation.

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:01.559
The variance is also greatly affected since

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:04.669
those slow Muggle-born students inflate our mean.

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.240
If we take out those Muggle-born times, the
rest of our data is quite close together,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.240
reflected in the variance of about 36 seconds squared.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.800
But once we add those times back in, the variance

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.000
shoots up to about 228 seconds squared, which matches our intuition that the group is now

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:22.319
more “spread out”.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:27.479
You can see that the distance between points and the new mean are much larger than before

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.840
we put the Muggle-born times back in

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.280
These Muggle-born times change our measures of spread and center.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.330
But that doesn’t necessarily mean these
data are *bad*.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.229
We need to think about whether unusual points belong in our data or not.

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:44.789
And we’ll talk more about unusual points,
or Outliers, later in the series.

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:45.860
Thanks thought bubble!

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.770
Remember that the units of variance are squared
units, like seconds squared for our flying

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.800
broomstick times, or baseball wins squared
for our baseball example.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.389
And yes, variance is valuable, but sometimes
we need something with units that make just

00:07:58.389 --> 00:07:59.699
a little more sense.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:01.029
Enter, standard deviation.

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:05.379
The standard deviation is the square root
of the variance, which gives back the units

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:08.189
that we’re comfortable with: seconds or
baseball wins!

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:12.560
The standard deviation of our Quidditch data
would be about 6 seconds without the Muggle-born

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.469
data and about 15 seconds with it.

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:19.979
You can think of the standard deviation as
the average amount we expect a point to differ

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:21.560
(or deviate) from the mean.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.210
That means that on average, we expect students
to deviate from the mean time by 6 seconds.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:31.009
When the Muggle-born students raise our mean,
our standard deviation goes up as well.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:35.750
In part this happens because now the other
points are further from the mean, since the

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.070
mean became larger.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.250
Just like the mean, the standard deviation
and variance are heavily affected by unusually

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.260
large or small values.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.520
So you should still always look out for extreme
values in your data and be aware of the influence

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520
they can have.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.750
If you see someone reporting a mean number in an article or on tv, you can use the standard deviation -

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.570
if they’re thoughtful enough
to give it to you--to get a better understanding

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.030
for how well the mean represents the data.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:07.340
If the mean number of murders per state in
2015 was 307 (which it was), then a standard

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.220
deviation of 10 murders shows us that 307
is a pretty good guess for the number of murders

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.970
in any individual state.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:19.890
But, if the the standard deviation was 353
murders (which it was), that guess wouldn’t

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.190
be nearly as accurate.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.860
And this makes some sense, you wouldn’t
expect Montana to have nearly as many murders

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.610
as a heavily populated state like New York
or California.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.710
Let’s go back to our YouTube channel.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.550
So now you have a better idea of who is watching
you.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.570
And you’re getting more and more viewers
everyday!

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.680
If you want to grow more, you realize you
need to diversify your audience.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.700
So you look at the standard deviation of the
ages of your audience.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.580
This will give you a better idea of whether
your audience have similar ages, or whether

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.100
you’re appealing to many age groups.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.060
You keep adding new content and collaborating
with other YouTubers to try to reach a wider

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.630
audience, and it’s working!

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.570
Your standard deviation is getting larger,
which means you’re attracting a more diverse

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.540
(or more “spread out”) audience!

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.940
And congratulations, looks like you just hit
one million Subscribers.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.760
As our YouTube thought experiment showed us,
the different measures of spread each give

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.160
us different information about our data, but
they all tell us something about how spread

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.160
out the data are.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.520
Sure, you can use measures of spread to grow your YouTube channel and are important for statisticians.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.640
But...they are also valuable for us non-statisticians
to ponder.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.580
And I’m going to go a little deep here...try
not to veer into the cheesy...but here’s

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.810
my big take away from this episode... we all
have a tendency to compare ourselves to the

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:33.810
“average”.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.370
We compare our income to the average income.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.900
We compare our rent to the average rent.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.540
Our intelligence to average intelligence.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.460
We compare our weight to the average weight
of someone our age.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.460
And on.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.460
And on.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.960
From these “measures of spread” I take
away the idea that the “average” whatever,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.770
on it’s own, can be deeply misleading.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.850
Comparing ourselves to that single statistic
can give us a false sense of failure...or

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.850
success.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.640
Depending on how the data is spread out.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.480
So maybe stop comparing yourself to the average…
or, if you’re really insistent on ranking

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.420
yourself against everybody else…

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.280
Go calculate the standard deviation too.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.160
Thanks for watching.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.400
I'll see you next time.
