00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.360
MATT PARKER: 1,  68,  44,  28,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.920
41 and 64

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.900
And so you, ok that's quite a nice magic square,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.960
except it doesn't work.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.160
If you add them up you get different numbers in different directions,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.940
If I go through now and square all of these numbers,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.520
that becomes a magic square.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.720
or rather it becomes a semi magic square.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.760
So this is so close to being a magic
square of square numbers.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.060
So all the rows add to the same number,
all the columns add to the same number.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.640
No one has ever found

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.040
a magic square that works properly both diagonals

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440
and all the numbers are square numbers.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.060
It's an open question in mathematics.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.580
And so people actually compete. There are sorts of squares we haven't found,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.440
so people try to find a 4-by-4 magic square with cube numbers,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.060
or, you know, a 7-by-7 magic square with square numbers, right?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.600
and so there are prizes for all the ones we haven't come across.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.660
Just last year someone found the first 7-by-7 magic square with all cube numbers,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.580
and they won a prize, they won 500 euros.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.840
It's alright, I mean, you know and fame, and mathematical...

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.460
you know!?
BRADY HARAN: What's their name?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.080
MATT PARKER: I can take... yeah...
BRADY HARAN: They're famous...
MATT PARKER: Let me check my notes, ehh

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.540
Yeah, that really famous guy, ok!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.360
Now in mathematics the word "fame" means

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.230
something slightly different to what it means to everyone else.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.360
Eh, in maths means, "fame" means

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.350
every century someone will look your name up in obscure book.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.200
So I thought, you know what, I could try to find one.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.400
So I wanted to try and find the proper magic square, with all square numbers

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.640
cause there's 1000 Euros for that one, and that's what I'm after.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.560
[3-by-3 or..?]

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.400
3-by-3, I'm a purist. Do you want to see what I've found?

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.540
Right, here's the one I found.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:57.940
29,  1,   47,  41,  37,  1,  23,  41,  29

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.700
Alright! So there's my fella.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.920
There are a few problems with this one.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.420
For start, it does work! So, if I go through by square all of these,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.820
And then I check the adding-up

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.540
The total of this square is 3051.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.100
And it works for all the columns, it works for all of the rows.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.800
It only works for one of the diagonals.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.740
So this diagonal here works.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.080
This diagonal here doesn't work.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.080
and so it's semi magic square.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.720
Also, as you may have spotted, some of the numbers are in there more than once.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.460
So, you see there's two 41's, there's two 29's, there's two 1's!

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.100
Some people would say that makes it less of a magic square,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.880
BRADY HARAN: I would say that!

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.680
MATT PARKER: You would say that, you are with the vast majority of humans in that...

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.100
BRADY HARAN: You can just put all the same number in it.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.660
MATT PARKER: No, yeah ok, so no that's very good point.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.190
So a magic square all the same number over and over

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.280
would still technically be a very disappointing magic square.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.980
And so I mean, to be honest, it's a bit like:

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.220
You know, you always think your children or your pets are the greatest in the world

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.120
and you put a lot of videos of them up online.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.340
For me, everyone else is like:

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.160
"It's not a very nice square, is it? Don't, should we tell Matt?"

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.080
"He seems so excited about it."

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.860
You know what? I am excited about it. This is my square!

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.640
And so I will admit I'm looking at it through rose-tinted square glasses.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.840
But I like it, it's a semi magic square with repeated entries,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.820
and it got square numbers in it and...

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.040
My find.
BRADY HARAN: Has it got a name?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.880
MATT PARKER: That hasn't got a name, I don't want to call it the "Parker Square",

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.740
because it doesn't work properly, it would be like:
"Oh, that's a classic Parker Square."

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.620
or someone would do something that's almost right, but not quite, they would...

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.120
"That's a real Parker Square kind of move." So I'm not calling it the Parker Square!

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.280
BRADY HARAN: Matt, you know the video is called?

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.260
MATT PARKER: I'm calling it, oh, for crying out loud...

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.960
The first time you name something after me,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.020
and it's something that's not quite right!

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.320
You know what? Maybe it'll become the mascot,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.120
for giving things a go!

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.360
People suspect one may exist or may not, I don't know, but they can't rule it out.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.220
But it's generally agreed:

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.220
it's not achievable with our current computing power

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.800
or our current number theory to be able to find one of these...

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.220
But I gave it a go, right? And of course, I didn't find it.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.720
I found this. This adequate...

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.360
-You know, it's like...you know?
BRADY HARAN: I'll tell you what, Matt.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.040
I don't think this is our best Numberphile video,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.490
but it was a Parker Square of a Numberphile video...

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.820
MATT PARKER: Stop trying to make Parker Square a thing!

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.740
[he he he he...]

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.720
ROGER BOWLEY: Or this diagonal, or that diagonal they add up. Or this little square in here. They all add up to the same number.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.460
Which is 176.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.700
JAMES GRIME: The magic hexagon, if it exists, has to be of size 3.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.840
So it's three layers, you've got the one in the centre, you've got your second layer and your third layer...
