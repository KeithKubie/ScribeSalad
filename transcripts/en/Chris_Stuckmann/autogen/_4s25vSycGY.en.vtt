down my main issue with this movie is
that despite its adult humour and its

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
that despite its adult humour and its
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.810
that despite its adult humour and its
mature themes it only makes jokes about

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
mature themes it only makes jokes about
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.450

the more gut-wrenching emotion that they
could get out of some of the storylines

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
could get out of some of the storylines
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630
could get out of some of the storylines
in this movie like for instance the two

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
in this movie like for instance the two
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.100
in this movie like for instance the two
brothers grew and drew they were

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

wrong child there could be a lot of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
wrong child there could be a lot of
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.539
wrong child there could be a lot of
depth there but it's basically just

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
depth there but it's basically just
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340
depth there but it's basically just
