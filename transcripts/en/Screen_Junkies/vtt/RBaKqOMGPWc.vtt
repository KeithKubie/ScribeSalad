lines.

One man will achieve his lifelong dream of
finding aliens but somehow feels like a failure

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.470

a drop of black goo then impregnate our main
character with an squid baby which impregnates

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.329
an engineer which creates an alien that only
kinda looks like the aliens in the real movies

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.890
even though they already showed a picture
