00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.290
The last thing that I want to cover is
that you make sure that you get feedback

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.670
from users every step of the way.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.580
Feedback takes a lot of different forms,
and you've already seen how

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.830
you can conduct user research
to inform your business idea.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.960
You might try incorporating
a survey into your product.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.140
You could send these out each week or
month to collect feedback, or

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.280
you might even try and embed them
in some way into your product.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.040
Social media is another great way to
monitor early usage of your product, and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.280
have customers connect to your brand.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.820
App ratings, or user ratings, or website
ratings, are another way to understand

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.340
quantitatively, and qualitatively
what users think of your product.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.330
One app, which is called Circa News
provides the following guidance on

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.180
ratings.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.300
First, they recommend that you
just build a great product.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.520
If you don't build a great product,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.210
users aren't going to give you
good ratings in the first place.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.450
Secondly, don't annoy the users.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.630
You should really only ask them to rate
your product if they've had a good

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.790
experience and they've used
the product for a little bit.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.810
And finally, Circa News recommends
that you ask nicely, and

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.310
maybe even reward your users for
rating the app.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.930
For more details about their advice,
check out the article,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.120
which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.970
Finally, you should make
customer support everyone's job.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.720
You might have a dedicated email or

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.720
chat service that let's users
talk directly to employees.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.850
Former CCO, and co-founder of Kayak,
Paul English, went so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.050
far as putting the very loud phone
in the middle of the engineers.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.620
He reasoned that if the same
calls kept coming in,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.590
then the team would work quickly
to resolve the problems.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.230
This would likely resolve the same
problems that other users were facing.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.760
No matter which strategy you use,
you should think about

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.800
when you'll intercept users and
how you will respond to them.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.530
Your actions and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.150
improvements to your product can speak
just as loudly as individual follow ups.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.950
But do remember that these
experiences also contribute

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.710
to the user's experience and
their perception of the product.
