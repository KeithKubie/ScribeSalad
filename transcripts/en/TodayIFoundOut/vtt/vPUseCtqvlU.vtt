00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.939
How the Modern Calendar Came to Be

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.680
Perfecting a method of foretelling and predicting
the passage of time preoccupied our ancestors

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.000
from the earliest recorded history.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.300
The unending journey of the Sun, Moon and
stars across the great expanse of the sky

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.310
provides clues for numerous methods of marking
time, the most obvious to primitive man being

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.369
the passage of a day (light/dark) and that
of a month (based on phases of the Moon).

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.620
Measuring the exact length of a year is difficult,
but for our ancient ancestors’ less stringent

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.899
parameters, such as when a certain tree would
bloom, was sufficient proof to denote the

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.609
beginning of a new year.

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.269
The ancient Egyptians knew that to calculate
an accurate measurement of a year, it was

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.679
necessary to take note of where the stars
are in the sky at any given time.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.180
Specifically, the priests of Egypt used Sirius,
the Dog Star, to predict the flooding of the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.969
Nile annually, which gave them the appearance
of being able to foretell this event.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.949
Studying Sirius also enabled the Egyptians
to become the first civilization to switch

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.979
from a lunar to a solar calendar.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.480
The ancient Babylonians utilized a lunar calendar.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.720
Even today, the Muslim and Jewish calendars
remain lunar-based.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.659
Nice, if you like tradition, but using a lunar
calendar poses a major problem as well.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.330
A lunar month is 29.5 days, meaning 12 lunar
months add up to 354 lunar days, which is

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.950
about 11 days short of a solar year.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.049
To solve this problem, some lunar calendars
add an extra month every now and then to make

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.010
up for lost time, which is how it is handled
with the Jewish calendar.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.200
However, the Egyptian priests’ study of
Sirius allowed them to count the exact number

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.859
of days in a solar year.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.880
They then arranged the lunar months into 12
month intervals, making each of them 30 days

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.719
in length with five added days at the end
of the year.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.810
Sounds pretty good, but there is a problem,
which is that every four years Sirius shows

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.979
up a day late.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.490
The reason for this is that the solar year
is really closer to 365 days and six hours,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.520
which the Egyptians never took into account,
though they were aware of the issue.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.920
This resulted in the calendar taking a backward
slide as a lunar one would do, only at a much

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.200
slower pace.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.509
By the time of the Roman Empire under Julius
Caesar, the calendar, which was out of sync

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.539
by about three months, was in desperate need
of tweaking.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.460
With the help of Sosigenes, a renowned astronomer
from Alexandria, Julius Caesar started a new

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.020
calendar on January 1, 45 B.C.- a calendar
that came closer to the solar year than any

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.780
of its predecessors and became known as the
“Julian Calendar”.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.800
Sosigenes informed Caesar that the actual
length of the solar year is 365 days and six

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.820
hours, as the Egyptian priests had known.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.040
Sosigenes felt the logical solution was to
simply add a day to February, the shortest

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.320
of the Roman months, every fourth year.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.060
This made up the difference, and with this
clever idea the leap year was born.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.080
This calendar quickly spread across the entire
Roman Empire, and was also used throughout

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.590
Christendom for centuries.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.100
And yet, once again, an error popped up.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.130
It turns out, that the solar year isn’t
actually 365 days and six hours after all.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.680
It’s actually 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes
and 46 seconds.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.870
This only amounts to a discrepancy of a single
day over 130 years, but when you’re talking

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.690
millennia you have no choice but to nitpick.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.350
By the 1500s, the seemingly minor glitch of
calculating the solar year to be 11 minutes

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.670
and 14 seconds shorter than it is led to about
a 10 day gap between the calendar and the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.130
real solar year.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.440
This posed a particular problem around the
equinoxes, which were occurring 10 days earlier

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.250
than the dates on the calendar denoted they
should be.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.860
Clearly something needed to be done, so Pope
Gregory XIII asked Christopher Clavius, a

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.870
Jesuit astronomer, to help him solve the problem.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.460
Quickly discovering that the error in question
amounts to 3 days over a span of 400 years,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.360
he devised a brilliant solution to the predicament.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.250
The ingenious astronomer put forth the suggestion
that years ending in ’00 should from that

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.830
point on only be leap years if they could
be divided by 400.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.660
By doing so, three leap years are eradicated
every three centuries, providing a tidy solution

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.740
to the problem.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.130
The proposal, named after the Pope responsible
for hiring its mastermind (rather than the

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.980
mastermind), was put into use in the Papal
States in 1582.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.070
The Gregorian calendar was quickly picked
up by Spain, Portugal, France and the Italian

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.740
states the following year.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.590
This was a time of great religious upheaval
in Europe, and many of the Protestant states

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.900
were in no great rush to concede that the
Bishop of Rome was right about anything.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.320
The Lutheran states of Germany finally got
around to making the change in 1700, while

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.380
Great Britain put it off until 1752.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.020
Even though by that point Britain had accrued
a sizable gap of 11 days, many people protested

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.510
violently when the change was made.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.130
Russia did not convert to the Gregorian calendar
until after the Russian Revolution in 1917.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.580
(The funny thing was, in 1908, the Russian
Olympic team arrived 12 days late to the London

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.290
Olympics because of it.)

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.430
Further technological advances in the 20th
century made it possible to hone the accuracy

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.570
of the Gregorian calendar even more.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.900
For instance, it has been suggested that to
fix a small error in the Gregorian calendar,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.070
one day should be added every 3,323 years,
and years divisible by the number 4000 will

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.490
not be leap years.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.680
So, the next time you’re scribbling down
your dental appointment on your handy-dandy

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.580
calendar, take a moment to appreciate its
long and noble evolution.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.900
The calendar so casually given to you during
the Holidays sits in your hands thanks to

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.510
the input of Egyptian priests, Julius Caesar
and co. and a Pope and his trusty Jesuit astronomer.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.510
Bonus Fact:

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.730
On the other side of the pond, a calendar
had been devised, not unlike the one the Romans

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.430
had come up with, by a culture in Central
America called the Olmecs, and was fine tuned

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.980
around the first century AD by the Mayans.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.200
The Mayans, having concluded that there were
365 days in a year, fashioned a calendar consisting

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.639
of 18 months including 20 days each.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.550
They rounded out the year by adding five days
at the end which were considered to be very

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.550
unlucky.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.430
Another aspect unique to the Mayan calendar
is what is called the “Calendar Round”,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.780
which is a cycle lasting 52 years in which
every day has its own individual name – none

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:08.410
are repeated.
