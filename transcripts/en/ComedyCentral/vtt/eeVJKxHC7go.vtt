00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:04.371
- So then I said to him,
"James, that's not my cat.

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:05.705
"That's my dad."

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.040
(both laugh)

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.208
- That is so funny.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.244 align:start position:0%
That reminds me of the time
that my cat got out of the house

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.545
and climbed that
palm tree, and--

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:13.446
- Oh, you already
told me that one.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.947
- Oh.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:16.015
- Have I ever told you about
the time that my ex-girlfriend

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.617
thought a tree was a mammal?

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:18.884
- Yeah, you told me that.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
I ever tell you about
the time that my ex tree

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.220 align:start size:84% position:16%
thought my girlfriend
was a mammal?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.421
- Yeah, you did
tell me that one.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:23.923 align:start size:84% position:16%
Did I ever tell
you about that time

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.391
that I almost hung myself
with my tie on purpose?

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:26.892
- Yes.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:27.793
Did I ever tell you about the
time that I shot a squirrel

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.862
and I loved watching it bleed?

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.297
- Yeah, have I ever
told you about the--

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.365
- Yeah, have I ever told
you about the time that I--

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.400
- Yeah, have I ever told--

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.233
- Yeah, have I--

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.768
- Yeah.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.904
- I guess we've run out of
things to say to each other.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.772
- Really, we haven't even
known each other that long.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.609 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Just happens
that way sometimes.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:47.413 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I guess we'll
just be quiet now.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.247
Oh!

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.082
- Don't.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:49.916
It's over.
