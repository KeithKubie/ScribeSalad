00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.890
How do you fill out this frame, David?

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; The way I did it is I started off by
writing down what I need to expect about

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.920
an earthquake.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.030
I knew that earthquakes
happen on a particular day.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.760
They happen at a particular location.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.430
They cause a certain amount of damage,
a certain number of fatalities.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.000
They happen on a certain fault
line with certain magnitude.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.200
They occur at a certain time.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.000
There are different types
of earthquakes, and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.890
they all have a certain
duration to them.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.900
I then went to the story to try and
find the fillers for

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.390
the slots I had just written down.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.820
So the time was today, the location
was Lower Slabovia, and so on.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.060
Some slots didn't have fillers in
the story, but that's all right.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.570
&gt;&gt; That's good, David.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.770
Let us note a couple of
things in David's answer.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.210
First, the slots are part of
David's background knowledge

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.710
about stereotypical earthquakes.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.330
Second, these fillers for
the slots are coming from the story.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.233
This is a very good example of
how both bottom-up processing and

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.560
top-down processing getting combined.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.884
As the story came,
David noticed the word earthquake,

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:55.800
went into a long-term memory.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.373
&gt;From a semantic memory he
pulled out the frame for

00:00:58.373 --> 00:01:02.639
the earthquake which told him what slots
to look for, and then he used bottom-up

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.800
processing to try to figure out
what values to put in there.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.814
But note the limitation of this
combination of top-down and

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:10.830
bottom-up processing also.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.220
Imagine a different story.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.420
Here is a second story.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.510
If you read the second story and
compare it to the first one,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.120
you begin to see that there are lots
of subtle and nuanced meanings here.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.770
So killed here will
happen to 25 proposals,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.673
killing here refers to 25 people.

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:28.501
Sadie Hawkins here was
a science advisor,

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:31.410
Sadie Hawkins here was
the name of a fault.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.910
The frame knowledge representation of
itself and by itself doesn't tell us

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.790
how to pick Sadie Hawkins as a science
advisor, and not as a fault.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.480
Or whether the killing of 25 proposals,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.360
how does it relate with
killing of 25 people?

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.080
We will return to this topic, and
we'll talk more about it when we come to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.750
understanding and
common-sense reasoning in a few weeks.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.600
&gt;&gt; Or if you're interested in reading
about this now, you can go ahead and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.670
go watch those lessons.
