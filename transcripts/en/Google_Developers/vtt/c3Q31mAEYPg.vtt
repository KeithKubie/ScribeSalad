00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:02.767
[applause]

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:04.033
Gibbs: Thanks.

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.634
You know, that actually
ends our tour

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:07.767
through our end to end
Java support for App Engine

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:09.367
and our campfire one tonight.

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:11.234
Now what have I shown you
this evening?

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.601
What have we talked about?

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.534
Well, I talked about
some new features

00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:16.400
that we put out
for App Engine,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.033
namely the ability to purchase
additional resources,

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.300
our cron support
for scheduled tasks,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.934
the ability to import and export
large amounts of data,

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:26.000
and the ability
to access data

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.033
that's behind the firewall.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.000
Then I told you
a little bit more

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.968
about our early look
at end to end Java support.

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:35.767
That includes Java Runtime
for App Engine,

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.901
our Google Web Toolkit support
for building your UI,

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.167
and the Eclipse integration
which ties it all together.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.267
Finally then
I showed you some demos,

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:46.267
and I also brought up
some demos from partners

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.267
who are using this stuff
in the real world

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:51.133
to solve real-world problems.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.067
Now we think we've made a lot
of progress with App Engine

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:55.200
over the past year.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.934
We know that we still
have lots left to do.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:58.501
There's a lot of tasks
in front of us

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.501
and a lot of things
we need to solve.

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.267
And that's why this early--

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:04.100
That's why
our Java release tonight

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.701
is an early look.

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:07.467
We know it's not yet complete,

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.133
particularly,
as I've mentioned,

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.133
for a lot of software libraries
and frameworks,

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.000
we think they're gonna
take some adjustments

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.434
to get them running smoothly
on App Engine.

00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:17.400
But we think
the best way to do that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.300
is to put the software
in your hands

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.234
so you can use it
and tell us what works

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:23.567
and what doesn't
and help us fix it.

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.634
So tonight we're opening
the early look

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.300
at Java support and App Engine

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.234
to the first 10,000 developers
who sign up.

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:33.300
After that,
we'll be letting in more people

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.033
in the coming months.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:36.701
And finally,
when we're ready,

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:38.334
and we think it's ready
for everyone,

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:40.868
we'll open up sign-ups
to the world.

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:44.467
So please, log in,
sign up, give it a try,

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.300
and let us know
what you think

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.601
about our Java support
for App Engine.

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.634
And that's pretty much it.

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:52.534
Now I have one other thing
I wanted to mention,

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:55.868
which is our Google--
plug for Google I/O,

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:57.968
our developer conference
coming up in May.

00:01:57.968 --> 00:01:59.934
There'll be two days
packed full of sessions

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:01.834
about App Engine,
Google Web Toolkit,

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:04.267
and other technologies
seen tonight.

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:06.334
And they've also told me
that for those of you

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.334
who are here in person,
in the audience,

00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:10.300
that underneath your chairs

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.467
some of them have
a golden ticket,

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.968
which will give you
admission for two people

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.067
to Google I/O.

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:18.801
So you can check for that.

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.634
And otherwise, thank you,
everyone, for coming out,

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:23.200
and please join me
for some birthday cake.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.133
[applause]

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.300
