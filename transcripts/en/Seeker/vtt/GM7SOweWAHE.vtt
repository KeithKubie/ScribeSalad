00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.530
Imagine if I told you everything you knew
about dogs and cats was wrong… because we

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.730
decided that some animals we’d been calling
dogs were actually cats.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.669
If that happened, you’d probably have questions,
right?

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:14.959
Well, that.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:15.959
just.

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:16.959
happened.

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:18.770
This is a part of the dinosaur family tree.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.109
On the left is the family that contains the
Brontosaurus, Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:29.259
all over here in the Saurischia.Then here
in the Ornithischia is the Stegosaurus and

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.580
Torosaurus (a.k.a, Triceratops).

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.950
Saurischia, Ornithischia -- aren’t randomly
assigned names.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.230
As humans found more and more of these ancient
bones, we started putting them into groups…

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.230
and just like Chubbs said, it’s all in the
hips.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.530
These animals have three bones in their hips:
the Ilium, Ischium and Pubis.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.550
On Saurischians, they’re arranged like this.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.480
This is called LIZARD HIPPED -- great band
name.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.149
And in Ornithischians they’re like this
-- called BIRD HIPPED.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.149
Theropoda means beast-footed.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.149
It’s a sub-category.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.149
Big.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.149
Difference.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.220
And this is how paleontologists started categorizing
these animals to trace their ancestry… it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.340
dates back to 1887.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.340
Until now.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.200
In 2017, British scientists analyzed the anatomical
samples and you know what.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.659
Their hips don’t lie.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.939
Here’s what they’re proposing.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.330
Ornithischians are not a separate group, but
in fact, grouped with Theropods -- they want

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.820
to call this group Ornithoscelida -- a name
thrown out in 1887, btw.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.829
THEN if that weren’t crazy enough…

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.520
This paper alleges, that the anatomy indicates
the Saurischia are actually TWO groups.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.719
Sauropodomorphs should be its own category
-- meaning Diplodocus and Brontosaurus might

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.360
not even be dinosaurs.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.740
What?!

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.830
First you tell me the triceratops isn’t
real, and now Brontosaurus might not even

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.299
be a dinosaur.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.930
But that’s not all... the analysis also
says dinosaurs are almost 100 million years

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.460
older than we thought they were -- at 247
million years.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.180
And that they may have evolved in the Northern
Hemisphere rather than the Southern.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.070
There’s obviously a lot here.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.980
The important thing to remember is, your favorite
dinosaurs aren’t going anywhere.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.190
But the way we’re thinking about how to
organize them in complex charts like this

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.610
-- is being completely rewritten.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.340
To do that… the researchers created a computerized
model.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.770
They took three years, visiting museums filled
with dinosaurs all over the world.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.520
They used the data available to calculate
457 different anatomical characteristics of

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.390
many species of dino (there are over 1,000
known) -- and looked for patterns.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.140
From there, they made a computer model to
form the best tree of life based on the data.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.000
They plugged in the numbers over the years,
and clicked go.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.890
In five minutes it analyzed 32 billion different
trees and picked the best one.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.090
Done and done.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.580
The click heard ‘round the Jurassic World
didn’t immediately change everything though.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.790
They’re just suggesting the tree be rewritten.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.230
130 years of tradition isn’t going to be
swept away overnight.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.410
Now lots of nerds all over the world are going
to debate dinosaur hips.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.410
Yep.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.810
It’s going to get lit.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.850
Now that it’s generally accepted dinosaurs
became birds, paleontologists are trying to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.920
find out where the first dinosaur evolved,
and how -- hoping to reveal more about the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.090
history of life on our planet.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.650
We only know dinosaurs exist today because
of the bones of a few that died in very specific

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.170
ways -- allowing their bodies (or tiny parts
of them) to be preserved.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.220
There will be potentially thousands of species
that we never find, and could have existed

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.600
completely without our knowledge.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.940
So we have to base our understanding on what
is left.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.460
One of the researchers put it humbly, and
well.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.050
Just because this is backed up by data “doesn’t
mean it’s right, just that it’s the best

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.720
we can do with the data we’ve got at the
moment.”

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.180
I mean, if scientists were potentially wrong
about something as fundamental as whether

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.910
these dinosaurs were bird-like or lizard-like…
what else might science have to revise in

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.240
the future…

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.960
Research More Needed Is.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.410
So ... are you curious how dinosaurs even
evolved into birds?

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.160
I’ve got a video for you explaining that,
right here.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.310
What do you think of these new classifications?

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.200
