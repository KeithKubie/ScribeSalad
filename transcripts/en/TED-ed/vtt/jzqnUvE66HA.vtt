00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:14.860
The geography of our planet is in flux.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.914
Each continent has ricocheted around
the globe on one or more tectonic plates,

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.890
changing quite dramatically with time.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.013
Today, we'll focus on North America

00:00:25.013 --> 00:00:27.358
and how its familiar landscape
and features

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:31.354
emerged over hundreds 
of millions of years.

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:35.112
Our story begins about 
750 million years ago.

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:38.480
As the super continent Rodinia
becomes unstable,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.395
it rifts along what's now the west coast
of North America

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:44.757
to create the Panthalassa Ocean.

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:48.193
You're seeing an ancestral continent
called Laurentia,

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:51.357
which grows over the next few hundred
million years

00:00:51.357 --> 00:00:55.983
as island chains collide with it
and add land mass.

00:00:55.983 --> 00:00:58.820
We're now at 400 million years ago.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.077
Off today's east coast, the massive
African plate inches westward,

00:01:03.077 --> 00:01:05.728
closing the ancient Iapetus Ocean.

00:01:05.728 --> 00:01:10.446
It finally collides with Laurentia 
at 250 million years

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:13.726
to form another supercontinent Pangea.

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:16.230
The immense pressure causes
faulting and folding,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.071
stacking up rock to form 
the Appalachian Mountains.

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.365
Let's fast forward a bit.

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:25.545
About 100 million years later,
Pangea breaks apart,

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:27.948
opening the Southern Atlantic Ocean

00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:31.942
between the new North American Plate
and the African Plate.

00:01:31.942 --> 00:01:33.224
We forge ahead,

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:35.757
and now the eastward-moving 
Farallon Plate

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:38.507
converges with the present-day west coast.

00:01:38.507 --> 00:01:43.014
The Farallon Plate's greater density
makes it sink beneath North America.

00:01:43.014 --> 00:01:44.580
This is called subduction,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.041
and it diffuses water into
the magma-filled mantle.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.956
That lowers the magma's melting point

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:54.425
and makes it rise into the overlying
North American plate.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:58.007
From a subterranean chamber,
the magma travels upwards

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.038
and erupts along a chain of volcanos.

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:04.193
Magma still deep underground slowly cools,

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:07.041
crystallizing to form solid rock,

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.788
including the granite now found
in Yosemite National Park

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:12.756
and the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:14.727
We'll come back to that later.

00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:17.038
Now, it's 85 million years ago.

00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:19.767
The Farallon Plate becomes less steep,

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:24.044
causing volcanism to stretch eastward
and eventually cease.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:26.165
As the Farallon Plate subducts,

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:28.136
it compresses North America,

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:30.726
thrusting up mountain ranges
like the Rockies,

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:33.884
which extend over 3,000 miles.

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:37.916
Soon after, the Eurasian Plate rifts
from North America,

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.226
opening the North Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.945
We'll fast forward again.

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:44.725
The Colorado Plateau now uplifts,

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:47.763
likely due to a combination
of upward mantle flow

00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:50.540
and a thickened North American Plate.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.008
In future millennia, the Colorado River
will eventually sculpt the plateau

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.134
into the epic Grand Canyon.

00:02:57.134 --> 00:03:03.039
30 million years ago, the majority of
the Farallon Plate sinks into the mantle,

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.790
leaving behind only small corners 
still subducting.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.788
The Pacific 
and North American plates converge

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:13.637
and a new boundary 
called the San Andreas Fault forms.

00:03:13.637 --> 00:03:16.666
Here, North America moves to the south,

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:20.039
sliding against the Pacific Plate,
which shifts to the north.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.946
This plate boundary still exists today,

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:25.544
and moves about 30 millimeters per year

00:03:25.544 --> 00:03:28.916
capable of causing 
devastating earthquakes.

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:32.193
The San Andreas also pulls apart
western North America

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:34.506
across a wide rift zone.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:38.666
This extensional region is called
the Basin and Range Province,

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.568
and through uplift and erosion,

00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:46.198
is responsible for exposing the once deep
granite of Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada.

00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:49.320
Another 15 million years off the clock,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.383
and magma from the mantle burns
a giant hole into western North America,

00:03:54.383 --> 00:03:57.452
periodically erupting onto the surface.

00:03:57.452 --> 00:04:00.819
Today, this hotspot feeds 
an active supervolcano

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.360
beneath Yellowstone National Park.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.914
It hasn't erupted 
in the last 174,000 years,

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:08.919
but if it did,

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.509
its sheer force could blanket
most of the continent with ash

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:16.039
that would blacken the skies
and threaten humanity.

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.007
The Yellowstone supervolcano
is just one reminder

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:22.832
that the Earth continues 
to seethe below our feet.

00:04:22.832 --> 00:04:26.443
Its mobile plates put the planet
in a state of constant flux.

00:04:26.443 --> 00:04:28.887
In another few hundred million years,

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:32.511
who knows how the landscape
of North America will have changed.

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:36.072
As the continent slowly morphs
into something unfamiliar,

00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:38.788
only geological time will tell.
