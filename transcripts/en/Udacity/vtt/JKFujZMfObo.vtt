00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.660
Here we're going to talk about one
of my favorite topics in this class,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.630
Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.530
The idea of Intelligent Tutoring Systems
is that we know students learn best when

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.320
they have individualized,
just in time feedback,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.130
right there in the context
of the learning process.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.150
They learn best when they have
someone sitting with them saying, hey,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.600
you just made a mistake
on that kind of problem.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.530
Here's how to avoid that mistake for
next time.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.000
Or, great job on that problem.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.900
You didn't make the mistake
now that you made previously.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.900
The idea here is that,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.210
it's not that we don't want to give all
the students this kind of feedback.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.010
We definitely do, but we really
have difficulty doing so at scale.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.010
We can't give every single student
a one on one tutor to have during their

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.780
entire educational career.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.688
But with software we might
be able to come close.

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:39.550
Intelligent tutoring systems is
about creating software agents,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.660
that can provide that same kind of just
in time individualized feedback to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180
students while they're learning.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.680
And because they're software agents,
they're available all the time,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.040
they don't have an hourly
cost associated with them.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.160
They get past a lot of
the obstacles to having one-on-one

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.880
tutoring during your
entire educational career.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.110
So in this lesson we'll talk about
intelligent tutoring systems and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.150
some of the places they've
been most effective.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.225
We'll especially talk about how they
exist in two different general areas.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:05.280
Well-formed problem domains that
have a well-structured problem and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.510
a correct answer.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.460
And more poorly from problem
domains where the things to

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.550
learn are a little bit more fuzzy, and
a little bit more difficult to observe.
