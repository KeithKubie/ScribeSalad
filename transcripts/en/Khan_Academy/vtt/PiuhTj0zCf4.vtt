00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.420
Let's say I've got some linear
transformation T that is a

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.970
mapping from Rn to Rn.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.570
So if this is its domain, which
is just Rn, then its

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.670
codomain is also Rn.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.400
If you give me some vector in
our domain, let's call that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.650
vector x, then T will map it
to some other member of Rn,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.770
which is also the codomain.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.790
So it'll map it over here.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.690
We could call that the mapping
of T, or the mapping

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.700
of x, or T of x.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.850
Since T is a linear
transformation, we know that

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.740
the mapping of x to its codomain
is equivalent to x

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.980
being multiplied by
some matrix A.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.470
So we know that this thing right
here is equal to some

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.600
matrix A times x.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.880
You've seen all of this
multiple, multiple times.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.720
Just to make sure we understand
the wording

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.960
properly, we said we've used
the word that A is the-- we

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750
could either call it the matrix
for T, or let's say

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:21.710
it's the transformation
matrix for T.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.950
Now, in the last couple of
videos, we've learned that the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.860
same vector can be represented
in different ways.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.810
It can be represented in
different coordinate systems.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.180
When I just write the vector x
like that, we just assume that

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.980
it's being represented in
standard coordinates, or it's

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.690
being represented with respect
to the standard basis.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.050
So let's be a little bit
more particular.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.530
This A is the transformation
for T only when x is

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.180
represented in standard
coordinates, or only when x is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.930
written in coordinates with
respect to the standard basis.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.875
So let me write a little
qualifier here.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:13.590
A is the transformation matrix
for T with respect to the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.840
standard basis.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.120
I never wrote this
blue part before.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.270
I never even said this blue part
before, because the only

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.560
coordinate system we were
dealing with was the standard

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.000
coordinate system or the
coordinates with respect to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.950
the standard basis.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.580
But now we know that there are
multiple coordinate systems.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.810
There are multiple ways to
represent this vector.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.690
There are multiple ways to
represent that vector, because

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.060
Rn has multiple spanning
bases.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.010
There are multiple bases that
can represent Rn, and each of

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.630
those bases can generate a
coordinate system where you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.450
can represent any vector in Rn
with coordinates with respect

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.740
to any of those bases.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.470
So that last part I said was a
bit of a mouthful, so let me

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.880
make it a little bit
more concrete.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.980
Let's say that I have some basis
B that's made up of n--

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.840
it has to be linearly
independent.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.010
That's the definition of a
basis-- of n vectors v1, v2,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.480
all the way to vn.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.150
Now, these are n linearly
independent vectors.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.480
Each of these are
members of Rn.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:35.030
So B is a basis for Rn, which is
just another way of saying

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.060
that all of these vectors are
linearly independent and any

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.690
vector in Rn can be represented
as a linear

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.440
combination of these guys, which
is another way of saying

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.220
that any vector in Rn can be
represented with coordinates

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.410
with respect to this
basis right there.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.580
So the same vector x,
I'm going to put

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.770
the same dot here.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.630
When we represent it in standard
coordinates, it's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.730
just going to be that right
there, that vector x.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.540
But what if we want to represent
it in coordinates

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.090
with respect to this
new basis?

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.990
Well, then that same vector
x will look like this.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.240
We would denote it by this.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.660
The same vector can be
represented with respect to

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.220
this basis.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.519
This could be some set
of coordinates.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.270
This would be some other set of
coordinates, but it's still

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210
representing the same basis.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.720
Likewise, this vector right
here, that vector right there,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.980
is also in Rn.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.300
So it can be represented by
some linear combination of

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.100
these guys, or you can represent
it with coordinates

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.920
with respect to this basis.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.940
So that same point right there,
I could represent it.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.680
So that point is this.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.700
But I could represent it with
coordinates with respect to my

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.380
basis just like that.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.390
So this is an interesting
question.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.210
This should maybe bring
an interesting

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.140
question into your brain.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.270
If I start off with something
that's in standard

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.360
coordinates, and I apply the
transformation T-- that's like

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.010
applying this matrix A to it or
multiplying that thing in

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.780
standard coordinates times the
matrix A-- I then get the

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.770
mapping of T in standard
coordinates.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.300
Now, what if I start off with
that thing in nonstandard

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.610
coordinates if I have
coordinates with respect to

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.590
this other basis here?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.365
Well, T should still
map it to this guy.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.520
The transformation, no matter
what, should always map from

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.700
that dot to that dot.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.640
It shouldn't care what
your coordinates are.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.750
So T should still map to
that same exact point.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.940
T should still be a linear
transformation.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.850
It can map from x to T of x, but
that's the same thing as

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.940
mapping from this kind of way
of labeling x to this way of

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.100
labeling x.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:58.720
So we could say maybe this guy
right here could be some other

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.285
matrix times this
guy over here.

00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:02.810
So let me write this
over here.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.460
These are just different
coordinate systems. I

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.650
shouldn't just even say maybe.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.146
This guy should be able
to be represented.

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:20.830
So if I represent the mapping
of x in our codomain in

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.300
coordinates with respect to B--
so that's what that guy is

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.980
right there-- so if I want to
represent that dot with this

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.120
other coordinate system,
coordinates with respect to

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.970
this basis, it should be
equal to the product

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.170
of some other matrix.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.650
Let me call that
other matrix D.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.740
Some other matrix D times this
representation of x times the

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.230
coordinates of x with respect
to my alternate nonstandard

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.400
coordinate system.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.290
I should be able to find some
matrix D that does this.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:02.140
Then we would say that D is the

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:12.270
transformation matrix for T.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.120
A assumes that you have x in
terms of standard coordinates.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.720
Now D assumes that you have x in
coordinates with respect to

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:35.440
this basis, so with respect
to the basis B.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.550
There's no reason why we
shouldn't be able to do this.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.090
These things are just different
ways of representing

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.910
the exact same vector,
the exact same

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.860
dot in our sets here.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.820
So if I represent it one way,
the standard way, I multiply

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.180
by A, and I get Ax.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.760
If I represent it in nonstandard
coordinates, I

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.970
should be able to multiply it
by some other matrix and get

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.500
another nonstandard coordinate
representation of what

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.270
it gets mapped to.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:05.420
So let's see if we can find
some relation between

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.510
D and between A.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.200
So we learned a couple of videos
ago that there's a

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.900
change of basis matrix that we
can generate from this basis.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.420
It's pretty easy to generate.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.690
The change of basis matrix is
just a matrix whose columns

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.865
are these basis vectors, so
v1, v2-- I shouldn't put a

00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:28.160
comma there.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.840
These are just the columns--
v2 all the way to vn.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.530
This is an n-by-n matrix.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.220
Each of these guys are members
of Rn and we have n of them.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.760
This is an n-by-n matrix where
all of the columns are

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.570
linearly independent, so we
know that C is invertible.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.010
These are column vectors
right here.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.650
So we know that C
is invertible.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:59.040
We learned in the last two or
three videos that if we have

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.860
some vector x, and it's being
represented by coordinates

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.600
with respect to our basis B, we
can just multiply that by

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.950
C, and we'll get our vector x.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.350
This essentially will tell us
the linear combination of

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.160
these guys that'll get us x.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:25.980
Since C is invertible, we also
saw that if we have the

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.380
standard format for x, or the
standard coordinates for x, we

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.970
can multiply that
by C inverse.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:43.020
That will get us the coordinates
for x with respect

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.080
to the basis B.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.310
These two things, if you just
multiply both sides of this

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.460
equation-- let me do it in a
different color-- if you just

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.310
multiply both sides of this
equation by C inverse on the

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.290
left-hand side, you're
going to get this

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.310
equation right there.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.450
Now given that, let's
see if we can find

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.170
some type of relation.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.740
Let's see what D times
xB is equal to.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.420
So let's say if we take D times
xB, so this thing right

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:22.740
here should be equal to D times
the representation or

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.130
the coordinates of x with
respect to the basis B.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.510
That's what we're claiming.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.550
We're saying that this guy
is equal to D times the

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.200
representation of x with respect
to the coordinates

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.440
with respect to the basis B.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.060
Let me write all of this down.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.940
I'll do it right here, because I
think it's nice to have this

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.660
graphic up here.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:52.400
So we can say that D times
xB is equal to

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.660
this thing right here.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.960
It's the same thing as the
transformation of x

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.990
represented in coordinates with
respect to B, or in these

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.230
nonstandard coordinates.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.890
So it's equal to the
transformation of x

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.420
represented in this coordinate
system, represented in

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.460
coordinates with respect to B.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.190
We see that right there.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.370
But what is the transformation
of x?

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.950
That's the same thing
as A times x.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.790
That's kind of the standard
transformation if x was

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.050
represented in standard
coordinates.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.670
So this is equal to x in
standard coordinates

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.900
times the matrix A.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.740
Then that will get us to this
dot in standard coordinates,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.830
but then we want to convert
it to these nonstandard

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.970
coordinates just like that.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:49.050
Now, if we have this, how can
we just figure out what the

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.550
vector Ax should look like?

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.330
What this vector should
look like?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.990
Well, we can look at this
equation right here.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.570
We have this.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.920
This is the same
thing as this.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.150
Actually.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.010
we want to go the other way.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.670
We have this.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.180
We have that right there.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.090
That's this right there.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.820
We want to get just this dot
represented in regular

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.680
standard coordinates.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.310
So what do we do?

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.740
We multiply it by C.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.330
Let me write it this way.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.350
If we multiply both sides
of this equation times

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.130
C, what do we get?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.785
We get this right here.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.780
Actually, no.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.250
I was looking at the right
equation the first time.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:38.490
We have this right here, which
is the same-- first intuition

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.660
is always right.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.100
We have this, which is the same
thing as this right here.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.510
So this can be rewritten.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:50.690
This thing can be rewritten
as C inverse-- we

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:51.690
don't have an x here.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:57.690
We have an Ax here, so
C inverse times Ax.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:03.130
The vector Ax represented in
these nonstandard coordinates

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.930
is the same thing as multiplying
the inverse of our

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.835
change of basis matrix
times the vector Ax.

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:15.510
If I have my vector Ax and I
multiply it times the inverse

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.160
of the change of basis matrix,
I will then have a

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.460
representation of the vector
Ax in my nonstandard basis.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.500
Now, what is the vector
x equal to?

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.870
Well, the vector x is equal to
our change of basis matrix

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.230
times x represented in these
nonstandard coordinates.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:43.340
So this is going to be equal to
C inverse A times x. x is

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.550
just the same thing as C.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:54.200
x is just C times our
nonstandard coordinates for x,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.210
just like that.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.360
Let me summarize it, just
because I waffled a little bit

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.736
on this point right there
just because I got

00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:01.080
a little bit confused.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.710
If I start off with the
nonstandard representation of

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.710
x, or x in coordinates
with respect to B, I

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.000
multiply them times D.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.490
So if I start with this, I
multiply them times D, I get

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.580
to that point right there.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.600
So this right there is
the same thing as

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.000
this point right there.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.500
That point right there should
be the nonstandard

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:27.070
representation of the
transformation of x, or the

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.310
coordinates of the
transformation of x with

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.730
respect to B.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.010
Now, the transformation of
x, if x is in standard

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.080
coordinates, is just
A times x.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.830
So this is just A times x.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.650
But I want to represent it in
these nonstandard coordinates.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:47.750
Now, A times x in nonstandard
coordinates is the same thing

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:53.290
as C inverse times A times x, if
you think this is the same

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.860
thing as this.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.730
So if you have this and you
want to represent it in

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.396
nonstandard coordinates, you
multiply it by C inverse, so

00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:01.360
then you'll get that
representation in nonstandard

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.530
coordinates.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.150
Then finally, we say look, x is
the same thing as C times

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.330
the nonstandard coordinate
representation of x.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.840
So we can replace x with
that right there.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:22.530
So the big takeaway here is that
D times the coordinates

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:30.280
of x with respect to the basis
B is equal to C inverse A

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:37.300
times C times the coordinates
of x with respect

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.550
to the basis B.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:47.170
So D must be equal
to C inverse AC.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:16:07.240
So if D is the transformation
matrix for T with respect to

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:26.970
the basis B-- and let me write
here-- and C is the change of

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:41.830
basis matrix for B-- let me
write that down, might as well

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:47.030
because this is our big
takeaway-- and A is the

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:55.800
transformation-- I'll write it
in shorthand-- matrix for T

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:09.910
with respect to the standard
basis, then we can say-- this

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.240
is the big takeaway-- that D,
our matrix D, is equal to C

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.750
inverse times A times C.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.099
That's our big takeaway from
this video, which is really

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.089
interesting.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.920
I don't want you to
lose this point.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.170
We now understand that A is
just for a certain set of

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:31.670
coordinates.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.670
But there's arbitrary different
bases that we can

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.340
use to represent Rn, so we can
have different matrices that

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.580
represent the linear
transformation under different

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.900
coordinate systems. If we want
to figure out those different

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.160
matrices for different
coordinate systems, we can

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.790
essentially just construct the
change of basis matrix for the

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.820
coordinate system we care about,
and then generate our

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.100
new transformation matrix with
respect to the new basis by

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.700
just applying this result.
