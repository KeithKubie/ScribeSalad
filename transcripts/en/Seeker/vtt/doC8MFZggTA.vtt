00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.489
Did you know the hardest part of our body
isn’t our bones, but the enamel that covers

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:04.520
our teeth?

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.320
And now scientists are on the cusp of figuring
out where this enamel came from!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.709
Hint: it once lurked in the briny deep during
the Silurian period!

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.049
Hello!

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:21.270
It’s Natalia Reagan for DNews and I’m
ready to take a bite a out of some science.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.380
Teeth- they are amazing!

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.900
They can tell us so much about someone’s
diet, background, overall health, their hygiene

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.020
(or lack thereof)!

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.020
Heck!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.480
Teeth aren’t just for eating- We can even
tell if our ancestors used their teeth to

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.170
make tools- how great is that!

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.320
But human teeth also contain the hardest mineral
in the body- enamel!

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.730
And nearly all tetrapods- or 4 limbed land
dwelling animals- have enamel on their teeth,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.730
too.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.340
But what exactly IS enamel?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.320
Tooth enamel is the hardest tissue in the
human body and it's comprised mostly of a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.690
mineral fittingly called hydroxyapatite, which
is crystalline calcium phosphate.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.010
This is the part of the tooth that dentists
are most concerned with preserving since it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.080
protects it from cavities and other dental
maladies.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.239
Even though it’s the top layer of the tooth,
it’s not responsible for the tooth’s color

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.530
as it’s transparent.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.690
But how did enamel get there in the first
place?!

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.730
Well, scientists have found that an ancient
fish might hold clues to how enamel came to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.260
cover our chompers.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.920
This fierce wee minipredator called Psarolepis
romeri cruised the seas 410 to 415 million

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.270
years ago.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.400
Scientists dissected the fossilized skull
of this minipredator and found that parts

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.619
of their scales and skull were comprised of
an enamel-like substance called ganoine.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.490
Their teeth, on the other hand, did not have
the enamel-like ganoine and were comprised

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.979
of naked dentine.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.260
Similarly, some living fish do not have enamel
on their teeth but some recognizable fish

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.100
like piranhas, grunts, and those ravenous
cartilaginous fish like this guy (point to

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100
shirt) do!

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.310
Yes, shark teeth are also made with a hard
mineral called fluoroapatite or fluorinated

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.759
calcium phosphate which is very similar to
hydroxyapatite, except with the added protection

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.759
of fluoride.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.610
That’s why sharks don’t get cavities!

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.909
So, how did enamel GET to our teeth from the
scales of ancient fish?

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.670
Time to get to the root of the problem!

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.409
Some scientists have surmised that the armored
scales on ancient fish evolved to become teeth.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.120
And if those scales had enamel on them, that
would explain how enamel made it’s way on

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120
our teeth.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.670
But, upon further analysis of Psarolepis romeri’s
fossilized skull and scales, it was clear

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.710
that the distribution of ganoine was not a
uniformed layer; the enamel was scattered.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.720
So perhaps the scales didn’t re-situate
themselves to become enamel covered teeth,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.260
but maybe the enamel production shifted south
to the teeth?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.260
Hmmmm….

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.670
That’s when scientists decided to look at
the genome of the modern-day spotted gar to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.849
understand the genetic building blocks of
enamel production.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.340
Researchers already knew that the gar, like
the ancient Psarolepis romeri, produces the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.190
hard enamel-like mineral called ganoine that
covers their scales.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.620
And when they looked at their genome they
found that the gar produces 2 of the 3 proteins

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.670
that comprise enamel, further supporting the
evidence that ganoine coated scales are like

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.390
the enamel coating of teeth.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.220
This discovery is making scientists rethink
the evolutionary process of how our teeth

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.940
became covered in enamel.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.110
Originally, researchers assumed that the enamel-coated
scales of fish shifted and eventually became

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.230
teeth, but these new findings suggest that
perhaps the actual body part did not move

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.100
from one place to another but that it was
just the enamel production that shifted from

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.879
one area of the body to another.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.130
But more research is needed...

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.610
So what’s the molar of the story?

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.709
We can learn a lot about our evolution from
some unexpected places and that teeth are

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.340
some of the coolest parts of our anatomy!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.450
Now you know a little more about teeth...did
you know that teeth can grow in tumors or

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.450
cyst?
