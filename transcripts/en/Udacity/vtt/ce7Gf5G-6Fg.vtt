00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's now look at the combined data set of height and weight.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It turns out both lists have the same elements, and the very first element

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in the height list is the same person as the weight in this list over here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The same is true for the second--so these data pair up conveniently to plot the height

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of a specific person and his or her weight.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I now want you to run a scatter plot. Remember how a scatter plot looked like.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Particularly, I want you to graph the height versus the weight,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the command to use is called scatterplot and accepts these two variables as input.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'd like you to try these out for the data I've given you.
