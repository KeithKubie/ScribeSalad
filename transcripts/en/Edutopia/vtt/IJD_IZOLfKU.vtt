00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:09.106
&gt;&gt;Student: We saw a bunch
of frost on everything,

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:11.716
so this is a picture of the bench.

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:15.056
&gt;&gt;Jordy: You've got your depth of
field right in the middle there.

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:16.546
How did you get it to do that?

00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:19.846
&gt;&gt;Student: This playlist on YouTube
gave us all these good ideas.

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.896
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Because our kids can
discover the vast amount of resources

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:26.636
that they have access to, kids
are then able to seek out answers,

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.256
rather than just ask for them.

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:31.256
&gt;&gt;Jordy: You get to try and
figure it out by yourself today.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:38.856
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh yeah.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.626
&gt;&gt;Mark: When you get kids collaborating
together, they become more resourceful.

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:48.836
They see themselves as experts, and the
teacher can oftentimes not guide them

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:50.826
to the answer, but to another resource.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.106
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Look around, people.

00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:54.366
These are your friends that
might need your help today.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.976
&gt;&gt;Kids need to learn teamwork based
skills, because every other class

00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:01.006
and every other subject that they
have, third through eighth grade,

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:04.476
requires them to work in different sized
groups, accomplishing different tasks.

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:06.546
So the learning goal today was,

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:10.156
how do I solve problems using the
people around me as a resource?

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:12.026
&gt;&gt;Who has had a problem so far?

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:12.846
Sean?

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:16.476
&gt;&gt;Student: So I got a picture and
then everything just disappeared.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.036
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Let's take a look
at this picture problem.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:18.976
Do you guys want to help me out?

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:20.346
&gt;&gt;Students: Yeah.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:22.646
&gt;&gt;Jessica: All right.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.716
&gt;&gt;When we get to a certain point in
a project, there are so many people

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:27.906
that have the same type of problem.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:29.336
&gt;&gt;Who is somebody that is an expert?

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:31.866
&gt;&gt;I try and remember who has had
similar problems and has gone

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.986
on to successfully solve them.

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:35.306
&gt;&gt;Student: First you go on the internet.

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:37.556
Then you click view image.

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:38.836
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Yeah, you got it.

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:41.806
&gt;&gt;Eloise: You get to help
people, and they'll help you.

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.536
Then you learn more and
make school easier.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.936
&gt;&gt;You right click it.

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:48.116
&gt;&gt;Ooh, we got it.

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:51.976
&gt;&gt;Another strategy that I use when kids
are having problems or need assistance--

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:53.486
&gt;&gt;What's your question?

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:55.346
&gt;&gt;Instead of just having
students raise their hand,

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:58.046
I have a clothespin system
that I call the help desk.

00:01:58.336 --> 00:01:59.696
&gt;&gt;We accidentally wrote it twenty B's.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:02.306
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Oh man.

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.996
&gt;&gt;The clip indicates that I'm
having a problem with something,

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:06.976
and I need somebody's help with it.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:09.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Our screen is frozen.

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:16.606
&gt;&gt;Eloise: I'm good at computers, so
people sometimes ask me to help them.

00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:18.936
&gt;&gt;Probably turn it off
and turn it on again.

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:21.406
&gt;&gt;Jessica: So at a certain point, I say,

00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:25.376
I'm now releasing anybody that's not
actively working to go and circulate

00:02:25.376 --> 00:02:26.996
and help with some of
these clips as well.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:29.176
They're psyched to be in that capacity.

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:31.436
&gt;&gt;Eloise: Is it the earth?

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:35.396
&gt;&gt;Sometimes I discover something
that I didn't know I could do.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.566
&gt;&gt;Jessica: All right, time to celebrate.

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:41.126
&gt;&gt;At the end of class, we build
each other up with celebrations.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:44.296
&gt;&gt;I want you to celebrate if
somebody was helping you today.

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:47.776
&gt;&gt;It's just a quick thing that gets
everybody fired up and really thinking,

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:49.426
well, what did this person do for me?

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:53.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Sophia helped
me do, like the pictures.

00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:56.046
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Sophia, do you hear that?

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:57.796
&gt;&gt;Sophia: Yeah.

00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:58.576
&gt;&gt;Jessica: How would you
like to be celebrated?

00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:00.976
&gt;&gt;I have a menu on my
wall of celebrations.

00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:04.806
&gt;&gt;All: [singing] Ah, ah, ah, ah,
you're really cool, you're really cool.

00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:09.766
&gt;&gt;Jessica: So we create this environment
where kids have an excitement and a fire

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:12.096
for finding the right
resource to solve the problem.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:14.586
&gt;&gt;You should feel really good
about what happened today.

00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:16.156
&gt;&gt;Student: Thank you, Miss Heckman.

00:03:16.376 --> 00:03:20.056
&gt;&gt;Jordy: In third, fourth grade,
one of the biggest goals is learning

00:03:20.056 --> 00:03:21.636
to solve your own problems.

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:26.116
And so I get kids that already have
some of that when they come to me.

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:27.546
&gt;&gt;Yeah, you need to quit for now.

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:30.276
&gt;&gt;In life, we have to be
able to teach ourselves.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.066
&gt;&gt;You need to make a new page.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:35.436
&gt;&gt;In my class, students
come up with a project idea.

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.686
&gt;&gt;Student: My project
is learning Turkish.

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:39.946
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm learning
how to play the ukulele.

00:03:42.086 --> 00:03:44.476
&gt;&gt;Student: I want to teach myself
how to get better looking photos.

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:49.516
&gt;&gt;Jordy: Students look at a template
that has a series of questions

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:52.536
that help them plan what
they want to do.

00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:55.386
What do they expect to
learn from this project?

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:57.256
What steps are they going to take?

00:03:57.776 --> 00:04:00.226
Who or what can they go
to when they get stuck?

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.256
&gt;&gt;Let's jump down to resources.

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:05.966
The people, the websites,
any books you used.

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:09.506
&gt;&gt;I'm not going to accept a proposal
where you don't have a resource to go

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:14.316
to if you get stuck, whether it's
an online forum, a YouTube channel.

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:15.236
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, Zoe, what's up?

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:17.656
&gt;&gt;Jordy: Another teacher,
a parent at home.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:18.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So you're going
to make your own acid.

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:20.686
&gt;&gt;Zoe: Yes.

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.376
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's the same
stuff that's in your stomach.

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:26.616
&gt;&gt;Zoe: We also learn managing your
time and kind of guiding yourself

00:04:27.186 --> 00:04:28.976
without having as much, like
people telling you what to do.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:30.946
&gt;&gt;Sodium chloride and--

00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:34.616
&gt;&gt;Jordy: When you are in high
school, when you're in college,

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:38.056
when you're in the workforce,
there are going to be a set

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:38.956
of projects that are not well defined.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:40.976
&gt;&gt;Zoe: Even though you're
learning hard stuff--

00:04:42.046 --> 00:04:43.866
&gt;&gt;Jordy: Students are going to
hit road bumps along the way.

00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:48.926
Can they get beyond those and
produce what they want to produce?

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:52.606
&gt;&gt;Mark: Because our students
are more resourceful,

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:57.286
they have more intrinsic motivation
within the learning process,

00:04:57.616 --> 00:05:01.266
and ultimately are learning
to be learners.
