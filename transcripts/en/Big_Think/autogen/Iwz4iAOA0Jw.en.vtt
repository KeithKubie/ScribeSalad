I decided okay let's do research and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
I decided okay let's do research and
 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.940
I decided okay let's do research and
find out how I can maybe control my

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950
find out how I can maybe control my
 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.890
find out how I can maybe control my
chemicals you know how I could cool the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900
chemicals you know how I could cool the
 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.110
chemicals you know how I could cool the
engine so I researched it in mindfulness

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120
engine so I researched it in mindfulness
 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.910
