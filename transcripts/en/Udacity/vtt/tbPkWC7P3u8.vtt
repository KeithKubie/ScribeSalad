00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
With these two completely different beliefs--Aristotle who says that objects fall

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
at a constant speed, and Galileo saying that objects gain speed as they fall,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
how do we reconcile these different opinions?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, we're scientists. We look at the evidence. Let's look at two pieces of evidence in particular.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
First, we have this idea that a mass dropped from a greater height leaves a greater impact,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and you could try this yourself.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Go outside and drop a brick from just barely off the ground

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then drop it again from higher off the ground.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You'll see that it'll make a bigger dent if you drop it from higher.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, Professor Settle mentioned earlier how difficult it is to actually

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
see anything when you drop an object.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, that's true except for when you drop something like a feather, and when you do that,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you can see that it really does tend to just drift down at more or less a constant speed.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, for each of these points, I want you to select one of these buttons.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Do this piece of evidence work in favor of Aristotle's belief or Galileo's

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and likewise for this one so you should check two of these buttons.
