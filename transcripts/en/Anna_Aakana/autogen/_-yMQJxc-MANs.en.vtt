00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.280
When I first heard about panic attacks, I thought they went something like this:

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.660
That you're just like sitting around, hanging out

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.800
when all of a sudden:

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.360
*gasps*

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.500
*loud heartbeats*

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.940
*breathing heavily*

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.540
Aaaaahhh!

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.160
But that is definitely not what happened.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.540
When I had my first panic attack a few years ago,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.160
it was insane.  I like couldn't move, it was so hard to breathe,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.540
my heart was racing, and I just had this like insane inexplicable feeling of fear.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.960
And it was weird, you know, because your head says:

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.580
Dude!  Everything is fine.  You're having a great time.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.480
There's no logical reason for this.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.680
But your body responds:

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.500
Ahhh!

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.340
Panic attacks just suck.  They do.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.760
And I don't know if this happens for you, but for me

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
it's so much more frustrating because you don't know why it's happening.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.380
Like, I was having a great time when all of a sudden

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.900
it just invaded my life.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.060
Ahhh!

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.360
And I feel very lucky becasue my therapist gave me

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.200
a lot of advice on how to try to deal with it without medication.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.780
Like, cutting down on all that caffeine I was drinking,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480
and practicing relaxation techniques,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.500
and eating better, and exercising regularly

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700
and all this stuff we know we're suppose to do but we don't.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.560
Until you just absolutely need to, to live.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.760
So, if you are suffering from any kind of panic attack or anxiety

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.480
please seek whatever help you need because that shit sucks.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.560
On a lighter note, I am really happy to say that today's episode is sponsored by a book!

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.740
Yes a book!  They still exist!

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.240
And it's alive!  It's "Alive!"

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600
Well "Alive" is written by New York Times Bestseller

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.840
Scott Sigler.  And it's book 1 of the Generations Trilogy that's coming out on July 14th.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.660
So "Alive" is about a teenage girl who wakes up in a coffin

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.380
with no memory of who she is or how she got there.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.820
She has to fight her way out only to discover that there is

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.320
11 more coffins just like hers.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.580
But the survivors don't have any answers so the reader follows her

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.900
as she goes to seek them out.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.700
You can watch the full trailer of "Alive" here and you can purchase the book when it comes out

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.760
