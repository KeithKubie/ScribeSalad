00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.880
PROFESSOR: So these are the
scores from test number two.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.560
The celebration.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.290
And as you can see, the
average has gone down.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
So as I've said in the past, I
think everybody in this room

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.400
has the intellectual capacity
to be here.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.415
Some people choose
to be there.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.710
I don't know why they choose to
be there, why they choose

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.140
not to go to recitation, why
they choose not to try the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.840
homework, why they choose not
to go to office hours, why

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.250
they choose not to read.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.500
But I guarantee you,
when you make that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.980
choice you will be here.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.940
And I have no requirements
whatsoever to pass a certain

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.870
number of people.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.790
I can give everybody
A's if I want.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.890
And I can take a large number
of people-- you

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.030
know, look at this.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.870
The way this is right now,
the failure rate will be

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.120
abnormally high.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.900
So I would warmly recommend that
if you're down here, that

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.235
you look in the mirror and ask
yourself a few questions.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.620
OK.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.160
Let's get to the lesson.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.980
We're going to start
a new unit today.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.210
The new unit is going to be
the second half of the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.100
classification of solids.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.670
We looked at solids and we
reasoned that there were

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.890
ordered solids and we've looked
at crystals and their

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.530
arrangements and so on.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.180
And today, we're going
to start talking

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.630
about disordered solids.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.635
And they're characterized
by no long-range order.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.140
They have short-range order.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.680
You might know who your next
nearest neighbor is, or your

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.070
second next nearest neighbor,
but you certainly don't know

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.300
who your 10th nearest neighbor
is or who your 100th nearest

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.490
neighbor is.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.060
And these solids are called
amorphous solids.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.630
And there's a simple
one salable

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.660
Angle-Saxon word for this.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.520
It's called glass.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.770
So we're going to talk
about glasses.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.090
What kind of materials
can form glasses?

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.710
Well, obviously, materials
that have trouble

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.940
crystallizing.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.450
And they come from a variety
of walks of life.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.430
So we have in organic
compounds.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.710
Some inorganic compounds can
form disordered solids.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.710
And a good example
is silicates.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.190
And this is what you know as
window glass, glass that's

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.420
used in bottles, cookware,
and so on.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.280
There are organic compounds
that can form disordered

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.590
solids and a variety
of polymers.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.860
Things like food wrap and so on,
are also prone to forming

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.370
disordered solids.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.030
Some elements.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.190
Some simple elements can
form disordered solids.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.990
A good example is sulfur.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.400
Sulfur can form solid in
crystalline form, but more

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.260
often than not, it can form
disordered solids.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.970
And what I'm going to show you
towards the end of the lecture

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.770
is metal alloys.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.150
Metal alloys can form disordered
solids, and you're

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.540
going to see metallic glasses.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:05.450
And they're typically 80%
metal and 20% metalloid.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.470
That is somewhere along that red
staircase on your Periodic

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.850
Table that divides the metals
from the nonmetals.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.580
So a good example here
is iron 80--

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.270
this is on mole basis--

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.540
and boron 20, boron being
the metalloid.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.640
And some, some do both.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.570
Some compounds can form both
crystal and amorphous.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.600
So one example of that
is SiO2, silica.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.420
When it forms crystalline solid,
we call it quartz.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:52.800
Crystalline SiO2 is quartz,
and amorphous SiO2 is the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.290
silicate glass that we know
for windows and bottles.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.110
And so as I've said many times,
the term "glass" is

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.625
related to atomic arrangement.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.660
It has nothing to do
with the ability

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.840
to see through something.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.160
Transparency has
no place here.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.700
So what are the conditions?

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.130
I mean, if you have silica and
it can form crystalline or

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.970
amorphous forms, how does
it decide which to do?

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.130
And so I'm going to
look at conditions

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.540
promoting glass formation.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.950
And I'm going to form glasses
on the basis of

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.622
solidification.

00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:51.160
So I'm going to start from the
liquid and go to the solid.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.380
So I'm asking the question, why,
on some occasions, does

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.770
the liquid go to a solid that's
amorphous and in other

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.450
occasions it will go to a solid
that is crystalline?

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.310
As in the case of quartz.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.700
So there are primarily three
factors that it boils down to.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.380
And I like to make the analogy
to the game of musical chairs.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.850
So imagine I've got chairs
placed around

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.460
this central table.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.500
You know how the game goes.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.250
There are more people
than chairs.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.980
And the music starts and you
walk around, and then at some

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.570
point the music stops and people
race for the chairs.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.610
And some people are going to get
a seat and they get booted

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.970
out of the game.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.040
And then one of the chairs is
removed and then so it goes.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.150
You know this game.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.880
I know you don't want to admit
to playing it, but your little

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.680
siblings play it.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.140
But of course, you
don't play it.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.730
But imagine if you
were to play it.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.470
The same situation here.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.080
I've got silicate floating
around in the liquid state,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.190
and the chairs are the crystal
lattice sites.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.000
So the question is, what
promotes the ability to get to

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.640
the lattice sites or not?

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.810
So obviously, one of the
first things we think

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.770
about is atom mobility.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.280
Atom or compound mobility.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.870
This is in the liquid phase.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.160
And the way I want to write
this, I want to talk about

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.110
promoting glass formation.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.550
So obviously, high mobility is
going to enhanced crystal

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.760
formation, isn't it?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.220
If you've got high mobility,
you're going to be able to

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.080
find the right lattice site.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.070
So I'm going to talk about
if atom mobility promotes

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.760
crystallization, the reciprocal
of atom mobility

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.250
will promote glass formation.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.410
The second thing is the
arrangement of the chairs.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.920
If the chairs are in a simple
line, it's easy

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.570
to get to the chairs.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.080
All other things being equal.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.210
But if the chairs are arranged
in some complex formation,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.410
it's harder to get
to the chairs.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.720
So that has an analogy and
that's the complexity of the

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.970
crystal structure.

00:08:09.396 --> 00:08:11.650
The more complex,
the more likely

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.120
you are to form glasses.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:20.460
And then the last thing, an
analogy to the musical chairs,

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.710
is the rate at which
the music stops.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.630
If the music stops suddenly you
could get trapped in the

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.950
liquid state.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.760
If I gradually turn down
the volume, you

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.910
know, OK, wait a minute.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.850
The music's going to stop.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.100
You start moving towards
the seat.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.360
So that's the analogy.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.610
Here is the cooling rate.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.020
So a high cooling rate is
going to make it more

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.480
difficult for the system to
find the crystal structure

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.830
because as the cooling starts,
the atoms start thinking, gee,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.100
it's time to form the solid.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.490
But the thermal energy is
removed from the system before

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.400
the atoms have had a chance to
find a crystal structure.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.070
So the reciprocal of atom
mobility, we write in a

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.080
positive term and call
that the viscosity.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.920
Something, a fluid, a liquid,
that has low atom mobility has

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.810
high viscosity.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.830
So I'll take this out and
instead represent it this way.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:25.350
This is the way to think
about the formation of

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.270
the amorphous state.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.610
And why are we studying
glasses?

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.150
Well, in the old days it was
bottles and food and

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.120
cook ware and so on.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.870
Today, fiber optics.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.390
Fiber optics is based on
silicate chemistry.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.370
Very important.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.310
So understanding silicate
chemistry has high-tech

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.980
implications.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:49.260
So let's look at, for the first
study, the silicates.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.070
The silicates for their value
in fiberoptic technology.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:03.120
So these are based on SiO2.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.520
And some nomenclature.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.670
This is called silica.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:14.880
So the oxide of an atom is named
by adding the term "a."

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.520
So silicon gives us silica
as the oxide.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:24.010
So here's the atom silicon,
the basic element.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.870
And if we fully oxidize--

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.700
see, here I've taken silicon, I
put two oxygens, so I made a

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.990
neutral compound--

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.000
that's silica.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.540
And then if I fully oxidize--

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.380
the maximum number of oxygens
I can put around is four--

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.050
and this is going to have
a net charge of 4 minus.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.800
And this fully oxidized anion
is called the silicate.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.690
And that's where we get the name
of the family of glasses.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.100
So this is fully oxidized.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.830
So now let's look at
the structure.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.420
Silicate glasses.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.680
sp3 hybridized.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.760
Just like carbon above it.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.450
sp3 hybridized.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.050
So that gives us the four struts
off of the central

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:22.240
silicon at 109 degree angles
to one another.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.650
And let's put some flesh
on the bones here.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.130
So I'll put a silicon
here in the center.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.460
One, two, three, four.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.130
But instead of putting silicons
everywhere, I'll put

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.430
oxygens at the end
of the struts.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.800
And then I'll put the second
silicon, and you can see the

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.120
oxygen is acting as a bridge
between the two silicons.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.190
One, two, three, four.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.230
Let's do one more.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.020
Another silicon.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.000
One, two, three, four.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.350
So again, you can see the
oxygen acts as a bridge

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.270
between the two silicons.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.690
So you see four oxygens per
silicon, but I've got two

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.090
silicons per oxygen.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:08.820
Hence, the structure looks
like SiO4, but the

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.540
stoichiometry of the
compound is SiO2

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.210
because the oxygens bridge.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.600
So this doesn't give you any
clue as to what the structure

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.450
should be, does it?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.970
You really have to write
this thing out.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:24.000
Now, here's where the thing
gets interesting.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.900
This is a three-dimensional
network.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.900
All of these oxygens
bridge to silicons.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.030
And I was talking here
about viscosity.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.060
You can see that this thing in
the liquid state is huge.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.950
It's like a giant battleship,
and this is just one.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.640
So now we can have
another silicate.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.670
It can form chains.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.910
It can form meshes.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.300
And these meshes entangle.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.280
So viscosity very high.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.770
So when it goes to solidify--

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.380
David, if we can go to the
document camera, please--

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.280
so here you see the silicate.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.760
So the yellows represent
silicon.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.160
And you can see the
oxygens, here, are

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.690
at 109 degree angles.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.650
So this is the SiO4.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.890
We'll do some nanotechnology
here.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.900
So here's the SiO4.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.160
One, two, three, four.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.590
And now I'm going to
make the bridge.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.370
But look.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:27.500
The bond between the oxygens and
the silicon is defined in

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.700
three dimensions.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.250
It's a 109 degree angle.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.160
But the bond between the two
oxygens is not defined.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.350
It's only defined in
two dimensions.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.440
So you can see that if I put
all of these oxygens on the

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.970
same plane--

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.960
so somebody borrowed this
and look, they lost

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.310
an oxygen for me.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.890
Got a missing oxygen, here.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.640
If you find this thing, please
bring it to my office.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.910
So now all five oxygens
are on the same plane.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.040
One, two, three,
four, and five.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.100
And then up here are
the two silicons.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.620
They're in the same plane.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.370
The oxygens are in
the same plane.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.350
What I'm showing you here
is the beginning

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.780
of crystalline quartz.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.000
Crystalline quartz,
this stuff.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.690
But now what happens
if we cool quickly?

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.630
This bond is only specified in
two dimensions, which means I

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.290
can hold this bond at
the proper value and

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.310
this is free to rotate.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.460
This is free to rotate.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.520
Look at the autofocus
on this thing.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.770
Who designed this?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.980
Boy, what a stupid machine.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.720
So anyway, so here we are.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.480
Here is the point.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.810
This bond is free to rotate,
and when it rotates, look--

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.420
now this oxygen is no longer in
the plane with this oxygen.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.110
And as a result of that freedom
to rotate, we can end

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.050
up running out of
thermal energy.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.840
And this is nowhere near its
regular crystalline array.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.250
So this gives you the
indications of the high

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.920
viscosity, moderate cooling rate
will end up giving you

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.410
the amorphous silica.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.140
But in all cases, this bond
is the linkage through.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.550
So we end up with this
three-dimensional network.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.820
So what do we do with to
show that we have some

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.010
evidence for this?

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.050
David, may we cut back to
the slides, please?

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.050
So how do you characterize?

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.660
I'm going to use x-rays.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:25.430
So here's an x-ray diffraction
pattern of the-- the upper one

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.050
is cristobalite, which is
one of the polymorphs of

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.360
crystalline SiO2.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.050
And you can see you have
distinct peaks indicative of

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.940
satisfying Bragg's Law.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.050
There's some width to
them, but that's

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.080
because it's a real crystal.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.740
Down here, this is the
amorphous silica.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.280
You don't see all of
these features.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.930
You see only one very
broad peak.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.840
Now if I said it's crystal--

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.710
pardon me-- if it's glass, you'd
say, well, it has no

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.470
long-range order.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.040
So why do we have even
this one feature?

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.310
What's this one feature
indicative of?

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.050
Doesn't matter how much disorder
there is, I still

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.600
know that no matter what, I'm
always going to have these

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.960
four oxygens as my nearest
neighbors.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.220
So these four oxygens minus any
long-range order gives us

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.610
this one line here.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.440
So we have evidence for it.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.660
Now let's look at the
energetics, because clearly,

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.480
these are two different
states.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.350
One of these is lower energy
than the other.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.220
Which one is it?

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.360
How to think about
the problem?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.260
There's a simple way
to do it with the

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.550
tools we have in 3.091.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.530
Energetics can be given
by bond formation.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:40.000
Energetics via bond density.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.640
When things form bonds
the energy

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.940
of the system decreases.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.680
So which one is going to have
higher bond density?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.370
Well, the higher bond density
clearly is going to be

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.790
exhibited by the one that
has the tighter packing.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.730
And which one has
tighter packing?

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.375
The disordered solid or
the ordered solid?

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:06.180
The ordered solid has much
more dense packing.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:23.110
So the ordered crystal exhibits
tighter packing,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.130
therefore, this means more
bonds per unit volume.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.790
So that means, to me, that the
energy of the crystalline

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.650
state must be more negative
than the energy

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.910
of the glassy state.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.750
That makes sense so far.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.710
But now I want to show you one
other thing that we've just

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.740
inferred from this
little exercise.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.200
If we get more bonds per unit
volume, then can you see that

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.540
we've made an association
between the binding energy of

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:11.210
any arbitrary ensemble and
it's molar volume?

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.240
So volume now, is a very easy
thing to measure, isn't it?

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.350
You can see it with
the naked eye.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:21.210
So the volume of something with
a given composition--

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.760
and we're talking about a mole,
we're talking about

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.270
equal numbers of atoms--

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.470
so the molar volume is
indicative of binding energy.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.220
It's a one-to-one
correspondence.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:40.200
If you like, the Vmolar is a
measure of disorder, meaning

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.440
the higher the molar volume,
the greater the disorder.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.020
Or put the other way, the
smallest molar volume is that

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.440
exhibited by the crystal.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.980
So we have some traces here that
come from the reading.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.370
So this comes from the archival
lecture notes that

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.940
were written by my predecessor,
Professor Witt.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.990
There's a little typo here that
obviously heating means

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.050
increasing temperature, not
decreasing temperature.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.740
Make a little correction here.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.760
So what we're plotting is the
volume, the molar volume of

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.610
silicate glass as a function
of temperature.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.710
And imagine we start with
some blob of glass--

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.230
of some known mass--

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.580
so we can divide and figure out
what the molar volume is,

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.160
and we started cooling it.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.680
We cool down until we get
to the crystallization

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.520
temperature of quartz.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.460
And when we get to that
temperature crystalline quartz

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.940
forms and along with
it, a tremendous

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.570
decrease in the volume.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.320
Unlike water ice, which is a
rare exception, where the ice

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.890
occupies a larger volume than
the liquid, for most systems,

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.510
the solid is more compact
than the liquid.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.850
And that's what you see here.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.810
There's an abrupt drop here
at the melting point.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.550
And then when we continue to
cool, there's some thermal

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.230
contraction.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.380
And as you can imagine a hot
solid occupies a greater

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.540
volume than a cold solid.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.960
And so this is the cooling curve
and you can retrace it,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.600
heat up, and when we get to the
melting point, there's a

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.290
tremendous expansion
and then off we go.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:19.310
So that's the classical form
of the crystallization of a

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.530
material that is undergoing the
normal process of liquid

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.490
to solid transformation.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.090
I'm going to use some
tea colors today.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.240
So we went down the red line.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.230
Now let's go down
the green line.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.800
So we're going to go down
the green line.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.360
We go down the green line, we're
going to use the same

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.890
stuff, this silicate network,
only we're going to cool a

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.490
little bit faster.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.080
And we cool a little bit faster,
we can zoom right on

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.490
past the normal melting
point and create

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.500
a supercooled liquid.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.350
And that supercooled liquid
gets lower and lower in

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.130
temperature and all the while
the volume is shrinking.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.570
Again, a hot liquid what
occupies a smaller volume than

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.120
cold liquid.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.510
You know this from a mercury--

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.920
the old days, you remember
these old thermometers?

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.590
You probably have never seen
one of these things.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.540
It's all done digitally.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.260
But we used to have these liquid
and bulb thermometers.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.500
You'd have numbers on here,
and what happens is the

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.240
temperature goes up, the liquid
in here rises to a

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.860
higher temperature.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.200
And at a lower temperature
this contracts.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.650
Isn't the solid expanding,
too?

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.760
Uh-huh.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.720
So what's the other thing
you learned from this?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:40.330
It must mean that coefficient of
thermal expansion, which we

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.650
affectionately will call CTE,
the coefficient of thermal

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.800
expansion of the liquid, must
be much greater than the

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.310
coefficient of the thermal
expansion of a solid.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.700
Otherwise, the two would expand
and you wouldn't get

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.640
any sensible measurement
out of this, right?

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.670
Well, we see that on a curve.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.450
We see that on a curve, because
when we plot volume

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.500
versus temperature, when we're
up here in the liquid regime

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.930
we have a steep slope.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.880
This slope here is dv by dt.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.110
And when we get down on
the solid regime,

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.300
it's a gradual slope.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.120
It's still a slope, but it's
a gradual because the

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.510
coefficient of thermal
expansion down

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.010
here is very low.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.080
And that's what you're
seeing here.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.580
So at some temperature the
system changes from a

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.290
supercooled liquid to a solid.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.840
But it's a disordered solid
because we've quenched in all

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.330
of that remaining
liquid disorder.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.360
And take a look at this--

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.830
you've changed from the slope
that's characteristic of the

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.950
coefficient of thermal expansion
of a liquid down

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.830
here to the gentle slope
coefficient of thermal

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.340
expansion of solid.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.730
You know what this proves?

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.980
This proves that glass
is a solid.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.490
There are many people out there,
even in the popular

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.500
press, who will say, glass
is just a very,

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.030
very viscous liquid.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:08.720
Nonsense.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.850
Look at this.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.140
It has this coefficient
of thermal expansion.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.600
And don't fall for any of that
nonsense they tell you when

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.900
you go to the cathedrals in
Europe and the glass is

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.220
thicker at the bottom because
it's been dripping for 400

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.030
years, and that proves--

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.020
you know why the glass is
thicker at the bottom?

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.030
Because they made
it by spinning.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.320
And when they spun it, it was
graded in thickness from the

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.310
center out.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.550
And now, if you're the glazier
and you're putting the glass

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.590
in a window, which way would you
put a pane of glass that

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.710
had variable thickness?

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.430
Would you put the thickest
part up or the

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.470
thickest part down?

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.940
It's thicker on the bottom
because that's

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.190
the way it was made.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.610
Lord help the tour guide when
there's an MIT student taking

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.830
3.091 on that tour.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.890
All right, so here we are.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.530
Look at what you have here?

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.330
You see this?

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.590
At this temperature--

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.540
let's say down here where
the lines end, it's room

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.340
temperature.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.070
At room temperature
the volume of the

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.080
crystalline solid is low.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.740
The volume of the amorphous
solid is higher.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.470
That's proving this.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.560
Vmolar is a measure
of the disorder.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.730
And sure enough, the glass that
was cooled quickly ends

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.360
up quenching in more of the
liquid state disorder, and you

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.320
see that in terms of what I
call the excess volume.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.560
The excess volume is a measure
disorder because the

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.370
crystalline solid
non-zero volume.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:38.390
So we can define, we can go from
this directly over and

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.140
say that v, that's
the excess--

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.710
that's a pun.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.910
You know, instead
of writing this?

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.190
This is the way they
do in high school.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.850
This is the excess volume.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.180
Bologna.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.810
We don't write like that.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.560
Excess volume is equal
to v of the glass

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.880
minus v of the crystal.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.320
And the greater the excess
volume, the greater the degree

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.360
of disorder.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.430
So let's do one more.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.590
Let's go down the orange line.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:09.130
The projector isn't giving us a
good yellow component, here.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.540
OK, so this is the
orange line.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.060
And what's the difference
between the orange line and

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.740
the green line?

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.760
The difference between the
orange line and the green line

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.030
is that in the orange line
we're going to cool more

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.400
slowly than we did on
the green line.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.270
Because green means go.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.060
So that's the fast one, right?

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:23.890
So here we are.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.060
We still get supercooled liquid,
but we get down to a

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.610
lower temperature before we have
ceased to have higher and

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.990
higher viscous liquid and
have formed the solid.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.320
The knee in that curve occurs
at a lower temperature.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.810
And that value is called the
glass transition temperature.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.130
Why do we call it the glass
transition temperature instead

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.720
of just saying it's a
solidification temperature?

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.740
Because when I say
solidification, before today

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.670
you would say, OK, liquid
became a solid.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.910
But after today, if someone says
to you, solidification,

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.730
you say, do mean ordered solid
or disordered solid?

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.160
So we distinguish.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.040
So every crystallization is a
solidification, but every

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.990
solidification is not
a crystallization.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.550
So here we are.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.120
Look at this-- this has a
smaller excess volume.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.010
Because if it was a slower
cooling, that meant that's the

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:21.220
equivalent of giving more time,
more thermal energy, for

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.400
things to find their crystalline
position, which

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.500
means there's less excess
volume quenched in.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.060
OK.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.380
So let's just get that down,
define these things.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.505
So this is a measure
of disorder.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.310
Or glassiness, if you like.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.040
OK.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.430
So now let's define these two
different temperatures so that

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.760
we have the distinction.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.460
So we have, first of all, the
classical one, which is

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.710
crystallization.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.636
And crystallization represents
the reactions of liquid.

00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:07.760
In both cases, we're going to
convert a liquid to a solid,

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.210
but a liquid goes to a
crystalline solid.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.820
And that occurs at a
unique temperature

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.530
called the melting point.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.120
Imagine if I talked
to you about the

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.150
freezing point of water.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:28.220
Freezing point of water at
atmospheric pressure is 0

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.450
degrees centigrade.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.780
If I asked you, well, if I cool
the water really quickly

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.980
or if I cool it slowly, does it
make any difference to the

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.330
freezing point of water?

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:38.210
No.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:39.710
Why not?

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.770
Why isn't all this happening?

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.210
Because water is a tiny molecule
and so cooling rate

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.730
has no impact on the temperature
of conversion.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.050
Those water molecules
will always find

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.430
their lattice sites.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.270
So this is a function
only of composition.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.600
If I put something in the water
and I make it impure, I

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.250
know I can change its
freezing point.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.410
If I put salt in water, I will
depress its freezing point.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.190
But if I put pure water, it
will free at 0 degrees

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.720
centigrade.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.340
Later on, we'll learn that
there are some pressure

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.860
effects, but today that's not
going to elucidate anything.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.870
It'll just be a distraction.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.380
So pure water, always
the same thing.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.350
But now if you go to something
like silica, which has the

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:26.840
capability of forming a glass,
the glass formation is a

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.670
different reaction.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.120
Glass formation is written
in this manner.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.960
We will start with supercooled
liquid.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.850
It's liquid, but I'm already
going to stipulate that it's

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.090
liquid that's been cooled
below the melting point.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.710
Supercooled means it's
cooled below the

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.430
normal melting point.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:52.800
So a supercooled liquid is going
to form a glassy solid,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.840
and this occurs at tg.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.500
tg, which is the glass
transition temperature.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:15.205
And that is very much a function
of cooling rate.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.010
And, of course, the function
of composition.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.280
Obviously, if we change the
composition from SiO2, we're

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.240
no longer comparing
apples to apples.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.410
So composition is important in
both instances, but only in

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.730
the case of supercooled liquid
do we form the glassy solid.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.700
And the degree of disorder
is a function

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.710
of the cooling rate.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.720
And how is it a function
of the cooling rate?

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.420
As the dt by dt, right?

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:51.220
Change in temperature with time
as dt by dt goes up, the

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.910
degree of disorder goes up.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.750
So if I want to quench in the
liquid state, can you imagine

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.200
if I had liquid and I could
instantaneously cool it?

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.640
I would quench in all of
the liquid disorder.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:11.120
If I quench it less rapidly,
there will be some time for

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.970
the atoms to strive for a
degree of crystallinity.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:22.210
So all of this we've said with
reference to silicate glasses.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.690
Now, there are other glasses.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.190
What are other glass
forming oxides?

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.870
Well, what do I have
to look for?

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:32.690
I should look for other
compounds that form bridging

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.070
oxygens, right?

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.970
That's the key here.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.750
What's the unifying feature?

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.440
It's bridging oxygens.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:47.390
Bridging oxygen leads
to glass formation.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.760
So what are other compounds
that could give us such

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.790
bridging oxygens?

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.670
Well, you could be lazy and say,
well, if silica does it,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.870
then why don't I look up
and down the column

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.850
on a Periodic Table.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.270
If you go up to carbon that's no
good because it forms gas,

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:06.190
but if you go underneath you
will form germania glasses.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.670
So this is germania, and the
glasses are germinate glasses.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.270
You can also go to
group three.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.030
B2O3.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:18.330
B2O3 forms sp2 hybrids.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.210
And the sp2 hybrids
off of each boron,

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.670
we have three oxygens.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.560
And that oxygen can bond
to another boron.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.420
One, two, three.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.730
And this is all going to lie
flat in a plane, isn't it?

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:37.780
But this oxygen bridge is only
specified in two dimensions,

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.970
whereas the boron struts are
specified in three dimensions,

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.340
which means this oxygen bond
between the two borons doesn't

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.000
have to lie in the plane.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.090
It could tilt this up and if it
does, this is going to have

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.020
a greater volume.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.410
You can see this with
the naked eye.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.230
I mean, I could have just taught
the lessen by putting

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.460
this slide up.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.190
If those are equivalent numbers
of borons and oxygens,

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.910
it's plainly obvious that on
the right side you've got

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.290
excess volume.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.830
This occupies a much larger
volume than the

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:11.780
image to the left.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.420
The image to the left
is crystalline B2O3.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.440
The image to the right is the
same stuff, except in many

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.250
instances this
boron-oxygen-boron bond

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.700
doesn't lie in the plane.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.810
It tilts out of the plane and
it causes all sorts of

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.400
distortions and leads
to excess volume.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.670
So this is called
a borate glass.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:36.140
All right, so if we can do it
with the borates, we can do it

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.360
with anything that will
form covalent bonds.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.190
So we can do it with P2O5,
phosphate glasses.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.930
V2O5, vanadate glasses.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.740
As2O5, arsenate glasses.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.390
And Sb2O5, stibnite glasses.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.320
And these are used, actually,
as additives to some of the

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.400
glass that's put in computer
screens so that they will

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.840
gobble up excess oxygen on
cooling and avoid bubble

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.900
formation, which then makes
the glass foggy.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.880
And a foggy computer screen is
no fun to try to look through.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.370
So what are the properties
of these oxide glasses?

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.070
Well, first of all, they're
chemically inert.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.780
Why are they chemically inert?

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.350
Because they've got strong
covalent bonds.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.730
So if you try to react something
with them, it's

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.710
going to take a very
special compound

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.100
that can trigger reactions.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.750
Which is why they're used for
bottling beverages and

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.590
packaging foods.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:42.100
You put vegetables and fruits
in glass jars going back to

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.490
ancient times.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.090
Until recent times, with the
advent of the soda can, there

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.860
were glass bottles and so.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.320
They're electrically
insulating.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.970
Why are they electrically
insulating?

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.300
Electronic structure.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.020
These are all covalent bonds,
high band gap, which is why

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.040
the amorphous version is
used in window glass.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.760
High band gap, which means
light goes through.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.260
How do I think about whether
something is transparent?

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.400
Do a little finger
demonstration.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.300
This is the band gap of the
glass, and this is the band

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.740
energy, the photon energy.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.850
If the photon energy is small
it goes right through.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.060
That's called transparency,
see.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.080
You can study quantum mechanics,
but you know what?

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.620
This is it.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.670
That's all you have to know.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.370
Now what happens if the
band gap is small--

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.430
like around 2eV--

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:32.050
and here's the photon energy?

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:36.140
That's called absorption
and re-emission.

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.800
Transparency, absorption.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.050
That's all it takes.

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.420
You think I'm kidding.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.970
That's all you need to know.

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:47.460
So now, the next thing.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.740
Mechanically brittle.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.990
Why are they mechanically
brittle?

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:52.150
Strong bonds.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:55.580
No opportunity for slip.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.640
Please don't tell me-- this is
what students tell me every

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.870
year and they get zero for the
stupid answer-- that the

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.580
reason glass is brittle is it's
a distorted solid and

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.570
therefore has no dislocations.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.740
Uh-uh.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.720
Dislocations take the stress
required to cause slip and

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.120
reduce it to a lower value.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.660
But you cannot cause this
thing to slip once it is

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.680
solidified.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.830
The only way to get this silicon
to move relative to

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:26.350
that silicon in a
vertical shear--

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.750
let's say I want to make this
silicon move up and this

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.890
silicon move down-- there's
only one way.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.160
It's called break that bond.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.710
When you break that covalent
bond, that's called fracture.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.820
So there is no slip allowed
because we have strong

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.660
covalent bonds.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.420
If you want to reshape glass,
what do you have to do?

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.940
You have to heat it back up
above its glass transition

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.150
temperature.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.330
But you do not shape glass
once it is solidified.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.910
You may have tried in the home,
and then you end up with

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:55.520
something called shards.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.920
And that's the reason.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.010
Optically transparent, we
know that one already.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.600
OK.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.090
Last thing is the very
high melting.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:09.190
Melting point of silica is over
1,500 degrees Celsius.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.240
You're saying, well,
wait a minute.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.290
He's telling me we're going to
make beverage containers,

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.640
we're going to make food
containers, we're going to

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.090
make all sorts of useful
objects, but that's going to

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.520
cost a lot of energy
to go away up there

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.610
to melt this glass.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.350
But it does have desirable
properties--

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.950
chemically inert, and so on.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.060
So what can we do?

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.670
Back here.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.040
Glass transition temperate is a
function of cooling rate and

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.300
a function of composition.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.680
So next step is let's modify
the composition of the

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:44.290
silicate network in order
to drop it's processing

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.930
temperature so that we can make
beverage containers at

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:48.990
acceptable energy.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.930
So what's it going to take?

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.410
I'm going to have to do
something about those bonds.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:57.020
Because those bonds are what
caused me to have to go to

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.210
such high temperatures.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:09.750
So in order to reduce the
processing temperature of

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:18.110
silicate glasses via change
in composition--

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.470
so this is material science--

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.040
change the composition in
order to get desirable

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.650
properties.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:33.370
And specifically, I want
to lower the processing

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:33.860
temperature.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.730
Even when I get these things
liquid, they don't deform very

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:42.500
well, because all these networks
are entangled.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.140
So I'll give you another
analogy.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.020
Suppose you're in the kitchen
and you're going

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.920
to cook some pasta.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.840
So you take some linguine and
it's about a foot long.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.520
So you got this pound of
linguine and you cook it in

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.630
the boiling water and you
pour in into a colander.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.550
And you may or may not rinse
it with cold water.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.010
Whatever.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.660
Just leave it in the colander
for a little while and what

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:11.630
you'll find is the whole thing
turns into one big mass.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.660
I'm not talking about the
stuff got all gooey.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.500
I'm just saying it just
hangs together.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.400
And if you're clever you can
just gently slide it out.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.080
And it'll slide out of
this one big mass.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.930
What's holding those strands of
pasta together, by the way?

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:27.730
Well, are they covalent bonds?

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.690
Are they ionic bonds?

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.100
Are they metallic bonds?

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.230
I don't know, if you've got
metallic pasta, you've got

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.580
digestive problems. So
what's the bonds?

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.220
It's van der Waals
bonds, right?

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.840
Now, I can cause them to
slip again, can't I?

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.325
I can put a little
water in there.

00:38:43.325 --> 00:38:44.585
And what does the water do?

00:38:44.585 --> 00:38:47.310
It goes in between and then it's
got hydrogen bonds and

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:48.350
they slide.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.010
I can put a little oil in there
and then that slides.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.480
or.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.220
The other thing I
could do is--

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.850
you know, have you ever seen
some people, they break the

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.910
pasta before they boil it?

00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:59.730
I did this experiment.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:03.050
So you take the pound,
divide it two halves.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.510
By my math, that's
two half pounds.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.650
So you cook the one half pound
one foot in length and you

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.770
cook the other half pound--

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:11.680
break them in three.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.850
So they're about four-inchers.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.920
And then you put them each
in a separate colander.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.750
Which one do you think is
going to be much more

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.880
difficult to move around?

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.080
It's the long stuff, right?

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.690
The long stuff entangles.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.280
So we're going to do the same
thing here with the

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:24.640
processing.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.180
And basically, you can study
and learn pretty much

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.960
everything you need to know
about polymeric networks in

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.390
the kitchen with a
pound of pasta.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:34.780
All you need to know.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.235
All right, so let's
go and look at it.

00:39:36.235 --> 00:39:40.580
I want to reduce the amount, the
length, of those chains.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.720
If I reduce the length of those
chains, I can process at

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.450
much, much lower temperatures.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.640
So what's my weapon, here?

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.090
My weapon here is oxygen.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:55.400
Oxygen is going to go in there
in the form of the oxide ion.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.770
And the oxide ion, O double
minus, has a very, very high

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.600
affinity for the bonding.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:09.840
And so what'll happen is
oxide ion attacks the

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.900
oxygen-silicon bond.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.900
It attacks the oxygen-silicon
bond and breaks it.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.360
It breaks it in two and then
incorporates itself into the

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.360
network in the following way--
you see I have to silicons

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.060
joined across an oxygen?

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.760
This free oxide ion will come
in here, interrupt that

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.060
network in the following
manner.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.700
So it's now broken the
silicon chain.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.660
Now, I've got conservation
of charge.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.080
This was 2 minus.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.410
I don't see any exposed
charge here.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.800
I need 2 minus.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.276
This'll be minus 1, this'll
be minus 1.

00:40:46.276 --> 00:40:49.610
I have conservation of charge,
I have conservation of mass.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.290
And what I've done is I've
broken the chain.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:53.540
This is called chain scission.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.770
Shorter chains, higher
fluidity.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:04.780
Higher fluidity, which means
lower processing temperature.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.980
Now, where am I going
to get my--

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.600
I can't go to the lab and get
a bottle of oxide anions.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.090
I have to have charged
neutral species.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:17.060
And so what I'm going to look
for is an oxide ion donor.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.630
I need an oxide ion donor.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.130
And where do I find an
oxide ion donor?

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.110
Well, better be something
that's going to be a

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.810
cation, isn't it?

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:27.642
Because if I've got an oxide
anion, I need a cation.

00:41:27.642 --> 00:41:28.892
And what kind of a cation?

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.270
How do I make an oxide anion?

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:38.130
I have to have electrons
to give to the oxygen.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.480
So I need a good
electron donor.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.890
Or to use a simple Anglo-Saxon
word, a good metal.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:47.470
So a good metal oxide like,
say, calcium oxide.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:51.320
So if I take calcium oxide and
I dissolve calcium oxide in

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.220
silica, it dissociates
to give calcium

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.920
cation plus oxide anion.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.450
And then the oxide anion
migrates over here to our pal

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:09.400
the oxygen bridge and results in
two of these broken pieces.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.750
So we call this one a bridging
oxygen, as I've been saying up

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.440
until now, BO.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.500
And this one is called
a terminal oxygen.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.330
This is bridging oxygen, this
is terminal oxygen.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.010
Or some people, I
don't know why--

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.525
they have no literary skills--
they call it

00:42:27.525 --> 00:42:29.240
non-bridging oxygen.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.950
I hate that because it tells
you what it's not.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:35.890
So you might see non-bridging
oxygen.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:40.990
So all of these up here, the
silicates and so on, these

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:45.150
compounds that have the
ability to form oxygen

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:49.470
bridges, these are called
network formers.

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:52.190
These are all network formers.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.220
Because they have the capacity
to make oxygen bridges.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:02.140
And then compounds like calcium
oxide that have the

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.670
ability to donate oxide ions
that break bridges, these are

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:07.985
called network modifiers.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:15.530
So good examples--

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:16.450
any good metal.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:20.540
So I can look at lithium oxide,
sodium oxide, these

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.490
will all disassociate
to give oxide anion.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.180
If calcium will work and you
believe Mendeleyev, then you

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.490
should probably think about
magnesium oxide, calcium

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.590
oxide, and anything
in that series.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:37.770
A good ionic oxide like
lanthanum oxide, yttrium

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:39.715
oxide, these will be
oxide ion donors.

00:43:39.715 --> 00:43:42.620
If you want to get yourself
fired, use scandium oxide

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.150
because it's frightfully
expensive.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.640
And you can go to Group four.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.030
You can even use something like
lead oxide or tin oxide.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.405
Even they will donate
oxide ions.

00:43:53.405 --> 00:43:56.670
In fact, you can put a lot of
lead oxide in, you'll modify

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.450
this thing so much that it'll
start to allow you to cut

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:05.800
crystalline facets and this'll
be called lead crystal.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.940
Why do we use lead?

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.640
Well, number one, it modifies
so I can cut it and I get a

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.740
straight line instead of that
conchoidal glass edge that if

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.950
you've ever cut yourself you'll
never do it again.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.610
The other thing is lead, because
it's got so many

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:24.250
electrons, has a very, very
high index of refraction.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.640
So when you make your billion
and you've got your crystal

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.400
chandelier hanging, of course
you want the cut crystal with

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.200
a high index of refraction
because it's going to make

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.160
that candlelight look
really elegant and

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.280
romantic and so on.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.410
And if you make a super boatload
of money, then you're

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.490
not going to go with
lead crystal.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.270
You're going to make diamond
pendants, right?

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.240
Because they've got
a higher index.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.730
And we all want the best
index, don't we?

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:50.260
OK, so I think this is probably
a good place to stay.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:54.230
So let's jump to the end,
because we've got

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.460
a few things here.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.000
So I said I was going to show
you about metallic glass.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.520
Here's metallic glass.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.830
1959, Pol Duwez, who was a
professor at Caltech, reasoned

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:09.060
that if he were able to cool
liquid metal very quickly, at,

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.600
say, a million degrees per
second, he could freeze the

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.910
random orientations of atoms
in the liquid state and

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.350
prevent them from finding even
something, either simple

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.540
cubic, body-centered cubic,
face-centered cubic lattice.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.930
So he worked with
gold silicon.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.220
Gold silicon has a very,
very deep eutectic.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:32.170
Even though gold melts to over
1,000, mixed with silicon, it

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:35.210
gets down to about 400
degrees Celsius.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:38.110
So he dropped this through
a little orifice here.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.510
This is molten and it drops
onto a water-cooled copper

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.490
wheel spinning at a
very high speed.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.850
And it makes a ribbon some
tens of microns wide.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:50.400
And what came out here
was disordered solid.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.520
It was metallic glass.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.250
This was the birth of rapid
solidification, and this is

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.390
metallic glass.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.250
This is metallic glass.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:03.730
This has no long-range order,
no grain boundaries, no

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.650
dislocations, but it's
not transparent.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.980
Why?

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.020
Because it's a metal.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.750
And what do you know about
band gaps and metals?

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:12.390
And it's different.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:13.130
It was a different Q-factor.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.190
It has different mechanical
properties.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.100
It has no ductility in
a classical sense.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.090
This is just for
your reference.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.650
This is aluminum foil.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.440
And you know what aluminum is.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.690
It's got ductility.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.740
It's got no grain boundaries
so the corrosion properties

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.400
are different.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.320
It's got no magnetic
wall boundaries.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.510
So that a transformer made of
this stuff is half the mass of

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.900
a transformer made of
crystalline glass.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.150
It has some other uses.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.300
So it's used in magnetoelastic
resonators for theft

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.300
prevention-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:52.970
I'm in Cambridge.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.380
I can't say theft prevention--

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.350
for inventory control.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:01.560
And so you see that it's 20%
boron and all of this metal--

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.040
iron, chrome, and moly--

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.200
and they put this inside the
object in the store.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.980
And then there's a permanent
magnet there,

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.480
iron-cobalt-chromium, that sets
the metglass to a field.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.480
And then when you walk through
the uprights, there's a

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:21.140
58-kilohertz signal that causes
this thing to ring.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.040
So it excites and listens
for the ring.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.100
And if you still have that
little piece of metglass in

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.610
there that hasn't been
demagnetized--

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:31.880
Bing!

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.120
And then, oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:33.780
I really am.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.770
I meant to pay for this.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.150
Explain it to the
police officer.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.560
All right.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.930
So that's inventory control.
