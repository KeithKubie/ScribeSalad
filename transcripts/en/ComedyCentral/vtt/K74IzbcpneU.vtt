STANTON AND HARDING GO,

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.453
MM-HMM, WE DON'T

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.956
BUT LINCOLN DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF THIS [bleep].

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.694
HE WOULD JUST KEEP RESEARCHING

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.730
OH, YEAH, BUP-BUP-BUP-BUP.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.100

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.402
HE WOULD WRITE.
HE WOULD BE LIKE,

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.539
AM I INVOLVED IN THIS CASE
OR WHAT?

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.209
FINALLY, HE FOUND OUT
THAT THE CASE HAD BEEN MOVED

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.444

LINCOLN WENT UP TO THE HOTEL
WHERE ALL THE LAWYERS WERE,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.394
AND STANTON SAW LINCOLN
COMING HERE--COMING UP.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.596
STANTON WENT TO HARDING,

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.566
