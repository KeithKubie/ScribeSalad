00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:18.250
Nowadays, we take curiosity for granted.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.166
We believe that if we put in the hard work,

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.456
we might one day stand before the pyramids,

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.301
discover a new species of flower,

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:25.885
or even go to the moon.

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:27.921
But, in the 18th and 19th century,

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.641
female eyes gazed out windows

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.358
at a world they were unlikely to ever explore.

00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:34.763
Life for women in the time of Queen Victoria

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.823
was largely relegated to house chores and gossip.

00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:40.168
And, although they devoured books on exotic travel,

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:41.658
most would never would leave the places

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:43.140
in which they were born.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.890
However, there were a few Victorian women, who,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.958
through privilege,

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:47.665
endurance,

00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:49.494
and not taking "no" for an answer,

00:00:49.494 --> 00:00:51.977
did set sail for wilder shores.

00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:54.637
In 1860, Marianne North,

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.755
an amateur gardener and painter,

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.227
crossed the ocean to America

00:00:58.227 --> 00:00:59.514
with letters of introduction,

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:00.427
an easel,

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.143
and a love of flowers.

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:04.018
She went on to travel to Jamaica,

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:04.830
Peru,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.790
Japan,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.713
India,

00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:08.059
Australia.

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:10.646
In fact, she went to every continent except Antarctica

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:12.856
in pursuit of new flowers to paint.

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:14.181
"I was overwhelmed with the amount

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:16.367
of subjects to be painted," she wrote.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:17.976
"The hills were marvelously blue,

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:20.062
piled one over the other beyond them.

00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:22.856
I never saw such abundance of pure color."

00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:24.483
With no planes or automobiles

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:26.151
and rarely a paved street,

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:27.703
North rode donkeys,

00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:28.612
scaled cliffs,

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:29.739
and crossed swamps

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.487
to reach the plants she wanted.

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.953
And all this in the customary dress of her day,

00:01:33.953 --> 00:01:35.369
floor-length gowns.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.957
As photography had not yet been perfected,

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:40.428
Marianne's paintings gave botanists back in Europe

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:43.376
their first glimpses of some of the world's most unusual plants,

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:45.997
like the giant pitcher plant of Borneo,

00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:47.714
the African torch lily,

00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:49.973
and the many other species named for her

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:52.970
as she was the first European to catalog them in the wild.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.713
Meanwhile, back in London,

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.807
Miss Mary Kingsley was the sheltered daughter

00:01:56.807 --> 00:01:58.138
of a traveling doctor

00:01:58.138 --> 00:01:59.719
who loved hearing her father's tales

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.896
of native customs in Africa.

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:03.855
Midway through writing a book on the subject,

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:05.852
her father fell ill and died.

00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:08.777
So, Kingsley decided she would finish the book for him.

00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:10.890
Peers of her father advised her not to go,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.278
showing her maps of tropical diseases,

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:14.432
but she went anyhow,

00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:17.455
landing in modern-day Sierra Leone in 1896

00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:20.331
with two large suitcases and a phrase book.

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:21.532
Traveling into the jungle,

00:02:21.532 --> 00:02:23.175
she was able to confirm the existence

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.862
of a then-mythical creature,

00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:26.164
the gorilla.

00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:28.007
She recalls fighting with crocodiles,

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:29.677
being caught in a tornado,

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:32.011
and tickling a hippopotamus with her umbrella

00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.264
so that he'd leave the side of her canoe.

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:36.017
Falling into a spiky pit,

00:02:36.017 --> 00:02:38.726
she was saved from harm by her thick petticoat.

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:40.688
"A good snake properly cooked

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:43.981
is one of the best meals one gets out here," she wrote.

00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:46.066
Think Indiana Jones was resourceful?

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.620
Kingsley could out-survive him any day!

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.026
But when it comes to breaking rules,

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:51.618
perhaps no female traveler was

00:02:51.618 --> 00:02:54.118
as daring as Alexandra David-Neel.

00:02:54.118 --> 00:02:56.620
Alexandra, who had studied Eastern religions

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.737
at home in France,

00:02:57.737 --> 00:02:59.287
wanted desperately to prove herself

00:02:59.287 --> 00:03:01.207
to Parisian scholars of the day,

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:02.774
all of whom were men.

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:05.380
She decided the only way to be taken seriously

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.630
was to visit the fabled city of Lhasa

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.049
in the mountains of Tibet.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.577
"People will have to say,

00:03:10.577 --> 00:03:13.108
'This woman lived among the things she's talking about.

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:16.193
She touched them and she saw them alive,'" she wrote.

00:03:16.193 --> 00:03:18.308
When she arrived at the border from India,

00:03:18.308 --> 00:03:19.740
she was forbidden to cross.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.693
So, she disguised herself as a Tibetan man.

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:24.306
Dressed in a yak fur coat

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:25.899
and a necklace of carved skulls,

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.613
she hiked through the barren Himilayas

00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:29.125
all the way to Lhasa,

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.160
where she was subsequently arrested.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.732
She learned that the harder the journey,

00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:34.161
the better the story,

00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:36.660
and went on to write many books on Tibetan religion,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.872
which not only made a splash back in Paris

00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:40.832
but remain important today.

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:42.834
These brave women, and others like them,

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.391
went all over the world to prove

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.337
that the desire to see for oneself

00:03:46.337 --> 00:03:48.674
not only changes the course of human knowledge,

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:51.337
it changes the very idea of what is possible.

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:53.417
They used the power of curiosity

00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:55.178
to try and understand the viewpoints

00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:57.308
and peculiarities of other places,

00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:58.807
perhaps because they, themselves,

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.766
were seen as so unusual in their own societies.

00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:03.109
But their journeys revealed to them

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.690
something more than the ways of foreign lands,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.484
they revealed something only they, themselves, could find:

00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:10.396
a sense of their own self.
