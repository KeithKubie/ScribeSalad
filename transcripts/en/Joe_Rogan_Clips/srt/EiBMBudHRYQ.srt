1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,510
Just such a, it's, it's,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,890
it's recreational. Yeah. There's a,
there's a, I mean it's back to Jack.

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:11,040
I mean it's a lot that has a lot to
do with social media and Twitter in

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,100
particular. Yeah. I mean you
have like so, so for instance,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,540
I missed the whole Covington
high school Catholic fiasco,

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,180
not on Twitter, basically
was ignoring Twitter. I saw,

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,150
I saw it out of the corner
of my eye. Like, man, this is
interesting. This is, yeah,

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,890
this is blowing up. But I, I
was so off Twitter that I had,

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,980
there was no temptation for
a hot take from me. Right.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,020
And I saw these people just torching
their reputations by taking these like,

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,550
like Kathy Griffin basically calling
for the doxing of these kids. You know,

12
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:44,040
given all that she has suffered from,

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,450
from mob behavior online and she's
whipping up her own mob. It was just nuts.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,760
But it's normal.
That's what people do.

15
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:53,010
It's what the platform
is calling out of people.

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,480
But it's also when people have been
shamed and they've done something awful,

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,850
then they reinforce their base like that.

18
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,851
Now she's like his so heavily hard left
because the right wing ran after her.

19
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,690
Like anyone on the right
that does anything.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,980
She's calling for her side
to go after this person.

21
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,800
Like reinforcing the cheese,

22
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,680
a part of that tribe that she's a part
of that left wing tribe. Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,690
Well it's, so obviously everyone
has a lot to lose doing this,

24
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,900
especially in a case where
all the facts aren't in.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,110
And if you just waited a beat and even
the New York Times got this wrong,

26
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:31,200
the New York Times writes an article
about the kids in the Maga hat that they

27
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:34,860
have to resend.
And the,

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,480
so then as the dust is settling
and I see these people,

29
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:43,200
some people are doubling down, some
people are, are issuing public apologies.

30
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,350
I see somebody who is actually
kind of car, you know,
branded herself as, you know,

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,940
one of my enemies for, for
a reason. I can't fathom.

32
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:55,140
But th this journalist Kara
Swisher, uh, who, um, you know, she,

33
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:59,160
she works for uh, uh, recode and vox now,

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,310
but she's got a big
podcast and she's a bitch.

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,660
She actually writes for the New York
Times. Now she's got an opinion piece,

36
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,890
you know, a regular column for the New
York Times. She's a tech journalist. Um,

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,390
and I, you know, happen to know she hasn't
liked me because she's tweeted against,

38
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,420
you know, she's said some disparaging
things about me on Twitter and we had a,

39
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,470
you know, an offline conversation
about it. Uh, but I saw her,

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,100
she said one of the most but two parative
and you know, fairly crazy things in,

41
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,690
in response to the kids initially.
And then once more information came out,

42
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,560
she walked it back and she basically
apologized, you know, good for on Twitter.

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,900
And so, so I said, good for
you Cara. I just wanted to,

44
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,930
to support this norm of acknowledging
that you got something wrong and I wanted

45
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:40,800
to do it even.

46
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:45,330
I wanted to actually do it for someone
who I know really doesn't like me. Like,

47
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,390
I mean, that was an added bonus
for me because that, that's,

48
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,430
that's another norm that I,
that I think we should support this like,

49
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,040
like we should, we should play fair even
with our enemies. And I mean, honestly,

50
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,500
I, you know, I try to play fair even
with people who never play with me.

51
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,530
Even someone like, you know, Glenn
Greenwald's Racsana Salon, I mean,

52
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,710
people who have just
lied about me endlessly.

53
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:10,000
If I get something wrong about them,
I publicly apologize for it. Um,

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,530
so I did this,

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,480
and this was at the absolute 11th
hour with respect to this, this,

56
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,060
uh, you know, a scandal online.

57
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,160
And when I saw the kind of pain I
was getting just for a con, you know,

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,570
s supporting Kara in her walk back of
this thing we had at a moment when it was

59
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,750
obvious she should've walked this
back. I got people saying, you know,

60
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,090
unsubscribing from your
podcast, you are, you know,

61
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,990
now I know you're a fucking racist. You
know, it was just, I'm just sure pain.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,240
And I just thought, wow,
man, that's, you know,

63
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,080
it's like you just touched this thing
at it's very end and you're, you're,

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,790
you know, it's, Eh, the slime
it gets on you. Um, so yeah,

65
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:53,710
it is. It's the medium, you know, we
had no opportunity to do this before.

66
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,400
It is the medium and it's also people
that don't feel like their opinions are

67
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,234
being heard.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,240
Like they want their opinion to be heard
and they want it to be heard right now.

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,400
And it might not be a very
well thought out opinion,

70
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,720
but they know that they have the
ability to blare it out and so

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,070
they just send it out and that,
that, the ability to do that,

72
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:15,550
it's just intoxicating for folks
and don't think to reach you.

73
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,390
You talked about this with Jack.
There is out there.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,330
What makes Twitter especially good for
this is that everything has the same

75
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,930
stature. Like your tweets no bigger than
the other tweets that just called you an

76
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,501
asshole.
Yeah,

77
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:30,370
that's my Kurt Metzger take on it because
Kurt Metzger was a hilarious standup

78
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,820
comedian. He, uh, he'll
write a Facebook blog only.

79
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,060
You only writes on Facebook and he's like,
I like how it's set up. He's like, it's,

80
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,150
there's a big D,

81
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,330
it differentiates between me and these
fucking idiots who are commenting under

82
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,840
there of, although ironically
I hate Facebook. I can't even,

83
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,450
I mean just the graphic
design on Facebook.

84
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,120
I find so offensive that I
can't even look at Facebook.

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,080
So I use it as a publishing
channel. But I, you know,

86
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,510
I keep threatening in my own mind to just
delete the account cause I just don't

87
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,880
read the comments three times maybe ever
read him. It's like truth is Christ.

88
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,430
It's like youtube but alive.
I don't know,

89
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,610
it's like youtube but with people
with their real names, right?

90
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,070
It's,
you know,

91
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:16,150
this is a new world that we're living in
man and everybody's trying to navigate

92
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,780
this thing and figure it out as it goes
along and not everybody is doing it well.

93
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,160
And uh, I think this world is going
to get more and more intrusive.

94
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:27,340
I think this is just the beginning.
I think we didn't see Twitter coming,

95
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,410
whatever comes after Twitter.
And this is one of the things that I,

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,450
before the podcast I wanted to really
talk to jack about to get his take on what

97
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,450
he thinks is next down the line because
there's going to be something that's

98
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,570
more invasive. There's going to be
something that is more, whether it's a,

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,540
I think probably something in
the line of augmented reality.

100
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,960
There were probably a decade away from
something that makes this look like books

101
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,770
look like, you know, a, a fucking
cork board at a bookstore. You know,

102
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,910
although strangely we're
live, we're living through
the golden age of audio here.

103
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,230
It's like, like we, we went
full into video and we're
poised to go like, you know,

104
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,570
three d and Vr,

105
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,360
and then all of a sudden audio is king.
