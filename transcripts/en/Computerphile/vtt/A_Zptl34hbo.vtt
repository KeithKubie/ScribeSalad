00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
"Okay, let's do the usual Computerphile: Mac or PC?"

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.620
Mac, of course.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.720
I use a PC.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.580
I use a Mac quite a lot of the time. I do have- I possess some PCs.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.400
Oh, it's got to be PC. Definitely.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.940
For Derek McAuley, who's also known as Mac, it's Mac.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.580
Not a PC.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.940
"Mac for Mac."

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.880
Mac for Mac.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.020
Ugh, PC.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.080
"Mac or PC?"

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.800
Mac.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.780
Um, Linux.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.820
*cough* *chucle*

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.700
Mac.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.800
"Mac or PC?"

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.960
PC. Linux.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.680
I've gone very Mac, as you can see.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.680
I probably prefer a Mac, but I've got a PC.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.040
Uh, Mac.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.580
Um, I use Windows.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.180
Whichever's appropriate.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.440
I do Mac now.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.260
PC.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.660
"Mac or PC?"

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.380
Oh, Chromebook. Neither. Linux man.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.360
At the moment, it is still, for me, PC plus Linux.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.080
But at some vague stage in the near future, I may capitulate and go for a fully Mac solution.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.600
In the course of doing these videos for you, I've seen people catch sight of an Apple on what they think

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.900
is my desk. Well, I have to say, sadly, it's not mine. It belongs to my colleague because we share this room

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.820
and he's not in very often. But when he is, he uses the Apple Macintosh.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.420
And yet- Well, I've also confused you totally by referring to the fact that I run openSUSE

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.020
and I also have a straightforward Windows 7 PC.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.840
I use Windows, which is a fairly controversial decision amongst my friends.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.360
But there is not a Mac laptop that actually does what I want it to.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.680
There's not a Mac laptop with a significant enough graphics card that will work

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.680
and no decent video editing software on Linux. so...

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.060
I've been preaching for years that one should be using the same machine

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.500
and the people actually produce the machine, they also produce the software so they are compatible.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.300
And meanwhile, was using Windows on a Dell.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.620
And one day I decided, it was enough of crashes and my blackbay not communicating with Dell.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.440
So I said, "That's it." I moved to Mac and all done.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.340
PC
"Okay, how's that then?"

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.800
Hehehe, *inaudible*

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.180
Apart from Steven, Steven's a real Mac fan.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.640
Mac, most of the time, at the moment.
"Yeah, well, any reason for that?"

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.140
Um, at the time, good full factor- for the hardware

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.880
Um, pretty well made

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.440
Um, the software is no more exasperating than PC, so far, so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.640
Having done, the Mac, and, um, more about

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.640
The Mac age 30 years and so on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.640
I have to say, they're still not my first choice

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.640
They were back in the eighties but, let's try and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.260
Offend everybody, or let's try and mollify everybody.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.840
Had I been a graphic designer, and not a computer scientist

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.280
I would certainly have gone for a Mac

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.840
Because all of the things that matter to Graphic Designers

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840
Worked really, really well

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.800
And they were designed, for the Mac, first of all, and it shows in everything they do.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.780
I'm the only one in the office that uses the Apple

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.100
And, I get slicied? for it, so

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.000
They're all Windows guys around here

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.960
I've always used a PC and, um, Apple, are very expensive

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.280
Um, and they have a rather draconian warranty system

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.280
That, I'd like to avoid

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
Just, I'm kind of fond of Mac phone thing

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.200
It's historical, I've been, on a PC for, many, many millenium

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.780
I think the problem for real computer scientists

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.000
Was the Macintosh was good, but it was signle user, it was for Graphic Designers

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.300
It didn't participate in the world of networked Unix m achines

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.160
Um, linux, *cough* *chuckle*

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.460
"PC, PC not Mac?"
Um, well no, whatever architecture, any architecture

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.240
I like the ??? chromebook, I'm a massive Google fanboy

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.880
And um, other than that I like the- it's the nicest, linux PC you can get

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm Mac these days.
"Ok, any particular reason?"

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.780
Yeah first I was linux, and then I found, too much hassle

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.520
Installing sound drivers, and whatever, and updating operating systems and moved to Mac

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.400
I have just always have used PCs

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.600
And, you know, I'm not against Macs, particularly, but um

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.700
Yeah PCs

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.420
I was a bit annoyed with Mac and those, erm

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.580
Copyright, *inaudible*

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.320
"Digital Theft", I call this

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.120
The Macintosh didn't participate in the world of networked Unix machines

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.720
Until relatively late on, and as many of you know that came about with Steve Jobs forming NeXT

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.800
NeXT was built on a Unix-like system, and so now that it's come full circle

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.500
Steve Jobs came back to Apple, brought this Unix-type system with him

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.840
Then all of a sudden, yes, now, I can live on a Mac, quite happily

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.700
And colleague Steve, is an absolute raving Mac enthusiast for just that reason

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.780
*chuckle*
Are there other computers?

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.800
It's totally Unix-based, you can have the best of both worlds

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.420
You can have the graphic richness, you can have a Unix-like environment as well
