ELLIE POWERS: All right.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.900
Hi, everybody.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.360
Good morning.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.115
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:08.650
ELLIE POWERS: Good morning.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.360
Good morning.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.710
Wow, it's amazing
to see so many

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.430
people out in the morning.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.980
And hello to you back there
who waved at me.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.110
So I'm Ellie Powers.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.880
I'm the Product Manager for
Google Play Developers, so

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.290
many of you guys here.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.770
MILES BARR: Hi, I'm
Miles Barr.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.850
I'm the Engineering Manager
for Apps in Google Play.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.990
RICARDO GOVONI: Hello, I'm
Ricardo, Tech Lead for the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.635
Google Play Developer Console.

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:28.400
ELLIE POWERS: All right.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.960
And some of you saw us earlier
this week at I/O. And so what

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.420
we're going to be doing today
is to give you even more of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.580
what we showed you.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.880
So you'll get to see more
details on the new features we

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.840
announced, as well as a couple
more new things.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.540
So let's go back in the
past for a second.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.160
Last year, Android market,
do you remember that?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.150
It was a recent memory.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.360
And Google Play was brand new.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.290
And all of you who publish apps
on Google Play were using

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.770
something that looks
like this.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.080
This is the old Developer
Console.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.070
I hope you've completely
forgotten about it.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.910
But if you haven't, it looked
a little bit like a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.170
web form from 1999.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.600
And so Miles and I came on the
stage at I/O last year and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.440
said, guys, we've totally
heard you.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.380
Your businesses are
really taking off.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.650
And you need something that's
really going to scale.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.050
You need some professional tools
to support all the great

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.790
things that you're doing now.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.120
And we said, don't worry.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.290
We've got your back.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.870
We've been working on
something great.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.850
It's the new Developer
Console.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.630
So back in London, where we're
all based, we were excited to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.700
see your response.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.860
You started sending
us thousands

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.310
of pieces of feedback.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.840
It just all started
pouring in.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.950
And many of you may
be wondering.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.010
I sent in that feedback.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.050
And then what happened?

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.000
Did anyone read it?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.900
Did it just go into a hole?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.520
And so I can actually tell
you, rest assured.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.900
Your feedback was read.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.850
And I know that because I
actually read every single

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.000
piece of feedback that you sent
in, by the feedback link

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.180
at the top of the new
Developer Console.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.890
And so I can tell you that
actually we were delighted to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.000
see that the number one piece of
feedback that came in was,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.960
hey guys, this new developer
console, it's a lot better

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.590
than the old one.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.560
And so we were relieved that at
least we were going in the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.331
right direction.

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:10.759
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.380
All right.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.650
Thank you.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.930
Thank you so much.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.240
We were absolutely delighted to
see that positive response.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.310
But also what started
coming in was a

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.930
bunch of feature requests.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.950
Hey, this is great.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.530
But could you also do--

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.670
how about this?

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.000
I also need that.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.480
You really should
be doing more.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.640
And we said, absolutely, we
totally agree with that.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.130
And so that's why we've
been rolling out

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.190
a ton of new features.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.940
So what we're going to do today
for you here, with some

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.980
great demos, is to show
you how Google

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.060
Play is evolving rapidly.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.785
We're rapidly moving to bring
you tons of new features that

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:48.580
are going to grow with your
business and help you support

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.150
Google Play's enormous audience
around the world.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.870
So let's walk through what
we're going to do today.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.260
So again, we're going to be
going into more detail on what

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.700
you've already seen and
also seeing new stuff.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.640
We're going to be going through
three different areas.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.840
We have publishing your app your
way on Google Play, how

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.590
you can take control of
publishing in our store,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.670
connecting directly
with customers.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.220
Secondly, we're going to be
talking about optimizing your

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.610
app, how we're giving you more
data so that you can go deeper

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.060
into how people are using
your app and improve it.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.990
And then, finally, how you can
expand your app globally to

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.800
take advantage of Google Play's
global footprint and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.100
reach more audiences
in new markets,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.160
expanding your business.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.450
So without any more ado,
we're going to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.530
look at cool new stuff.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.200
And Miles Barr is going to
take us through that.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.370
MILES BARR: Thanks, Ellie.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.430
I want to start today by talking
about how Google Play

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.080
keeps you in control of
publishing your app.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.900
Our philosophy has always been,
"put no barriers between

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.440
you and your users."

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.320
Meaning, when you have a new
version of your app ready, you

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.500
can push it out to everyone
at the same time.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.210
This can be very daunting
though, as anyone who's pushed

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.750
a new app with a serious
bug knows.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.250
So we figured we
can do better.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.560
I was happy to announce on
Wednesday that we launched a

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.890
beta testing and staged rollout

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.190
feature in Google Play.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.530
This means you can start testing
your new version of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.230
your app with a small group of
alpha testers, and when it's

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.680
ready, move on to a larger
group of beta testers.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.690
And once you're comfortable your
app is ready for prime

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.830
time, you can roll out
in stages to the rest

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.370
of your user base.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.459
This means you can keep your
startup's new app under wraps.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.180
You can try out a major new UI
with just your power users.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.570
Or you could even give a
preview to the press.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.850
And why is this important?

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.350
Because we want to ensure that
your users are always happy

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.680
with your app.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.930
So let's take a look
at how this works.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.160
Here we are in the developer
console.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.820
As you can see, there are two
new tabs, Alpha Testing and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.970
Beta Testing.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.340
These are essentially
the same thing.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.910
They're two targeted groups,
that allows you to send a

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.980
version of your app to a
specific set of users.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.450
If the user is in both tests,
they'll receive the alpha one.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.220
At Google, our philosophy
is to test our

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.400
software early and often.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.140
So whenever a build is ready,
we send it to our team.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.640
So they can try it out.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.565
So let's switch to the Alpha.

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:07.680
And we'll do the same here.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.430
So first, we got a new APK.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.820
And what we're going to
do is, we're going

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.880
to target our team.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.920
And we're going to do this
with a mailing list.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.510
So Ricardo is entering our
team mailing list here.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.530
Now when you target a user for
a beta test or an alpha test,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.020
they're not automatically
opted in.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.010
For them to receive the version,
they need to go to

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.330
this link here and opt-in
to the test.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.420
And this is available on the
web and on the phone.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.880
And it explains to your users
what being a tester is.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.470
And they can opt-in.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.570
And if at any point, they want
to opt-out of the test, they

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.680
can come back to the same page,
opt-out, and uninstall

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.930
the test version of your app.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.380
Now, beta tests and alpha
tests are private.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.610
What this means is, until a
user opts-in to your test,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.620
they'll see no details about
the app on the Play Store.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.400
Similarly, we don't
allow reviews

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.040
of pre-release versions.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.960
So none of the details of
your new app will leak.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.820
We recommend using a mailing
list or Google community to

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.640
talk your testers.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.180
We do collect statistics and
crash report data on your test

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.090
versions, so you can track the
progress of how it's going.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.090
So let's say the alpha
test is going great.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.160
So we're going to
move it to beta.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.920
And this time, we want to have
a wider set of testers.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.146
So instead of a mailing
list, I'm going to

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:25.010
use a Google+ community.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.960
This community is some of
our most engaged users.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.660
They love our app.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.450
They love testing early
versions and giving us

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.570
feedback on the new features.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.170
So Ricardo is going to let the
group know that we've got a

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.050
new beta test ready.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.300
And they can opt-in.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.170
Now when setting up a beta test,
it's important to get a

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.130
good representation
of your users.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.040
And by this, I mean make sure
that you've got a good mix of

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.350
devices, people who speak
different languages, and

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.010
people on different carriers.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.990
You want to ensure your app
works for everyone, once you

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.060
publish it.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.530
OK.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.350
So we've got a lot of feedback
for our beta test.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.250
We fixed some bugs.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.460
And this latest version,
we're comfortable with.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.320
So we want to get it
out to production.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.800
I'm feeling pretty good about
it, because we've been through

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.140
so many rounds of testing.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.060
But sometimes, a bug
does slip through.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.320
And what happens when
you launch it?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.960
It means you get a lot
of unhappy users

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.270
and one-star reviews.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.010
So we're going to be on
the safe side here.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.496
And we're going to do
a staged rollout.

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:23.620
So rather than choosing
everyone, we're going to start

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.700
with about 10% of our users.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.020
At this point, users can
now review your app.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.200
So you can see the feedback
of how it's doing.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.000
And if there's a problem,
you can stop the

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.960
rollout, create a fix.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.720
And then we'll push that fixed
version to that same original

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.716
10% of users.

00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:43.810
RICARDO GOVONI: Shall we roll
it out to everybody?

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.230
MILES BARR: Hm?

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.870
RICARDO GOVONI: Shall we
do it to everybody?

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.120
MILES BARR: Yeah, let's
go to everyone.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.410
All right.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.540
And you can also use this
feature to control traffic to

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.610
your backends.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.710
We know sometimes, when you
release a new version of your

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.310
app, the traffic patterns
differ.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.650
So by just looking at 10%,
making sure you're backend

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.820
service can handle the load,
you could be sure once you

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.940
push it to everyone, your
app will work great.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.470
OK.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.740
Let's hear about how someone has
been using beta testing.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.550
Wattpad is a great app, that
gives you access to over 10

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.800
million free books and
short stories.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.600
They have been beta testing
since the beginning.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.730
And they do this by having two
separate apps in the Play

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.280
Store, a beta version and
their main live one.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.980
The beta version, they push
every single week and the live

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.930
one about once a month.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.750
Each feature they add to their
app goes through three to four

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.659
rounds of beta testings.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.120
So they get lots of feedback.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.940
And they decide what makes the
cut and should go to the

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.340
monthly release.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.640
A great example of this is the
new UI you see up here.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.480
They recently changed
how users' books

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.550
appear in their library.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.250
This is quite a big change.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.780
So they wanted to see how
users would react to it.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.020
Unsurprisingly, they found
that some users got it.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.400
Some didn't There was
a bit of confusion.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.370
So before they launched it, they
added a tutorial section,

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.510
explaining what the change was
and how to find your books.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.260
This led to a seamless
roll out to the

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.510
rest of their users.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.390
Well, they'd been beta
testing before we

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.080
launched our feature.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.430
This meant that they had to
created two listings and also

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.530
manage their testers outside
of Google Play.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.180
With the launch of today's
feature, you can retain one

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.770
store listing and also use
Google tools like Google

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.230
Groups and Google+ Communities,

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.480
to manage your testers.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.160
Wattpad has a huge beta-testing

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.810
community, 25,000 users.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.900
But they've told us that they've
seen benefits back

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.310
when they only had 10 users.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.500
This gave them access to a wider
range of devices than

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.190
they had testing in-house.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.990
It also meant they got early
feedback from real users.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.500
So if you ever get a one-star
review again, you know haven't

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.750
been beta testing.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.476
Now I want to talk to
you about tablets.

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:06.260
There are over 900 million
Android devices activated now.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.280
And a growing part of
that is tablets.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.135
On developer.android.com, we now
show you the proportions

00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:16.840
of devices, by screen size
and screen density.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.040
Tablet are the large and
extra large screens.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.460
So you can get a good
idea of how many

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.050
tablets are out there.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.270
Also on developer.android.com,
we've launched a tablet app

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.500
quality checklist.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.750
This explains Google's criteria
of what makes a good

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.580
tablet app and gives you advice
on how to optimize your

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.372
app for tablets.

00:10:34.372 --> 00:10:36.230
If you haven't seen this
already, please go to

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.290
developer.android.com
and check it out.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.170
Also, in the developer
console, here in the

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.420
Optimization Tips section, we
automatically scan your app

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.980
against the checklist to
see how you're doing.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.330
If there's anything which your
app doesn't meet, we explain

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.060
it and tell you how to fix it.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.820
So it's important to follow
these tips, so you create a

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.445
great tablet experience
for your users.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.230
Also, once you've created a
great new tablet UI, a nice

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.310
multi-pane, using the fragments
API, you want to

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.470
show it off.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.000
So last month in the Play Store,
we gave you the ability

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.990
to upload tablet screenshots.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.150
So you can show how your app
will look on a 7 inch and 10

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.910
inch tablet.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.570
When a user goes the Play Store
on a tablet, they'll see

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.955
the tablet screenshots first.

00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:24.800
And on a phone, they'll
see the phone ones.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.190
On Wednesday, we announced that
the top lists on tablets

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.470
will be able to be filtered
down, so users will only see

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.590
those apps designed specifically
for tablets.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.810
So make sure that you follow
all these guidelines.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.880
So your app doesn't
get left behind.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.620
So let's take a look at
a great tablet app.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.160
I'm sure you've heard
of Evernote.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.450
If you haven't, it's an app that
lets you collect notes,

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.260
record web page, everything,
and syncs

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.300
across all your devices.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.290
Evernote has been creating a
tablet app ever since we

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:02.360
launched Honeycomb,
back in 2011.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.450
They created a beautiful
multi-pane UI and spent a lot

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.540
of hard work on their
tablet experience.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.980
It's all this hard work which
has kept them a consistent

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.550
Editor's Choice in
Google Play.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.970
And it's not just
a hit with us.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.020
It's also a hit with
their users.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.585
As you can see here, their
second most popular devices is

00:12:17.585 --> 00:12:20.960
a Nexus 7, a tablet.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.410
Evernote has thought long and
hard about what makes a good

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.750
tablet experience.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.445
If found on a phone, they user
can record a quick note or

00:12:27.445 --> 00:12:29.305
maybe pull up a piece
of information.

00:12:29.305 --> 00:12:31.660
But on a tablet, they spend a
lot more time organizing and

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.920
planning and getting
real work done.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.440
Here's what their VP of
product had to say.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.380
By focusing on creating a great
tablet experience, they

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.740
created more engaged users.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.470
And these users have gone
on to become paid

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.720
subscribers of Evernote.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.620
All right.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.310
Now I want to talk about a
feature that's coming later

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.140
this summer.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.520
A lot of you have told us you
want to give access to the

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.800
console to more people
within your company.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.895
In fact, if you were in the
Fireside Chat yesterday, a lot

00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:06.380
of you asked for finer
grade controls to

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.330
the Developer Console.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.380
So late this summer, we're
releasing several new

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.400
permissions in the Play Store,
allowing you to control

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.180
exactly what each of
your users can do.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.540
And these permissions
can also be set on a

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.090
per-application basis.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.710
So if you've ever wanted to give
someone in your company

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.010
access to your stats but make
sure they don't mess around in

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.340
your APKs, you'll soon
be able to do that.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.641
So please stay tuned.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.070
Last year, here at I/O, we
announced a pilot to our Reply

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.460
to Reviews feature.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.640
This allowed you, as a
developer, to reply directly

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.416
to your users.

00:13:39.416 --> 00:13:42.020
We're happy to say, after lots
of rounds of testing and

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.410
tweaking, we've now made
available to every single

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.720
developer on Google Play.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.430
It gives you a direct channel
to your users.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.330
So if you haven't started using
this already, please

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.860
read up on our policies
and guidelines and

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.862
start replying now.

00:14:00.862 --> 00:14:03.000
Now I'm going to tell you about
how one developer has

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.960
been using this feature.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.200
textPlus is an app that let's
you chat with your friends all

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.540
around the world, through free
SMSs and cheaper calls.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.440
textPlus has gone all-in
on replying to reviews.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.490
Everyone in their team takes
part in this, from the

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.800
engineers, the product managers,
and of course, their

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.320
customer support team.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.665
Every day, twice a day, they
look to see if they have any

00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:25.590
new reviews and reply
directly to them.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.820
By doing this, they've really
connected to their users and

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.230
find out what their biggest
pain points are.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.440
For each negative review, they
try to turn around that user's

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.820
experience, by giving
them advice and

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.410
pointers to more help.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.480
If they succeed, those users
typically change their review

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.340
to a positive one.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.210
But they don't stop
just there.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.250
For their positive reviews, the
five-star reviews, they

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.410
find these users are their
most engaged users, the

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:52.260
biggest advocates who tell other
people about the app.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.190
They use the Reply to Review
feature to speak directly to

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.270
them, to get their opinions on
new features and what else

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.960
they want to see in this app.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.820
By focusing on the user and
having this intensive customer

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.710
support, the newer versions of
textPlus have a higher average

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:13.550
rating in the Store, than the
previous versions did.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.800
Here's what they had
to say about it.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.570
They've used this direct line
to their users to prioritize

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.330
what features they
should focus on.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.950
And now they have happier
users and higher

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.010
scores within the Store.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.950
Now I'm going to hand over to
Ricardo, our tech lead, to

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.295
tell you more about data.

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.110
MILES BARR: Thanks, Miles.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.560
Hello, everybody.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.470
So Miles showed you how you can
have more control on the

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.150
way you deploy your app to your
users and how you present

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.090
it to them.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.510
Now I want to shift your
attention to data.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.800
I want to show you
how [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.610
developer console helps you make
informed decisions about

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.260
your app and your business and
helps you figure out what is

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.710
the next most important
thing to focus on.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.260
Over the course of last year, we
expanded the amount of data

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.300
that we make available
in developer console.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.050
I think you're familiar with
the standard metrics,

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.460
installs, and uninstalls per
user, per device, divided

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.080
across six different dimensions,
country, SDK

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.050
version, application version,
language, and more.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.620
But in the past few months, we
rolled out a few more metrics.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.530
And we announced a couple of
them a couple of days ago in

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.040
the keynote.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.860
So let me focus on them
for a second.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.590
One I want to talk about
now is, Rating Stats.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.010
Rating Stats show you how the
User Star Rating for your

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.170
application changed over time.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.500
This is the metric you want to
look at when you want to see

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.490
whether the new version of
your application you just

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.200
rolled out is getting the same
good user reviews, good user

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.870
satisfaction, compared to
the previous version.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.300
We offer these in
two variants.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.730
So you have the cumulative
rating.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.200
This is the Overall Aggregated
Rating, over the lifetime of

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.470
your application.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.770
This is good for the long-term
view, when you want to review

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.065
what you did historically in the
past and the decision that

00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:49.560
you made at the time.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.900
Another one that we offer is
the Daily Average Rating.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.230
This is the aggregated overall
daily ratings, over the

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.530
lifetime of your app.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.570
And this is good for the
short-term view, when you want

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.630
to spot problems early on.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.140
I want to mention a couple
of cases where this is

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.560
particularly useful.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.700
One is Reply to Reviews.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.190
So you can use this metric to
identify segments if your user

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.990
base where customer satisfaction
is not as good as

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.349
you would expect.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.480
And from that, you can then jump
to Reply to Reviews, as

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.349
Miles just described, and
provide dedicated customer

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:24.200
support exactly to
those users.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.770
On the other side, it works the
other way around as well.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.280
If you're spending a lot of time
doing customer support

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.940
and offering replies to your
users, then you might want to

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.050
use this metric to verify the
effectiveness of what you've

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.000
done and see that you're
actually achieving the results

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.060
the you were expecting.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.640
Another feature in which this
is particularly useful is

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.950
staged rollouts.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.480
Unlike alpha and beta, where a
user cannot leave reviews or

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.690
ratings, during a staged
rollout, users will be able to

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.680
rate and review your app.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.300
And that means that, when you
are at 5% of a stage rollout

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.150
of you brand new application out
there, you are on the edge

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.590
of your chair.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.950
You want to make sure
everything is fine.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.150
You may want to use this
metric to see whether

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.570
everything is doing as
well as you expect.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.000
In this example, we rolled
out a new version of our

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.850
application in mid-April,
the orange line.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.960
But it never really caught up
with the baseline, which is

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.860
the green line.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.970
And so this is maybe the point
where you want the pause your

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.300
staged rollout and decide
what to do.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.380
Like all the other metrics that
we have, if the breakdown

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.410
by the top ten values, like
the top 10 countries

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:22.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.560
is not enough, obviously, you
can always export as a CSV.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.940
And you get the full
data payload.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.360
So you can integrate
it with your tools.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.830
Another thing that you want to
talk about is filtering crash

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.350
reports, because we now allow
you to filter crash reports by

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.880
application version,
since a few weeks.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.490
Again, now that we have beta
testing and staged rollouts,

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.690
this is extremely useful.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.870
Because it means that you can
look at the crash reports that

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.850
are coming only from your
alpha version--

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.500
maybe it's a little bit
more crashing--

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.090
and then decide what to do.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.780
During a staged rollout
as well, we keep

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.360
collecting crash reports.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.590
And so you can see and decide
what to do for your staged

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.050
roll out, whether to pause it
or continue it, based on the

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.340
amount of crashes that
you're getting.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.990
So now everything is fine.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.650
Users are happy.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.900
You're not getting any crashed,
unicorns and rainbows

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.500
all over the place.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.860
It's time to talk about money.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.600
I want to talk about a new
page that we launched on

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.840
Wednesday, which is
Revenue Charts.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.890
I always find it a bit annoying
that, just to figure

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.085
out how much money you made
yesterday, you had to go to

00:19:22.085 --> 00:19:24.800
the Developer Console, download
the CSV report, put

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.020
it in a graph in the spreadsheet
program, aggregate

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.050
everything, just to see how much
money you made yesterday.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.240
And I think that was
just nonsense.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.080
And so we decided to fix it.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.090
And starting Wednesday, you
have this new page.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.720
We show you how the revenue
for your app changed over

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.250
time, aggregated daily.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.260
You can divide it or inspect it
by country and by source of

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.250
revenue, say, by applications
revenue generated from

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.540
application sales, in-app
products, or subscriptions.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.490
I think this is great to get
an overview of how your

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.270
application is doing
at a glance.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.885
You can come her every day,
look at how much money you

00:19:55.885 --> 00:19:57.260
made yesterday.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.580
And it lets you also do
some sort of analysis.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.570
You can look at whether you
are ahead of you company

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.250
targets or not and whether some
countries are performing

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.700
as well as you would expect.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.000
But I also know that many of
you want to integrate this

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.310
data with their own custom
financial reporting tools and

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.890
data pipelines.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.480
So another thing that we're
doing in the coming few weeks

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.310
is that all of financial
reporting from the Google Play

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.880
Developer Console will
be available in

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.490
Google Cloud Storage.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.020
And what that means is that,
by using the utilities

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.270
provided by Google Cloud
Storage, like GSU2, you will

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.620
be able to have programmatic
access to your financial

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.340
reports and to your
financial data.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.490
So you can integrate it with
your own date pipelines.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.010
The other benefit of this is
that, thanks to the new

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.100
permission model, granular
permissions that Miles just

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.550
described, you will be able to
set up a dedicated account

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.010
that will only have access to
financial data and will all be

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.420
used for accessing
the financial

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.980
data in Cloud Storage.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.500
And that account will not be
able to mess up with your APK

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.610
configuration or something.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.900
So you can separate
roles there.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.600
OK, let's talk about referral
tracking and usage.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.430
So another think that we'd like
all of you to have is one

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.220
place, one single place, where
you can see all the data that

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.650
pertains and is about
your application.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.220
And I know that many of you are
using Google Analytics to

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.770
track user engagement and user
interaction with your

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.740
application.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.040
But so far, the experience
was fragmented.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.620
You had to go to the Developer
Console to see device and

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.620
install metrics.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.860
You had to go to Google
Analytics to see activity and

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.720
user engagement.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.680
And soon, during the coming few
weeks, you will be able to

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.100
link together Google Analytics
and Google

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.530
Play Developer Console.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.755
And what that means is, that
once linked together, book by

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:39.890
in Google Analytics, you
will have access to

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.620
additional new metrics.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.820
In particular, you will be able
to see how many views,

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.100
downloads, and installs your
marketing campaigns triggered

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.135
on Google Play.

00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:51.030
And this is really good, because
it gives you a better

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.590
view of the conversion funnel.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.100
You can see more details about
how your users discover your

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.470
app and then went to install you
app, and then became daily

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.720
active users.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.550
This integration
goes both ways.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.930
And so you will have access to
engagement metrics, directly

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.410
from the Play Developer
Console.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.680
So next to installs and other
metrics, you will also see

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.245
engagement, like number
of active users.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.550
So a few more things about
optimization tips--

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.760
so Miles spent a few minutes
talking about how you can use

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.530
the Optimization Tips section
to learn whether your app is

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.820
well-designed for tablets,
whether it meets the Quality

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.920
Checklist requirements,
and et cetera.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.440
But I have bigger plans for the
Optimization Tips section.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.190
I want that to become the place
where you go to discover

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.540
personalized recommendation and
insights that are specific

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.670
to your app and your context.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.180
So starting from a few days ago,
from Wednesday, you now

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.430
have additional tips present in
that section, what we call

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.825
the Localization Tips.

00:22:53.825 --> 00:22:56.630
They help you how to reach a
broader audience and how to

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.330
expand your app to multiple
countries.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.910
When you decide it's time to
go global, you have to do a

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.040
number of things.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.720
You have to localize your APK.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.780
You have to the localize
your store listings.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.250
You may even want to consider
localizing your screenshots,

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.260
because for some markets,
that's really important.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.200
And most importantly, you have
to decide which countries to

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.930
focus on first, where
should I go first.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.260
So now, in the Optimization Tips
sections, you will get

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.020
these localization insights.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.230
They will guide you
in the process.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.380
They will tell you whether
you're missing anything.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.665
Maybe you localized your APK,
but you forgot to localize

00:23:29.665 --> 00:23:30.550
your listing.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.740
And we'll also help you identify
your opportunities.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.305
For example, we'll tell you,
you may have a lot of free

00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:36.450
users from Russia.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.680
Even though you never localize
you app there, that's a great

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:44.950
opportunity that you should go
into, which brings me to the

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.780
next topic, which is reaching
Play's global audience.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:57.300
When you decide to go global,
that first and most important

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.300
thing to want to do is localize

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.030
you application contents.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.770
And many developers are
already doing that and

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.450
expanding into new markets.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.190
And as non-native English
speaker, as you may have

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.540
guessed from my funny
accent, I'm Italian.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.370
I think one of the most
important things is to make

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.790
sure that your app is available
to as many users in

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.590
as many countries in as many
languages as possible, but

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.040
still providing the same
high-quality experience that

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.580
you would provide to users that
speak your own language.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.080
And we announced on Wednesday
that now, from the Google Play

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.010
Developer Console, you have
access to professional

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.460
translations in collaboration
with the Google Translation

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.320
Manager Team.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.570
Let me show you how
this works.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.420
So in the APK screen, at the
very bottom, there is a new

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.140
section which is called the App
Translation Service, that

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.150
you can use to start to
request a professional

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.582
translation.

00:24:49.582 --> 00:24:50.390
Just click the button.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.810
It starts a wizard that will
guide you through the process.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.960
You pick a project name.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.230
That is just for your
convenience.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.205
You may have multiple projects
going on at the same time.

00:25:00.205 --> 00:25:05.100
Pick the language you're
translating from.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.650
You then upload the strings.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.850
If you're using the Android
Developer Tools, you can use

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.330
that directly from the
Eclipse Plugin.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.510
Otherwise, you can just
upload the XML files.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:20.230
Once that's done, you wait.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.210
There you go.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.630
You pick the languages you
want to translate into.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.770
I'm going to pick Japanese and
Korean. there are just two

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.660
markets that you cannot
be outside of.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.020
You pick the service level.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.690
The service level basically
decides how many users, how

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.320
many people are actually looking
at your strings and

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.970
contributing to the translation,
in the

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.380
translation company you pick.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.150
You get an idea of the price.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.170
You choose the translation
company you want to use.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.880
You get an indication of how
long it's going to take and

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.910
how much it's going to cost.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.970
Obviously, the cost of the
translation depends on how

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.350
many words you have in
your strings file.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.420
And then, you get a confirmation
page, where you

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.270
can reorder and get started
with your translation.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.380
The moment you confirm that.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.810
The translation company will
start right away translating

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.970
your strings.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.880
And from the Developer Console,
you will be able to

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.540
check progress.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.310
You will be able to see how far
the translation company is

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.340
in processing all
your content.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.810
While they're doing their work,
you will be able to

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.050
communicate with them, answer
any questions that might

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.370
arise, troubleshooting,
these kind of things.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.460
And then, once all the
strings are done, you

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.770
will be able too--

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.210
again, from the Developer
Console--

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.760
download them, put them
into your APK, pack

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.740
everything, and publish.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.960
And this feature is rolling out
in private beta, just like

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.250
we did for the Developer Console
itself last year,

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.940
which means that if you go to
the APK page right now, you

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.170
will see a sign-up form,
where you can leave all

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.850
your contact details.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.490
And then, we'll shortly start
rolling this out to everybody.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.710
I want to reinforce again the
importance of reaching a

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:54.500
global audience.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.610
I want to speak for a few
seconds about Gameloft.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:59.320
So I think all of you know
who Gameloft is.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.695
They are a very successful
games company.

00:27:01.695 --> 00:27:03.830
They are based in Europe.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.350
They realized very early the
importance of targeting

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.580
multiple languages and
multiple locales.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.540
They're currently available to
12 languages, English, German,

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.490
Italian, French, Chinese,
Japanese, and a few other

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.570
European and Asian languages.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.460
And they have two experiences
they want to share with you.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.920
One is when they decided
to localize "Ice

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.250
Age Village" to Russian.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.810
So "Ice Age Village" has a user
base of 10 million users.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.200
And they discovered that 14%
those users are actually

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.280
Russian users.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.290
That's the second biggest market
after English users.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.550
Another case that the had is
when they decided to localize

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.610
"My Little Pony" to Turkish.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.050
As part of a global application
update, they had a

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.690
Turkish localization.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.600
And they discovered very
interesting figures.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.490
So the number of active users
in Turkey jumped up by 95%,

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.010
compared to 20% to 25% they
did in other countries.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.560
And that was thanks to the
presence of localized content,

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.540
rather than just a simple
application update.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.680
The revenue jumped up
by 600% in Turkey.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.580
And the revenue per
daily active users

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.090
jumped up by 300%.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.330
And another tip that you might
want to use, that they took

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.810
advantage of--

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.580
they used local holidays and
other local knowledge to make

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.840
promotions and sales, like they
did, for example, for the

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.590
Chinese New Year.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.450
So let me stress it
one more time.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.200
Think global, always trying
to target a really global

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.220
audience in multiple countries
and multiple languages.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.240
I hope that these features that
we just announced will

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.810
help yo do that easily.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.670
And if you want to learn more,
there's a session at noon, I

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.100
think, which is Building Android
Apps for a Global

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.410
Audience, where you can learn
more how this translation

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.570
process works and the
details beyond that.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.060
Having said that, let me
go back to that Ellie.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.730
Thank you.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.210
ELLIE POWERS: Thanks, Ricardo.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:48.670
All right.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.300
So today, we've given you an
overview of everything that

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.580
we're bringing you to try to
help you grow your businesses

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.570
across these three
different areas--

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.250
first, publishing your app,
having more control over it,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.280
connecting directly with your
user base; secondly, gaining

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.430
insight into your users and what
they're doing with your

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.730
app; and then, expanding your
app to grow your user base

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.650
into new markets.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.050
So because there was a lot of
stuff, we're going to give you

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.420
a quick summary of everything
that's new.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.610
So first of all, we have, of
course, beta testing and

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.650
staged rollouts, which allows
you to get user feedback,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.410
early on in the process
and respond to it.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.950
Secondly, we're giving you
summaries and overviews of

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.990
user ratings and your revenue,
so that you can check those

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.720
stats at your fingertips
very easily.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.990
Next, we're giving you
tablet-specific screenshots.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.710
So you can show off your
awesome tablet layouts.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.380
And if your app isn't designed
for tablets yet, we give you

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.040
optimization tips to help
you make it that way.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.860
We're also helping you identify
how to localize your

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.670
app and where you should
go first, with new

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:49.350
localization tips.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.140
We also announced that
everyone can

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.640
now reply to reviews.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.510
But stay tuned, because
there's a lot

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.680
more coming this summer.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.680
So we have three new areas where
you should watch for

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.970
some announcements
on the Android

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.950
Developers blog in the future.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:05.110
First of all, we're going to be
having those extra access

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.960
controls, so you can grant
more people access to the

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.540
Developer Console without
getting worried.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.810
We're also adding new Google
Analytics integration figures.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.690
So these were the Campaign
Referral Tracking Flows, that

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.990
conversion funnel, and also
seeing your Google Analytics

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:24.190
usage data, directly in
the Developer Console.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.790
And finally, if you're
interested in translating your

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.960
app with our new App Translation
Service, which is

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.350
being offered in partnership
with our Internationalization

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.060
Team, sign up today in the
Developer Console.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.780
It's at the bottom of
the APK page, if

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.310
you're looking for it.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.830
OK.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.710
So as I said at the beginning,
everything that we're doing is

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.460
with you, Google Play
developers, in mind.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.100
And we need to keep getting
your feedback, in order to

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.380
plan our next 12 months and even
farther in the future.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.910
So we hope that you'll join
us for Office Hours today,

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.380
following this session.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.100
We hope that you also rush right
back after that, because

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.010
at 12 o'clock, there's a very
important session on

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.900
monetization.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.920
And everyone is looking for more
information about money.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.900
If you're watching this session
online and you miss

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.020
the office hours, you want
to make sure that you're

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.920
following Android Developers
on Google+.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.500
Because that's the best place to
go to see new announcements

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.210
about what's happening in the
world of Android development.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.730
You can watch Hangouts.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.010
We always post our blog
posts there as well.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.380
And we go and look for your
feedback about what you're

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.170
looking to see on Google Play.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.610
So that's it.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.300
And the next thing we're
going to do now start

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.770
by taking some questions.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.060
We have about eight
minutes left.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.020
So if you'd like to come to the
microphone at the front.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.340
Or I think there may be possibly
one there as well.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:35.990
That would be great.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.860
We'll alternate between
the two microphones.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.980
All right, so you in the red hat
at the front, what would

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.580
you like to ask?

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.270
AUDIENCE: Hi, Chuck Rebb, form
AWeber Communications.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.040
I actually have two really
quick questions.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.630
I had a lot more.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.310
But I narrowed it down to two.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:51.860
So with the new alpha-beta
production system for

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.510
launching a new version, is
there's still a concept of

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.750
draft APKs?

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.530
And if so, how does
that relate to

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.510
testing In-app Billing?

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.705
ELLIE POWERS: Great question.

00:32:00.705 --> 00:32:01.320
MILES BARR: You want
to take this one?

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.240
RICARDO GOVONI: No, please.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.790
MILES BARR: Yes.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.170
ELLIE POWERS: Miles is going
to take this one.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.710
MILES BARR: So when you go into
the App Advance mode part

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.430
of the tab, you can
upload draft APKs.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.110
So that's still separate from
alpha and beta testing.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.850
You can imagine the alpha and
beta tabs are exactly the same

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.410
as production.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.660
And the drafts are shared across
all three sections.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.110
Is that right?

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.785
RICARDO GOVONI: Yes.

00:32:20.785 --> 00:32:21.965
Go ahead.

00:32:21.965 --> 00:32:24.950
MILES BARR: So they will have
access to In-app Billing, for

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:25.555
testing purposes.

00:32:25.555 --> 00:32:28.970
RICARDO GOVONI: So specific for
In-app Billing, I think we

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.690
still have a few improvements
to do.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.560
But from the In-app Billings
handbooks that was announced,

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.270
in these days, you can both use
the Tester section in the

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.130
Developer Profile, to decide
testers that will have, for

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.340
example, access to full In-app
Billing experience, without

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:42.980
having to actually pay.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.450
Or you can use beta testing
and then side-loading that

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.450
APK, for example or to
do fake purchases.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.310
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.890
And then, my other question was
about the staged rollouts

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.640
for the actual listing.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.290
If you want to add some new
screenshots, new description,

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.610
things like that, if you're
doing a staged rollout, is

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:06.360
only the people who are getting
the update going to

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.100
see the new listing?

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.170
Or is everyone going
to see it?

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:08.560
RICARDO GOVONI: No.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.550
At the moment, there's just
still one listing.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.510
So you may want to pay attention
to that for the

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.490
moment, for the time being.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.220
So if you put something in
your Store listing, for

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.530
example, a brand new feature,
and you're still rolled out

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.580
only to 5% of the users.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.900
It may be you have to
communicate that publicly.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.545
Maybe you want to say that we
are rolling out a new version.

00:33:26.545 --> 00:33:28.520
And that's a feature that
you are getting.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.980
And they will be getting
over the next few days.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.390
AUDIENCE: So you say,
for the time being.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:34.145
That makes me hopeful about
what's to come.

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:34.800
MILES BARR: Yes.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.266
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:36.430
ELLIE POWERS: We're always
looking for feedback. all

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.800
right, in the back, please.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
Manford Mosa.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.170
I have an interest in automating
the whole process

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:44.870
of the deployment now, with
staging in the deployment.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:49.490
Is there some sort of plan
towards being allowed to

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.880
integrate in a continuous
integration server, to

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.110
automatically, as part of the
nightly build with QA tests

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.610
that are automated, push it out
to a staged environment

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.590
automatically?

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.380
I mean, at the moment I'm
doing with Selenium.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.200
But that's a hack.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.650
So is there some sort of plan to
like have an API maybe, so

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.580
it could even be integrate
in build tools?

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:11.432 --> 00:34:13.269
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, all right.

00:34:13.269 --> 00:34:14.310
We've totally heard you.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.480
This has been a super-popular
developer request.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.070
Everyone has got their
own system.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.630
And we're really excited with
the beta testing, that more

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.800
and more people want
to be pushing their

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.860
APKs, even more often.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.860
So I guess we won't say too
much about the future.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.949
But we definitely will say,
we've heard that.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:29.969
We're thinking about it.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.750
And as soon is we have anything
to share, we'll

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.420
definitely let you know.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.760
But we definitely hear
you on that one.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.270
That's a very common request
that we get.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.611
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:38.611 --> 00:34:40.850
AUDIENCE: So in the Play Store,
you guys added the

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.670
Design for Tablets feature.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.219
Because you recognize that
phones and tablets are

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.469
fundamentally different
in their apps.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.409
With more Smart Glass products
coming out, is that going to

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.719
be accessible to other
types of products?

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.520
And if one were to manufacture
such a product, how would they

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.710
engage with you guys to make
sure that feature would happen

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.354
and set the criteria and
all that kind of stuff?

00:35:01.354 --> 00:35:02.410
ELLIE POWERS: All right.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:02.920
MILES BARR: All right.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.670
ELLIE POWERS: Take this one?

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.880
MILES BARR: It's a good one.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.480
So right now, we're only
focusing on tablets.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.150
But we're aware, within
our team, we've got--

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.650
our team and externally-- lots
of different form factors that

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.330
are coming out.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:19.730
So when you think of things like
Google TV, it's something

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.000
we consider.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.670
I think we want to wait for a
particular device class to

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.740
take off or begin to get
a foothold, before

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.190
we change the store.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.250
But definitely, other
form packs are

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.446
something we'd consider.

00:35:31.446 --> 00:35:34.051
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:38.330
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the device distribution

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.860
of my app in the Play
Store dashboard.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.650
So what I see with the top 10
devices, my app is doing good.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.280
But what are the top 10 devices
on an aggregate level

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.130
in Play Store that
I don't know.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:53.620
And it might be the case that
the top device in my app might

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.140
be the 15th global
stack ranking.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.920
And I might be leaving a lot of
money on the table because

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.400
my app really doesn't do well
on the top devices in the

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.500
global ranking.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.240
Is there any way I can get
access to that data?

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.590
MILES BARR: So the short
answer is no.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.140
But the aim is that, you
shouldn't be focusing on

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.320
particular types of devices.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.320
You should be making sure your
app works across all devices

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.420
on the same great experience.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:24.450
So don't worry too much about
specific devices.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.050
Try to use the beta
testing feature.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.010
Try to reach more users on
different devices, to make

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.180
sure it works well.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.820
If you're doing some really
cutting edge stuff, we've seen

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.450
some people really push
the boundaries of 3D.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.490
And sometimes that
causes problems.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.240
You can look at the Crash Report
section, particularly

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.970
to find out if there's a
problem device and how

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.010
best to fix on it.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.580
But definitely don't try to
optimize your app for a

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.000
specific set of devices.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.090
Just make sure it's a great
experience for everyone.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.368
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:52.368 --> 00:36:54.350
AUDIENCE: John Coryat,
with the Radar Now!

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:56.010
USNaviguide--

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.300
I have some maybe APKs in my
Developer Console that are

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.250
years old and essentially
abandoned.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.540
And now, with the rollout of the
beta feature, I'm going to

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.640
have all these beta versions
of our app stuck out there.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.710
Is there going to be a feature
to archive or delete old and

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.810
abandoned APKs?

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.110
ELLIE POWERS: Yes, this is also
a very popular request.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.550
I saw some applause
over there.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:18.330
So it depends.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.180
So right now, many of you may
not know this, but if you have

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.970
not published an app, you
can delete it today.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.530
So if you go to the Developer
Console, on the right-hand

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.910
side, there's a little
gray button.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.085
And you can select Delete.

00:37:32.085 --> 00:37:34.110
AUDIENCE: Well, these
are like apps that--

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:34.660
ELLIE POWERS: I know.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.560
If you've published them, I
totally hear you on that.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.630
I see a lot of feedback.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.760
It's definitely in the top 10
things we're seeing coming

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.380
into the feedback.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.160
So we hear you on that.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.080
I guess, with the alpha and
beta, just to be really clear,

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.610
those are in the same
store listing.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.670
So it's not going to litter
up your app page anymore.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.290
But we definitely hear folks who
are having apps that they

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:52.170
don't work on anymore.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.050
And they kind of want
to hide that.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.740
AUDIENCE: Well, I have
beta versions of

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.030
our apps for testing.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.730
And now, we're want
to abandon those.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:00.630
ELLIE POWERS: With different
package names.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.980
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.520
ELLIE POWERS: OK, I see.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.510
Yes, we've definitely
heard that.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.870
I guess we're not announcing
any changes today, that are

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:06.490
happening there.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.042
But we've definitely heard
that as a top 10 request.

00:38:09.042 --> 00:38:10.560
RICARDO GOVONI: It's that just
something that you would like

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.620
to hide from the applications
list?

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.300
AUDIENCE: Yes, it would be OK if
we could just archive them,

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.820
so that they're not sticking
there right in our face, every

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.120
time we go in.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.770
Sometimes also, it would be
good to order, be able to

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:22.730
order the list.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:25.320
So that the ones that we're
using and that are popular at

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.830
the top, instead of--

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:27.730
I don't know exactly.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.310
You might have it

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:29.710
alphabetically now or something.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:30.466
RICARDO GOVONI: I think
it's alphabetically.

00:38:30.466 --> 00:38:34.540
AUDIENCE: But archiving, just
archive, hide or something.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.500
ELLIE POWERS: A lot of folks
have wanted to hide the

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.170
unpublished ones, once they're
not using it anymore.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.740
So we definitely have
heard that one.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.385
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks
very much.

00:38:43.385 --> 00:38:45.130
Oh, I love the comments
thing by the way.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:45.950
I've had it for a year.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:46.440
It's great.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.230
ELLIE POWERS: Awesome.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.130
I'm glad.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.970
In the back--

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.530
AUDIENCE: My question is
about staged rollouts.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.060
And specifically, how do you
determine which percentage of

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:54.820
users is it.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.780
And is it the same percentage
of users each time?

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.000
Or is it different?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.920
So when you release new versions
of the app, is it

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.470
always going to be that
same 10% that

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.280
you're going to be trying?

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:09.330
MILES BARR: So it's random
per staged rollout.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.310
So by that, when you're rolling
out a new version, we

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.830
sort of have a different
random seed.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.050
So it's jut select which 10%.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.750
But we keep that seed during
that rollout process.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.950
So if you don't want to push
that out to 100% and you want

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.940
to replace it with another APK,
those original 10% will

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:26.690
get the update.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:31.670
AUDIENCE: You could have a 2.0
to everyone, a 2.1 to 10% and

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.550
then a 2.2 to a different 10%?

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.960
Is that possible?

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.580
MILES BARR: No, there's
only one staged

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.150
rollout at any time.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.810
RICARDO GOVONI: So any time you
do a staged rollout, we

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.940
pick a different part
of the population.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.780
So it's not the same guys
that get the same

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.270
testing APK each time.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.530
But during a staged rollout,
if you decide that the

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.140
particular APK needs changing,
then you can change it.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.460
And the same group of users
will receive that.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.490
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.300
MILES BARR: And also, to
clarify, staged rollout is not

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:54.590
for testing.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.276
RICARDO GOVONI: Yeah, sorry.

00:39:56.276 --> 00:39:58.390
MILES BARR: Only staged rollout,
when you're ready for

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.420
everyone to get it.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.330
ELLIE POWERS: All right, so it
looks like we basically have

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.300
five seconds left.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:02.950
But don't worry.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.780
I still see some folks wanting
to ask questions.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.960
We're just going to head
back to Office Hours.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.250
And don't forget that there's a
Monetization session in here

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.500
in an hour.
