00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.010
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: And
thanks everybody for coming.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.920
And who here feels happy?

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.720
Who here would
like to be happier?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.070
Who thanks deep down
that other people are

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.365
responsible for your happiness?

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.420
Who blames other people for you
for the unhappiness that you

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.920
feel?

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.900
Who blames others, in
part, for the unhappiness

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.080
that you feel in your life?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:07.420
And lastly, who believes
that we have it in our power

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.430
to be unbelievably happy?

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.240
So the question then is-- let me
just begin just by asking you,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.730
what is it that is
stopping you being happier,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.960
given that you all think
that you could be happier?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.580
What is it that's blocking you?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.380
And we're going to be
doing some exercises

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.990
and I do want to get
you on your backs.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.767
And as I'm just
looking at you there,

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.600
I'm trying to think how
I'm going to do that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.670
but we'll do it.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.370
I want you to-- just answer
that question actually

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.360
to begin with.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.676
What is it-- just some ideas.

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:53.550
What is it that's blocking
you being happier?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.200
Ego.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.700
Time.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.650
What is this thing called ego?

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.260
I mean all my life people
have talked about ego

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.580
and no one's ever really
satisfactorily defined it.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.289
What is ego?

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.450
AUDIENCE: Your mind-- the
voice in your mind [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.390
SIR ANTHONY SELDON:
Your voice in your mind,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.700
which is self-referencing.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.300
Time.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.620
Why is time a problem?

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.144
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:22.060
SIR ANTHONY SELDON:
There's never enough time.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.640
But what does that mean,
there's never enough time.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.855
What you're actually
saying is, be honest,

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:40.790
I don't choose to-- who's
in charge your time?

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.080
So rephrase that question in a
way that takes responsibility

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.705
for the answer.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.740
I am not giving the
time that I would

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.530
like to give it to thinking
about my own happiness.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.600
Is happiness selfish?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.120
Hands up.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.369
Can I just see, who thinks
that happiness, being happy

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.410
is fundamentally selfish?

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.370
Who thinks it's
fundamentally the best

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.515
thing for you and for everyone
who loves you to be happy?

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:19.670
You know, just one of many
misconceptions about happiness

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.560
is that we think it's selfish.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.500
All of you think now of
somebody, a brother, a sister,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.000
parent, friend, who is very
unhappy, seriously unhappy.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.960
And how does that make you
feel when you think about them?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.990
What?

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.181
How does it make you feel?

00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:46.680
Unhappy.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.600
Drags you down.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.400
Unhappiness drags us down.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.060
And now let's think of
somebody that's really happy,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.620
a brother or sister, get real.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.290
Parents, who, somebody's
really happy around you.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.330
Just think about that person
and think what they do to you.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.990
I think what you could
now do to everyone round

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.680
you, if, fundamentally--
and the proposition

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.839
is that we all lead lives
which could become much more

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:26.940
fulfilling and much happier and
much more meaningful and much

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.346
more considered.

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:30.220
And we're looking at
why that doesn't happen.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.275
And we talked about this thing,
this self-referencing mind.

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:36.270
And we talked about
us choosing not

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.370
to make time available
for us, while blaming

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.400
everybody else and
the cat and the dog

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.680
for not giving us enough time.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.180
What else?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.936
What else stops us
from being happier?

00:04:47.936 --> 00:04:49.444
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:49.444 --> 00:04:50.485
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: Fear?

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:51.674
Fear of what?

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:54.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.550
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: Fear
of not getting it right.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.246
Is fear a powerful
emotion in you?

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:00.162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.910
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: Fear is a
powerful emotion in all of us.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.326
Sometimes we're afraid to make
the choices that we could make

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:12.450
that would make us happier.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.975
Just a couple more things.

00:05:14.975 --> 00:05:16.350
What's stopping
us being happier?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.264
Yeah.

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:18.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.900
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: Fear
that the person next door,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.144
working in that next door
screen or next door office here.

00:05:33.144 --> 00:05:34.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.340
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: So how
can one deal with that?

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.256
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:48.440
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: OK.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.050
Or you could be more accepting.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.050
Just one more thing
because you are

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.180
going to go out of here
at 5:30 and some of you

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.260
will be unchanged and others
of you will be changed.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:14.020
Others of you I will leave here
with a fundamentally enhanced

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.470
drive about going and
making yourself happier.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.240
So let's just think, right.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.380
I think we've done enough
thinking about that.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.450
I want us just to
be very still now.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.126
And OK, so I want us
to close our eyes.

00:06:31.126 --> 00:06:32.250
Everybody close their eyes.

00:06:38.095 --> 00:06:43.700
A lot of clicking, listens to
the clicking and the ringing

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.050
and air con and the
noise round about you.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.810
I want you to sit
up, sit upright.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:07:01.610
And just find that nice
point of-- that nice point

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.180
of balance for your back.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.840
You know, it's wonderful
to find the position

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.185
for standing and sitting.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.780
This is something that
if you don't do it,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.720
you can really take away
with renewed energy,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.020
is to find a position we could
all adopt that will not give us

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.100
back pain, not make us need
to go to how's have massages

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.190
for back pain.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:36.320
The massages are very nice,
but where we feel just

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.390
properly balance.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.580
Try and see if you could
find that point in the back.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.850
I want you to earth your
feet, really earth your feet.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.850
And if you're-- my eyes
are closed by the way.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.640
So can't see what you're doing.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.800
But if you a standing up,
you might want to sit down.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:02.190
And I want you just
to breathe deeply.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.660
The mind plays
many tricks on us.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.150
One is it denies
to us that there

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.290
are levels of stillness
that we can all

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:28.470
it experience, which
are profoundly restful.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.710
I'm asking you, if you
don't know this already,

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.260
and it's not a
question of belief,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.120
it's a question of
knowledge, that if you

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.570
don't know levels of
inner silence and rest

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:52.180
and stillness, which are
beyond words, to accept

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.630
there is that state.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:01.910
And what stopping us getting
there is all the things

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.520
we talked about,
the restless mind,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.110
the clicking of the
door, the noises outside.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.350
So I'm asking us,
or I'm inviting you,

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:22.630
I'm inviting you to let
go of the turning mind

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:31.600
and to experience yourself,
not believe, not think about,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.460
thinking is not
going to help here,

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.420
it's about letting
go of thinking.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:42.800
Experience a level of
stillness beyond anything

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.700
you've experienced
today, beyond anything

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.160
you've experienced this week.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:57.980
And to understand that, in
making ourselves happier

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.980
and thinking more about
our own well-being.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.640
This is profoundly helpful
for everyone round us.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.300
We're better for colleagues
if we are happier and look

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.320
after our well-being.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.610
We're better for ourselves.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.900
We're better for
everyone who loves us,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.200
everyone who works with us.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.330
So there's nothing
selfish about this.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:24.790
There's nothing selfish about
taking time out of your life

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:34.610
and to care for your own mental
health, psychological health,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.620
physical health,
spiritual health,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:49.230
and embrace a level of stillness
which will give you happiness,

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:55.960
which is beyond nourishment,
beyond any pleasure

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:05.310
that cocaine and
sex and any Lord

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.480
or whatever it
wants to indulge in.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.090
It is beyond happiness
is the title of the book.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.300
It's beyond pleasure,
it's beyond happiness.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:25.390
It's a level of complete,
utter acceptance of oneself

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:30.960
and of other people, not
as a belief, but as a fact,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.770
an experience that we
can have all our lives.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.920
We can carry around
all our lives.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:48.640
And so breathing
and loving your body

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.270
and getting to know your body
is really fundamental in this.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.680
So just run a scan over
your body and over your mind

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.920
at the moment, with the eyes
closed and in a relaxed, really

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.050
relaxed position.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:09.830
And the feet grounded, just
feel the pressures of the day

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.590
just coming out
through the feet.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.350
Imagine that you're walking
around at home, barefoot.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:27.740
Think how wonderful that can be
walking barefoot, maybe walking

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.680
on a beach barefoot on a lawn.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.360
And just feel that sense
of contact earthiness

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.820
between the sole of the
foot and the ground.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.330
Let all the tension
just come out

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.510
through those many, many nerves
in the bottom of the feet.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:53.860
Just let it drain out
and just sense yourself,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:13:01.710
just feel how your feet and your
lower legs are, just notice.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.470
If it's holding tension
there, just let it go.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.950
If you are, just come up through
the knees and the thighs.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:20.740
Come up through your whole
sitting area, your abdomen,

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.460
coming up to the lower trunk.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.600
Just see what's there.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.671
Are you holding tension?

00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:31.300
Are you holding on to things?

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.720
Just notice.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.650
This whole journey into
happiness is about noticing.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.920
It's about letting go
and it's about seeing

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.890
what's really present and
accepting it and embracing it.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.040
And then letting it go.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:58.360
And coming up through the core,
the chest, shoulders, hands.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:06.480
Coming through the-- coming up
through the hands, the palms.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.690
Just hold them out.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.380
Just feel the heat of the sun.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.310
Feel the heat of the sun.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:19.510
Imagine on your palms, the
warmth radiating through.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.380
Goodness coming into the
body through the hands

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:31.180
and coming up through
the forearms, the elbows,

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.760
the upper arms, the shoulders.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:43.340
Just feel all the tension now
coming out of the shoulders.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:53.170
Just if you're holding on
to it, you can let it go.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.790
In the same way that
if you're holding

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.070
on in your mind to
anxious thoughts

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.650
about what am I going
to do tonight, what am I

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.150
going to pick up
the dinner, how am I

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.490
going to finish this
assignment, what does so and so

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.400
think of me, let it all go.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.590
Because it's not here now.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:20.180
What's here now is us
and the present moment.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.480
And that present moment
is always a present.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.900
it's always a reminder
that we can just

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.040
live in the present
moment, or we can live

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.760
in our heads, lost in thought.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.200
So we're in the present
moment now together.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.980
And just feel your
sense of everybody.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.060
Just slightly embarrassing
to do this, but just

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:47.020
mentally embrace
everybody in this space.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.930
Just feel as if your arms
are coming around the person

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.010
next to you.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.650
And feel them around you.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:01.470
Feel their support
and acceptance.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:08.400
And extend beyond them to people
further away and to everybody

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.750
in this room.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.130
They are telling you that you
can accept yourself, that it's

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.010
fine to be as you are.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.000
And accept that.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:29.060
Just feel your whole self, your
whole face becoming lighter,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.950
feel a calm, gently
warm breeze coming,

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:43.260
passing through your face, over
your cheeks, over your eyes.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.200
Feel just a warm glow on
your eyes, just letting go.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.450
When you feel the thought,
let it go, let it go.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.330
And just be here
now in this room.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.040
There's no anxiety in this room.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.210
There's no pressure.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.190
There are no enemies.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:11.190
There's just good people,
good human beings,

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.150
who want the best for you.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:21.890
And breathing is the
core of our being

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.760
and we are not taught how
to breathe in this country

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.250
or in most countries.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.760
But breathing is wonderful.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.900
So keeping that
still good posture,

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.060
just breathing in to
the count of three,

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:45.245
coming in, one, two,
three, and hold that.

00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:56.440
And coming out, one, and
two, and three, four, five,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.500
and inhaling, coming
in, deep breath.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:06.900
One, two, three, and hold it.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.940
And exhaling through
the nostrils.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.540
Feel the air come out through
the nostrils, two, and three,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.620
and four, and five.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.610
Inhaling, feel the air coming
in through the nostrils,

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:26.406
and one, and two, and
three and hold it.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:36.830
And exhaling, one,
two, three, four, five.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.110
And inhaling, real
depth in here,

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:46.430
coming in, coming in, and
one, and two, and three,

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.160
and just feel the
point between the eyes.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.730
Just hold that.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:56.560
And exhaling, one, two,
just listen to those noises

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:02.270
and accept them, and
three, and four, and five.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.120
The concentration is very
important, by the way.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.510
Try and keep the concentration
on the tip of the nose,

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:17.180
coming in just one last time,
in, one, and two, and three,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:27.610
and exhaling, one, two,
three, four, and five.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.630
Just notice, breathing under
your own time, notice the mind.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:37.240
Is the mind any different
at all to how it's been?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.730
Just notice the mind.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:44.990
Are you feeling any sense
of greater acceptance?

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.302
And I just want you to
keep the eyes closed.

00:19:48.302 --> 00:19:53.210
And I want you to
recall the time

00:19:53.210 --> 00:20:04.370
in your life when you have
felt the stillest, the calmest,

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.010
that you've ever
felt. A real time.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.550
And once you've alighted
on that experience,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:23.970
that occasion, just try and
recall what it was about that

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:33.730
and how that felt. I want
you to move towards it.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.865
I want you to just let
that sense come to you now.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:51.650
See if you can hear the distant
smell of it, the distant ripple

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.610
or echo of it here now.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:06.550
I want you to see
yourself as you would like

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.020
to be in front of yourself.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.890
I want you just to see yourself
as you would dearly love to be.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:25.740
With the qualities, the
attributes, the person

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:33.590
who would be superbly
happy, the person who

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.840
is beyond any worldly
recognition of money or status

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.600
or reward.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.920
But maybe those things
are important too.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.460
If they are, include them.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.880
And if they are, just see
them there in front of you.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.730
Visualization is,
as you all know,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.100
incredibly powerful, or can be.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.990
See that person, and
walk towards that person.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.200
And feel what's left
inside, you feel

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.742
the-- whatever
inadequacies you might feel

00:22:12.742 --> 00:22:16.990
or hurts that you might have.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.610
And just walk up to
that person and embrace

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:25.070
them, this supremely happy
person, this supremely happy

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:30.860
you and just see you
coming together as one.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:44.450
And we're going to do just one
or two exercises with orange

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.780
and one or two other things.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.790
But I want you just
before that, just

00:22:47.790 --> 00:23:00.440
to do the cathartic exercise
of imagining that you

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.460
have a cushion in front you.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.530
You've got two cushions.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:17.820
And one of them could be
your boss or your partner

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.670
or your father and the
other could be your mother

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.020
or your best friend.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:32.390
And you've got in your
hand a big wooden spoon,

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:37.780
a big, heavy wooden
spoon, old and heavy.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.870
And I want you to,
having imagined

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.880
who those cushions
are, I want you

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.270
to see yourself, on that first
cushion, really hitting it.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:55.420
And just see if you can
connect with letting

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.500
go, which is the key to
happiness, letting go.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.700
It's not about acquiring.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.870
The happiness is inside us.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.590
We don't have to go
anywhere or do anything.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.040
We just have to let go.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.600
So letting go, really
hit, see yourself

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.360
really beating
that cushion hard,

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.790
cushion A, whoever
that is to you.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.620
You can work yourself
up in a frenzy.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.675
You can make noises.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.210
Screaming at it.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.870
And then coming
over, you can still

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.110
love this person, whoever A is.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.710
Come over to B,
and you could still

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.590
love B very much,
whoever B is and take

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.110
that wooden, large ladle,
spoon in your hand.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:51.790
And come up to B and just
hit it and get whatever

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.275
you want to out of your system.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.000
Anger that is something
the corrupts us,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:09.080
and so many people take anger
to their graves with them.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:15.370
Parents, grandparents, take
anger, take fear, take sadness,

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.400
take regret to their graves.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.220
What we're saying here is these
things will be part of you

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.370
and they will occlude
your happiness

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:33.410
unless you take responsibility
and start acting to assimilate

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.830
them and to let them go.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:39.620
So you're hitting that cushion
B, whoever that is that.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:49.570
It's not anybody in the room,
cushion B. And so just let

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.460
yourself rip into cushion B.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.900
Just one last one is
to come to-- imagine,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:05.120
eyes closed, the
most sacred space,

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.540
what is your most sacred space?

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.410
Just see it.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:21.910
Is it a building,
a field, a beach,

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:28.870
a presence with someone
else, a room, an object?

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:38.310
Come into that sacred space,
and whatever your fears

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:43.490
and sadnesses are, lay
them in that sacred space,

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:47.760
knowing that the sacred
space will absorb them.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.910
The sacred space will
not be diminished.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.980
The sacred space to grow if
you can do this, and just

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.980
lay them there.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:09.110
And then, take it and
place it and then walk away

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.690
or give if these things up.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.982
They're imaginings.

00:27:13.982 --> 00:27:14.690
They're not real.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:23.350
They're imaginings that we carry
with us forever unless we act.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.970
So there we are.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.970
That's some of the journey.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:36.560
I would like, while we
just take some questions,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.960
can I just maybe put
these between three?

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.740
I didn't quite know how
they're going to work out.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.260
Maybe we'll take an
orange between two

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.840
and a flower between three.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:28:00.744
Can I just ask, while
we're doing that,

00:28:00.744 --> 00:28:08.060
did any questions arise
or any observations

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:08.860
from that exercise?

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:23.130
One flower I think between
three or actually maybe,

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.540
I think we're going to do this.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.330
We can actually break
them off the main stem.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.700
Can you break them so
everybody has their own flower.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:47.494
And just while we're doing--
while we're doing that,

00:28:47.494 --> 00:28:48.660
can you look at your flower.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:06.760
OK, just keeping the
concentration everybody.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.700
Does any question emerge
while we were doing that?

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.480
Anyone fall asleep?

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.050
Falling asleep is fine.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.940
But I would like to see
you at the end the session

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.340
for an explanation.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.520
OK.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.640
Have you all got a flower?

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.380
I want you to look
at your flower

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.575
now in the present moment.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:44.500
Do you all know what I mean by
the difference between looking

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.640
at the flower in
the present moment

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.197
and looking at the flower in
the ordinary state of mind.

00:29:52.197 --> 00:29:53.155
What is the difference?

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.040
It's simple awareness, yeah.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.100
Do it knowingly.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.000
So if you can look
at your flower now

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.710
and if you could study it with
total concentration on it.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:21.940
Look at it with an intensity
and a power of acute observation

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:30.960
that you have never done before.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.880
You have never had
this moment before.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.720
You have never seen
this power before.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.990
This is a unique moment
in human history.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:44.580
And look at it with
an intense love,

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:50.965
and an intense awareness of
if the colors, the shapes.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.350
And now just touch
it to your cheek.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:07.170
Just feel, gently, just
sense that sensation.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.910
And now bring it to
your nose, and there's

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.360
just ever say slight sense.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:29.490
And with that, just feel
an acute love for that,

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:33.300
as if it's their most
precious possession.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.050
And now give it to the
person next to you.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.930
Give it with love.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.390
Give it with total love.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:02.150
OK, have you got an orange
more or less between two.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.950
Who has not got an
orange between two?

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.910
Who has got an
orange between one?

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.840
OK.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.580
Gently and not in
a way as if you

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.550
would be beating the cushions.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.450
Could we get an
orange between three?

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.020
Who now doesn't have an
orange between three?

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.130
OK.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:34.560
So can we have-- there's a
sense of orangelessness here.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:49.260
All right so, can
we just descatter.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.740
Can I ask, who practices
mindfulness here already?

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.030
OK.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:33:02.440
Mindfulness is about the
descattering of the mind.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:08.430
It's an approach which is
thousands of years old,

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:13.160
which the Western world
thinks it's now discovering.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.690
It is thousands of years
old and it is simply

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.610
about savoring the
present moment.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.820
It's about a
conscious awareness.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.460
Who here's aware of walking
or driving across London

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.060
or catching a tube home,
getting home, putting

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.276
the key in the lock, and
thinking, how did I do that?

00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:35.775
Has anyone ever had
that experience?

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:39.680
Sorry?

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:42.390
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: OK.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:47.650
I mean doing that is
fine, doing that is fine,

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.210
but that is not mindfulness.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.800
Mindfulness is about being
aware of what you're doing.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.970
So taking that
orange between two,

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.150
could we just open
that orange up.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:05.270
And could you share
with somebody else

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:09.730
and I want to do it mindfully.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.100
Just do it very consciously.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.880
And then can you pass a
piece of the fruit, a segment

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.570
of the fruit, to somebody else.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.909
Don't eat it yet.

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:22.880
OK.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.130
And of course,
everyone's cleaned

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:33.400
that hands so it's to
be absolutely-- Just

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.270
smell that orange,
that aroma of orange.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.230
OK.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.750
Could you now pass a piece
of orange to everybody.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:52.810
So everybody hold-- OK, so
moving the oranges round,

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.389
so everybody has a
segment of orange.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.680
Can you just pass them round
once you've got them open.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:10.310
And could I also ask, could
everyone just be quiet please.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.660
Can I ask you to notice
how your mind is defaulting

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.590
in an involuntary
way, some of you,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.930
back to work, back
to insecurities, back

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.610
to what it's all this
about, that they're not

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:26.500
in the present.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.220
I mean you all can think
and do whatever you want.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:36.620
But you'll get more from this
if you're silent and present

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:41.680
and not checking your
gadgets, just being here now

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.820
and paying everybody
else the compliment,

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.650
the incredible compliment
of being present with them.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.620
Do you know that's what love is?

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:52.190
Love is just to be there.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:57.160
Love isn't about rich,
parents, or partners,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.480
buying expensive meals.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.140
Love is simply about being
completely and utterly

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.960
present with somebody else.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:12.150
There is nothing more that we
can ever be to anybody else

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:16.000
than to be totally,
unscatteredly

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.100
present in front of them.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.980
That is love.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:24.200
So have you all now got-- I
want you now to-- don't try this

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.790
yet.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:29.980
I want you all please
to have the experience

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.520
of having your first ever--
What fruit are they, by the way?

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:37.840
Whatever they are.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.110
You're going to have a
whatever they are orangey

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.830
kind of experience.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:47.240
I want you to bring it to
your nose and just smell it.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.130
And close your eyes
before you smell it

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.010
and then inhale, and put
the total concentration

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:55.070
into that smelling.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.435
And let that orangey
smell percolate

00:36:59.435 --> 00:37:01.190
and have it your whole being.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.160
And I now what you put it down.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.140
Very open your lips and
very, very slowly place it

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.870
on the tongue.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.600
And just feel that sensation.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:24.100
Feel the weight of
it on the tongue.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:29.360
And totally mindfully,
just start chewing on it.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.050
And just love, total
immersion in the experience

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:34.810
of that orange.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.640
Total silence.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.080
Just close the
eyes for a second.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.440
And just notice the mind
goes and it comes back.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.150
OK.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.800
Let me just conclude.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:12.700
This was a-- I don't normally
write about happiness

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.630
by the way.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.470
I normally write books
about prime ministers

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.190
so that's what-- So my
new book is about Cameron.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.917
It's out next month.

00:38:22.917 --> 00:38:24.250
It's the inside book of Cameron.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:29.620
I did a book on Blair, two books
on Blair and Brown, before,

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.530
but this is just a subject
that's really important to me.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:37.040
So with Lord Layard we set
up action for happiness.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.980
And in this book, I'm talking
about how who we are-- we

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.800
will be much like
our parents, and they

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.599
will be much like their parents
and your grandparents will

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:50.140
be much like your
great grandparents.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.920
We carry on in these lines and
grooves of habitual behavior

00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:01.050
unless we decide we want
to let go and discover

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.760
extraordinary depths.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.200
And by extraordinary, I
mean precisely that word,

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.530
because it is extraordinary.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.870
Most of us live
just ordinary lives.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.370
I mean, we might
be rich and famous.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.869
And I spend a lot
of my time writing

00:39:12.869 --> 00:39:14.340
about the rich and famous.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.940
Boy, are they often
very unhappy and they

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.130
lead very ordinary
life, skimming

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.620
on the surface of ambition
and fear of other people

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:28.380
and what other people might do
to them and suspicion and anger

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.070
and regret.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.790
We can dive deep, deep,
deep down into life

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:37.120
and to lead to
extraordinary lives.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.750
And to do that we didn't
have to acquire anything.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.460
We simply have to let go.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:50.370
We have to learn how to let
go of the anger, the fear,

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.500
the sadness, the depression.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.520
And we have to start
experiencing in us

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.320
the real depths.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:02.230
And to do that, recall the still
moments, the sacred spaces,

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.830
and getting in touch with our
bodies and with our feelings

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.110
is fundamental.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:10.330
And I know you all know that,
but sometimes it's helpful,

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:15.820
particularly in an office, given
that you work alongside or not

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.410
too far from each other,
to recognize that together.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:23.030
And in this book here,
I talk about pleasure

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.630
and what was the name of
that lord, by the way?

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:29.040
I'm not trying to laugh at
him, I'm feeling sad for him.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.600
What?

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.370
Sewell.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.860
I mean, he was trying
to find pleasure.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.030
I mean, of course what he
was trying to do, I guess,

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:39.970
was to find something
that would make him,

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.330
deep down-- the
craving for happiness

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.410
is there in all of us.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.440
And he looked for it
in the wrong place.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.090
And it's very sad and I
certainly don't laugh at him.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.440
But I talk about going through
pleasure into happiness.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.600
And I talk about how we
could move towards happiness

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.660
by learning to, A.
accept ourselves,

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.130
B, belonging is
really important,

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.510
C, character, which is all
about playing to our character

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.610
strengths and not
being-- playing

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.280
from our great qualities and
not worrying too much about we

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.440
can't do.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.370
About having a
discipline, which is

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.350
what I was saying there about--
otherwise it will just simply--

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.670
your life will suddenly go.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:24.290
Empathy, really truly
emphasizing with each other

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.060
and with ourselves.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.750
Having a focus in life.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.480
Giving.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.840
Undoubtedly those people who, if
you want to feel good, do good.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.820
Do good to others.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.620
It always makes us feel better.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.290
Those of you volunteer will
know exactly what I mean.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.850
And H is to health, and
taking our physical,

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.810
mental, and psychological
health seriously

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.560
is fundamental in happiness.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.630
A happy mind does
equal-- and a happy body

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.240
will mean a happy mind.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.630
If you jog and run
and you all know that.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:59.280
And if you eat well, conversely
if you do the wrong things,

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.210
you won't feel happy.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:04.650
And then five ways to get
beyond happiness, inquiry, being

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:08.680
on a journey, karma,
which is about thinking

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.660
about the hurt
you've done to others

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:16.120
and trying to seek
forgiveness, to forgive others

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.740
and on it goes.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.740
So that's the book.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.698
I don't know if there
are any questions in just

00:42:20.698 --> 00:42:22.010
the remaining time.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.810
It's a topic I absolutely love.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:28.500
And it came out of my own
experience and to some extent

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:34.040
my family's experience
of being not very happy,

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.330
certainly my experience.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:39.020
I was pretty profoundly
unhappy when I was younger.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.220
So and it was near here.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.060
It was about two
blocks south of here

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.280
that one day when I was
writing my doctoral thesis.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.750
When I was at LSE, I used to
work at the British Museum.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:00.800
And I went past this
secondhand bookshop

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.810
and there was this book that
said, do you want to be happy?

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:07.179
And I was kind of interested,
but didn't go and buy it.

00:43:07.179 --> 00:43:08.720
The next day I
thought I would buy it

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.880
and it wasn't in the shop.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.379
Because it was a
secondhand bookshop

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:14.675
they've got no idea who wrote
the book or what it was.

00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:17.950
So as I say in the book,
I've written the kind of book

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.120
I would have wanted
that to be, so I could

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.710
have read that when I was 25.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.620
OK any questions on anything?

00:43:28.136 --> 00:43:29.320
Yeah.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.770
We have about five or 10
minutes for questions.

00:43:58.481 --> 00:43:58.980
OK.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.150
No, I can see that.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:07.830
Let me see if I can
explain what I mean.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:17.660
The experience, my
experience in life,

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.140
is that there is a
radiant, inner stillness

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.000
and happiness within me.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.890
And it's not anything
that I and the people who

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:38.490
I admire who write
and think about this

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.850
also happen to believe.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.820
They believe that it's
not anything external.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.010
It's not anything that
we have to acquire.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:48.630
It is a case of letting
go to acquire it.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.625
But to do that we
need to have a focus.

00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:52.810
That was the point about focus.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.030
So many people in life
don't have a focus.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.030
They're not this way and
they're not that way.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.310
And they get this promotion.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.450
but then they think, is
this really what I want?

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.990
They go from that promotion.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:11.020
My experience of being in
schools and a teacher and still

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.905
more ahead for the
last 20 years where

00:45:12.905 --> 00:45:17.200
I come across many parents
is that many have just

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.610
been swept along into jobs
without thinking whether that

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.920
was really what they want.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.330
So one of things I've
tried to do at schools

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:29.580
as well as giving them a really
big grounding in what we've

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:34.770
been talking about in stillness,
and positive psychology,

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:40.590
is to help them to find out
what they really want to do,

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.370
young people what do you
want to do in your life?

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.080
What do you love about life?

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.290
And if you want to
be a carer in life

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:54.640
and your parents want you
to be a bond trader, well,

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.420
sorry if they were
great parents,

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.540
they'd want you to be
what you want to be.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.610
And that's why many parents get
it wrong, because for the best

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:05.870
reason in the world, they
impose their own thoughts.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.590
So focus is about trying to
find out what your focus is

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.190
and getting in touch with that.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:13.760
I think the other example
there would also be you

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.990
can see how they too can
be things that we let go of

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.460
and all this.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.510
I first became really
interested in this

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.870
when I came across somebody
who-- has anyone come

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:26.020
across Martin Seligman here?

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.950
Very simple, Martin Seligman--
one or two of you have.

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:35.105
Martin Seligman spent his life
studying depression in America.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:41.009
Very well known
and very celebrated

00:46:41.009 --> 00:46:43.050
and one of the things he
learned about depression

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:48.830
was that people have a sense
of learned helplessness.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.240
They learn to be helpless.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.190
They learn to think that they
can't have personal affect,

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:58.850
that they can't ever get over
their neuroses or psychoses,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:02.190
that they'll be
depressed forever.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.610
It's a learned action.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.730
But he then realized
that you can actually

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.120
learn optimism also.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.160
And when he was elected
President the American

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.440
Psychological
Association in 1998,

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.640
he made his inaugural
address about why

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.675
is academic psychology,
not just American

00:47:20.675 --> 00:47:22.050
and Britain and
Europe, the world

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.630
over, obsessed by the
abnormal, obsessed

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:33.990
by OCD and depression and
neuroses and addictions

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:35.580
and anxieties and fears.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.180
Where are the studies
looking at the ingredients

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.190
of good organizations?

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:42.600
So Google is a
great organization.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.950
And the way the
spaces are organized

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.220
shows how you could
be very imaginative.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.730
What are the ingredients
of a great relationship?

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.600
So if you have a problem
with your partner, you can go

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.220
and you could talk
to a counselor.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:57.746
And the traditional
way of doing it

00:47:57.746 --> 00:48:00.620
is to say, well,
what's going wrong?

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.170
But this way says,
what's going right?

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.990
You know what is going
right in your relationship?

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:09.350
When are you having a
really good time together?

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:10.546
Are you having enough sex?

00:48:10.546 --> 00:48:12.170
Are you going out to
the cinema enough?

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.500
Are you having enough fun?

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.120
Are you doing the kind
of things you used to do,

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.090
that you used to really enjoy
them as sacred between you?

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:20.570
Are you going out
on enough dates?

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.945
By the way, the
recommendation is

00:48:21.945 --> 00:48:24.910
that you have two dates with
your partner every week.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:29.500
And these are serious things
that we can take responsibility

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.450
for to make our own lives
happier, recognizing our lives,

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:36.030
being happy will make other
people's lives happier

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.730
around us.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:40.040
So positive psychology as
opposed to traditional,

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:40.750
negative.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.140
So much of academic
disciplines are actually

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.400
quite negative in the
way they look at life.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.080
So that was the kind of genesis
to me of a lot of this work.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.430
And Seligman's a key figure
in action to happiness,

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:56.090
or his influence is.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.670
Time for one or two more
questions if there are any.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.586
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:04.947 --> 00:49:06.780
SIR ANTHONY SELDON:
There's a question there

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:13.617
saying, in a practical sense
how do you remind yourself

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.200
about the importance
of being present?

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.580
It simply grows.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:25.860
And having people around
you who are also working

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.722
in that direction helps.

00:49:27.722 --> 00:49:30.180
In the same way that having
people around you who are very,

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.760
very sort of like
that and agitated,

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.900
can make us feel
uncomfortable, you know,

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.830
people in the office,
people in our groups,

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.950
who are very insecure
can make us insecure.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:42.800
Also people you go
at holiday with who

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.380
are very kind of angsty.

00:49:48.254 --> 00:49:49.670
Flipping that round
the other way,

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:54.620
being with people who are
reflective and thoughtful and

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.670
present, looking in the eye,
just give us little reminders,

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.120
helps this to grow.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.540
So it's a good thing
to be in mindful spaces

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.550
around mindful people.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:14.120
Because, even though
is T.S. Eliot says,

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.500
Four Quartets, you
may all know it,

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.570
that the endpoint
of the journey--

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.370
can someone finish
that off for me?

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:28.660
Is to come back to the-- and
the end of all our travel

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:36.440
is to come back to the
place from which we left

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.840
and to know that place
for the first time.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.000
He's just saying that
the end of all our travel

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.370
is to come back to
that same place.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:50.510
But to know it, and that
place is our inner selves.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:51.900
It's our inner depth.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.740
So it's a very long
journey but actually

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:58.620
it's a journey-- it feels,
wow, it's a long time.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.100
It takes a lot of
effort to do it,

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.071
but we're just coming
back to ourselves.

00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:04.570
T.s.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:05.445
Eliot, Four Quartets.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.780
Last question.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.510
I'll take both of them together.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:13.426
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:21.650
SIR ANTHONY SELDON:
Do I think-- why

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.720
has the Western world adopted
mindfulness in the last two

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.970
years and will it stay?

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:26.886
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:36.384 --> 00:51:38.675
SIR ANTHONY SELDON: So let
me take that question first.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:45.900
I think technology is
a neutral positive,

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:53.330
I simply don't--
Wellington, in my school,

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.950
the kids have these with
them, whatever they've got all

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:56.994
the time.

00:51:56.994 --> 00:51:58.285
We don't ban them from lessons.

00:51:58.285 --> 00:52:04.710
They are a fantastic enhancement
to learning to sense of wonder.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.375
I mean it's just
unbelievably exciting.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:16.080
Great teaching is helping people
discover things for themselves.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.330
So some of you
would love history.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:19.360
Some find it boring.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.670
But what great history teachers,
they didn't tell you the story.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.010
They said that the
battle of so on.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:26.440
The French were here.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.762
The Germans were there.

00:52:27.762 --> 00:52:28.720
The British were there.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.140
How would you have fought that.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.490
You can use your gadgets to try
and work all that out and find

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.670
out who was on either side.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:38.086
Where they're placed and how
you'd have fought the battle.

00:52:38.086 --> 00:52:41.020
In terms of active learning, I
mean I just think it wonderful.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.150
But obviously as
you all know, you

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.930
have to be the master
of your technology

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:48.080
rather than let the
technology master you.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:53.560
So it's a neutral positive and
a wonderful positive too So

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.700
that's where I stand
in terms of that.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.490
And just finally,
do I think it will

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:00.670
fade in the next few years?

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:02.030
Well, it might fade.

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.270
But it doesn't mean
that it will go away

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:13.440
because all that we're
being asked to do

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:21.260
is to get back in touch with
the simple and the natural.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:29.640
I mean loving somebody,
caring for somebody,

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.300
having the experiences
your sacred spaces,

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.450
your special moments with
people, your stillest moments

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.310
in your life, your
happiest moments,

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:41.440
are moments of
complete simplicity.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.180
Mindfulness declutters
us, descatters us

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.610
into coming into
the present moment,

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:52.620
so that we know that we're
there because we are there.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.610
So just to finish, my last
words will be again T.S. Eliot.

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:02.240
He talked about all of this.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.710
He talked about the journey
in life properly followed

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:08.780
and this would be the
meditation, mindfulness,

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.010
well-being movement.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:14.450
It's about a condition
of complete simplicity

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:17.450
costing not less
than everything.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.640
Condition of complete
simplicity costing not less

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.420
than everything.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:27.410
And the everything
that it's costing us

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:31.650
is the letting go all the
other stuff so we can just

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.140
come together as human
beings and with ourselves

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.000
in complete harmony
within ourselves

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:37.980
and with other people.

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.860
It's been really
nice to be here.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.276
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.810
[APPLAUSE]
