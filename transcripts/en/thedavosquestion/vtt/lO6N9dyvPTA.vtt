00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
&gt;&gt; My name is Aaron McCormack.
I'm the Chief Executive Officer of BT Conferencing

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.170
with the India
Economic Summit in New Delhi.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.559
I think it's fair to say that India is going
to be a global superpower.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.190
I think that our definition of what constitutes
a superpower is out of

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.150
date.
I believe that soft power and economic power

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.740
and influence are becoming
much more important than hard military definitions

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.800
of what a superpower
is.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.320
I believe that India's levels of innovations
and the sheer size of the

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.950
country, and the fact that scarcity is driving
levels of innovation

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.520
that are not seen in other parts of the world
pretty much predestines

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.640
India to become one of the major superpowers
of the 21st century.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.250
I think it is ready.
