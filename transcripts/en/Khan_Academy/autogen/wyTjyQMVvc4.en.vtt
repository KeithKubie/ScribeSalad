00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.480
 Let's take a function of x and y; f of x 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.470
 is equal to x plus y-squared. 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.400
 If I want to draw that, see if I can 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.100
 can make a good attempt 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.590
 That's my y-axis ... I'm going to draw something in perspective 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.440
 this is my x-axis ... I can see the negative x- and y-axis, 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.180
 I could do it in that direction ... this is my x-axis here 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.150
 And if I would draw this out if y was 0, it will be 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.720
 just one ... let me draw it in yellow .. it just becomes one 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.310
 straight line that looks something like this. 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 And for every fact, we go 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.010
 get a parabola in y 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.230
 Y is going to look something like this 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.335
 I'm just going in the positive quadrant 

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:41.780
 It will look something like this. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.090
 Actually, if you go to negative values ​​of y, 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.905
 you'll see the other half of the parabola, but I'm not going 

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:50.370
 worry too much about it 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.980
 So you are going to get this surface. 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.190
 It looks something like this. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.140
 Maybe I'll try to draw it again 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.930
 But this is our ceiling, which we will be using again. 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.340
 And I'm going to get a path in the xy plane 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.660
 I'm going to start at point 2 is 0. X is 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.430
 equal to 2, y is 0 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.670
 And I'm going to walk, just like we did in the previous video, 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 I'm going to walk over a circle, but this time 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 is the radius of the circle 2. 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.650
 Go counterclockwise at that circle. 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.610
 This is on the xy plane, just for it 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.040
 visualize well. 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.500
 So this here is a point 0, 2. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.055
 And I'm going to come back along the y-axis. 

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:35.640
 This is my path; I'm going to come back along the y axis. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.220
 and then I turn left here and then I go 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.640
 here I turn left again and I come back along the x-axis 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.540
 I drew it in these two shades of green. 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.680
 That is my circumference. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.830
 And what I want to do: I want to calculate the area 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.260
 of this small building in fact, that has a roof of 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.020
 xy equals x plus y-squared. And I want 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.620
 calculate the area of ​​its walls. 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.705
 So you have this wall here, the base of which is the x-axis. 

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:09.250
 Then you have this wall, which lies along the curve. 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.490
 It will look like some funky wall 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.410
 on that crooked side there. 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.550
 I'm going to do my very best to .. it will be 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.510
 bend all the way up that way and then along the y-axis 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.240
 It's going to have a sort of half parabolic wall right here 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.150
 I am going to place the rear wall along the y-axis 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.400
 I do that in orange, or no, I will use magenta 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.530
 That is the rear wall, along the y-axis. 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.660
 Then you have this front wall, along the x-axis. 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.230
 And you have this crazy wavy curtain or wall. I will do that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.020
 maybe in blue ... that runs along this curve here, 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.740
 this part of the circle with radius 2. 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.890
 So hopefully you understand that visualization. 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.670
 It's a little harder; I don't use any graphics 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.680
 program at the moment 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.900
 But I want to find the surface, the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.270
 total surface area of ​​these three walls. 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.390
 And in very simple notation we can say, well, that's the surface 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 of those walls ... of this wall, plus that wall, plus that wall 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.570
 is going to be equal to the line integral along this 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.020
 curve, or along this perimeter ... whatever you want to call it 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.820
 from f from xy ... so that is x plus y-squared .. ds, where ds 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.220
 just a short length along our perimeter. 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.450
 And since this is a closed loop, we call this 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.500
 a closed line interval. 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.560
 And we sometimes see this notation. 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.480
 You will often come across these in physics books 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.870
 And we will cover many more / 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.330
 And we are going to put a circle on the interval sign 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.060
 And that means no more than the outline we are working on 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.750
 is a closed outline; we come back to the point where we started. 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.770
 But how do we solve this now? 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.660
 A good start is, just 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.630
 the circumference itself. 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.830
 And for convenience; we're going to divide it into three pieces. 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.040
 and actually the three separate ones 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.290
 calculate line integrals. 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.770
 Because, you know, this isn't really a continuous outline. 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.050
 So the first part ... 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.980
 Let's do this first part of the curve where we 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.640
 run along the circle with radius 2. 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.770
 And that is pretty easy to put together if we have x. Let me .. 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.850
 do each part of the outline in a different color. So if i 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.920
 this part of the circumference orange color ... if we say that x equals 2 times 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.440
 the cosine of t and y is equal to 2 times the sine of t and if we say that 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.680
 t ... and this is only building on what we are in 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.960
 saw the previous video ... when we say that t ... and that this is of t 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.170
 greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to pi 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.270
 divided by 2 ... is actually going to be the corner, that 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.200
 we walk along the circle. 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.040
 This will actually describe the path. 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.820
 And if you know ... how I built it up a little bit 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.980
 confusing, maybe good to have the parametric video 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.860
 view comparisons. 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.360
 So this is the first part of our path. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.080
 So if we just want to find the surface of that wall there, 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.940
 we know that we have dx, dt and 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.670
 dy, dt have to find 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.970
 So let's do that right away. 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:28.770
 If we say that dx, dt will be equal to minus 2 times sine t, 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.495
 dy, dt is going to be 2 times cosine t, no more than 

00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:35.840
 the derivatives thereof 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.350
 We have seen that often enough 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.290
 So if we want the surface of this orange wall, we can 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.675
 taking the integral ... and if anything of this is confusing; there are 

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:47.400
 two videos for this, in which we derive this formula 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.170
 ... but we can get the integral of t is 0 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:59.260
 divided up to pi by two our function of x plus y-squared and 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.610
 then times the ds. 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.570
 So x plus y-squared gives a height of 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.550
 every block. 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.360
 And then we want the width of each block, 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.690
 what ds is, but we know we can rewrite ds as 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:18.930
 the root ... creating some space there ... from dx van de 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.310
 derived from x with respect to t-squared .. so that is minus 2 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.160
 times sine t squared ... plus the derivative of y with 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.660
 with respect to t-squared, dt. 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.050
 This gives us the orange part, and then we can bow 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.820
 over the other two walls. 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.410
 And how can we simplify this? 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.670
 Well, this is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to pi 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.000
 divided by 2 of x plus y-squared 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.180
 And actually, let me express everything in t. 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.250
 So x is 2 times cosine t 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.910
 Let me write that down. 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:13.310
 So it is 2 times cosine t plus y, which is equal to 2 times sine t and we go 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.830
 squared everything. 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.780
 And then all that times this crazy radical 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.880
 At the moment it looks like a difficult primitive or integral 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.780
 to solve, but we will see that it is not so bad. 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.380
 This will be equal to 4 times sine-square t plus 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.380
 4 cosine square t. 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.020
 We can divide by 4 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.450
 Don't forget the DT. 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.820
 This here ... let me simplify this expression 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.260
 so I don't have to rewrite it all the time 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.820
 This is the same as the root of 4 times 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.650
 sine-squared t plus cosine-squared t. 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.800
 We do know what that is: just 1. 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.516
 So this whole thing just simplifies to the 

00:07:56.516 --> 00:07:58.650
 root of 4, which is just 2. 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.120
 So this whole thing simplifies to 2, which is nice 

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.290
 for solving our primitive 

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.860
 That makes it a lot easier 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.620
 So this whole thing simplifies to ... I'm doing it on this side 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.320
 I don't want to waste too much space; I still have two walls 

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.760
 to work out ... the integral of t equals 0 to pi divided by 2 

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.660
 I want to make this very clear. 

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.700
 I just opted for the easiest parameterization 

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.080
 of x and y that I could do. 

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.630
 But I might as well have chosen a different parameterization 

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.250
 but then I should have adjusted it accordingly. 

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.200
 So as long as you work consistently, 

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.020
 it should all be fine. 

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.290
 There is not only only 1 parameterization for this curve; 

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.130
 it depends on how fast you want to go 

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.140
 along the curve. 

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.450
 Watch the videos about parametric functions as you 

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.900
 want more depth on that. 

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.860
 In any case, this thing simplifies. 

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.400
 We have a 2 here; 2 times cosine t, 

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.720
 that is 4 times cosine t. 

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.500
 And then we have 2 times sinus t-square here. 

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.430
 So that is 4 times sine-square t 

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.230
 And then we have to multiply again with these two 

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.970
 so that gives us 8. 

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.750
 8 times sine-squared t, dt. 

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.040
 And then you know, sine-squared t; that seems to be 

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.840
 hard to find a primitive for, but we 

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.150
 remember that sine-squared of ... everything actually ... we can say 

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.660
 sine-squared u equals half of 

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.290
 1 min cosine 2 h. 

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.700
 So we can use this term again. 

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.380
 I can try it here; sine squared t is equal to 

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.540
 1/2 time 1 min cosine 2t 

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.050
 Let me rewrite it that way, because it will be a lot 

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.390
 make it easier to solve the integral. 

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.530
 So we get the integral from 0 to pi divided by 2 ... and actually 

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.080
 can I divide it, well, I'm not going to divide it ... from 4 cosinus t 

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.550
 plus 8 times this thing. 

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.350
 8 times this thing, this is the same thing as 

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.020
 sine squared t. 

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:02.250
 So 8 times this ... 8 times 1/2 is 4 .. 4 times 1 min cosine 

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.590
 2t ... just use a little trigonometry here ... and 

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.390
 of all that: dt. 

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.430
 Now, here you could easily be the primitive 

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.800
 must be able to find 

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.980
 Let's just primitivize. 

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.500
 The primitive of these is the primitive of cosine t 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.610
 that's just sine t. 

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.150
 The derivative of sine is cosine. 

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.050
 So this becomes 4 sine t ... affecting the scalars 

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.470
 nothing .. and then, well let me transfer these 4. 

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:34.640
 So this is 4 times 1, which is 4; minus 4 times cosine 2t. 

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.630
 So the primitive of 4 is 4t ... plus 4t .. and then 

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.880
 the primitive of -4 cosine 2 t 

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.970
 Let's see, that becomes sinus 2t. 

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:58.900
 The derivative of sine 2t is: 2 times cosine 2t. 

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.660
 We need a minus sign here and we put a 2 

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.420
 there and now it should come true. 

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.740
 What is the derivative of -2 sine t? 

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.240
 Take the derivative of the inner part 2 times 

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.400
 minus 2 is minus 4 

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.740
 And the derivative of sine 2t in terms of 2t 

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.280
 is cosine 2t. 

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.830
 So there you have it; we have calculated our primitive. 

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.260
 Now we evaluate it from 0 to half a pi. 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.420
 And what do we get? 

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.210
 We get 4 sine wave ... let me write this down because I don't want to 

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:34.100
 skip too much ... sine a half pi plus 4 times a half pi 

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:42.040
 that's just 2 pi minus 2 times sine wave 2 times pi divided by 2 sine wave pi 

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:48.620
 and then all that minus all this, viewed at 0 

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.580
 That is actually quite easy, because 

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.670
 sine 0 is 0 

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.490
 4 times 0 is 0 and sine wave 2 times 0, that is also 0. 

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.190
 So everything with the zeros is great. 

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.350
 And what do we have here? 

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:05.770
 Sine half a pi ... from the head, the sine of 90 degrees I think; 

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.320
 the same .. that is 1 

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.980
 And then the sine of pi is zero, that is 180 degrees. 

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.670
 So this whole piece falls away. 

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.440
 So we have about: 4 plus 2 pi. 

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.290
 So that's how we were able to surface it 

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.520
 calculate this first wavy wall here, and frankly 

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.710
 that's the hardest part. 

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.760
 Now let's determine the area of ​​this curve. 

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.220
 And you will see this other one 

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.830
 curves, running along the axes, many and many 

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.760
 be easy, but we need others 

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.480
 find parameterizations for this. 

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.390
 So let's take this curve here 

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.590
 make a parameterization for this 

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.490
 Actually, you know what? 

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.630
 Let me continue this in the next video, because I notice 

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.920
 that I go a bit over time. 

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.110
 I'm going to do the next two walls and then we add them all together.
