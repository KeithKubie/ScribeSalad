No job fair about genetics would be complete

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.340
without discussing the role of an actual genetic researcher.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.630
&gt;&gt; Now because genetics is so fundamental for

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.920
all life. You can study pretty much any

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.790
living organism from humans, mice, fish, insects, yeast,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.980
plants, bacteria. Even viruses if you wanted to.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.980
&gt;&gt; Now this course has been very human centric but really that's

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.340
not the most exciting part of genetics. Even still, the role of the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.980
human geneticist can actually save lives.
