00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.700
NARRATOR: Talk about
counting sheep.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.060
There must be hundreds
of them on this hill.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.810
And this black dog,
standing front and center,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.370
driving the herd.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.420
And the most amazing thing about
this image is the perspective.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.785
Just how do you capture
a moment like this?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.842
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.220
Sometimes to get
the shot you want,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.640
you have to be willing to get
your hands dirty like this guy.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.070
ANDREW FLADEBOE: Hello, my
name is Andrew Fladeboe.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.850
I'm an artist currently
based in Minneapolis.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.290
I'm often lying on the ground
to get the angle I want,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.845
covered in mud, and
I'm pretty sure I

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:40.750
look like a crazy person.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.200
NARRATOR: In this
case, Andrew was

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.620
lying in a field in New
Zealand's South Island,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.370
taking pictures of working dogs.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.870
ANDREW FLADEBOE:
This particular dog

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.090
is a Huntaway, a unique dog
to New Zealand which is not

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.990
defined by physical
characteristics, but by the job

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.040
they perform.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.960
They excel at
moving sheep uphill,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.070
and in close quarters
using their loud bark.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.432
[DOG BARKING]

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.880
We are moving a
few thousand sheep

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.340
from one end of the
property to their homestead.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.950
It was quite foggy, so
we almost didn't go out,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.352
as it was hard for the
shepherds to see the sheep.

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:12.810
NARRATOR: It turns out that
Andrew is somewhat of an expert

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.420
when it comes to capturing
working dogs an action.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.260
In fact, he's traveled
the world documenting

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.740
the unique relationship that
has developed over centuries

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.490
between man and dog, in a series
called "Shepherd's Realm".

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.661
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.190
ANDREW FLADEBOE:
During my first volume

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.564
of the "Shepherd's
Realm" series,

00:01:29.564 --> 00:01:32.370
I took a portrait of a
dog named [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.320
in the highlands of Scotland.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140
To me, the picture
represented the dog

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.171
in such a noble
and individual way.

00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:39.670
It was special, and
I figured that I

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.545
could do something really
interesting and new

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:42.965
if I focused only on dogs.

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:45.090
The more I researched dogs,
the more I fell in love

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.570
with them and their history.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.400
NARRATOR: Andrew's work has
taken him across the globe,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.790
allowing him a rare
insight into how different

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.444
cultures rely on working dogs.

00:01:54.444 --> 00:01:56.860
ANDREW FLADEBOE: Through my
adventures photographing dogs,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.026
I've learned so much about
them and their importance

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:02.830
to humanity across different
cultures and demographics.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.450
One fact that stands out
is how devoted the dogs are

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.156
to their owners and handlers.

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:09.030
They would do anything
that is asked of them,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.980
and work nonstop through any
kind of whether or terrain.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.645
I remember looking
at a sheepdog's face

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.770
as he looked up at his owner
after a rough 10 hour muster.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.500
It was filled with pure
joy and dedication.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.375
NARRATOR: And it may
be a cliche to say it,

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.700
but Andrew's portraits
of working canines

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.145
are a testament to the
phrase, man's best friend.

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:30.520
ANDREW FLADEBOE: To me they
represent God's greatest gift

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.510
to humanity-- a species
sagacious and noble,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.550
willing to do whatever
we ask of them,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.642
and only asking for
some food and a pat

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:40.540
on the head in return.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.540

forget to check out
this one on what

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:07.825
it's like to get this close
to a great white shark.

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:10.200
MAN: The photo itself--
taken from inside the cage--

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.741
shows the shark having managed
to grab the bait before anyone

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:13.720
had a chance to react.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.011
The end result is this powerful
image of it leaping out

00:03:16.011 --> 00:03:17.414
of the water with its prize.

00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:19.580
