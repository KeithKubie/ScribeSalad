00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Many of the differences between JavaScript and Python

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
are similar to the differences between American English and British English.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Sometimes the spelling changes a bit, or the pronunciation changes a bit,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but in general, they are mutually intelligible.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It should look very similar, but with 1 or 2 extra letters.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
JavaScript is big on curly braces.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Python is big on tabbing.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
JavaScript is big on semi-colons.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Python not so much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
JavaScript really loves parentheses.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Python could take them or leave them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Python could have these, could have these, but doesn't have to.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They're somewhat optional.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And in some sense, preferring one over the other is a bit like preferring

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Brutus to Caesar.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I've heard that Brutus is an honorable man, or at least so Mark Antony told me.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They're both entirely reasonable from our perspective.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is this a dagger I see before me?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I guess this one must be Brutus, and this one must be Caesar,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and you know which one is which because of these convenient labels.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Here I've written a new JavaScript function

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
called "ironcrutchli."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This one is not recursive, but it takes a formal argument x

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and then does some reasoning based on x and returns values as a result.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I want to make sure that you're following along with JavaScript,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so I'm going to have you tell me what this function evaluates to

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
based on a few different inputs.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In this fill-in-the-blank quiz, for each one of these inputs,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
imagine we're calling ironcrutchli on 0,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so this 0 is bound to the value of x.

00:01:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What would the output be, similarly for 1, 2, and 9?
