00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:01.892
- [Voiceover] Let's now
take the definite integral

00:00:01.892 --> 00:00:03.225
from two to four

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.109
of six plus x squared

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:10.535
over x to the third power dx.

00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:14.354
At first this might seem pretty daunting.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:16.167
I have this rational expression.

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:19.233
But if we just rewrite this,
it might jump out at you

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.172
how this could be a little bit simpler.

00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:24.781
So this is equal to the
integral from two to four

00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:27.698
of six over x to the third power

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:32.820
plus x squared over x
to the third power dx.

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:35.770
I just separated this numerator out.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.248
I just divided each of those
terms by x to the third power.

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:40.894
And this I could rewrite.

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:44.836
This is equal to the
integral from two to four

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.320
of six x to the negative three power,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.737
that's that first term there.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:53.652
And x squared divided by x to the third,

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:56.394
well that it going to be one over x.

00:00:56.394 --> 00:00:58.477
So plus one over x dx.

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:03.415
Now this is going to be equal to,

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:06.263
let's take the antiderivative
of the different parts

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:09.941
and we're going to evaluate that at four

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:13.549
and we're going to evaluate that at two.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.160
And we're going to find
the difference between

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.435
the antiderivative valued
at four and at two.

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:21.493
Now what is the antiderivative

00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:24.043
of six x to the negative three?

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:26.151
Well, here, once again we can just use,

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.433
we could use the power rule
for taking the antiderivative

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.903
or it's the reverse of
the derivative power rule.

00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:34.127
We know that if we're taking the integral

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.794
of x to the n dx,

00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:39.469
the antiderivative of that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.252
is going to be x to the n
plus one over n plus one.

00:01:44.252 --> 00:01:46.110
And if we were just taking
an indefinite integral

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.917
there would be sum pluc C.

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:49.847
The reason why we don't
put the plus Cs here

00:01:49.847 --> 00:01:54.234
is when you evaluate at
both bounds of integration,

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:56.623
the C would cancel out
regardless of what it is.

00:01:56.623 --> 00:01:57.815
So we don't really think about the C much

00:01:57.815 --> 00:01:59.783
when we're taking definite integrals.

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:02.718
But let's apply that to six x
to the negative third power.

00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:04.708
So it's going to be, we're going to take

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:08.203
x to the negative three plus one.

00:02:08.203 --> 00:02:10.090
So it's x to the negative two.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.227
And so we're gonna divide
by negative two as well.

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:16.376
And, of course, we had that
six out front from the get go.

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:17.538
So that's the antiderivative

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:19.264
of six x to the negative three power.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.946
And what's the
antiderivative of one over x?

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:25.322
You might be tempted to use
the same idea right over here.

00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:26.844
You might be tempted to say, all right,

00:02:26.844 --> 00:02:29.541
well the antiderivative
of x to the negative one,

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.437
which is the same thing as one over x

00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:35.201
would be equal to x to
the negative one plus one

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:37.597
over negative one plus one.

00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:39.687
But what is negative one plus one?

00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:40.843
It is zero.

00:02:40.843 --> 00:02:44.255
So this doesn't fit this
property right over here.

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:47.142
But lucky for us, there
is another property.

00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:48.171
And we went the other way

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:49.716
when we were first taking derivatives

00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:51.499
of natural log functions.

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.482
The antiderivative of one over
x or x to the negative one

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:57.410
is equal to, sometimes
you'll see it written

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.910
as natural log of x plus C.

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.323
And sometimes and I
actually prefer this one,

00:03:05.323 --> 00:03:09.202
because you could actually
evaluate it for negative values,

00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:11.141
is to say the absolute value,

00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.332
the natural log of the
absolute value of x.

00:03:13.332 --> 00:03:15.950
And this is useful,
because this is defined

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.292
for negative values, not
just positive values.

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:22.314
The natural log of x is only defined

00:03:22.314 --> 00:03:24.952
for positive values of x,

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:26.192
but when you take the absolute value,

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:29.369
now it could be negative
or positive values of x.

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.999
And it works, the derivative
of this is indeed one over x.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.165
Now it's not so relevant here,

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:36.577
because our bounds of
integration are both positive.

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:39.150
But if both of our bounds of
integration were negative,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.384
you could still do this
by just reminding yourself

00:03:41.384 --> 00:03:44.652
that this is a natural log
of absolute value of x.

00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:49.151
So this, we could say
is plus the natural log

00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:51.401
of the absolute value of x.

00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:53.672
It's not a bad habit to do it,

00:03:53.672 --> 00:03:54.750
and if everthing's positive, well,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.245
the absolute value of x is equal to x.

00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:59.591
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.176
This is equal to, let's
evaluate everything at four.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.674
And actually before I
even evaluate it at four,

00:04:04.674 --> 00:04:07.446
what's six divided by negative
two, that's negative three.

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:10.280
So if we evaluate it at
four, it's going to be

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.030
negative three over four squared.

00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:18.766
Four to the negative two
is one over four squared

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:22.368
and then plus the natural log of the,

00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:24.395
we could say the absolute value of four,

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.563
but the absolute value
of four is just four.

00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:28.982
So the natural log of four.

00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:30.830
And from that we're going to subtract

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.163
everything evaluated at two.

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:35.665
So let's do that.

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:39.832
So if we evaluate it at two,
it's going to be negative three

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:42.884
over two squared.

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:47.751
So two to the negative two
is one over two squared,

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:51.969
over two squared, plus the natural log of,

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.326
the absolute value of positive two is,

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.650
once again, it's just two.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.150
And so what does this give us?

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:02.668
So, let's try to simplify it a little bit.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:05.796
So this is negative 3/16.

00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:07.635
We'll do that same color.

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:11.771
So this is going to be equal to negative,

00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.796
negative, sorry, not negative 3/16,

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:15.909
it's gotta be very careful,

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.184
oh, sorry, yes, it is negative 3/16.

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:20.380
For some reason my brain started thinking

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.695
four to the third power.

00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:25.862
Negative 3/16 plus natural log of four.

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:30.940
And then this right over here
is negative 3/4, negative 3/4,

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:34.421
do that same color.

00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.757
This right over here is negative 3/4.

00:05:36.757 --> 00:05:38.363
We have this negative sign out front

00:05:38.363 --> 00:05:40.405
that we're going to have to distribute.

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:44.572
So the negative of negative
3/4 is plus 3/4, plus 3/4,

00:05:46.532 --> 00:05:48.817
and then we're going to subtract,

00:05:48.817 --> 00:05:50.536
remember we're distributing
this negative sign,

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:54.199
the natural log, the natural log of two.

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.266
And what does this equal to?

00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:58.493
All right, so this is
going to be equal to,

00:05:58.493 --> 00:06:01.807
and I'm now going to
switch to a neutral color.

00:06:01.807 --> 00:06:03.904
So let's add these two terms

00:06:03.904 --> 00:06:05.651
that don't involve a natural log.

00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:06.834
And let's see, if we
have a common denominator

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:10.032
three over four is the same
thing, that is the same thing

00:06:10.032 --> 00:06:11.570
as we multiply the numerator
and the denominator

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.903
by four, that is 12 over 16.

00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:18.961
And so you have negative 3/16,

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:22.457
negative 3/16 plus 12/16

00:06:22.457 --> 00:06:26.374
will give you 9/16, 9/16.

00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:29.779
And then we're gonna have the ones

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.324
that do involve the natural log.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:35.407
Natural log of four minus
the natural log of two.

00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:40.017
So we could write this plus
the natural log of four

00:06:40.017 --> 00:06:43.169
minus the natural log of two.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.011
And you might remember from
your logarithm properties

00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.372
that this over here,
this is the same thing

00:06:48.372 --> 00:06:52.636
as the natural log of four divided by two,

00:06:52.636 --> 00:06:55.668
this comes straight out of
your logarithm properties.

00:06:55.668 --> 00:06:59.902
And so this is going to
be the natural log of two,

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:02.036
natural log of two.

00:07:02.036 --> 00:07:04.857
So, we deserve a little
bit of a drum roll now.

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:07.151
This is all going to be equal to,

00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:10.901
this is going to be
equal to the natural log,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.627
nine over 16 plus the natural log of two,

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:19.129
plus the natural log of two.

00:07:22.052 --> 00:07:23.385
And we are done.
