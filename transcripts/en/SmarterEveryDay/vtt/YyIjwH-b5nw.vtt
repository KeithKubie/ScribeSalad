00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:03.444
So, hey it's me, Destin.
Welcome to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.119
I do a YouTube show.
- Okay, well, that's so cool.

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:08.357
(Destin) Yeah.
- She's like, "what do I have to..."

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:10.373
- Hello!
[Destin laughs]

00:00:10.398 --> 00:00:14.283
(Destin) We're here with
Johan's roomate and friend.

00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:16.699
- Yeah.
- And we're going to...

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:18.646
I don't condone smoking, ever.

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:21.180
However, Johan's roomate smokes,

00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:24.087
and we're going to light her
cigarette with a high powered laser.

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:26.590
Because we... because we can, really.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:29.283
Goggle up.
- The professional's here, so...

00:00:29.308 --> 00:00:31.015
(Destin) Are you ready?

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.065
Everyone have goggles?
- Yeah.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.778
(Destin) Okay, you come to this side.

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:38.198
Okay. Yep, hold on, are you powering up?

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:39.827
Hold on, let me step over the beam.

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:42.084
- [Speaks Dutch]
(Destin) Okay.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.310
- [Speaks Dutch]
(Johan) [Unintelligible]

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:49.328
(Destin) Yeah.
(Johan) ...High power.

00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:53.775
(Johan) [Speaks Dutch]

00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:55.596
- Oh.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:59.605
(Johan) [Speaks Dutch]

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.097
- Oh, nice!
(Destin) Yeah.

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:06.704
[Conversation in Dutch]
(Destin) Yeah, there you go.

00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.199
- [Speaks Dutch]

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.451
(Destin) There you go.
(Johan) [Speaks Dutch]

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:21.885
(Destin) Smoking is wrong.
[Everybody laughs]

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:27.346
(Destin) Did it work?
- Yeah, nice!

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:31.840
[Destin and girl laugh]
(Johan) [Mutters in Dutch]

00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:33.876
(Destin) Alright.

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.761
There you have it. That's how a physicist
and an engineer light cigarettes

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:41.041
 that they don't smoke, in the Netherlands.
[Girl laughs]

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.972
Thumbs up, Johan.

00:01:43.622 --> 00:01:45.840
[Destin laughs]

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:52.502
Let's see.
(Johan) This is where it gets silly.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.594
If I rotate the block...

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.935
(Destin) Yeah, hold on.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.784
It's hard to adjust the focus ring at
the same time. Hold the goggles please.

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:06.604
There we go.

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:09.883
Holland or the Netherlands?
- You can actually use both.

00:02:09.908 --> 00:02:12.084
- Really?
- Yeah. I usually say the Netherlands.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.873
It's, uh... it's like, more
professional than "we're in Holland!"

00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:17.442
[Destin laughs]

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:20.062
