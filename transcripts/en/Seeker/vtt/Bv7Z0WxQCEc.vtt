00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:07.475
Have you ever wondered why humans are the
only species capable of talking?

00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:15.265
If chimps are so smart, why can’t they speak!?

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.655
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you’re
like me, every so often weird thoughts will

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:22.954
pop into your head, and you won’t be able
to stop thinking about them until you figure

00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:23.954
out the answer.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.425
This morning, it was - why can’t chimps
speak?

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:30.805
Which is great - because it turns out there
was an article published just today, about

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:32.245
that very subject.

00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:36.705
Scientists have discovered the reason behind
humans’ unique ability to produce and understand

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:41.655
speech, and it turns out - it may have arisen
from a gene mutation over half a million years

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:42.655
ago.

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:46.785
That gene is called FoxP2, and it exists in
both humans and chimps.

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:50.645
Its connection to language, was first discovered
in a group of family members who had severe

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:55.205
difficulties with speaking and understanding
speech - and that family was found to be carrying

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.115
a mutated version of the gene.

00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:01.835
Back in 2009, there was a study published
in Nature about FoxP2, showing that the human

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:06.945
and chimp versions of the gene, not only look
different - but function differently too.

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:12.275
Somewhere around the time humans began developing
the capacity for speech, our FoxP2 gene became

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:13.275
mutated.

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:17.245
And that mutation, resulted in different gene
targets being switched on or off in human

00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:18.245
and chimp brains.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:23.925
In that study, scientists genetically engineered
mice to express the human form of FoxP2.

00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:28.175
Mice who were given that mutation, learned
to run a maze much more quickly than normal

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:30.925
mice, meaning their learning capacity was
effectively enhanced.

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:35.764
Specifically, they developed the ability to
turn mindful actions into behavioral routines

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:38.835
- which is a necessary learning process for
developing language.

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:44.175
It hinges on 2 key types of memories: declarative
memory, which is the memory of events and

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:48.014
places, and procedural memory - which is needed
for routine tasks.

00:01:48.014 --> 00:01:51.935
In humans, those two types of memories work
in conjunction with each other.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:56.575
So when somebody shows us a hand, for example,
and says the word “hand” - we’re transforming

00:01:56.575 --> 00:02:00.495
the experience of hearing that word, into
an automatic association.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:04.315
Meaning our brains now associate the word
hand, with objects that look and function

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:05.315
like hands.

00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:07.264
And once we learn that association, it’s
with us forever.

00:02:07.264 --> 00:02:11.555
That’s why, when we’re performing routine
actions, like driving to work, we don’t

00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:14.375
need to consciously think about it as we’re
doing it.

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.665
But that’s not really the case for other
species.

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:22.226
And our unique ability to do that, is an essential
part of how we’ve come to develop and understand

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.226
speech.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:27.265
It’s crazy to think that a single gene mutation
could be responsible for our entire development

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:31.775
of language, but what’s crazier - is that
it doesn’t completely rule out the possibility

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:34.465
that other animals could someday develop speech.

00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:38.325
Of course even if they did develop that mutation
naturally, it would still take thousands if

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:42.795
not millions of years to set in - but it does
make you wonder what would happen, if something

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:43.795
like that occurred.

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:45.935
Imagine someday being able to communicate
with chimps.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:49.855
It’s like a weird, alternate reality version
of Planet of the Apes.

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:50.855
Kinda scary to think about.

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:53.865
But on the bright side, if it does happen
- we’ll all be dead by then!

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:57.505
And on that topic, I wanna remind you guys
that I host another show here on Discovery

00:02:57.505 --> 00:03:00.695
called
Anyhoo, where we recently did an episode about

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.775
4 of the most gruesome unsolved murder cases.

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:16.935
So if you feel like getting grossed out, you
can watch that episode over at youtube.com/revision3.

00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:23.085
And in the meantime, if you guys have any
questions, comments, fears about our impending

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:25.865
chimp overlords - just leave em in the comments
below.

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:26.975
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
