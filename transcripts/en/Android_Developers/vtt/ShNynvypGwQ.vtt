MARK BENNETT: Welcome.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.130
Good morning.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.060
God, it's a good crowd today.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.050
Thank you for queuing.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.440
Thank you for coming.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.590
For those of you I've
not met, I'm Mark.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.320
There are some familiar
faces in the audience.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.347
It's great to see people again,
back here at Playtime London.

00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:19.680
And it's great to see a packed
house with so many of you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.702
here today.

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:22.410
What's into that?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.690
Well, a lot of what you
just saw on the agenda

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.840
is about you guys learning,
learning what we've been up to,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.235
learning about what
we're coming up with.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:31.860
But I just want to
re-echo what Shannon

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.190
said there is like, we'd
like you to be telling us

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.404
what more you'd
like to see and what

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.570
you'd like to see happening.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.100
So you're going to hear
this thing, feedback.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.600
We love feedback in Google.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.215
So we'd love you guys to
take that on board as well

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.090
and give us feedback.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.340
That doesn't include you, Rob.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.010
I don't need your
feedback today.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.117
I get enough of
that all the time.

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:54.450
But it's also, we like to
think you'll have a bit of fun

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.130
with your peers,
with your colleagues,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.740
intermingle, spend some
time and get together,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.719
and with, obviously, your
Google business partners.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.260
And what I've been
asked to do, apart

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.110
from act as a little
bit of a warm-up act

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.780
before the main event starts--
Ellie follows after the break.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.420
That's when you get all the
juicy details of Android,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.070
and of Material Design,
and Studio, Firebase--

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.120
is really to talk a
little bit about what's

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.855
next for Google Play,
and what we're doing,

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:22.230
and the things
that we think will

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.940
happen that will
touch your world

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.970
and change some of the
things you're building

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.770
over the next few years.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.500
So let's start with you
guys, our developers.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.110
It's your magic,
it's your innovation,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.160
it's your creativity that
brings these supercomputers--

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.260
a few fingers pointing-- maybe
we've got a couple of your apps

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.560
up on the screen-- but brings
these computers in our pockets

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.730
to life.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.180
And as Shannon said,
from UK to Estonia,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330
it's great to have
so many people here,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.130
from "Age of Lords"--
Alex is staring me out--

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.660
to "The Economist," to British
Airways, to "Candy Crush"--

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.270
such a diverse collection of
apps and games developers here.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.640
And like he said, the real
future of what play is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.840
is what you guys build and
what you guys demand from us.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.480
So we'd love to hear more about
your imagination, your stories,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.812
and your ideas, and
how your apps are

00:02:14.812 --> 00:02:16.020
impacting millions of people.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.210
And the team thought
it would be kind of fun

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.550
for me to give a
snapshot of my life

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.030
and how apps affect my life.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.940
So I'd start with
my kids, seeing

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.590
as my biggest
challenge in my house

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.010
is getting my 10-year-old boy
and my 8-year-old daughter

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.729
off tablets and smartphones.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.020
They seem to be getting more
and more addicted to them.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.500
So I don't know whether I'm a
great parent or a bad parent.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.630
I'll let you guess-- I
asked both of my kids

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.600
to pick their favorite apps.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.150
Obviously, my son is a
big fan of everything

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.580
that comes out of our
friends at Supercell,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.782
whether it's "Boom Beach,"
"Clash Royale," his latest.

00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:52.490
And he still spends
a huge amount of time

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.760
with "Clash of Clans."

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.310
My daughter's really got
into "Color Switch," which--

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.470
those of you who've
played it-- is right up

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.030
there with one of the--
obviously, it drives me crazy.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.290
But her and her friends
absolutely adore this game.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.390
But I could have
listed "Crossy Road,"

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.500
"Agar.io." "Subway
Surfer" is another big one

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.304
in our household.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:12.720
And the other thing
that they seem

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.050
to spend a huge amount of
time is video consumption.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.970
Those of you who are
into "Minecraft," my son

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.520
doesn't really play "Minecraft"
on the XBox anymore.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.760
I just have the
echoes of Stampy going

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.100
around my house in his
high-pitched squeal of a voice.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.640
But they're on iPlayer.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.790
Now DisneyLife is out
there, and obviously,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.830
Sky Go for a
football-mad family.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.780
And they really do
dominate our life.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.385
And I think, as
many of you know,

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:42.200
kids are probably the biggest
users of a lot of products

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.810
and a lot of games that
are on these devices.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.830
But also, apps and
utilities-- this

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.260
is an example that, actually,
my wife and I have started

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.370
using Houzz an awful lot.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.244
It's a fantastic app.

00:03:51.244 --> 00:03:53.970
We're about to start doing some
renovation work on our house,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.700
and we're a big fan
of this utility app.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.000
It really helps you find
an image of an idea,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.030
share it, and pin
it into a scrapbook.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.730
And it's just a number
of apps that really

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.990
change the way you think.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.114
Some of the great stuff in
here is, now, they start

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:10.350
tagging items in the images.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.510
So you can actually,
obviously, go on and look at,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.594
what is that sofa,
what is that lamp.

00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:17.010
And it leads you through to
the e-commerce site to buy it.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.170
And a feature I've not
actually used on this

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.380
as yet is an augmented reality
feature where you can literally

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.520
pick that sofa up and drop
it in situ to find out

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.950
if it's going to really look
great in your future lounge.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.480
But there's 100
different apps that

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.610
are changing the way
people act and how people

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.530
behave when using their phones.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.450
I personally can't
imagine ever printing

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.990
a boarding pass again or, in a
major city, phoning for a taxi

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.230
when I've got Lyft,
or GetTaxi, or Uber.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.810
And the great thing is that
millions of Android users

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.139
have not discovered
how much these apps can

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:48.930
change their lives.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.970
So there's so much more
growth ahead of us.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.470
This was supposed
to be kind of fun.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.690
I realize, seeing this on
the big screen in rehearsal

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.064
this morning, it's
kind of scary.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.560
This is me taking a
picture, clowning around

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.480
on an app called Masquerade.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.541
I'm sure a lot of you
guys have used this.

00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:07.725
This has been a great
example in my house,

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:10.336
just bringing fun, bringing
the magic back into apps.

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:11.710
If you've not
done-- has everyone

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.534
done the face swapping?

00:05:13.534 --> 00:05:15.750
Yeah, some people haven't.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.250
Do it.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.461
It's really fun.

00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:19.460
And so, at a dinner party,
do the face swapping.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.940
And you just see
the magic in people,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.310
especially if they're not
that familiar with what

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.570
you can do on a phone.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.740
And it's just hilarious.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.230
Obviously, video it,
post it on social media,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.090
and scare the hell
out of everybody.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.490
But these kind of
experiences just

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.160
bring so much fun
into what we do

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.220
and what we put
in people's lives.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.425
Yeah, sorry about the scary
clowning around picture.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.690
And these guys,
these guys probably

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.110
need a mention, because it
seems to be in everyone's lips

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.890
at the moment.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.070
The great thing about what
Niantic and what they've

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.000
done with "Pokemon GO,"
for me, it's obviously

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.082
brought a lot of
people into gaming.

00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:01.040
It's brought a huge amount
of people purchasing

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.600
for the first time
in Play, which

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.015
is obviously fantastic for all
of us to add new paying users.

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:08.390
But the big thing, I think,
is that two potential impacts

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.965
of these game is, it's really
brought augmented reality

00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:11.840
into the mass market.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.270
It's taken it out of hyperbole.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.230
And this is no disrespect to
the hundreds of apps developers

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.050
that have been working
really hard on AR,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.330
but it's now made this
a mass market thing

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.421
around a format of, obviously,
spending time walking around.

00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.670
But the other thing that I
think is really interesting

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.100
about this is it's
hopefully going

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.700
to wake up more triple-A
developers, more of that IP

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.700
that's been previously just
locked in console and PC,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.460
to a lot of your guys' benefit,
but bring these guys more

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.480
into mobile.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.130
And we've seen that with
Nintendo, Square-Enix and EA.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.480
They have been early
adopters of mobile.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.120
But a lot of those big IP
and triple-A developers

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.510
have actually not done as
much in terms of bringing

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.120
their content onto mobile.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.800
Hopefully, we'll see
a lot more of that

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.660
on the back of the
success of "Pokemon GO."

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.710
But that's just my story.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.120
That's just a small
slice of my story.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.160
As you guys know, the
beauty of what you do

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.100
is that there's apps
and games for everyone.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.960
There's over a staggering 1
million apps on the Play Store

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.980
now.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.302
So it's really huge in terms
of the breadth and the depth.

00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:15.010
And the message, just
to finish this bit,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.980
is that it's what you guys do.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.760
That's what drives us.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.097
And we love the passion that you
have, the creativity you have,

00:07:23.097 --> 00:07:24.680
and the imagination
that drives us on.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.870
And very much, what's
next for Google Play

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.470
is what you guys
imagine and create.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.560
So let's cover a little bit of
what we do to help you guys.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.292
Some of you guys know this well.

00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:38.750
If you don't know
this, our mission

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.180
is really to help you
guys succeed and grow

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.380
global businesses.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.770
Every Googler that's here
today with a blue tag

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.359
on is here to help you.

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:49.400
I'm not going to stress
the feedback thing again,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.560
but they want to make
your business bigger.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.370
And you're going to hear a lot
on both the apps and the games

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.446
sections today about how you
can be more successful on Play.

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:00.320
The biggest thing is,
the platform that we've

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.720
created, Play,
and Android is now

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.480
the largest app distribution
platform in the world.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.130
And I'll talk, in
the next few slides,

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.110
around some of the numbers
that make up Android and Play

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.100
and why we're so proud of the
success and scale that we have.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.060
And second one is,
we provide tools

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.320
to improve your
performance, whether it's

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.350
through deeper analytics, A/B
testing, beta release programs.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.577
You're going to hear a
lot more about this today

00:08:25.577 --> 00:08:27.410
from the speakers in
the following sessions,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.870
in the breakout sessions.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.328
And as Eddie's going to talk
about, the new features you're

00:08:31.328 --> 00:08:33.440
going to see in Android
N, in Android Studio,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.409
in Firebase, and in Material
Design, there's a lot of stuff

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:37.940
here for you to pick up today.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.860
So try and soak up
as much as you can.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.750
And yeah, try and
stay off the Wi-Fi.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.159
Try not to get distracted.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.179
And try and learn.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.450
And give us feedback
on what you say.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.800
And finally, as a partner, a
lot of what we do-- and you'll

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.830
see sessions today-- is
about supporting verticals,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.066
supporting groups of
you as our developers.

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:59.690
Whether it's publishing, whether
it's indie games, whether it's

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.398
the media sector,
whether it's families--

00:09:01.398 --> 00:09:04.400
and Shazia's got a session
later on today, again,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.080
on families-- is helping these
categories succeed within Play

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.660
and creating quite unique
experiences to bring

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.750
the best out of the content
you have in those categories.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.030
And that partnership,
again, is critical.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.179
We want that feedback.

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:19.970
Tell us what more things
we could be doing.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.580
Whether it is a reaction to a
first impression of something

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.030
you've seen today or a deep bug
bear that's been ticking away

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.020
in your engineering team for a
long while, please come to us.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.160
Tell us what you think.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.480
And help us be a
better partner for you.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.240
So let's talk
about distribution.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.820
The good news is
Android continues

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.730
to grow at a staggering
rate-- the biggest smartphone

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.820
platform in the world, with
over 1.4 billion monthly users.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.350
And that's growing every
week as more and more people

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.361
get connected and get a
smartphone for the first time.

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.860
As that technology gets cheaper,
as it gets more accessible,

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.734
we're going to see more
and more people come.

00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:01.390
I was reading the
Horowitz blog yesterday.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:06.400
And they said that by 2020, 80%
of the world's adult population

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.090
will have an
internet-connected smartphone.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.960
Now, forecasts are forecasts,
but the basic trend in momentum

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.364
is that the majority of
this planet's population

00:10:17.364 --> 00:10:19.030
are going to have
access to the internet

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.750
and going to have access to very
cheap, affordable computing.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.470
And the great news for us is the
vast proportion of those users

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.730
are going to be on Android.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.540
So that 1.5 million a
day new Android devices

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.230
is only going to
accelerate and only

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.200
going to give you a bigger
audience to build and take

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.471
your products to.

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.220
And also, the ecosystem
is getting bigger.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.261
We're not going to talk
a lot about the expansion

00:10:41.261 --> 00:10:42.490
of the ecosystem today.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.190
But we have a fantastic
team working hard

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.890
to add more OEMs
into that ecosystem

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.390
and to bring more
carriers on board.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.480
And we now have over 500
carriers working with Android

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.990
and working with Play, and 400
OEMs developing for Android.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.720
And as this ecosystem expands,
it's great news for Play.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.580
The result is,
more Android users

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.935
are coming into the Play Store.

00:11:04.935 --> 00:11:05.810
They're finding apps.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.026
They're downloading apps.

00:11:07.026 --> 00:11:08.650
And more and more of
them are spending.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.410
We now have over a
billion monthly users

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.470
who have downloaded a
staggering 65 billion apps just

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.950
in last year alone.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.330
So the engagement is huge.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.620
And our work really
has gone into enabling

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.760
more of these customers to
actually spend money on Play.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.830
We do a lot of work adding
local forms of payment,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.070
finding ways for
consumers, particularly

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.740
in emerging markets, to
make that first purchase,

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.020
to educate them on why they
can actually have a better

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.650
experience if they spend,
but also to give them access

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.110
to local forms of payment.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.450
One of those most
important forms of payments

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.460
is what we call DCB.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.910
That's Direct Carrier Billing.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.100
So that's paying through
your mobile phone bill.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.290
And in emerging markets where
gift card penetration is lower

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.460
and credit cards not really
relevant for a lot of people,

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.120
DCB is incredibly important.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.857
And we now have 100 deals
live in over 41 markets.

00:12:02.857 --> 00:12:04.690
And actually, our
hundredth deal was a point

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.110
of quite good contention within
our business development teams.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.580
The APAC team was saying it was
a carrier called Idea in India.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.870
The EMIR team were claiming
that the hundredth deal

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.290
signed was Vodafone, in EMIR.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.330
Hey, they're great
challenges to have.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.850
Actually, Vodafone went
live first, as a deal.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.036
But I think they're
two great examples.

00:12:23.036 --> 00:12:24.910
Idea is one of the
biggest carriers in India,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.296
over 190 million subscribers,
a significant proportion

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:30.670
on Android, and
obviously growing

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.810
as more and more of those
customers adopt smartphones.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.220
And Voda, we're
all familiar with,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.635
is the biggest carrier in EMIR.

00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:39.010
And that actually
means we've got

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.520
100% coverage in most of our
markets in EMIR now on DCB.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.310
So great to have both
those deals now on board

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.060
and have such a strong payment
platform with our carrier

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.079
partners.

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:53.620
And the good news
is that this is now

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.140
starting to actually see a
meaningful effect, particularly

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.680
in those emerging markets.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.559
Now, we'd expect these growth
rates to be huge, because we're

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:01.600
starting from a low base.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.020
But we're seeing downloads,
absolute downloads,

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.550
four times the level we're
seeing in mature markets.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.844
The consumption is huge,
driven by an expanding platform

00:13:11.844 --> 00:13:13.510
as more and more
people get smartphones.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.860
But it's also demand.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.310
People want to be
entertained on these devices.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.090
It opens up a whole
world that they've not

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.220
been able to experience before.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.890
And as I talked about in
payments, on the back of that,

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.410
our job is to actually enable
more of these people to spend.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.310
And we're seeing a very
fast twice the pace

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.550
of spend growth in
emerging markets

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.210
than we're seeing
in mature markets

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.950
as users make
their first payment

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.470
and then become habitual users
in terms of spending what

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.496
disposable income they
have on your products.

00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:42.287
It's very exciting.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.460
So doing all this, we're
doing some work globally

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.020
to expand the platform.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.590
And we're working hard
to help you guys find

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.790
your audience in Play.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.130
And then, we hear
this a lot-- we've

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.880
don't work around beta
testing and allowing you to do

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.380
staged, managed rollouts.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.430
But we got great
feedback from you,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.970
not just at Playtime, but
through the year, about what we

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.310
can do to make it easier for
you to recruit beta testers.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.315
Often, you guys--
they're friends.

00:14:12.315 --> 00:14:12.940
They're family.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.440
There were people
using that before.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.110
But finding complete newbies
that could act as a great beta

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.330
tester has proved to be hard.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.320
So we launched a collection
called the Early Access program

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.870
just over a month ago, just
after I/O, with 29 apps

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.310
to start off with.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.880
And we've had over a
million installs since I/O.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.200
And what we did, we basically
opened up this collection

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.440
to those users that had a
very high propensity to engage

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.190
with apps and games early on.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.500
So they were just inquisitive.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.750
They liked to try things.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.583
And we felt this was a
really great audience

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:45.930
to open up to developers.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.710
And the great news is that
we're expanding the program

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.310
outside of the
startups and the indies

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.290
we had to all developers.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.080
So if you want to
learn more about this--

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.320
and you want to learn
more about this-- please

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.440
come to the launch smart
session today, or talk

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.817
to your BD manager today.

00:15:02.817 --> 00:15:04.400
And they can give
you more information

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.507
how you can get into this
Early Access program.

00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:11.340
And another thing I
just wanted to highlight

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.040
is how you drive acquisition.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.050
And for those of you who
have a user acquisition

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.980
budget, a marketing
budget, app discovery

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.060
is a critical role in
driving your growth,

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.680
in driving your user base.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.090
But we wanted to leverage
our experience in ads as well

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.470
within the store.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.740
And search ads in Play
launched over a year ago.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.550
And we're seeing
significant success

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.310
with search ads in Play.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.400
And the developers that I
see spending on this channel,

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.695
I consistently get feedback
there's great CPIs.

00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:41.960
This is a really
efficient channel.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.570
And they were using it as part
of their marketing budget,

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.750
to find both high-quality
users and users with intent.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.300
And search is a really critical
part of that discovery process

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.697
within the store.

00:15:52.697 --> 00:15:54.280
You can do search
in a couple of ways.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.045
You can buy a search campaign
that runs across .com

00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:57.110
and search within Play.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.570
You can't buy a campaign
just on Play search.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.050
But you can also purchase within
the universal app campaign,

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:09.440
which drives acquisition across
YouTube, across Google search

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.050
in Google.com, and other
Google properties as well,

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.970
including AdMob-- so,
advertising within other apps.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.050
Universal app
campaigns alone have

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.530
driven 3 billion app installs.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.250
So I implore you guys to
try it, and to explore it,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.140
and to give it a go.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.035
We're investing heavily in
helping you acquire more users.

00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:33.410
And so you'll see some more
announcements over the coming

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.700
months about changes
we're doing in this.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.870
And if you'd like to learn more
about universal app campaigns,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.710
there's a session after lunch.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.760
So please try and
join that as well.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.750
So to summarize the first
bit, this is my asks.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.397
This is it.

00:16:48.397 --> 00:16:49.480
This is as bad as it gets.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.104
You can take a picture
of these slides.

00:16:51.104 --> 00:16:52.300
These are the basics.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.790
These are things that we want
to see all you guys doing.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.130
They're pretty straightforward.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.570
We continue to repeat
the focus on quality.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.080
My ask for you there
is, quality is king.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.520
We create a lot of tools
to try and allow you

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.000
to get your product
better and better.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.990
Please listen to our feedback.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.170
We apply a lot of
resource in our teams

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.550
to try and give you that
consulting, that feedback

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.290
of how you can
improve your products.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.599
So focus on design.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.050
Make it easy to use.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.450
Really invest in quality.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.504
If the product's not
right, work on it

00:17:24.504 --> 00:17:25.670
until you've got that right.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.310
And the iteration
piece follows really

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.050
fast on the heels of this.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.020
We've created many
tools to help to do

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.702
experiments that lead to direct
performance improvements.

00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:39.410
And we've been speaking
to top developers

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.830
about how many that use A/B
testing, or staged rollout,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.630
or store listing experiments.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.790
And 70% of top developers say
they use this functionality,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.720
and it absolutely helps them
get their product better.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.300
60% of top developers
use beta testing.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.810
My question is, why are
the rest not doing this.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.880
If this functionality is
really going to help you

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.120
guys have better product,
there's no coding,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:07.230
it's free, it's easy to use,
why aren't all your teams using

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.810
these tools that we build?

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.050
Please take a chance to learn
more about the tools today.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.130
Again, there's a session,
the launch smart session,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.920
about how you can use our tools
to iterate and get that product

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.886
right before you spend precious
user acquisition budget

00:18:21.886 --> 00:18:23.885
and find that there's a
retention issue that you

00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:26.180
had not spotted before.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.825
Try search ads.

00:18:26.825 --> 00:18:28.825
I've just talked about
it on the previous slide.

00:18:28.825 --> 00:18:31.470
But next time you sit down with
your user acquisition team,

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.844
go through and
ask whether you've

00:18:32.844 --> 00:18:35.250
spent any money on search
within Play or universal app

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.350
campaigns, and see what the
performance numbers look like.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.810
Developer Console-- we'll talk
about that later on today.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.220
It's a great tool, not just
for your engineering teams,

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.450
but also for your marketeers
and the non-engineering folk

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.490
within your teams.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.050
It's a great way for you to find
what's going on with your user

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.200
base, the analytics about
what your conversion

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.430
funnel's looking like.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.450
So again, try and use that.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.540
And also, we have
our Playbook app

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.990
with a host of articles
and information in there.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.795
Please try it.

00:19:06.795 --> 00:19:09.140
And I think I've mentioned
the feedback one at the end

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.230
as well.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.240
OK, that's the asks over.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.190
As the temperature
rises, Latitia

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.280
loves to find a venue
with glass ceilings.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.550
I think Playtime has to be in a
warehouse or garage with glass

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.900
ceilings in London.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.460
So apologies to
those guys over there

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.000
that are really under the cosh.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.926
And it's like I/O, isn't it?

00:19:29.926 --> 00:19:31.780
I/O was outdoors and very hot.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.649
And we like to replicate
that here in Playtime.

00:19:34.649 --> 00:19:36.190
The last section I
want to talk about

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.590
is briefly about the future
and about the future of mobile.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.490
And you've seen
this picture before.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.781
You've probably seen this
like 20 times just on the way

00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:42.610
here today.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.970
Face down, touch and
swipe-- great products,

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.120
but designed for that
form of interaction.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.240
People download apps from
top charts or search.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.010
And we've built an
entire ecosystem,

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.965
a very successful ecosystem
about this type of user

00:19:56.965 --> 00:20:00.457
behavior and about this type of
interaction within our store.

00:20:00.457 --> 00:20:02.290
But we really think
that mobile is evolving.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.623
And we think it's evolving
in a number of different ways

00:20:04.623 --> 00:20:07.660
that will be a new era for
mobile beyond this kind

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.810
of mobile first and
touch and swipe era.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.960
And I wanted to talk about
three areas, beyond the click,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.870
beyond the install, and
also, beyond the phone,

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.150
and just talk about
some of the investments

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.056
Google are making in these areas
that we think will massively

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:23.680
change your perspective
on what you can

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.420
do within your products
in the near future

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.800
and in the mid-term
future as well.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.980
So beyond the click-- the phone,
starting with the touch screen,

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.810
you can tap, swipe--
revolutionary.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.440
Everyone was like, oh god,
this changes the whole way

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.850
I'm using a mobile phone.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.220
It will never be the same.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.590
This is the future.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.710
I can't believe I couldn't
actually touch and interact

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.250
on a device.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.320
It makes things so much better.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.270
But newer elements of input are
now becoming very, very strong

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.370
and will soon be mass market.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.290
Voice is the first one
we wanted to highlight.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.160
A staggering 40% of Android--
Google Android-- app

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.280
searches and now using voice.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.260
And that's driven
by huge advances

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.090
in natural language
processing that

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.910
is helping us understand
the spoken word far

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.580
better than we've ever done
before, to a much higher,

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.020
higher degree.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.630
And Google's actually
training its models

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.360
to ignore background
noise, so it's even easier

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.520
to hear what the individual
is saying to the phone.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.740
And so I still amaze people
when I do an "OK Google"

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.740
with friends and family.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.050
I still see, how--
what-- what's going on?

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.420
I generally think, a bit like
with autonomous cars, in 10,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.327
15 years-- or maybe five years
at the rate of speed autonomous

00:21:37.327 --> 00:21:39.160
driving is going--
people look back and say,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.390
what, you really drive a car.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.910
But didn't millions
of people die?

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.070
Yeah, again, driverless cars
are much better than-- yeah.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.430
And I think, voice, people
will look back and say, well,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.050
why were you typing.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.175
And why weren't you just
speaking to your computers

00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:52.030
all the time?

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.470
And devices like Google Home,
which was announced at I/O--

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.150
and there's a few other home
speakers that you can interact

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.950
with a voice-- are
really going to make

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.500
that level of interaction
in the mainstream.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.960
So I think we'll
look back and see,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.120
typing is a thing of
the past, and voice

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.220
is one of the main inputs
for a lot of the app

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.000
experiences you're building.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.650
Gesture is another huge
area that's coming.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.990
One of my favorite projects,
if you saw it at I/O,

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.830
it's a project called
Project SOLI-- S-O-L-I--

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.570
that was announced from
Google's ATAP team.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.180
That's the Advanced
Technologies And Platforms team.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.434
This is really cool.

00:22:29.434 --> 00:22:31.600
This is just a GIF just
showing the gesture control.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.230
But have a look at the video
from I/O. What it basically

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.460
uses is shortwave
radio frequencies,

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.530
kind of like radar, to actually
have a detailed understanding

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.650
of how your hand is moving.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.230
And then you can start
to actually make changes

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.580
in swiping and interact
with your device.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.030
And it's already
very sophisticated

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.090
even though it's in a very
early stage of the product.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.040
It kind of reminds me
of "Minority Report."

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.540
No?

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.620
No one gets that.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.680
I'm showing my age,
yeah-- or maybe

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.140
Tony Stark from "Iron Man,"
for those younger devs

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.140
here that don't know what
"Minority Report" is--

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.360
but yeah, that proper
interaction and a completely

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.430
new way of interacting with
an app, or even with a game.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.870
And it won't replace.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.010
I think this will
complement voice.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.560
It will complement touch.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.570
But that third dimension
of gesture control

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.850
will bring a new
experience to products.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.889
I think the solid dev kit
for hardware manufacturers

00:23:30.889 --> 00:23:32.180
doesn't go live till next year.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.710
So this one really
is a year or two out.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.859
But you can start to think of
great things and applications

00:23:39.859 --> 00:23:40.900
you could do around this.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.340
Personally, I just want
to get this one in there.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.690
I'd love to see an app
where I could just play

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.150
the piano on top of my phone.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.050
So if someone could
pick that one up-- or,

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.790
does anyone have the
Hungry Hippos game?

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.126
So I could just bash it.

00:23:50.126 --> 00:23:51.000
No?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.890
OK, I'll leave the
creativity up to you guys.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:59.357
But there's a great
world of ideas

00:23:59.357 --> 00:24:01.690
that we could actually bring
out there with this gesture

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.670
control, in the app.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.612
Another one is
conversational UI.

00:24:05.612 --> 00:24:07.070
If you followed
I/O, you would have

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.990
seen the announcement
of Allo, which

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.640
has not been in release yet.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.910
But this is bringing bots
into Google's new messaging

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.250
platform.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:18.627
And Allo combines AI
with search assistance.

00:24:18.627 --> 00:24:20.210
And the interesting
thing for you guys

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.260
is how we bring developers, and
particularly app developers,

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.899
into this experience.

00:24:24.899 --> 00:24:27.190
And this is a huge area for
Google-- again, [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.355
for everyone,
assistant, bringing AI

00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:30.960
into more and more
of our products.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.730
And a big theme for
Play in our team

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.220
was how we can bring you
into these experiences

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.710
and maybe even bring AI into
your businesses as well.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.730
So voice, gesture,
conversational UI, these

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.970
are just three
ways that we think

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.530
that the interface of how people
interact with your products

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.080
is going to change over
the next few years.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.770
And now let's look beyond
the app and beyond the

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.055
install as well.

00:24:58.055 --> 00:25:00.180
A lot of you have built
brilliant, brilliant native

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.380
experiences, brilliant
experiences to mobile.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.210
But one thing I
think we all agree on

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.970
is, it would be great to bring
new users to your products even

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.076
quicker.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:12.450
And still, there
are some hurdles

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.400
for that install
experience, some speed bumps

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.470
and some access issues
that actually just

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.720
don't exist on the
web, particularly

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.040
for people in the first time.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.595
And the product team in
Play were just thinking,

00:25:22.595 --> 00:25:23.970
wouldn't it be
great if you could

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.220
have that same beautiful
experience on the web,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.340
just tap, and then you're there.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.330
And then, a few of the
guys are here today,

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.280
and started imagining
how we could actually

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.540
bring this to life.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.870
And I'm sure many of you
saw this announcement

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.930
at I/O. I'm hoping you have.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.240
I'm assuming you have.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.100
I'm certainly not
going to try and do

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.230
what Ellie Powers and the team
did so well on stage at I/O

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.940
and talk through this product.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.560
But for those of you that aren't
familiar with Instant Apps,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.230
please spend a bit
of time on this.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.089
What it is is
effectively exactly what

00:25:56.089 --> 00:25:56.880
it says on the tin.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.760
You can run an Android
app instantaneously, which

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.840
makes it much easier
for users to discover,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.010
to share, and enjoy
your products.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.650
This example here
was an example using

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:12.780
B&amp;H, which is a massive
camera retailer in the States

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.690
who have a great app.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.240
But the example is very
pertinent, because obviously,

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.479
a lot of people don't really
search for "camera" week

00:26:18.479 --> 00:26:19.020
in, week out.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.870
So a lot of people might
not have the B&amp;H app

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.140
installed on their phone.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.848
But as you can see
here, someone has gone

00:26:24.848 --> 00:26:26.670
through a search experience.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.990
They've clicked on that search.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.490
And what it's done
is it's just gone

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.290
straight into the
page within the app

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.510
that the user's interest in.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.360
This app is not
pre-installed on the device.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.550
And then, actually, within
that instant experience,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.050
they can then add that product,
if they want, to the basket,

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.790
pay with Android
Pay, and check out

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.190
without entering any
additional information.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.220
And a lot of people we speak to
think this kind of experience

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.130
is incredibly cool.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.200
No visit to the Play
Store, no accepting

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.170
permissions, no
waiting for a download,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.730
no having to type in,
again, the same search

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.910
results for that camera
within that app--

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:02.970
you're straight there.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.150
You're able to purchase.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.654
It's a fantastic experience.

00:27:06.654 --> 00:27:08.570
And really, what it
means, it's a much faster,

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.070
it's a much more
seamless experience.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.650
And getting that deep link
right into the right page

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.599
of the app-- what
the team have done

00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:17.640
is they've broken the apps
into separate modules,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.848
so making it a lot lighter
for those modules actually

00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:22.237
to be consumed and
installed on the product.

00:27:22.237 --> 00:27:23.820
And then, that instant
flow of the app

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.635
is optimized for the device.

00:27:26.635 --> 00:27:28.260
And there's a lot of
work going to make

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.070
this backwards compatible, a
long way backwards compatible,

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.790
to reduce that
friction and allow

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.147
Instant Apps on a lot of
previous versions of Android.

00:27:37.147 --> 00:27:38.730
And another element
to this-- and this

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.530
is, again, another
demo that I've done.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.650
We've just lifted out of
I/O-- is really around--

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.390
and it's around a
Buzzfeed video-- is

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.730
about how to make
content that exists

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.320
in your app really accessible.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.550
Again, the web is very easy.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.210
I can share a link.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.293
Someone's on the web page.

00:27:52.293 --> 00:27:52.880
It's great.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.140
But often, that's very
hard to do within the app.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.797
That changes with Instant Apps.

00:27:56.797 --> 00:27:58.380
Because as you can
see here, someone's

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.390
shared a link to a
cooking video on Buzzfeed

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.290
on SMS with a tab that opens
instantly within the Buzzfeed

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.680
app, which, remember, is not
pre-installed on the user's

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.100
device.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.060
And then they can
access that content.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.911
So this opens up a whole new set
of opportunities for you guys

00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:20.160
to really compete with a web
presence-- you don't need

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.430
to have a web presence-- try
new marketing techniques,

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.730
and try new ways to get
people and customers to engage

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.680
with your products.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.490
And then, if people want to
keep the app on their device,

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.030
you can.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.488
You can prompt them
into the store,

00:28:34.488 --> 00:28:36.750
and they can keep it fixed in.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.790
And this is a real
world example.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.608
I don't have Ficus here to
present with a pay meter

00:28:43.608 --> 00:28:47.160
like they had at I/O. But this
is a real world example that

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.600
has bugged me multiple times.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.430
You turn up at a car park.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.888
I think the last
time I did, it was

00:28:50.888 --> 00:28:52.110
a snow dome in Milton Keynes.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.660
Kids desperate to get in there.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.420
And then I've got a choice--
phone a premium rate number

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.500
or download an app.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.410
And clearly, it's a
horrendous experience.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.390
If you could just
literally rock up

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.330
to that sign in the car
park, tap on the meter,

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.110
NFC could instantly launch an
Instant App on your device.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.910
You could instantly pay.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.242
It's really seamless.

00:29:13.242 --> 00:29:13.950
It's really easy.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.675
It's really simple.

00:29:15.675 --> 00:29:16.970
It's just cool.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.520
And and I think this is a
real world problem-- well,

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.750
you know, first world real
world problem-- but a real world

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.030
problem for a few of us anyhow.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.070
I'm sure a lot of you
are excited about it.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.570
A few of our product leads
are here, Michael Solinsky,

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.370
Jonathan Carmel.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.100
Don't know where they are.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.190
They're hiding in
the back over there.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.570
There's a hand up there.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.710
If you guys don't
know-- just aggressively

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.544
pursue them around
the event today.

00:29:40.544 --> 00:29:42.210
They've got a lot of
meetings booked in.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.980
But if you can't
get ahold of them,

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.930
speak to your
Android BD manager.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.810
They will make sure that you
get connected about this.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.079
We are in a very small
early access program.

00:29:51.079 --> 00:29:52.620
The momentum on this
project is huge.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.060
They're moving at a
really great pace.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.714
So please learn more about it.

00:29:57.714 --> 00:29:59.130
It could be a
really huge paradigm

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.000
shift in terms of the
app consumption model

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.470
and crucially really help you
reduce that friction of how

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.830
people consume your app.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:07.650
Right.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.720
And then finally, beyond
the phone-- how am I doing?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.750
I've got five minutes.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.590
That's great, because it's all
about virtual reality next,

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.540
so I can make that one up.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.940
The ecosystem is expanding
from wearables, to car, to TV.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.650
There's still a huge
amount of investment

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.980
going into taking that Android
ecosystem to more devices.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.030
For those of you that
are building experiences

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.207
that are consumed on
different form factors,

00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:33.290
there's a lot more coming.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.980
I talked about that
ecosystem of 400 OEMs working

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.120
on Android, which is getting
bigger and bigger all the time.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.890
We also wanted to
announce-- you might

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.280
have seen this at
I/O, Play Store

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.250
also, on Chromebooks--
Chromebooks have

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.130
been hugely successful,
particularly in North America.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:53.810
IDC just announced that,
in 2016, for Q2 2016,

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.820
Chromebook's the number one
spot in the US, outselling Macs.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.570
And the great news is,
now, the Play Store

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.390
is available on these devices.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.140
So you'll be able to
offer your Android

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.750
apps to millions of
users on Chromebooks

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.600
as well without any
additional work,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.899
without sacrificing
any performance.

00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:11.440
So it's a kind of
nice one, isn't it?

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.555
The world has changed.

00:31:12.555 --> 00:31:13.930
We've already done
web to mobile.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.130
Now we're going mobile straight
back to laptops, the other way

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.050
around.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.170
So we think that's
fantastic, and again,

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.160
opens up exposure for you.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.362
And then finally, I just want to
touch on VR, because everyone's

00:31:26.362 --> 00:31:27.070
talking about it.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.260
And clearly, it's a
big part of our future,

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.580
and our future on mobile.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:39.370
Like AR, it's now getting to be
truly immersive, comfortable,

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.040
and affordable experience.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.090
This is about the future.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.540
Unfortunately, we don't
have anything on AR

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.530
to show you today.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.010
There's no Daydream demo in the
breakout session, I'm afraid.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.950
I have personally done
it quite a few times.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:51.880
It is awesome.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.320
It's not going to make you
feel any better, because you

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.778
haven't played-- unless you've
played around with Daydream.

00:31:55.778 --> 00:32:01.850
But it was announced at
I/O, built on the Android M

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:02.650
platform.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.130
We're currently working
with our first partners

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.802
to prepare this for launch.

00:32:07.802 --> 00:32:09.760
And we do intend to make
this available for you

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.470
guys as soon as possible.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.920
Our goal with VR
and with Daydream

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.790
is to make it as accessible
to as many people as possible.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.370
And in many respects,
it builds on the work

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.110
that we've done
around Cardboard.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:27.710
Cardboard, I think, has brought
VR to over 5 million people.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.450
And we've had over 50 million
installs of Cardboard out.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.310
So that's a great start.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.249
And that's a great foundation to
build on for the Daydream team.

00:32:36.249 --> 00:32:37.915
But what they've done
is they've gone on

00:32:37.915 --> 00:32:40.280
to a whole new level of
bringing the software together

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.960
with the hardware to create
a premium VR experience.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.590
And that means
working very closely

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.720
with a whole host of
Android manufacturers,

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.410
with hardware manufacturers
around upcoming phones,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.620
and sharing designs for
the VR viewer product,

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.420
and also the
controller that makes

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.280
it such an immersive
and exciting experience.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.760
But that's not going to
work without your apps.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.070
This is just a screen grab
of what the Play Store will

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.760
look like in virtual reality.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.310
We're creating this
welcoming space

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.100
where people can
hang out and explore.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.196
The top row is something
called discovery windows,

00:33:15.196 --> 00:33:19.090
where you will be able to
promote your best content.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.892
And users can preview
the experience in VR.

00:33:21.892 --> 00:33:23.350
And next, I'd like
to just show you

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.870
a very quick video
of how developers

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:29.740
will be able to use the
controller, which is actually

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.352
incredible for this as well.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.810
It's that controller
that, personally, I

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.440
think a lot of people are
incredibly excited about.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.070
The potential-- you can turn
it to a tennis racket, a whisk.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.449
You saw the pancake.

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:38.130
I've done the pancake flipping.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.370
I'm really good at it,
actually, as it happens.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.467
But you can just play
around it, move around it

00:34:43.467 --> 00:34:44.550
in lots of different ways.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.790
Rob was laughing at that gag.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.460
We got the same
terrible sense of humor.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.542
But when you start
to see this thing,

00:34:51.542 --> 00:34:53.500
your mind is going to be
opened to a whole load

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.041
of opportunities
you can do around VR

00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:57.730
and around your game
play that will literally

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.310
transform the
experience for users

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.274
of your products and your IP.

00:35:02.274 --> 00:35:03.940
And it's not just
about game developers.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.880
We have a lot of content
owners here today.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.421
One of the best
experiences I've seen

00:35:07.421 --> 00:35:11.790
is I've watched a 3D movie in
a 3D cinema on the VR headset.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.810
Immediately, I'm thinking
that anyone on a plane

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:14.770
is going to have
one of these things

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:15.870
on, because it's so much better.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.911
You literally feel like
you're watching something

00:35:17.911 --> 00:35:19.150
at IMAX Experience.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.502
And it's incredible for such
a-- putting your headset on,

00:35:23.502 --> 00:35:25.710
having that experience, and
turning around and seeing

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.440
people next to you, or having
the cinema on your own,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.230
is really cool.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:33.190
And companies like Wall Street
Journal, HBO, Netflix, NBA

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.210
have all committed to
adding VR to the platform.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.860
So content is really
important when

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.290
you're bring a new
technology to market.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.745
So that's it.

00:35:41.745 --> 00:35:42.655
That's it.

00:35:42.655 --> 00:35:44.350
That's the future Google Play.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:45.250
I'm out of time.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:45.870
I'm cutting.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:46.627
I'm going.

00:35:46.627 --> 00:35:48.460
Do you want to carry
on a little bit longer?

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:48.960
No?

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.320
I'm going to really annoy you.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.980
I talked about feedback.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.180
I talked about having
fun, getting in the ring.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.840
Seeing as it's such
a cool day today

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.340
and the temperature
is not too high,

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.170
we've got some really thick
sumo outfits that you can go

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.830
and put on, just to raise your
temperature a little bit more.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.500
I'd suggest you
challenge your BD manager

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.920
to a sumo fight this
afternoon, maybe

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.870
after a couple of
mojitos or something.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.310
Lily's going to challenge
me to a fight in a second.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:17.070
There's a feedback
form you have.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.170
If you fill in that form,
you can get stamps for it,

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:21.479
doing the activities today.

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.770
You will get a little surprise.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.936
Just to manage expectations,
it's a little surprise.

00:36:24.936 --> 00:36:30.084
It's not a VR headset, or a
car, or anything like that.

00:36:30.084 --> 00:36:31.250
Maybe there's a prize there.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.770
I don't know.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.080
But yeah, please fill in.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.005
Please enjoy the day.

00:36:35.005 --> 00:36:36.630
It's great to have
so many of you here.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.382
It's great to get Playtime back.

00:36:38.382 --> 00:36:40.590
It's great that the team
has done such an amazing job

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:41.465
with the venue again.

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:43.050
So please enjoy it.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.272
I'd love to talk to as many
of you as possible today.

00:36:45.272 --> 00:36:46.730
And thank you very
much for coming.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:47.230
