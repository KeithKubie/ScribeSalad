00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.710
&gt;&gt;Simon Maxwell: My name's Simon Maxell. I
run a think tank on international development

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.140
in London called The Overseas Development
Institute.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.390
I've just heard Bill Clinton say in the ____
Hall how important it is to remember that

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.030
this is a global community in which some of
the people most affected by the crisis are

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.330
amongst the poorest on the planet. And that's
a really important statement because there's

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.289
a tendency to think about the financial crisis
being something that mainly affects developed

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.700
countries and that it's a crisis that will
be solved in developed countries. Neither

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.809
of those statements is true.
We've seen the recession rolling out and affecting

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.920
many poor countries and many poor people on
top of the food crisis and fuel crisis of

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.780
last year. We now see countries very badly
affected by lower remittancies for migrant

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.839
workers, by falling prices and volumes for
the export of goods and services. Tourism

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.280
receipts for example are falling. The reversal
of foreign direct investment, the repatriation

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.979
of portfolio flows to developing countries.
These are hitting countries very hard.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.659
Kenya, for example, has lost something like
30% of its tourist revenue, 40% of its remittances.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.829
And if growth falters in those countries,
it will have a very serious long term affect

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.310
on the poorest people and those costs will
be irreversible because children who are affected

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.750
by malnutrition, for example, in the early
years lose their health, their ability to

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.090
learn, their adult productivity.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.140
So what do we have to do? We have to make
sure that we tell the story about the recession

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.950
which puts developing countries fully at the
table and their voice must be fully heard

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.759
in this exercise. We need to make sure that
the protection measures are available to stop

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.299
this crisis affecting poor people. And we
need to think about poor countries as part

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.510
of the solution, as well as just part of the
problem. And investment in developing countries

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.319
can play a big part in providing the boost
to global growth that is on so many peoples'

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.359
minds here at Davos.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.280
We have a number of important opportunities
coming up in the next few months, starting

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.900
with the G20 meeting in London in April. The
G20 is not a perfect formulation because it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.099
leaves out many developing countries, but
it's a good start. We need to build on that

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.959
and make sure that the measures we take to
deal with the recession don't just affect

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.980
us in the North, but really work for all people
around the world and that we have a principled

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.290
approach tlicy making.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.760
Let's see that evident from leaders at the
G20 meeting in London _____ leadership in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.030
April.
