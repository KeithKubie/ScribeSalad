00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.350
So far, we've learned a little
bit about determining electron

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.210
configurations.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.590
Let's see if we can use that
information to group elements

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.440
on the periodic table and then
guess as to what they might do

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.130
when they react with
other elements.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.890
So let's just figure out the
electron configurations of a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.680
couple of elements just for
a little bit of practice.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.920
So, lithium, right there.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.630
What does it look like?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.970
Lithium's electron
configuration.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.670
You get the first
shell, is 1s2.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.200
Two electrons there.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.840
And then you have 2s1.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.270
And sometimes, just to be quick,
to get the notation, is

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.280
you can imagine lithium's
electron configuration is the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.970
exact same thing as helium's
electron configuration-- this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.070
is helium's electron
configuration-- plus the 2s1.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940
This could have also been
written as-- do that in light

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.690
blue-- could also have been
written as helium, 2s1.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.810
Which essentially means that
lithium's electron

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.330
configuration is exactly what
you would have written for

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.360
helium's electron configuration,
and then you'd

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.390
have written 2s1.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.960
You could do that a
bunch of times.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.720
Let's say if we wanted to
figure out the electron

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.980
configuration of iron.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.180
Instead of going through the
whole thing, you know, it's

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.950
1s2, and then it's
2s2, and 2p6.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.360
Instead of doing that whole
thing, you could just say, OK,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.130
iron has the same electron
configuration.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.180
So you could say iron's electron
configuration is the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.375
same thing as argon's electron
configuration.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:36.140
So I'll just put argon
in brackets.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.750
And then you get 4s2.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.280
And then you have one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.750
So d6.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.630
And we learned that when you're
in the d subshell, or

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.740
when you're in the d-block of
the periodic table, you are

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.350
actually backfilling
the previous shell.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.830
So when we're in the fourth
period, in the d-block, we're

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.850
backfilling the third shell.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.930
So 3d6.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.870
And someone had asked-- and
this is an interesting

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.740
question-- why does
it do that?

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.230
Why does it not just continue?

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.890
Why doesn't it fill the
fourth d shell?

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.790
And the way I think about it--
and this is all intuition, and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.510
things at the atomic level
really start to become, on

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.880
some levels, non-intuitive-- but
the way I think about is

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.090
as the atom grows larger and
larger, there are more spaces

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.510
between the previous orbitals.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.560
For example, this is just
how I visualize it.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.430
If my first shell
looks like this.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.260
Let's say the s looks
like this.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.440
And then, if I just cut it out,
let's say the p's look

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.690
like something like this.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.810
This is maybe the
second shell.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.060
The p's look like this.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.210
And then the next place an
electron might want to be

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.150
might be in the third
shell, right?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.900
So the third shell would
be like this.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.970
And then you fill out
the third p shell.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.290
This is just an intuition.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.830
This isn't exactly what an
electron would look like.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.540
Maybe the third p shell would
look something like that.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.470
Look something like that.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.910
And then look something
like that.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.020
And then you're in
the fourth shell.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.520
So you're doing the
fourth shell.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.650
The s subshell might look
something like that.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.230
And then instead of immediately
starting the next

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.310
p shell, you're in
the d-block now.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.830
So this is-- let me just
write some labels-- 4s.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.920
This is 3s.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.020
This is 3p.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.500
This is 2p.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.930
This is 2s.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.650
And then 1s is inside of 2s.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.980
So you don't have to worry
about that too much.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.390
But my intuition behind why the
d orbital gets backfilled

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.350
is because now, as the atom gets
larger and larger, you

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.830
have these spaces in between
the previous orbital.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:18.790
So now, after filling the 4s
subshell, or the 4s orbital--

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.690
so this is 4s here-- out here,
we go back and we fill in the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.960
3d orbital.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.980
So we're going back and
we're filling these

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.450
spaces right here.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.580
So this is a lower energy
state than this.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.730
It takes more energy to cram an
electron back into the 3d

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.530
shell, back there.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.180
But then once you do that, now
you're ready to then go to the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.120
4p shell, which might look
something like this.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.610
So an electron would rather go
to another shell, which is the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.870
fourth shell, rather than
backfill the 3d shells.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.950
But once it fills out the fourth
shell, it fills in

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.915
those spaces in between.

00:04:59.915 --> 00:05:02.690
And as the electron gets bigger
and bigger, there's

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.260
more and more spaces
in between.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.940
So eventually, when the electron
gets big enough,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.860
there's going to be spaces
between the d shells, and

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.930
that's where the d orbitals
and that's where the f

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.990
orbitals will go.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.610
That's my intuition behind
its working.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.740
And obviously, when we're
dealing at the atomic scale,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.050
as far as I'm concerned, that's
the best that I can do.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.670
But fair enough.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.220
That's not what I want to do
here, but that was a good

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.580
question, as to why do you go
and backfill the third shell

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.290
when we're in the
fourth period?

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.750
Fair enough.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.500
This is an easy way to write
iron's electron configuration.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.710
The reason why I'm doing all of
this is to figure out how

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.890
many electrons you have in
the outermost shell.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.630
In the case of lithium, you
have one electron in your

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.680
outermost shell, right?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.860
This is your outermost
shell right here.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.490
You have one electron.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.740
And you could have done the
same thing right there.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.580
In the case of iron, how
many electrons in

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.000
the outermost shell?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.950
Remember, the outermost shell
is the period you're in.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.570
And this is the outermost
shell.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.260
So even though these are higher
energy electrons-- it

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.550
took more energy to backfill
those into the lower energy

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.630
shell-- it's these that are on
the outside energy shell, the

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.670
fourth shell, that are
going to be the

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.450
ones that are reacting.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.220
And how many are there?

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.590
There are two.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.920
And this is an important
thing.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.410
So there's two here.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.710
There's two on the outside
shell here.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.940
And actually, there's going to
be two for any of these in

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.610
pink right here.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.880
Any of the ones in the d-block,
what happens?

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.730
You fill whatever period
you're in.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.310
Let's say that you're
in period five here.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.670
Right?

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.850
You're going to have 5s1.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.240
5s2.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.050
And then you're going to go back
and you're going to fill

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.490
the 4d shell.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.190
Right?

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.240
But in terms of how many
electrons you have on the

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.200
outside shell, in this case the
fifth shell, you are going

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.660
to have two electrons.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.060
So all of these are going to
have to electrons in their

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.310
outermost shell.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.832
In the case of these, the
outermost electrons are going

00:06:56.832 --> 00:06:58.750
to be 4s2, right?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.210
Because then you go back and
fill the 3d, but the outer

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.000
ones are 4s2.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.640
So this one also has
two electrons in

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.930
its outermost shell.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.540
How many does this group have?

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.940
And I've just used a word that
I don't know if I've defined

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.030
before, but the group are the
columns in the periodic table.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.590
And as you can see, they all
have patterns to them.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.990
Everything in this first group
has one electron in its

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.770
outermost shell.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.090
If you don't believe me,
look at hydrogen.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.510
Hydrogen's electron
configuration is 1s1.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.925
Its outermost shell is 1s.

00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:33.620
It has one electron there.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.960
Right?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.190
And that's true for
all of these.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.985
All of these guys have
two electrons in

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:38.480
their outermost shell.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.930
These guys have those
same two electrons.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.780
We can view it that way, in
their outermost shell, but

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.530
then they go and backfill
the d shell.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.610
But in terms of their outermost

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.460
shell, only two electrons.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.620
Than once you fill the d-block,
or you go backfill,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.670
in the case of the fourth
period, you go and backfill

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.570
the third d sub-orbital.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.660
Then you go back to filling
the fourth shell again.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.860
Now the p block, right?

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:09.540
So this one's going to
have three electrons

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.010
in its outside orbital.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.060
Or you could say three
valence electrons.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:19.710
This is four, five, six,
seven, and eight.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.620
Let me do one more, just in
case you don't believe me.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.270
What's the electron
configuration for Sn.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.920
This is, what, selenium?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.740
I'm not even sure.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.690
But let's say Sn.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.210
What's the electron
configuration?

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.620
It's going to have
the same electron

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.640
configuration as krypton.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.409
Yes, that element is krypton.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.789
There is such an element.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.070
So it will have the
same electron

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.520
configuration as krypton.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.120
So I could have figured
out krypton's electron

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.920
configuration just by going
through the whole periodic

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.020
table, but this is just a
faster way of doing it.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.420
Same thing as krypton,
and then it has 5s2.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.940
Then it goes back and backfills
the d-block.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.470
So then there's 10 there.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.130
So 4d10.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.380
And then it starts filling
up the p-block in

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.390
the fifth shell again.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.640
So 5p2.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.930
So how many valence electrons
does it have?

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.310
Valence electrons,
or electrons in

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.440
the outermost shell?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.800
Well, what's the outermost
shell?

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.250
It's the fifth shell.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:29.440
So these and these.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.750
These electrons have a higher
energy state than that.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.960
It took a little bit more energy
to cram them back into

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.800
that previous shell than
it took to put

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.310
these on the s orbital.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.630
But if you talk about the
electrons that will react, and

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.830
that's why I'm emphasizing
these, these are the electrons

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.130
that are going to react with
other atoms. Or sometimes with

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.840
just other electrons, even.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.460
This one has four outside
electrons.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.920
And you see that right there.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.700
Four outside electrons.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.900
And since the outside electrons,
for the most part,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.130
are the ones that you're going
to care about, there's a-- I

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.750
guess you could say, a notation
where you only draw

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.130
the outermost electrons.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.820
So, let's say, for hydrogen, you
could write it like this.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.150
Where you're only drawing the
outermost, valence electrons.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.070
Valence electrons are just
the outermost electrons.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.540
You could write it like that.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.040
You could write it like that.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.150
But this says, hey, I just
have one outside

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.980
electron for hydrogen.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.380
If I wanted to draw
it for iron?

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.900
Iron, right here?

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.520
How would I do that?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.170
I have two electrons in my
outermost shell, so iron I

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.890
could just do like this.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.130
And electrons, they
tend to be paired.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.050
So if I have, let's say I wanted
to take the example of,

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.810
if this is Sn, this
is selenium.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.270
Let me do carbon.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.840
Carbon, I have four electrons
in my outermost shell.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.470
So carbon I could
write like this.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.750
Or if I didn't want to pair
them, in theory I could write

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.220
them like that as well.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.010
And now they're ready to react
with other things.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.800
Now what does this tell me
about, you know, this one has

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.410
one electron in its
outermost shell.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.390
These blue, these noble gases--
and we'll talk a

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.690
little bit about them in a
second-- have eight electrons

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.380
in the outermost shell.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.560
How does that help me when I'm
actually trying to figure out

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.200
how things react?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.730
Well, it turns out that all
atoms want to have eight

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.200
electrons in their
outermost shell.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.660
And that number is important.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.000
Eight.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.320
They want to have eight
electrons in

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.870
their outermost shell.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.230
This is the most stable
configuration for atoms. Or I

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.050
guess you could say, to some
degree, a better energy state

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:43.980
for the atom.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.260
And why is it the
number eight?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.020
Well, that's something
to think about.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.980
This is another fundamental
number that

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.380
just pops out of nature.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.610
And I've thought a little
bit about it.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.400
It must be something about the
atoms in the outermost shell,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.760
when you have eight, they
resonate well with each other.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.270
And they somehow don't get
in the way of each other.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.780
Or don't want to push away
from each other.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.950
I don't know the
answer to that.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.280
And frankly, if someone could
really answer the question of

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:14.790
why eight, exactly why eight,
they would make a good career

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.140
for themselves in physics
or chemistry.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.580
But through experimentation, it
has been well established

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.260
that atoms want to have
eight electrons in

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.990
their outermost shell.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.010
So the question is, if you're
dealing with something like,

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.030
let's say you're dealing
with potassium.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.410
Right?

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:38.140
Potassium has one electron
in its outermost shell.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:46.240
Let's say you have stuff like
chlorine, that has seven

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.100
electrons in its outermost
shell.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.970
What do you think's going to
happen if you put some

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.850
potassium near some chlorine?

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.360
What's going to happen?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:02.560
Well, what's the easiest
way for the chlorine

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.525
to get eight electrons?

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:05.980
Well it has seven in its
outermost shell.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.610
What's the easiest way?

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.040
Well, it'll want to gain an
electron really, really badly.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.290
And what's the easiest way for
potassium to have eight

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.670
electrons in its outermost
shell?

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.860
Well, if it lost that one
electron, then it will have

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.340
eight electrons in its outermost
shell, right?

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.450
Its outermost shell won't be
the fourth shell anymore.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.700
It'll be the third shell.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.950
But it'll have eight electrons
in the third shell.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.820
Its configuration will then look
like argon if it loses

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.900
that one electron.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.720
So it'll be a more
stable state.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.690
So if you put sodium in the
presence of chlorine, what's

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.650
going to happen?

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.020
This electron wants to jump off
of sodium real bad so that

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.890
sodium can have eight electrons
in its outermost

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.680
shell, or have an electron
configuration like argon.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.410
And that electron is going to
jump to chlorine, and then

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.710
chlorine will have eight
electrons in its outermost

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.070
shell, and also have
an electron

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.970
configuration like argon.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.560
And so, as you can imagine, this
group right here, which

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.030
are called the alkali metals.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.600
And we'll talk probably
in the next video why

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.230
they're called metals.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.810
This group here,
alkali metals.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.630
And they tend to exclude
hydrogen, and

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.110
we'll talk about that.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.140
These really want to give
away electrons.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.620
And because of that, they're
highly, highly reactive,

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.050
especially if you put them
in the presence of these

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.050
elements, these yellow elements
right here, which are

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.510
called the halogens.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.150
These really, really want to
take electrons from other

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.440
things, because they just need
one to get to eight.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.750
They usually want to give away
electrons, because they just

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.640
have to give away one
to get to eight.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.790
And the reason why hydrogen,
actually, isn't included is

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.060
because hydrogen doesn't want
to give away its electron as

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.930
bad as these guys.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.920
This rule that your outermost
shell wants to get to eight,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.440
that's true for everything
except for

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.790
hydrogen and helium.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.310
Hydrogen and helium, just
because they have one shell,

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.330
they're happy with just
two electrons.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.380
And so with hydrogen, sure, it
could lose an electron, but

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.860
could just as easily gain an
electron and be happy, because

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.540
it'll have a full first shell.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.510
But all of these other ones,
these alkali metals, they want

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.430
to give away electrons
really bad.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.100
When people in chemistry talk
about metallic nature, they're

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.900
really talking about how
badly something wants

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.720
to give away electrons.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.260
Anyway, I'm all out
of time now.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.960
In the next video, we'll
continue discussing the groups

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.620
in the periodic tables
and any trends we can

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.800
ascertain from them.
