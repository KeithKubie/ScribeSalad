00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.930
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Hi there.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.700
Welcome to the Library of
Congress's Digital Collections.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.880
My name is Nicholas Brown
and I work in the Office

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.770
of Special Events and Public
Programs here at the library.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.640
It's my great pleasure to
welcome Maestro Leonard Slatkin

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.360
to the Interview Studio
here with us today.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.360
Maestro Slatkin is in
town for a performance

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.820
with the National Symphony
Orchestra and we're going

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.490
to be talking about his most
recent book publication,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.240
"Leading Tones; Reflections
on Music, Musicians,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.840
and the Music Industry."

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.140
Welcome Maestro.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.440
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Very
nice to be with you Nicholas.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.740
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Alright, well it's a treat

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.200
to have you back in
Washington since you've been

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.040
in Detroit mainly for the
last ten years now about.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.340
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yes.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And
could you tell us a bit

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.260
about what brought you back to
Washington for this occasion?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.430
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Well, I
was the music director here

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.430
for twelve years and,
two set of terms,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.110
and after I was getting
near the end of that tenure,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.970
I actually didn't think I would
take on another directorship,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.450
but somehow Detroit
came in to play,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.790
it was a such huge challenge
that I couldn't resist it.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.530
So, between Detroit and then
taking a second orchestra

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.340
in Lyon, France, it limited
my time as a guest conductor.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.000
So, somehow dates
never quite worked out.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.900
I think that last time I was
here was even back in 2010,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.010
but now, my Lyon directorship
has come to a conclusion

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.700
after six years and Detroit
will end this season after ten,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.960
and I don't want to be a
music director anymore.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.820
I've done it for forty
years; conducted for fifty.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.630
The burdens of endless meetings,
board groups, and auditions,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.540
and all the other stuff that
goes into it, at this point,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.280
it's something I think I
want to put to the side

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.440
and focus just on
the music-making.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.040
I want to cutback to
conducting schedule

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.290
to maybe 28-30 weeks a year, do
some more writing of both music

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.900
and books, and take some time
off just to travel to the places

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.780
in the world I would
like to see.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.050
I'm 73 now, so one wants to
enjoy the fruits of the labor.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.310
Anyway, I got asked to come
back to Washington specifically

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.650
to do one piece and that
was Bernstein's "Songfest."

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.590
We are in what is the start
of a 2-year celebration

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.880
of Leonard Bernstein; he would
have been a 100 this coming

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.450
August, I'm not quite sure why
they're all starting this early,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.220
but they are.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.240
And "Songfest" was one of
two pieces that he wrote

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.140
that were premiered by the
National Symphony Orchestra.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.620
We're also playing the other one

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.040
which is a short
overture called "Slava!"

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.160
dedicated to my predecessor
his music director,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.360
Mistislav Rostropovich.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.000
So, when we decided and
found the date that worked,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.020
now I just have to fill
out the program and I want

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.240
to do another work that,
at least I associated

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.450
with Bernstein, but that had
perhaps more popular appeal

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.140
to the audience, and that's Igor
Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring."

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.440
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Excellent.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.070
I think we'll come back to
"Songfest" a little bit later

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.230
in the interview, but "The Rite
of Spring" pops up in your book

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.390
in quite a interesting way
in the story of an experience

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.330
with a Mexican orchestra.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.630
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yes.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.420
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Sorry
to jump [brief laughing].

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.790
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Well,
first you have to understand

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.440
that the book is a kind of
mixed bag book where I'll move

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.270
from one subject to the other
with not much rhyme or reason,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.970
but in my head there was.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.120
I like to think that if
I'm in a conversation

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.820
with someone that's sort of
the way I would be talking.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.890
I can't go into all of
it otherwise we'd be here

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.460
for six hours, but
essentially what happened was,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.510
very early in my career,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.230
I was asked to guest conduct
an orchestra in Mexico City

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.140
who at the time were
paying me an outlandish sum

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.560
of money to come and conduct.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.840
I didn't understand why,
but I decided to do it,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.650
but the condition was that
I do "The Rite of Spring."

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.050
I had no idea about the quality
of the orchestra, but I thought,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.840
"Uh, okay I'll go to it."

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.140
And, I knew on day one there
was going to be a problem.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.170
The rehearsals weren't
in an auditorium.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.160
They were actually in
an abandoned garage.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.720
So, there was this
orchestra there and we start

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.670
and right away there's a
problem, because the piece calls

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.110
for two bass clarinets, but
only one of them is there

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.930
and I looked and I said, "Where
is the second bass clarinet?"

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.770
And I'm told that he was
at the dentist or something

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.570
and he would be back for the
afternoon rehearsal; fine.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.460
The rehearsal was a real slog.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.760
When you get that point,
even at a first rehearsal,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.860
you have to make decisions about
what are you willing to let go

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.300
and what are you going to work
on that's going to make it work?

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.580
In the afternoon of the second
rehearsal, we start again

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.900
and now there's still
just one bass clarinetist,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.580
but it's a different person
than the one who was there

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.790
in the morning, and
I said, "Excuse me.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.980
So, I needed a second
bass clarinet."

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.840
And they said, "Yes, I'm
the second bass clarinet."

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.480
I said, "Yes, but
your colleague,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.780
the first one, where is he?"

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.610
He says, "No you just
said you needed the second

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.910
bass clarinet."

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.320
"No! I didn't mean that.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.530
I meant I needed both
of you together."

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.670
And, I didn't see the
two of them together

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.970
until the last rehearsal.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.270
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Well.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.570
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Well,

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.870
so the whole rehearsal
schedule goes like that.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.720
It just insane, and finally
we get to the concert

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.490
and I really wasn't sure
if we were going to be able

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.830
to play the piece
through without a stop

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.140
or a major problem.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.220
Got through the first
part close enough,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.680
second part I was going along

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.370
and I'm realizing this
is going to be okay.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.310
I'm going to get through this.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.990
And then, in the last section,
the "Sacrificial Dance",

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.130
very complicated
technically both for conductor

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.700
and for the orchestra,

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.530
from offstage we start
hearing a voice [singing].

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:30.640
It's getting closer, and
closer and on the stage,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.600
walks basically a construction
worker with high hats

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.380
or hard hat and overalls,
and he's singing away.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.680
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.980
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And
three violinists put

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.280
down their instrument,
they tackle him,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.100
the drag him offstage,
but I'm determined.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.400
I'm going to finish the piece.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.620
I do not want to have to go
back and go through this again.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.000
So, we finished it and
it ends, I'm not going

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.850
to say indecisively, but
just with a like that,

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.790
and nothing from the
audience, absolutely dead

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.510
and it take the baton
and I just drop it

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.300
onto the podium hoping
it will make a noise

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.160
and people will figure
out that it's over.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.940
They finally started applauding,
but in my dressing room,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.290
these journalists all comeback
"What did you think of that?

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.040
Was that disruptive
or whatever?"

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.660
Being from Los Angeles,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.410
I can have a very
sarcastic sense of humor.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.990
Not that you can't have
it from any place else,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.270
but I had this sort of way
to make something seem real

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.170
when it's not, and I seemingly
looked to them and I said,

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.300
"You know, I had read that
Stravinsky somewhere had thought

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.450
about incorporating
operatic elements

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:53.030
into this ritual sacrifice to
the pagan gods of Russia and now

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.360
that I've heard a voice
associated with this music,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.120
I think I'm going to investigate
this further" and sure enough,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.690
next couple of days, the
reviews are all talking about

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.070
"Rarely heard Stravinsky
music now possible"

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.520
and all this kind of stuff.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.020
There were a lot of
other stories connected

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.320
with that whole trip.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.620
And when you read
the whole thing,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.880
it's like no this
is not possible.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.180
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.480
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: But, I
did have it corroborated,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.920
I was in a kind of a shop, not
a hardware store, but something

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.050
like that, and there
were two people,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.700
this is about three years ago,
they come up and they said

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.000
"You probably don't
remember us."

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.300
I said, "No."

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.660
Said, "We played in that
orchestra in Mexico City"

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.360
and we went through the
whole thing and sure enough,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.540
everything I remembered
is exactly what happened.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.840
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
That's wild.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.520
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: So,
there are moments in our life

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.590
that when they're
occurring seem disruptive,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.400
but and in retrospect,
you go, you know,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.960
this is really funny enough.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.260
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.560
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
To want to tell.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.860
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Neat, very cool.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.160
So, that's one of the things
I enjoyed about your book

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.380
so much was that you let the
reader into you as a person

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.400
and what you're experiencing
throughout your career whether

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.200
it's in the business side,
which has its ups and downs

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.860
or the music-making side
or the family side as well.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.720
Would you mind sharing
with us a bit

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.020
about your family background.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.320
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Sure.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.620
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: In music

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.920
and then also how that's
impacted you personally

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.220
and professionally
and then also you son?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.520
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: True.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.860
Well, four-and-a-half years ago,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.860
I published my first book
never really thinking

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.340
that it would have
much impact at all.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.360
I've always written
ever since high school;

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.510
I used to write short
stories and since 2008,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.800
when the web became interesting,
I would write a monthly column,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.870
I would write articles for
newspapers, for magazines,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.070
and finally people said "You
know you have such stories

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.630
to tell and your family
history is so interesting,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.000
why don't you put
them in a book?"

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.750
So, the first book
which was called

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.570
"Conducting Business" was kind
of an autobiography memoir,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.320
but primarily meant to
inform the lay public.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.620
The music lovers
not the musicians

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.020
about what a conductor
does; how do we study,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.460
how do we decide the
end of the profession,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.230
what it's like to be a
music director working

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.200
in the Opera House,
recording, being on tour,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.780
health, all those things.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.970
And it's sold very well
much to my surprise.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.260
And people started
saying, "Well,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.990
is there going to be a sequel?"

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.670
And I said, "I don't
really know."

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.050
And then I started looking
at all the notes I'd made

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.780
and realizing how much I
left out of the first one,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.030
but I wanted to take the second
book in a different direction.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.840
So, rather than considering
it as a sequel,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.380
it's more like a
growth and continuation

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.100
of what was in the first book.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.750
Essentially, my family
were Russian

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.080
in origin from my grandparents.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.400
My mother's family settled
in the states in 1903 prior

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.940
to the first revolution

00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:01.230
and my father's family
settled in St. Louis in 1912.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.390
On my mother's side,
everybody was musicians,

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.260
every one of them
all mostly cellists.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.580
One of them, one of my mother's,

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.490
my grandfather's brothers
was named Modest Altschuler

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.210
and when he arrived in New York,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.550
he founded something called the
Russian Symphony of New York

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.520
which is all Russian
immigrants, and they would play

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.220
for fourteen years
a series of concerts

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.390
at Carnegie Hall giving American
premiers of a great deal

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.390
of Russian rapporteur, but
also some unusual things along

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.230
the way.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.460
My mother, along
with her father,

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.870
were outstanding cellists.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.860
Eventually, the Aller side,
actually the Altschuler,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.480
that was the real name;
there was this rift

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.370
in the family we have
like two opposite sides,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.700
they wound up moving
to California.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.440
My father' side, this
group having come

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.920
from the Ukraine,
settled in St. Louis.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.870
My grandfather on that
side was a barber.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.330
There were no musicians
other than my dad

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.810
who could be heard practicing
apparently by everybody.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.270
When I arrived in St.
Louis as the assistant,

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.190
you would swear everybody
lived on this little street,

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.950
Washington Boulevard, because
they all talked about being able

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.250
to hear my father play.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.550
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.260
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: I didn't
know his sound was that big.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.200
Eventually, he also would
relocate with his family

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.820
to Los Angeles and there was a
competition held before young

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.150
soloists; the award
would be a performance

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.380
in the Hollywood Bowl
with pianist conductor

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:51.220
who was Jose Iturbi
and my dad won.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.470
My mother was furious.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.270
They had not met.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.290
She felt the whole
competition was rigged.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.590
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Uh-oh.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.890
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And she
went back and she started

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.840
to give my father hell about it,
she said, "You didn't deserve

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.600
to win, that I should
have been the winner."

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.890
Well, somehow they thought they
should continue the argument

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.820
over coffee and a bite to eat

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.210
and two years later
they got married.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.510
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Funny.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.560
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
So, with that in mind,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.600
they moved in three different
directions of the music industry

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.940
in L.A. First, my dad
was concert master

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.870
of the orchestra at
20th Century Fox.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.610
There were eleven
studio orchestras each

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:38.240
with their own actors,
writers, directors, producers,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.500
and musicians and composers.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.750
So, he was at Fox, my
mom was the first cellist

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.220
over at Warner's and
she was the first women

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.450
to hold a titled
position in the studios,

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.140
and this is the late 30s.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.130
In the 40s, they formed one-half

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.580
of what would become a very
famous group mostly known

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.740
on recordings because
they didn't tour a lot;

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.550
they were called the
Hollywood String Quartet.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.630
They couldn't tour a lot because
the studio work kept them very,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.540
very busy.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.810
And the third part of the music
resistance [phonetic] was the

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.720
part of the popular
music industry

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.470
and the recording field,
particularly for Capitol Records

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:21.990
where people like Nat King Cole,
June Christy, Stan Kenton all

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.290
of the people who were
recording for the same one,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.010
but in particular,
it was Frank Sinatra

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.390
who became very close
to the family.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.240
My brother and I,
when we were young,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.700
referred to him as Uncle Frank.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.000
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.130
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: When we
were little, he would take us

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.410
by the hands, lead us upstairs,

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.340
put us in our beds
and sing us to sleep.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Oh, my gosh.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.220
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yeah.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.120
We spent a lot of time with him
in his homes in Palm Springs

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.620
and Las Vegas and he couldn't
have been nicer to the family.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.300
Obviously, if you were a friend

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.370
of Sinatra's you couldn't
have ask for a better friend;

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.810
if you were an enemy, you
couldn't ask for a worst enemy.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.330
So, I grew up in this family

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.920
where there were not
boundaries in music.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.070
We didn't think about classical
music as up here and rock

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.550
and roll was down here.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.260
If it was good, it was good
no matter what the genre,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.240
and I've stayed that
way to this day.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.240
I do a lot of things that
many conductors don't do,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.230
simply because they didn't
have that as children.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:33.410
Having this kind of background
was in some ways a big benefit,

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.830
but a slight curse because
if you were associated

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:42.110
with doing lighter music,
some people say "Well,

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.260
okay he's not that serious."

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.620
And I knew that was a risk,
but I couldn't be without it.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.730
Jazz became a hugely
important part of my life,

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:57.320
first as a piano player and
as a conductor and a listener,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.500
and that hasn't changed either.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.220
So, I've enjoyed this existence
of just experiencing all kinds

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.960
of music and it is due to
the influence of the family

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.400
and all the people we met,
because all of those folks

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.660
that I mentioned and
virtually every luminary,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.520
whether it was Stravinsky, or
Hindament, or William Walton,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.370
or Sinatra, or Korngold,
Tiomkin.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.790
Max Steiner all the big
film composers right

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.900
through to John Williams,
Jerry Goldsmith and so forth

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.900
and so on, all of them
were at our house.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.200
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.500
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And
they all played on the piano

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.230
that I still have and to
us they were just people.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.910
They were normal.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.030
I didn't hold anybody in the
highest esteem in the world,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.010
I held baseball players up
there, but not musicians.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.810
They were just really good
people to get to know.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.770
The other thing that
did have an impact

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:02.720
on me a little bit later
had to do with 1955 and 56

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.560
when the McCarthy
hearings were taking place.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.200
The film studios were
among the prime targets.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:17.110
Generally, people who are
in the arts, the performers,

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.360
the painters, writers tend

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.300
to be a little more
liberal in their thinking.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.200
The people who are donors,
however, surprisingly tend

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.560
to be a little more
conservative.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.370
So you have to find that
balance, but McCarthy went

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.720
after musicians and almost
anybody he could involved

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.620
with Hollywood including Aaron
Copland who, one was accused

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.010
of being a communist,
a homosexual, Jewish,

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.230
which he denied in Congress
but then later it turned

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.200
out he was all three

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.900
and it caused complete
chaos in the film industry.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:01.170
All the studios then abandoned
their separate setups.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.020
They're making one pool
actors and musicians

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.780
and directors for
all the studios.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.950
Actually, he wound up putting
people out of work rather

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.260
than the theory that it
would open up everything.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.960
So, all of a sudden I became
interested, not quite yet,

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:24.490
but later on in the history
of the unions, vis-à-vis how

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.750
and orchestra is dealt
with, because they're part

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.060
of the negotiating process.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.980
But these days with the,
in many cases, very,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.150
very healthy salaries that
orchestras are making,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.960
I think the union's
job is not be involved

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.520
with orchestras except
for pensions,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.500
health benefits,
things like that.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.040
Unions are good I think
for the studio musician,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.820
bursting the club date, things
like that take care of them.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.200
So, a lot of things from
the past have come back

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.050
to me recently and
so I wanted to talk

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.350
about some of them in the book.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.650
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Yeah, great.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.110
And now your son is in music?

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.410
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: He is.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:14.700
Now this is unusual because
I didn't have the best luck

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.820
when it came to being married.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.840
I had two early marriages,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.340
neither of them lasted
more than two years.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.450
Just, but those separations
were all very amicable,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.480
it just didn't work.,
but in the third one

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.780
after I think nine
years, Daniel came along

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.050
and now there was a
different reason to focus,

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.720
but as many musicians will
tell you, it is very difficult

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:48.360
with this life on the road so
much and focusing on career

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.570
and the hours you need
to study and work,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.830
it's not something you
leave at the office.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.920
You bring it home
when you're home.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.910
So, I was away a lot.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:03.030
I fell to temptation
a couple of times.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:10.510
My wife and I became really
antagonistic, our son saw it

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:14.960
and eventually we separated
and I worried about my son,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.110
because I didn't know
what was going to happen.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.870
He had been interested in music,
but only on the peripheral.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.400
He played piano, played viola,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.150
but we were all convinced
he wasn't going to go

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.310
into the performance end at all.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.800
When he went to private school
during his high school years,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:41.780
he started playing guitar; did a
little bit of drumming I think,

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.880
and then out of nowhere
he decided he wanted to be

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.490
in what's called the
"music industry" meaning go

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.540
to the University of
Southern California and study

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.480
to be possibly a
producer, an engineer,

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.620
maybe have a management
of a bunch

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.040
of rock groups stuff like that.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.060
Three-and-a-half years into
that program, out of nowhere,

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.100
came "You know, I think
I want to compose."

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.150
And I went, "What?"

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.050
He says, "Yeah, I don't want to
deal with the nonsense that goes

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.810
with the management
side of the profession."

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:25.420
And very quickly, I mean really
quickly, he acquired the skills

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.360
as a composer and so
now at age twenty-three,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.030
now going to the UCLA Extension
Division, he's writing music

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.430
for films and television,
he's wrapping

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.960
up his first documentary, he
has a couple of short films

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.490
out there, and I'm not saying
this as a proud father,

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.750
this is very distant, he's
really good at what he does

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.100
and I think he will be
able to make a good,

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.730
strong name for himself
after a while.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.090
He's very serious.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.390
He has a fiancé.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.220
They probably won't get
married for a couple of years,

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.960
but they're very supportive
of each other and he

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.840
and I have become
very close now.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.790
In fact, as we are
talking, he's here on this.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yes.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.390
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Trip to Washington.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.690
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yes, yes.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.990
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And he
came to rehearsal yesterday

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.290
and all the members of the
orchestra who knew him,

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.380
you know, when he was yea
high, they just were so happy

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.080
to see him again and it was;

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.130
especially his first piano
teacher was playing keyboard

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.430
in the orchestra.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.730
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Oh, that's so great.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.030
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: They
had a great reunion.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.330
So, it's a different
kind of pride.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.630
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.930
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: You know?

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.230
Of course, I realize I better
not mess up with the concerts,

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.790
because if my son gives me
a bad time, it's all over.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.390
Excellent.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.670
So, your son, you mentioned
that he studied piano.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:35.970
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yeah.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.270
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And was

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.570
that his primary
instrument always

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.870
or did he play [multiple
speakers]?

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.170
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
He played viola.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.470
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Uh-huh, interesting.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.200
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And he
actually was the only violist

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.880
in his middle school or
actually that was still here

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.420
and a rather cute story
evolved from that.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.440
He was playing viola
in the string ensemble,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.870
but he was a pretty
good pianist.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.960
But there was another
kid in his school

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.020
who was top class
pianist, very young,

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.900
just one of those protégés
who could do anything.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.590
And Daniel in his last year
in school here, really wanted

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.420
to play something on the
Spring Concert on the piano,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.560
but he was worried that the
other kid was going to get it,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.390
because superior talent.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.770
And when he told me this, I said
"So, you want me to basically go

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.070
to your music teacher and
say would you please let

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.720
Daniel play?"

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.070
And I said, "That may
not be the nicest thing,

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.960
but let me try something else."

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:38.790
So, one night I sat down and I
started writing an arrangement

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.520
for piano and strings.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.510
I guess it was a Christmas
Concert, that's what it was

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.580
of a couple Christmas songs

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.260
that could be played
by that age group.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.270
And I went the music
teacher and I said,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:01.640
"I know you probably have
Ben" the other child playing,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.270
"but maybe you might
be interested in this

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.660
because it's age appropriate
for your young string players

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.500
and it would feature Daniel
on piano and would conduct."

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.100
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Dun-dun-dun.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.400
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
And, I guess it's a form

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.150
of bribery I suppose,
but that's what we did

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.440
and that started a
small part of my career

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.940
that I never thought
would happen.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.080
I went on to write twelve pieces
that began the collection,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.080
and then I wrote another twelve
and now a third volume has come

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.040
up with single line instruments
and it's all because of

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.730
that little genius Ben.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.590
He probably has no
idea what he started

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.680
and these actually sell very
well among more than schools,

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.830
churches; churches
really enjoy doing them.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Interesting.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.430
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: It
was just another fun.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.730
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Cool.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.030
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: To do.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.330
I like adventures
outside of the conducting.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.630
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Has Ben
stayed in the music industry?

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.930
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
I don't think so.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.600
I think he, I know he graduated

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.230
from whatever incredible
college he went to.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.530
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.830
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: You know,

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.130
but early he was just
one of those kids.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.430
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Interesting.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.730
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Right.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.030
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Neat.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.330
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Probably
be a serial killer now.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.630
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh, gosh.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:13.930
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Probably.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.230
No.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.530
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Hard part.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.830
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Yeah, hard part, yes.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Where did you live in D.C.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.430
or in the area when you were?

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.730
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: We lived
almost entirely in Potomac.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.030
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Okay.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.330
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: In Maryland.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.630
And I used to love
driving down to the center,

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.570
because I could either take the
canal road down and cut over,

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.230
or I could go over to the
junior parkway and I could get

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.810
from my garage at home
to my parking spot

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.160
at the Kennedy Center;
one, no billboards;

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.330
two, not one stoplight.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.630
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.930
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: That
will never happen again.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.230
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: No.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.530
Not at all and now they're
doing constructive over there

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.830
and all that kind of stuff.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.160
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yeah, but I
loved that drive in the morning.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.460
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.930
What have you seen
change in D.C.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.090
since you've started coming here
and since you living here and.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.550
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Oh, absolutely nothing.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.850
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh, yeah.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.150
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Gee, it's all the same.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.350
You know, I was hanging
out the Clintons and.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.650
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.950
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: A
little bit with the Bush's

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.530
and you know here this trip I've
been waiting for my invitation

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.900
to the White House,

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.310
but I suspect that's not
going to be forthcoming.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.380
But, those, in those
administrations,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.410
often the Presidents and
First Ladies would come

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.940
to the concerts.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.620
Members of the Diplomatic
Corp. lots of people

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:30.200
from news divisions
became very good friends.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:42.760
I think that the Kennedy Center
itself, which has so much

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.040
to offer, still remains
a little bit disconnected

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.950
from Washington life,
in the sense,

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:57.140
that when you're a tourist
say you come, yes you want

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.850
to go the Capitol, you want
to go to the White House,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.900
you want to go to
the Smithsonian,

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.170
come here to the Library
of Congress, whatever,

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:07.230
and it's not the first thought
to go to the Kennedy Center.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.930
I still think no one's quite
solved yet how do you make

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:16.320
that structure and what's
inside, an integral part

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.320
of the city, maybe
because of where it is.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.180
I know they're extending
it out now trying

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.950
to build a pedestrian mall.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.660
They tried that quite a while
ago even while I was here,

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.710
and the costs were
too prohibitive.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.750
So, maybe the physical way
it connects will help a bit,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:35.510
and I'm hoping that Deborah
Rutter will really use her

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.030
incredible skills to
help make that happen,

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.380
but it's made it a
little more complicated.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.240
People don't really know
that your government,

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.100
your taxes do not go
to the institutions

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.940
within the Kennedy Center.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.340
They go to the building.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.940
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Maintaining it,

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.880
because it's a national
monument and making sure

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.750
that the upkeep is there,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.840
but the institution
still rely primarily

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.450
on philanthropy and
ticket sales.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.380
So, when you talk about
ticket sales, you're talking

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.900
about potentially high prices
and that shuts out a lot

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.180
of people and the
ability to come,

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.050
even though on bus
tour you're going

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:19.540
to see three million people
looking at the Kennedy bus

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.160
and the Hall of Flags and all
that, but they don't really go

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.820
into what it's supposed
to be about

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.500
and that's making the arts a
living and breathing thing.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.450
So, I member one of the things I
did right away, I went on a tour

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.610
like the first day I got here.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.700
I got a tour but they didn't
know who I was and it shocked me

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.920
that we really never
went into a hall,

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.730
none of the performance spaces.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.940
So, I immediately
opened up the rehearsals,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.160
I said "If we're rehearsing,
you bring that tour group,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.370
they stand at the back
behind the railing,

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.670
and stay for five minutes."

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.300
They said, "Well, don't you
think that will be disruptive?"

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.660
I said, "No.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.480
They'll be so in awe and
surprised and pleased

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.530
to be there they
will be just fine."

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.590
And I suspect they still do it.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.890
I don't know.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.190
My back is always, I mean,

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.520
I never see what's
going on back there.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.410
But I always thought that was
a good start for opening it up.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:14.230
But, they're going to have to
reconsider pricing structure.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.940
I know they're doing a lot
of good work now in Outreach

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.850
at least in the orchestra,
having Mason Bates

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.780
as the Kennedy Center
composer residence is great,

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.620
because Mason is just terrific
at understanding so many levels

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.760
of the artistic experience,
but it really is a question

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.210
of making it come together.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.100
If you look at the other
major venue in the country,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.870
Lincoln Center, and
it's sitting there right

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.720
in the middle of everything.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.910
You can't miss Lincoln Center.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:49.910
And when you look at the
Kennedy Center it just,

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.550
it's not quite connected
to anything physically.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.850
So, they're going to have

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.150
to find other ways
to make that work.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.040
So, that remains what it was.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:05.520
I do see a lot of new
independent stores opening

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.080
up as I've been driving
around a little bit

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.380
and that's very pleasing,

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.320
certainly the restaurant
scene is even better

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.620
than when I was here.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.300
There's just so many
wonderful places to eat.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:23.060
Obviously, one notices the
heightened security sadly,

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:30.820
and as we're talking it's
not really tourist season,

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.610
so the city is not too crowded,
it doesn't feel like it anyway.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.650
So, at the moment, it
feels like the people

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.940
who are actually residents

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.650
of the Capitol are
the heart of the city.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.850
They always have been, but
when all the tourists come,

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.060
that changes the
dynamic of the city,

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.380
it changes who it
is and what it is.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.960
The administrations are
going to come and go,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.260
that's always going to be.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.790
There will be a whole new core
of people every two, four,

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:07.600
six years and you
took that in stride.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.520
It made it difficult
in some places

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.670
to establish some
long-term friendships

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.300
with people I wish I had
gotten to know better,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.380
just because they're here
and then they're gone

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.000
and it's hard to find them.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.550
But, essentially there's
still an excitement

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.010
to the city knowing
that we're in the place

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:34.640
that when everybody turns
on the national news

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.550
and sees what's going
on, here in Washington,

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.180
you turn on the local news

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.060
and the local news here is the
national news everywhere else.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.790
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
That's very interesting.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:52.630
One of the things in our
collection is we have a lot

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.160
of Bernstein's papers of
course, and Aaron Copland's

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.680
and many other major,
major figures

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.370
from the 20th Century
American History and culture.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.600
And in Bernstein's
correspondence, particularly

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.900
with the Kennedy family, you
can see when he first interacts

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.900
with Jackie Kennedy when
J.F.K, was in the senate

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.700
and they had some correspondence
then and then as it goes forward

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.050
and their relationship
into the inauguration,

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:19.800
and we have this Frank Sinatra
telegram that Frank sent

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.720
to Bernstein talking about
he called him a genius

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.020
and saying how he'll
see him at the dinner

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.750
and there was a whole story
with a snow storm and then

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:32.170
into the White House time how
the, how Bernstein was pulled

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.670
in to certain things to
advise on a personal level

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.210
about the arts and arts
policy and then was brought

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.870
in for certain state functions
where the diplomats from Japan,

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.750
for example, and
then the whole period

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.260
from after J.F.K. was
assassinated and the letters

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.170
that Jackie wrote to him on
the night of R.F.K's funeral

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.470
which is just mind-blowing.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.770
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
I could imagine.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.070
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
At four in the morning,

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.370
it's ten page thing
just pouring her heart

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.820
out about Muller it's amazing.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.580
And then how they were
so connected later on

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.880
and with the Kennedy
Center, of course.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.180
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yes.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.480
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: With
Mass and with "Songfest."

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:12.310
What is the appropriate balance
in your mind or a civic figure,

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.910
or culture figure like yourself

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.350
and the civic society
whether it's the politicians,

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:22.020
the you know, the Chamber
of Commerce, etcetera?

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.560
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Bernstein was unique.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:31.540
I mean, never before had
there been a musician

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.690
who infused himself into
virtually all aspects

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.490
of society the way
Bernstein did.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:43.340
But then again, Bernstein
was the very first American

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.500
conductor to have achieved
an international reputation.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:57.080
He was intellectually curious
all the time and loved,

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.060
absolutely adored being
part of the interaction

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:06.300
with every figure, but I'll get
back; I have one quick story

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.710
about the Kennedy Inauguration.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.720
So, Sinatra is invited to sing.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.390
Sinatra said, he's coming but
there's a condition, my mother

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:19.200
and dad had to be the
respective first cellist

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.830
and concert master
of the orchestra.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:23.720
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: So, I have
photos of them with Bernstein.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.020
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Oh, my gosh.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.320
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
At the inauguration

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.150
and do you know what the
gift was that everybody got?

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.450
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: They
got one of those books?

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:30.750
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: No.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.820
They got a cigarette holder.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.120
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Oh, really?

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.420
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yes.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.720
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Oh, my gosh.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.020
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: You know,

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.320
a thing like that a
silver the thing on it.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.620
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Oh, that's pretty cool.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.920
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
That, you know,

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.220
that was very generational.

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.080
Anyway, so we can
say today that a few

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.000
of our musical figures have
tried to interject themselves

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.890
into the political scene anyway,

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:55.170
certainly Daniel
Barenboim's done it.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:59.700
Dudamel has kind of waffled,
but sort of getting drawn

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.670
in a little, and my predecessor,

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:06.220
Rostropovich clearly wanted
the same kind of thing.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.860
But Bernstein was the one
who could pull it off.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.480
And you only have
to go back and read

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.520
that fantastic lengthy essay
in the New Yorker written

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.340
by Tom Wolfe where we got
the term "radical sheep"

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.090
which describes the dinner
party at Bernstein's apartment

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.230
when he invited the
Black Panthers over.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.530
That was Bernstein.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:30.970
Trying to understand and
somehow put diverse groups

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.370
of people together.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:36.450
He truly believed
that he could do this.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.010
I think it was an
interesting time.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.050
I don't think it was
necessarily meaningful,

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:48.430
but for me personally, I
try to let the music more

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.270
or less speak for itself.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.970
What we have to do as a
performing arts institution,

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.680
I'm going to cough and
I might need the water.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.980
One second.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.130
I can pick this up.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.230
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Thank you.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:10.080
[ Background Sounds ]

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.380
If it's down here
you won't see it?

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.670
&gt;&gt; No, yeah that's fine.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.970
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Okay.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.540
What I think we need to do
as performing institutions

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.870
or artistic institutions is
to make what we do available

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.350
to as many people as possible,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.300
mostly through an
education system,

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.600
because since I was a
young person and now,

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.660
arts education especially

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.380
in the public schools
has just deteriorated.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:43.700
When I arrived in Detroit, the
supervisor of schools bragged

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.990
that 30% of Detroit
schools had music education

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.250
and I just looked at him
and I said, "And 70% don't."

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.290
So, I've been working the last
couple of years to find a way

00:36:55.290 --> 00:37:01.720
to fold arts education, not just
music, but painting, sculpture,

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.300
architecture everything,
into the history curriculum.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.620
No piece of great art
exists in this vacuum.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.460
We always have something to
say about the society in which

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.370
that artist lived whether
they're looking ahead

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.700
or looking back or
providing commentary.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.920
So, maybe that helps if history
teachers get a little bit

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.640
of education as well

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.110
into interjecting the
arts as they go across.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.410
Then we'll see.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.460
Maybe there will be an outcry
from some public people

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.500
to have that, but we're
two generations now

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.450
where it's been declining
and declining and declining.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:45.270
But with that being said, we're
seeing an influx in our country

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.780
of something quite
different than what we saw

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.780
when I was young and what
my parent's generation saw.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:58.350
Our artistic heritage in almost
every way came from Europe

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.920
or Russia or one of
the Slavic countries.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.850
Today, the influx is coming

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:09.530
from Asia whether it's
Japan, Korea, China.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.020
These are the people who
understand that becoming part

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.910
of the global marketplace means
that you have to become part

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.170
of the western cultural
scene as well,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.440
and they are producing
outstanding talents

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.510
in every field.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:34.100
So, our job, I think, as artists
are to encourage this diversity,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.700
embrace the new Americans.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:47.000
Obviously, I'm as the
grandson of immigrants,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.430
not so keen on how
we keep people out,

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.500
because maybe you're
going to prevent something

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.420
from happening, but
you're also maybe going

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.830
to lose out on opportunities.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:06.500
So, perhaps the system under
which we let people in needs

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.230
to be looked at very
carefully, but there's a lot

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.610
in this world none of us are
ever going to be able to change.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.710
All we can do is identify
those who we see have promise,

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:20.540
who have talent, the
dreamers, all these people

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:25.520
who will make American
life better as we go along.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.910
The focus now is on the
people who will make it worse.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.860
I tend to want to
think the other way.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.200
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
You've been in Detroit

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:37.370
at such a pivotal time in the
city's existence and it sort

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:41.340
of moving towards a new
potential, where was the city

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.530
when you found it as a music
director and where is it now

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.260
as you're preparing to
complete your tenure?

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.170
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: I hadn't
planned on going anywhere

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.470
after I finished in Washington.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.840
I thought that was it
and then I was asked

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.880
to guest conduct the Detroit
incredible Hall, just really one

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.030
of the great halls of the world,
not so big, about 1800 people.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.490
The orchestra was good.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.980
I really didn't even
know they were looking

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.320
for a music director, but
somehow we hit it off.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.620
Board members came to me,

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.570
we hastefully arranged
a couple more concerts

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:12.870
to see if it would work.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:16.440
But along the way,
people were saying, "Well,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.940
you know there's going to be
a lot of problems in Detroit."

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.550
We already knew that the
economic downturn was happening

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.900
in Detroit two years before
it happened everywhere else,

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:31.230
so 2006 is when the automobile
industry was really on the verge

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.510
of a kind of collapse, 2008
for the rest of the country.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.080
What that meant, that perhaps
the upswing could take place a

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.680
littler earlier if there
was going to be one.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.820
And then, into the
third year of my tenure,

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.170
the orchestra was on strike.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.220
They were on strike
for six months.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.540
And everybody had told me
that was what was going

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.290
to happen before I took the job.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.600
Everybody knew this.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.370
And that's when I took
it on as a challenge.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:59.670
I said, "I've got to be here.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:04.060
I've got to be part of what will
happen when the strike is over."

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.460
So, during the work stoppage,
I was meeting with musicians,

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.280
board members, management,
talking to the other people,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.020
"What do we do the
day the strike ends?"

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.380
And we started putting
in initiatives.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.000
We webcast for free
all over the world,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.930
every subscription concert
now are educational concerts,

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.830
as well as, others.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:30.350
We offer incredible pricing
structures for young people;

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:34.180
for 25 dollars students can
buy what we call a soundcard.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.880
We're not one of those
cities where people walk

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.980
up at the last minute
and buy a ticket.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.160
We're; the suburbs
are too far away.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.500
So, we know two weeks in advance
roughly what our ticket sales

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.480
will be like.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.770
And we're not talking about
just orchestra concerts,

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.290
anything that's done
in Orchestra Hall,

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.810
you pay the 25 dollars,
you're in,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.520
but it's 25 dollars
for the whole year.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.070
It means after one, certainly

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.160
after two events everything
after that is free.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.920
You get the pricing
structure right, you're going

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.800
to attract the young people.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.220
The third thing we did
was to go out and play

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.930
in those suburban communities
increasing subscribership

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.600
by about 3500.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.900
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.200
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And
adding almost six more weeks

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.760
of classical concerts
for the orchestra,

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.610
more and more orchestras now
are relying on pops concerts

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.570
and playing musical films and
those are all fine, again,

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.210
if it's good it's good.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:29.330
But I know the musicians
appreciate getting their teeth

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:34.840
more into the rapporteur or
they're older or contemporary.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.950
So, those things
that we did helped

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.740
to spur other organizations, not
just arts ones, but businesses

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.690
to say "Hey, the orchestra
has just really gotten ahead

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:50.120
of the curve here", and all of
a sudden, new people were moving

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.010
into Detroit, the largest
community of artists for example

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.760
in Detroit is coming from where?

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.160
Brooklyn. It's too
expensive in Brooklyn.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.460
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yep.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.760
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: So, they
come, they buy these properties

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.840
that are inexpensive, redo them,
and are creating sensational,

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.030
really interesting
new works of art.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.120
I don't recognize
much of the city

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.590
that I came to nine years ago.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.890
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: No.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.190
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Which at the time,

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:17.770
looked like Berlin in 1945.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:21.880
Yes, there are still large
pockets that remain burned down

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.270
or empty and whatever,

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:28.750
but gradually you see
the transformation that's

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.100
taking place.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:34.060
There's still a long way to
go for both the orchestra

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.510
and for Detroit itself,
but one good number is

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.830
that when I started
out of the orchestra

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.920
at that time I think
was 92 players.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.560
Only one lived in what we
would call the "downtown" area.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.230
Everybody else lived
in the suburbs.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.510
Over the last year, I hired
seven new players and out

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.500
of the seven, six of
them live downtown now.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.800
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.100
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And
that's a big change.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.490
The shops were moving.

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.760
The restaurant scene
has become terrific.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.790
The art museum, another thing

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.250
that was potentially
going to disappear.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.940
The city itself voted,
because it's a city museum,

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.100
if you pay taxes, the
museum stays in business

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.750
and the residents in
Detroit City voted

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.060
that they would not allow
the museum to fall victim.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.870
Amazing. So, it's
been a great story.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:29.620
I had to change my set of goals.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.710
I had a slightly different
artistic agenda when I started,

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:38.060
but now my job was just to help
get the orchestra, not just back

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.640
on its footing, but really
in a more prominent position

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.870
than it had been and
through all the initiatives

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.700
with all the people that
helped, I think we've come

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.250
to a very good place and when

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.140
that happens then you
say, "It's time to stop."

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.270
Let somebody else take
over and build from that.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.760
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Are
there any specific repertoire

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.670
programmatic decisions
that you've made in Detroit

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:03.010
to maybe tap into
the young audience

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.770
or to grow that subscriber base?

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:11.050
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Well,
you don't really want to be

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.700
in Detroit in February.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.340
If somebody said, "Where
are you going in February?"

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.120
"I'm taking a vacation
to Detroit."

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.050
"No, you're not going
to do that."

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.350
I'm from L.A.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.650
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:23.950
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: I
mean, I don't know what all

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.630
that stuff is that's
falling from the sky

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.840
and it's causing my car
to stall and slip out,

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.560
but a lot of our patrons, the
ones who are the big givers

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.190
and all that, they leave for
the slopes or for the sun.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.750
So, one of the first things
I did was start a series

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.390
of festivals in the
February period,

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:41.690
they're three weeks long.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.160
The first year it was all
the Beethoven symphonies

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.460
and three weeks.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.600
Then the next one is all
the Tchaikovsky symphonies

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.930
and all the concertos
in three weeks.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:51.870
Then it was all the orchestra
works of Brahms' and then

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.270
after that it was just
a whole pile of Mozart

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.570
and this year it's
a French Festival.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.140
These go on for three weeks,

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.090
two different programs each
week, each played twice.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:04.520
Very low-cost, but also tied
into the subscription scheme.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.290
So, subscribers who are there
can go, but if you want to come

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.830
to one of these festivals, you
can get a really great discount

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.480
on being able to come in.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.080
And I guess the best
statistic I could cite is

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.330
that when I started nine
years ago, ticket sales were

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.580
at about 61-62% at
house on an average,

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.840
and now they're going
closer to 93%.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.140
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.140
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And it's
due to all these factors.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.710
It was complicated
but also simple.

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:37.250
A lot of it was just saying,
"What does this community need

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.910
to make it interesting?

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:42.280
What would it take to get
people to really want to come

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.580
to the Detroit Symphony?"

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.770
For young people, it's
not the repertoire

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.790
and it's really not the artist
unless it's a big pop star

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.490
or something like that,
it's the pricing structure.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.690
Can I actually get into
the symphony for less money

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.340
than it's going to cost them
to go the movies and spend all

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.020
that money at the concessions?

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.530
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: One of the
interesting discussions you get

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:08.660
into in the book, is applauding
between movements and you seem

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:12.480
to have a an attitude
about it that I like

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.750
and that I'm in-line with, but
every time I have that kind

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.570
of conversation with
certain colleagues

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:19.490
or certain musician
friends, you know,

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.620
there's a whole negative
chastising thing

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.920
that goes on and.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.220
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yes.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.520
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Would you
mine sort of summarizing that?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.820
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
It's pretty simple.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.610
Really it wasn't until the
20th Century when this concept

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.510
of not applauding
between movements started.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:36.150
We don't quite know
how or why it did.

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.840
It might have even been more
an intellectual movement rather

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.760
than an emotional one.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.510
Beethoven's 7th Symphony at
the premier slowly was played,

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.100
the audience applauds widely,

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.010
and they repeat the slow
movement before going

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.440
on with the rest
of the symphony.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.320
And this was the
case all the time.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:58.440
And a little bit like if you
went to a pop singer's concert

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.450
and they do a song, and they're
going to segue into another one,

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.340
but people will applaud and
you have to either wait to go

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.470
to the next song
or whatever it is.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.130
With symphonic music,
it's pretty clear

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:16.410
when a composer might actually
have encouraged the applause

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:19.400
especially in the concerto;
first one usually ends

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.310
in a flourish and
whether it's Tchaikovsky

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:25.490
or Paganini whatever
it happens to be.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:29.690
I find that the applause
is a release

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.410
of tension for the audience.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.410
They've been sitting
like this for 20 minutes,

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.480
and now yeah, [clapping] okay.

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:44.960
It's probably inappropriate
say at a string quartet

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.730
which is an intimate surrounding
or even at a recital maybe,

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.180
but for an orchestra concert
there's just some pieces

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.090
that beg a response.

00:48:56.250 --> 00:49:02.120
Where I think the naysayers
argument falls flat,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:08.410
has to do with the same practice
being acceptable in an opera.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.890
So, in Tosca the soprano
finished Vissi d'arte

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:19.420
and the audience
cheers and screams,

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.600
goes on for a
minute-minute-and-a-half,

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.550
but not only is the
musical flow interrupted,

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.210
the story stops dead.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.920
So, why is that okay?

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.440
But at a symphony where
usually the composer,

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.490
unless they have said they want
you to go from this movement

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:39.130
to the next what we call
a attacca, right away.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:40.630
Why can't they applaud?

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:46.630
Why not? Certainly, I can
name no musician that I know

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:47.930
who doesn't want applause.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.230
We all want it.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:50.530
It's a question of when.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:51.830
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.130
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: I think
it has to be done though

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:54.430
out of the emotion
that's generated.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:57.630
So, it doesn't bother me at all.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.430
I don't encourage it.

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.680
I know it's; I don't finish
something, give it cutoff and go

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.090
to the audience, you know, okay.

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:08.040
I won't do that, but if somehow
there's a feeling of wanting

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.140
to express themselves, that
should be, and on the other side

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.870
of that coin, one
thing that's missing,

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.320
at least in concert
audiences, you still see it

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.960
in Italian opera houses, there
used to be all these complaints

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.380
about new music, less so now,

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.970
because the new music is
a little more palatable

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:31.520
to audiences, composers are
more diverse, but if you don't

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.360
like it, why aren't
you booing us?

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.960
Why aren't you letting us
know how you feel about it?

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:44.000
Audiences feel uncomfortable
expressing displeasure,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.300
but they shouldn't.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.360
How are we going to
know unless you tell us?

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.770
I do get letters every so often.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.070
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:51.370
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: But,

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:53.400
it's not the same thing
as a good lusty boo.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:51:00.740
But once in a while, you will
get a response that's unexpected

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.950
from the audience and usually in
music; I remember being on tour

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:07.300
with the National Symphony.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.720
We were in Florida.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.490
We were playing Charles
Ives' "Three Places

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.830
in New England" the second one
ends in this cacophony of sound,

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:21.320
it just ridiculously distant
and it's just kind of ends.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:26.810
And we heard from the back
of the hall, "Oh my god."

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:32.030
And then, a few weeks
ago in Detroit

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:41.030
when we opened our season,
we were doing Beethoven 3

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:46.830
of all things, and after
the first movement,

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:50.260
we didn't finish, you don't
usually expect applause there,

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:54.300
and they didn't,
but we heard "Wow."

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:59.530
But better than that, was at
the very end just as we finish

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.750
that last chord and right
before the audience started,

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.050
somebody goes.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.350
"Hell yeah!"

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:05.650
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Oh, that's awesome.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:07.100
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And, you
know, we all we loved it.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.400
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
That's great.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.700
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
We thought, you know,

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.000
okay you know they're really
showing us how they felt

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.300
about it.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.750
So, I really don't have a
problem with this at all.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.050
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Yeah, cool.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:20.580
Someone who was new to
our concert audience here,

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:22.030
this was like three
or four year ago,

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:23.680
it was probably a string
quartet concert or something

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.430
or a new music concert, and
this person was a young person,

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.390
twenty-something,
very well dressed,

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:34.700
clearly very intelligent, and
they were just loving everything

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.970
and they were clapping
like it was a pop concert

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:39.650
and not everyone appreciated
it, but I was like "Come on,

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.510
this is their opportunity
to experience the art

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:43.810
in the way that they believe."

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.690
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: But, why not
breakdown one of the barriers?

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:49.740
And one of the barriers
is the communication.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.010
It's not just we are
playing for the audience

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:56.650
and there's this thing up
there, the invisible wall.

00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:00.550
No. We want to know
how the audience feels.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:01.850
We react to that.

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:03.420
We play. You can
sense from the stage.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.720
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.020
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Even
with my back to them,

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.760
I know if the audience
is with us.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.820
You feel it.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Do you read frequently?

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.940
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yes.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.310
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: What kind
of books are you reading now

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:16.610
or do you prefer to read?

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:17.910
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
I'm wrapping up;

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:19.210
I used to have a
couple books either

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:25.280
on the electronic reader or,
because that's for traveling,

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.590
otherwise they kind of
charge a little too much

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:28.890
for the extra weight.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.190
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:31.490
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Or
at home, so I'm finishing

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:34.850
up the recent biography
of Toscanini

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:37.840
which is really interesting

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.610
by Joe Horowitz I think
wrote this, I think.

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:46.450
And I'm rereading
James Baldwin's

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:48.090
"Go Tell It on the Mountain."

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.390
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.150
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: I find
sometimes when I see something

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:57.510
in our culture, I find myself
being thrown back to the 1960s

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:00.910
where much of what we're
experiencing today is

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.550
reoccurring, but to be frankly

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.390
in a much more horrifying
manner.

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:12.190
So, I go back and I read works
that were influential to me

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:15.950
as a young person to see if they
still resonate and, in fact,

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:19.770
they do resonate usually more
than ever, more than ever.

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:25.380
And I think now having seen
the Ken Burns Civil War series,

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:29.830
I will probably now go back
and look at that differently

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:34.130
and read, I'm not sure which
book yet, but that came

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:43.680
because this year I'm doing,
I'm conducting a score

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.440
to Buster Keaton's silent film
"The General" usually recognized

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:52.470
as one of the top ten or fifteen
films ever made in this country

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:59.040
and I had it scheduled for
two places, and I got flack

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:03.650
for saying well, this is about
the South in the Civil War,

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:06.920
and I said, "No it's not.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.850
It just happens to be then."

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:16.520
Keaton's character is conflicted
because he runs this train

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:22.010
as the engineer and he's a
very good engineer and his,

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:26.150
the person he loves wants
him to be a solider,

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.660
but the Confederates don't
want him to be their soldier

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.070
because he's such
a good engineer.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:32.800
There are no slaves in it.

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.570
There's no Robert E. Lee in it.

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.790
Yes, there's a battle
and the South wins.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:38.090
Guess what?

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.660
The South did win some battles,

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:43.550
but one organization decided
they would go through with it

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.620
and they'll do it, but there
will a panel discussion

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:50.220
and the other one said no
it's just too hot a topic.

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.730
And, I find that sad.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:59.800
I find that erasing
an important part

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:07.430
of our history as
conveyed via art.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:11.040
It's incomprehensible
to me, but that happens.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.970
It, I do understand why in
Israel they don't play Wagner.

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:18.480
I understand that and that will
probably change at some point,

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.730
but this is a different
thing altogether.

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:26.290
This is something where
you want young people

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:30.620
to understand the
creation of our country.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:34.800
How we evolved and maybe how
we've gotten to the point

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.490
where we are today, devolved.

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:40.940
So, I was glad I won one of
the two battles anyhow, So,

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.400
yeah I do different things.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.740
I read. I go to movies a
lot, product of Hollywood.

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.380
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yes.

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.710
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: No choice.

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:55.530
And I go to sports events.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:57.980
I got back in time to
watch the last five innings

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.190
of the World Series last night.

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:03.190
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Are you a Dodgers fans?

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:04.490
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Sort of.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:05.790
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh, geez.

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:07.090
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
I'm a Cardinal fan.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.390
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.690
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
And I'm a tiger fan.

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:10.990
You know, I didn't really
care, but I just I wanted

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:12.290
to see Verlander
go against Kershaw.

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:13.590
I'm just sorry that
didn't happen.

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:14.890
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.190
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: I
really wanted to see that.

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:17.490
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:18.790
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: So.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:20.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Maybe next year.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:21.390
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: No.

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:22.690
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: No?

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.990
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: No,

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:25.290
the Cardinals/Tigers
series next year.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:26.590
It's got to be.

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:27.890
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Very good.

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:29.190
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
It's not a prediction.

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:30.490
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh, okay.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:31.790
Since we've just now
gotten into some topics

00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:33.090
about American society
how it evolves and such,

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:34.390
I'd love to go back
to "Songfest."

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:35.690
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yeah.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:36.990
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: "Songfest"
is, of course, this collection

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.770
of songs that Bernstein composed
setting various different

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.500
American poets from different
periods, different backgrounds,

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.840
comings, Whitman,
Gertrude Stein, etcetera

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.530
and with my experience

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:51.330
of studying the piece
is just it's bold

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:52.630
in the statements it makes.

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:56.050
It's not necessarily making
positive statements at all

00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:01.450
for most it, but it feels
like it stands apart from some

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:05.300
of Bernstein's depictions of
American culture and society

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:11.350
in that it's more maybe
realism and less optimism

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:12.650
in some ways, I don't know.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:15.890
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: I agree, but
I put it a different context,

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:22.470
I'll give you five works in
Bernstein's concert output

00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:23.770
which is what he wanted

00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:25.880
and hoped he would
eventually be remembered for.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.110
He was really tired
of being identified

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:32.180
as the composer of
"Westside Story."

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:35.500
We should all be so lucky to
have written "Westside Story."

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:41.620
But, you start with his
first symphony "Jeremiah",

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:46.300
dedicated to his father and
not exactly the subject matter,

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:53.250
but the nature of his
Jewish upbringing is infused

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:55.010
within this work.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:58.990
Now you come to the second
symphony, "Age of Anxiety",

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.570
an Auden Eclogue all
about alienation.

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:06.150
Three people trying to figure

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:09.910
out who they are what
their role is and all that.

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:13.500
It's not necessary to listen to
this piece with that in mind,

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:18.260
but this is very
descriptive of Bernstein

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:22.070
as his conducting career is
developing, he hasn't written

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.720
"Westside Story" yet, but he's
written Broadway shows and it's

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.660
like he's searching for what
is his real place going to be,

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:31.000
he doesn't quite know yet.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.100
Now, you come to
"Kaddish" which is 1963,

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.400
written just before
Kennedy is assassinated

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.150
but not performed until after.

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:46.970
The Kaddish is the Jewish prayer
for the dead where the word

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:50.300
"death" is not mentioned, but
the word "life" is three times.

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:54.960
And there's a narration
in this piece which begins

00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:03.830
to express the conflict
between man and god

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:07.570
or whatever you do
or don't believe.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:11.450
The first performances
were narrated by his wife,

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:15.010
one a women is not
allowed to recite a Kaddish

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.630
in the traditional
Jewish [inaudible],

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.990
and the text was
roundly criticized.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:24.480
It was also Bernstein
trying to deal

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.250
with the prevailing
musical thought of the time

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:31.480
which was 12-tone serial
music which he does for some

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.630
of the piece and then abandons
and we hear him a little more.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.610
But it really is about
that struggle of faith

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:42.360
which would then continue
into mass where now it's;

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.770
sometimes things are we've
got to hear Bernstein's mass.

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:46.400
It's just the word "mass."

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.390
It's not mass and b
minor, it's not a mass.

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:55.680
It is not specific
to any religion.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.940
It is, again, about that
struggle between somebody

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:04.060
who should be pious in some
way and not knowing how to deal

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.340
with it, but it was very
much a piece of the 60s.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.650
There was a rock group in it
and all this kind of stuff.

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:13.920
In some ways, to me it's
not holy successful work,

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.660
it's just a little bit too
dedicated to the times,

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.250
but it very much
continues now Bernstein

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:25.850
between the Kaddishness
realizing that he's bisexual

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:28.880
and he doesn't know how
to come to grips with it.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.480
That's where his
crisis of faith is.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.640
And finally we come
to "Songfest."

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.000
And you pointed it
out, but I'm going

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.320
to give you a slightly
different spin on it.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.960
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Yes, definitely.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.280
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Of all the
pieces that Bernstein wrote,

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.380
this is the one that is the most
autobiographical of Bernstein.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.860
You might have been going there
anyway, because almost all

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:56.030
of the poems deal with
some aspect of his life.

01:01:56.030 --> 01:02:01.220
So, if you're talking about
"The Pennycandystore",

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.690
that's Bernstein's childhood,

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:10.210
but doesn't it kind
of 1940s style jazz.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:15.030
Then you come to Julia de Burgos
the only song not in English,

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:19.420
and this is about a
fight for women's rights

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.460
and for the possibility
to break shackles.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:26.170
Then you come to the Whitman
poem, the only poem we know

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.470
that came later were written

01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:31.210
and is acknowledging his
homosexuality and one

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:34.210
of the most moving songs
ever written, ever.

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.760
And there's Bernstein again,

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.800
and you go through it
then you get the duet

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.820
with Langston Hughes
and the other name.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.120
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
June Jordan.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.420
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Yeah.

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.720
First of all the juxta positions

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.790
of the two poems is amazing how
it works, but now you're talking

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:51.720
about the Black Panthers
over at Bernstein's apartment

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.070
and one song after
another tells you

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:59.640
that this is an autobiography
of Bernstein seen

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.950
through these other poet's eyes.

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:07.490
So, I treat these five pieces
as being in a way better

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:10.230
than reading any
biography of the composer,

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:14.070
because they tell you what
he stood for in his life

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:19.200
through his music and the use
of the words that he chose.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.500
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500
June Jordan actually
recorded the poem.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.800
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Oh, really?

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.100
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Right there.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.400
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Wow.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.700
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
It was pretty wild

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.000
and we have it up
on our website.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.300
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: You don't
have the Langston Hughes

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.600
one though?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.900
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: No,
I don't know if we have.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.200
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
Wouldn't that be cool

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.500
to put them [brief
laughter] together?

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.800
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Yes, in the same realm.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.100
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And it's,

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.400
"Songfest" has an
unusual history,

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.470
because it was not
premiered as a totality.

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:44.660
The first performance was
of, I don't remember how many

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:47.290
of his songs, but
maybe six, seven,

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.480
and it was for a
July 4th concert.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.250
Now, July 4th here in
Washington, you know,

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.680
flags are out and people are
going out and they want to hear

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.430
"Stars and Stripes"
and they want to hear

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:57.440
"1812" and all these things.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.170
Well, all of a sudden
came this piece with texts

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:05.230
that were angry, texts that were
touchy subjects people did not

01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:06.530
want to deal with.

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:10.230
And I believe [inaudible] was
then not allowed to play 4th

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:11.530
of July for a couple of years,

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:17.340
and the administrations now were
very careful about what could

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:21.110
and could not be done
on this occasion.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.490
I'm sure they thought
Bernstein was just going

01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:27.820
to write us a good old patriotic
piece and we'd get the preview

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.470
of "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.770
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:32.070
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: But,
that wasn't to happen.

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:33.370
So, finally he put it altogether

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.420
and the piece was premiered
here; he recorded it,

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.130
but I also have another
piece to start the program.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:42.300
Very rarely played,
he wrote an overture

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:46.110
for Rostropovich's very first
season it's called "Slava."

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.410
It's great fun.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:52.380
It's really almost like
"Candide" on steroids.

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.680
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yes.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.170
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
And Slava conducted it.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:59.960
In it, there's a portion
where the orchestra used to,

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.340
they don't do anymore, you're
supposed to yell out "Pooks"

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.570
which is the name of Slava's dog
who came around all the time,

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.470
but at the end the
orchestra does to go Slava!

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:10.670
for Rostropovich and
then comes the end,

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:13.810
but those are the two pieces
that the orchestra played

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:16.720
that Bernstein wrote for them
and I thought they would be nice

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.280
and they're coupled with
"Sacre du printemps"

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.310
for the simple reason
I grew up with his,

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:25.890
Bernstein's first
recording of it.

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:28.990
The first time I met him it was
the piece he was rehearsing.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.290
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh, wow.

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:31.590
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin:
And I thought if I had

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:34.870
to pick a non-Bernstein piece
other than Mahler, to associate

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.220
with Bernstein it's
the "Rite of Spring."

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.520
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Excellent.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.230
To wrap up, I'd like
to ask a favor of you.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.530
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: Sure.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:45.120
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And
that is to share with us

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.330
and our viewers a piece of
advice for how musicians

01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:51.820
and people in the
cultural sector,

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:57.170
how we can use our position
as public figures with art

01:05:57.170 --> 01:06:02.500
to motivate community
engagement?

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.640
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: You have
asked basically the question

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.940
of our time.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.240
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yes.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:12.030
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: And my
response to that is one,

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:17.530
always remember as an artist,
whatever kind of artist you are,

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:21.910
why you decided to
enter this profession.

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:23.210
What drove you?

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:27.210
Maybe it was a person in your
life who led you on this path.

01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:31.820
Maybe you saw or heard
something that inspired you.

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:37.220
If you don't keep that in
the forefront of your mind,

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.670
you're just doing a job.

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:45.020
To be an artist is a very
special honor not many people

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.800
get to do it.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:54.680
And so, conveying the passion
and the love for what you do,

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.730
that alone should be enough
to help inspire others.

01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:05.470
The most noble part of what all
of us do is not what takes place

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:09.340
in the museum, in
the concert hall,

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:13.080
it's what takes place
in the classroom.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:19.600
A big change in our society has
to do with the lack of education

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.940
that exists in the arts, but
also has to do with the change

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:29.150
for those people who
are people of faith.

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:38.440
Music has become quite secondary
in church services, synagogues,

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:46.300
mosques it's not thought of as
being the inspirational part

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.830
of what going to worship is,
and if you're an agnostic

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:56.040
or an atheist and you've decided
that you don't believe in any

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:02.190
of that, although I'm Jewish
by heritage and birth,

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:06.430
I'm not what one calls
devout or practicing.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:07.730
I'm just not.

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:12.100
And the reason I'm not, is
because I get to do something

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:17.270
that people would
love to be able to do.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:19.640
I take these circles
and these dots

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.970
and those little
instructions left to us,

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.390
they're sitting there
on a piece of paper

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:27.840
and I have these
musicians in front me

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:33.060
and I'm bringing
those ideas to life.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.430
I'm doing what doctors
would love to do.

01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:42.740
I can resurrect them, sometimes
successfully, sometimes not,

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.830
but I can that and if everybody

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.560
in our profession would
take more seriously

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:55.030
that this is not just a job,
but it's a real privilege

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:59.270
and a responsibility to pass
it on; conveying that love,

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.410
conveying that passion.

01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:03.920
That's what's going to spread
out into the community.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.220
Make sure people know about
what you do, who you are,

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.100
get in touch with marketing
people, with PR people,

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:21.490
whenever you can explain even
controversial art is a positive

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:26.230
because it's something created
that never existed before.

01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:30.460
We really wish more
people could do that.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:34.930
You're a young person now; what
happened between my generation

01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:37.010
and today's young generation?

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:41.900
We became a more
visual-oriented society;

01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:46.390
pop singer makes a
song, create the video.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.460
Kids are driving or doing
whatever they do listening

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:53.040
in their things, song comes on,
are they really into the song

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.610
or are they flashing
to how it looked?

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:58.110
Which is usually a
director's vision of the song,

01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:00.780
not necessarily the
artist who created it.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.700
I want to get us back
to the time when all

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.340
of us had the power
of imagination,

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.380
as some people would put it,
be able to live your dreams,

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:18.360
and if we can do that as
a society, in conjunction

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.670
with physical responsibility,

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:26.950
with an aim towards things not
going towards the violent end

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:30.680
that they seem to go to sadly
these days, but understand

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.340
that bringing the
beauty of imagination

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:38.930
to the general public
I think we would all be

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:41.570
in a much better place.

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.270
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Well,
you've left me hopeful.

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:45.640
Thank you for sharing
those insights.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.940
&gt;&gt; Leonard Slatkin: My pleasure.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.970
