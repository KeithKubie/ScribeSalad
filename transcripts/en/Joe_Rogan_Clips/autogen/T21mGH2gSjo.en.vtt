airplane underneath the surface and if
 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.689 align:start position:0%
airplane underneath the surface and if
he<00:05:12.550><c> gets</c><00:05:12.669><c> into</c><00:05:12.909><c> trouble</c><00:05:13.090><c> if</c><00:05:13.389><c> they</c><00:05:13.539><c> wiped</c><00:05:13.780><c> out</c>

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
he gets into trouble if they wiped out
 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
he gets into trouble if they wiped out
they<00:05:15.699><c> have</c><00:05:15.849><c> a</c><00:05:15.879><c> quick</c><00:05:16.120><c> release</c><00:05:16.300><c> but</c><00:05:16.659><c> now</c>

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 align:start position:0%
they have a quick release but now
 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.230 align:start position:0%
they have a quick release but now
they've<00:05:17.199><c> gotten</c><00:05:17.530><c> this</c><00:05:17.680><c> developed</c><00:05:18.190><c> so</c><00:05:18.849><c> that</c><00:05:19.029><c> he</c>

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
they've gotten this developed so that he
 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.339 align:start position:0%
they've gotten this developed so that he
can<00:05:19.449><c> do</c><00:05:19.690><c> it</c><00:05:21.360><c> without</c><00:05:22.360><c> the</c><00:05:22.659><c> boots</c><00:05:22.840><c> because</c><00:05:23.110><c> that</c>

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 align:start position:0%
can do it without the boots because that
 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
can do it without the boots because that
adds<00:05:23.529><c> an</c><00:05:23.770><c> element</c><00:05:24.159><c> of</c><00:05:24.250><c> danger</c><00:05:24.490><c> that</c><00:05:24.870><c> because</c>

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 align:start position:0%
adds an element of danger that because
 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.330 align:start position:0%

is<00:05:45.909><c> denser</c><00:05:46.089><c> than</c><00:05:46.419><c> air</c><00:05:46.569><c> so</c><00:05:46.930><c> it's</c><00:05:47.080><c> sort</c><00:05:47.289><c> of</c><00:05:47.319><c> like</c>

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 align:start position:0%
is denser than air so it's sort of like
 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.730 align:start position:0%
is denser than air so it's sort of like
a<00:05:47.680><c> miniature</c><00:05:48.550><c> plane</c><00:05:49.029><c> and</c><00:05:49.599><c> it</c><00:05:49.719><c> is</c><00:05:49.750><c> like</c><00:05:50.110><c> the</c>

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 align:start position:0%
a miniature plane and it is like the
 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
a miniature plane and it is like the
Oracle<00:05:51.520><c> guys</c><00:05:51.669><c> that</c><00:05:51.940><c> do</c><00:05:52.060><c> those</c><00:05:52.240><c> boats</c><00:05:52.509><c> do</c><00:05:52.810><c> have</c>

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 align:start position:0%
Oracle guys that do those boats do have
 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.790 align:start position:0%
Oracle guys that do those boats do have
made<00:05:53.440><c> foils</c><00:05:53.889><c> for</c><00:05:53.949><c> Laird</c><00:05:54.310><c> it's</c><00:05:55.469><c> yeah</c><00:05:56.469><c> so</c><00:05:56.560><c> those</c>

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
made foils for Laird it's yeah so those
 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.689 align:start position:0%
made foils for Laird it's yeah so those
are<00:05:56.979><c> kind</c><00:05:57.250><c> of</c><00:05:57.370><c> more</c><00:05:58.889><c> low</c><00:05:59.889><c> performance</c><00:06:00.430><c> ones</c>

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 align:start position:0%
are kind of more low performance ones
 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.149 align:start position:0%
are kind of more low performance ones
when<00:06:01.029><c> you</c><00:06:01.089><c> see</c><00:06:01.210><c> the</c><00:06:01.330><c> high</c><00:06:01.419><c> performance</c><00:06:01.930><c> they</c><00:06:02.620><c> I</c>

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
when you see the high performance they I
 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.990 align:start position:0%
when you see the high performance they I
mean<00:06:04.080><c> you</c><00:06:05.080><c> know</c><00:06:05.370><c> aerodynamics</c><00:06:06.370><c> hydrodynamics</c>

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
mean you know aerodynamics hydrodynamics
 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.809 align:start position:0%
mean you know aerodynamics hydrodynamics
it's<00:06:07.659><c> all</c><00:06:07.870><c> of</c><00:06:08.020><c> that</c><00:06:08.159><c> so</c><00:06:09.159><c> now</c><00:06:09.490><c> what</c><00:06:09.729><c> you're</c>

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 align:start position:0%
it's all of that so now what you're
 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's all of that so now what you're
doing<00:06:09.879><c> is</c><00:06:10.210><c> because</c><00:06:10.479><c> there's</c><00:06:11.050><c> energy</c><00:06:11.199><c> below</c>

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 align:start position:0%
doing is because there's energy below
 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.369 align:start position:0%
doing is because there's energy below
the<00:06:12.279><c> surface</c><00:06:12.520><c> moving</c><00:06:13.270><c> so</c><00:06:13.659><c> we</c><00:06:13.810><c> think</c><00:06:14.050><c> of</c><00:06:14.139><c> a</c><00:06:14.199><c> wave</c>

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 align:start position:0%
the surface moving so we think of a wave
 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
the surface moving so we think of a wave
like<00:06:14.589><c> pushing</c><00:06:15.159><c> and</c><00:06:15.310><c> dropping</c><00:06:15.819><c> but</c><00:06:16.449><c> there's</c>

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 align:start position:0%
like pushing and dropping but there's
 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
like pushing and dropping but there's
actually<00:06:16.810><c> the</c><00:06:17.139><c> energy</c><00:06:17.430><c> circular</c><00:06:18.430><c> energy</c>

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 align:start position:0%
actually the energy circular energy
 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.309 align:start position:0%
actually the energy circular energy
below<00:06:18.940><c> so</c><00:06:19.360><c> now</c><00:06:19.479><c> you've</c><00:06:19.659><c> got</c><00:06:19.690><c> the</c><00:06:19.930><c> foil</c><00:06:20.169><c> that</c>

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
below so now you've got the foil that
 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.050 align:start position:0%
below so now you've got the foil that
can<00:06:20.469><c> ride</c><00:06:20.620><c> that</c><00:06:20.800><c> but</c><00:06:21.099><c> you're</c><00:06:21.219><c> not</c><00:06:21.370><c> you</c><00:06:21.909><c> don't</c>

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 align:start position:0%
can ride that but you're not you don't
 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
can ride that but you're not you don't
have<00:06:22.210><c> drag</c><00:06:22.650><c> so</c><00:06:23.650><c> like</c><00:06:23.830><c> they</c><00:06:24.009><c> can</c><00:06:24.219><c> go</c><00:06:24.400><c> there's</c><00:06:24.849><c> a</c>

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 align:start position:0%
have drag so like they can go there's a
 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
have drag so like they can go there's a
wave<00:06:25.449><c> on</c><00:06:25.839><c> kawaiii</c><00:06:26.259><c> where</c><00:06:27.069><c> they're</c><00:06:27.219><c> going</c><00:06:27.460><c> over</c>

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 align:start position:0%
wave on kawaiii where they're going over
 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
wave on kawaiii where they're going over
you<00:06:28.150><c> know</c><00:06:28.270><c> 50</c><00:06:28.659><c> big</c><00:06:28.990><c> Oh</c><00:06:29.050><c> about</c><00:06:29.229><c> 50</c><00:06:29.560><c> they</c><00:06:29.800><c> can</c><00:06:29.949><c> go</c>

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:30.069 align:start position:0%
you know 50 big Oh about 50 they can go
 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.379 align:start position:0%
you know 50 big Oh about 50 they can go
up<00:06:30.129><c> get</c><00:06:30.339><c> up</c><00:06:30.370><c> to</c><00:06:30.550><c> 52</c><00:06:30.819><c> miles</c><00:06:31.210><c> an</c><00:06:31.419><c> hour</c><00:06:32.879><c> so</c><00:06:33.879><c> imagine</c>

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 align:start position:0%
up get up to 52 miles an hour so imagine
 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.730 align:start position:0%
up get up to 52 miles an hour so imagine
if<00:06:34.449><c> you</c><00:06:34.539><c> did</c><00:06:34.719><c> something</c><00:06:35.110><c> well</c><00:06:35.259><c> you've</c><00:06:35.409><c> you</c>

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 align:start position:0%
if you did something well you've you
 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.589 align:start position:0%
if you did something well you've you
know<00:06:35.770><c> dedicated</c><00:06:36.399><c> yourself</c><00:06:36.490><c> to</c><00:06:36.789><c> martial</c><00:06:37.360><c> arts</c>

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
know dedicated yourself to martial arts
 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.779 align:start position:0%
know dedicated yourself to martial arts
it's<00:06:37.750><c> like</c><00:06:37.899><c> but</c><00:06:38.529><c> then</c><00:06:38.709><c> there's</c><00:06:38.979><c> like</c><00:06:39.159><c> a</c><00:06:39.310><c> new</c>

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 align:start position:0%
it's like but then there's like a new
 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.490 align:start position:0%
it's like but then there's like a new
way<00:06:40.000><c> to</c><00:06:40.419><c> do</c><00:06:41.050><c> it</c>

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.650 align:start position:0%
way to do it
and<00:06:41.920><c> so</c><00:06:42.070><c> he's</c><00:06:42.190><c> been</c><00:06:42.340><c> doing</c><00:06:42.610><c> the</c><00:06:42.730><c> big</c><00:06:42.970><c> stuff</c><00:06:43.330><c> for</c>

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 align:start position:0%
and so he's been doing the big stuff for
 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.870 align:start position:0%
and so he's been doing the big stuff for
25<00:06:44.350><c> years</c><00:06:44.590><c> but</c><00:06:45.160><c> now</c><00:06:45.340><c> they're</c><00:06:45.580><c> getting</c><00:06:45.820><c> the</c>

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
25 years but now they're getting the
 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.150 align:start position:0%
25 years but now they're getting the
equipment<00:06:46.090><c> right</c><00:06:46.420><c> that</c><00:06:46.660><c> he</c><00:06:46.780><c> can</c><00:06:46.960><c> ride</c><00:06:47.200><c> ways</c>

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
equipment right that he can ride ways
 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
equipment right that he can ride ways
that<00:06:48.430><c> actually</c><00:06:49.270><c> wouldn't</c><00:06:49.450><c> be</c><00:06:49.540><c> that</c><00:06:49.720><c> great</c><00:06:50.080><c> but</c>

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
that actually wouldn't be that great but
 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.010 align:start position:0%
that actually wouldn't be that great but
now<00:06:51.100><c> they're</c><00:06:51.280><c> super</c><00:06:51.550><c> fun</c><00:06:51.760><c> Wow</c>

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 align:start position:0%
now they're super fun Wow
 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
now they're super fun Wow
so<00:06:53.140><c> he</c><00:06:53.260><c> gets</c><00:06:53.410><c> it</c><00:06:53.650><c> makes</c><00:06:54.010><c> him</c><00:06:54.160><c> excited</c><00:06:54.460><c> and</c><00:06:54.880><c> he</c>

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 align:start position:0%
so he gets it makes him excited and he
 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.990 align:start position:0%
so he gets it makes him excited and he
still<00:06:55.390><c> pursues</c><00:06:55.810><c> it</c><00:06:55.990><c> and</c><00:06:56.640><c> that's</c><00:06:57.640><c> how</c><00:06:57.790><c> that's</c>

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
still pursues it and that's how that's
 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.610 align:start position:0%
still pursues it and that's how that's
on<00:06:58.270><c> Kauai</c><00:06:58.510><c> right</c><00:06:58.750><c> there</c><00:06:58.960><c> and</c><00:06:59.170><c> see</c><00:06:59.320><c> how</c><00:06:59.440><c> it's</c>

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 align:start position:0%
on Kauai right there and see how it's
 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
on Kauai right there and see how it's
not<00:06:59.770><c> even</c><00:07:00.070><c> breaking</c><00:07:00.340><c> where</c><00:07:00.640><c> he</c><00:07:00.700><c> rides</c><00:07:00.940><c> it</c><00:07:01.210><c> yeah</c>

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 align:start position:0%
not even breaking where he rides it yeah
 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
not even breaking where he rides it yeah
so<00:07:02.500><c> it</c><00:07:02.650><c> no</c><00:07:02.800><c> drug</c><00:07:03.130><c> correct</c><00:07:03.850><c> and</c><00:07:04.150><c> it's</c><00:07:04.450><c> it's</c>

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 align:start position:0%
so it no drug correct and it's it's
 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
so it no drug correct and it's it's
actually<00:07:05.110><c> riding</c><00:07:05.560><c> the</c><00:07:05.860><c> energy</c><00:07:06.220><c> below</c><00:07:06.700><c> the</c>

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 align:start position:0%
actually riding the energy below the
 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.190 align:start position:0%
actually riding the energy below the

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
surface which you know for him he's just
 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
surface which you know for him he's just
interested<00:07:11.950><c> in</c><00:07:12.040><c> what's</c><00:07:12.520><c> the</c><00:07:12.700><c> most</c><00:07:12.910><c> efficient</c>

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 align:start position:0%
interested in what's the most efficient
 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.850 align:start position:0%
interested in what's the most efficient
way<00:07:13.570><c> I</c><00:07:13.750><c> mean</c><00:07:14.020><c> look</c><00:07:14.170><c> at</c><00:07:14.260><c> that</c><00:07:14.320><c> you'd</c><00:07:14.560><c> never</c>

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 align:start position:0%
way I mean look at that you'd never
