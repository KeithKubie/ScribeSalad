And I said I wanted to
know what was going on.

Because, when they sent

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.050
out the invitations,
the invitation had what?

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.750
The types of games
are going to have.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.590

the tail on the donkey.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.990
And what did the donkey do?

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.790

&gt;&gt; What game do you think this was?

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.780
&gt;&gt; Because they do

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.960

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.340

&gt;&gt; Because bacon--

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.390

Uh-oh. The pigs, they
need a mud bath

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.660
to look their best for the party.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.310

And little Duck gets in the mud and
squishes and gets in the mud too.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:01.250
Well, now the cows, now the
cows like the way they look.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.860
They thought they looked
pretty good.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.990 position:56%
And so the cows-- no

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.730
Now, Farmer Brown was
making the cake.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.990
And he lights the candles
and he puts on his best hat,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.800

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.200

&gt;&gt; He's just one years old!.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.040
He thought that he should do what
all the other animals were doing.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.340
And look how he looks.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.310
At his own birthday--

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.630
