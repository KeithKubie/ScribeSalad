00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.543
- [Voiceover] Hey, grammarians.

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:04.686
Today let's start talking about
subordinating conjunctions.

00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:08.734
Words like, although
and after and because.

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.028
It's a pretty complicated topic,

00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:13.676
because in order to understand
subordinating conjunctions,

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:15.835
you have to understand the difference

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:19.505
between an independent,
and a dependent clause.

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:21.460
Because that's what
subordinating conjunctions do,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.958
is they unite independent
and dependent clauses.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.818
That's what subordinating conjunctions do.

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:29.485
But, what are these?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.800
You know, what is an independent
and a dependent clause?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.777
Well okay so first of
all, let's back up again.

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:37.610
What is a clause?

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.268
A clause is just a language chunk

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:42.601
that has a subject and a verb.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.942
That's what a clause does.

00:00:44.942 --> 00:00:46.939
All sentences are clauses,

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.285
but not all clauses are sentences.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:50.340
I'll write that down.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.872
So, all sentences are clauses,

00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:55.913
but not all clauses are sentences.

00:00:55.913 --> 00:00:57.453
It's possible to have
something that has both

00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:00.575
a subject and a verb, that
doesn't stand on its own,

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:01.867
and that's a dependent clause.

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:03.421
We'd call that a sentence fragment.

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.838
What a dependent clause does,

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:11.495
is provide extra information
that isn't necessary

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.535
to the understanding
of the sentence, right.

00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:16.451
But an independent clause has

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.807
to be able to stand on its own.

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:20.353
So, let's take a look
at the sentence here.

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:23.044
Herbert performed his
irresponsible experiments

00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:25.296
because he was curious.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:28.379
And this sentence is
composed of two clauses.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.087
In red, we've got this independent clause,

00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:33.111
Herbert performed his
irresponsible experiments.

00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:36.143
And in green, we have
this dependent clause,

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:37.975
because he was curious.

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:39.915
Now, we know that because he was curious,

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:41.422
is the dependent clause.

00:01:41.422 --> 00:01:45.589
Because, it explains more of
why Herbert did what he did.

00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:48.915
Right, it is explaining the reason

00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:52.694
for his performing
irresponsible experiments.

00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:56.250
But, because he was curious on its own,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.180
doesn't work as a sentence,
he was curious does.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.013
That's a sentence.

00:02:01.013 --> 00:02:02.830
But, because he was curious

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.923
asks more questions than it answers.

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:08.326
Because he was curious, what?

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:11.848
You know, if a clause causes you to ask.

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:13.388
Yeah, so what?

00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:16.757
Then it's probably a dependent
clause, write that down.

00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:18.926
Put that in the doctrine.

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:20.582
So, a dependent clause should

00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:23.559
cause you to ask, yeah so what?

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.260
Because a dependent clause leans

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.049
against an independent clause.

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.712
It's like a ladder laid
up against the tree.

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.046
The tree is still gonna be standing there

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:32.208
whether or not the ladder is there or not.

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:35.212
But, the ladder is useful
because it allows you to get up

00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:38.238
further into the tree
and explore its leaves,

00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:39.071
if that makes sense.

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:40.078
It allows you to get further context

00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:42.838
and further understanding.

00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:44.515
But the tree could just as easily,

00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:45.823
it's still a tree without the ladder.

00:02:45.823 --> 00:02:46.856
Right, you don't have to have

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:49.439
a ladder in order to be a tree.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.784
All right so, another
thing about the difference

00:02:57.784 --> 00:03:01.894
between a coordinating and
a subordinating conjunction,

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:03.561
is that coordinating conjunctions

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:07.509
only unite independent
clauses with each other.

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.793
Which means, any sentence that has

00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:11.015
a coordinating conjunction like,

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:14.344
but or anything else in fanboys,.

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:18.443
Which is for and nor,
but, or yet so, right.

00:03:18.443 --> 00:03:22.617
Can be separated into two
sentences, two separate sentences.

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:25.838
Look at this, so Jimothy
liked to wash the dishes,

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:28.254
but Beckany preferred to sweep the floor.

00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:30.429
Now these can each be their own sentences.

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.840
Jimothy liked to wash the dishes.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.954
Beckany preferred to sweep the floor.

00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:37.982
We can combine these if
we want to and, we have.

00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:41.269
Whereas, this subordinating
conjunction sentence

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.436
that begins with although,

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:48.546
cannot be separated into two sentences.

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:50.211
Although she loved Sir Reginald,

00:03:50.211 --> 00:03:52.101
Lady Penelope hated his pranks.

00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:55.020
So, Lady Penelope hated his
pranks, that's a sentence.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.784
Although she loved Sir
Reginald, that's not a sentence.

00:03:57.784 --> 00:04:02.079
This is a dependent clause
so, this can be split.

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.871
(mouth sound effects)

00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:05.384
This cannot be split,

00:04:05.384 --> 00:04:06.932
because although she loved Sir Reginald,

00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:10.634
doesn't stand on its own, it
just grants additional context

00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:12.090
and detail to the fact that Lady Penelope

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.423
hated Sir Reginald's pranks.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.897
So, with that in mind,

00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:18.260
here are some of the most

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.728
common subordinating
conjunctions in English.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.834
And some of these you might
recognize as being adverbs

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:27.868
or prepositions in other contexts,

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:29.800
but you could also use them

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.911
to unite dependent and
independent clauses.

00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:34.161
So, here we go.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700
After, although, as, as if, because,

00:04:39.898 --> 00:04:42.315
before, even if, even though,

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:46.110
if, if only, like,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.193
rather than, since, that,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.149
though, unless, until,

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.899
when, where, whereas,

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.472
wherever, whether, which, and, while.

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:03.389
All of these words have the power

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.972
to unite independent
and dependent clauses.

00:05:08.092 --> 00:05:09.374
You may notice some of them like,

00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:12.308
after and before, are prepositions.

00:05:12.308 --> 00:05:14.084
They can be used in many ways.

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.399
English is complicated, but I am confident

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.900
that you can figure this out

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.525
because you can learn anything.

00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:23.889
These are some of the subordinating
conjunctions of English.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:24.722
David out.
