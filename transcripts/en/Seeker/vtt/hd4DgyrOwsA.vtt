00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.819
Have you ever stopped to think that it's possible
to lose a lot of blood -- like a LOT -- and

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.350
not die? Or is that just me… am I weird…
Meh! Well, we can live with about ⅔ of our

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.460
blood lost! It’s nuts. Let’s break it
down.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.720
On average — and this of course varies from
person to person based on height and weight

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.580
— an adult human has somewhere between 1.2
to 1.5 gallons of blood circulating in their

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.119
body at any given time.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.279
And even though we say “blood” like it’s
one thing, blood is actually made of four

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.999
things.
Plasma is the liquid that carries salts, electrolytes,

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.840
and blood cells around your body. Red blood
cells are the ones that carry oxygen, white

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.810
blood cells fight infection, and platelets
help us stop bleeding when we get a cut.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.390
The interesting thing is that the parts that
make up blood don’t have the same lifespan.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.070
Plasma is replenished as we eat and drink.Red
blood cells last about four months, white

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.679
blood cells turn over about every day, and
platelets last about ten days… and all those

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.070
cells are made predominantly in the bone marrow
controlled by hormones. The takeaway here

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.870
is that blood is always turning over.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.350
So say you donate a pint of blood, which is
the standard amount. This is actually about

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.130
10 percent of your blood! The plasma will
be replenished almost immediately, and the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.750
platelets and white blood cells pretty soon
after because the body makes those all the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.770
time. But it takes days for a stem cell in
the bone marrow to become a functional red

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.390
blood cell, so it can take a few days or even
a week for your body to replenish all the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.140
components of blood taken for the donation.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.200
And with red blood cells taking the longest
to replenish while also having the vital function

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.680
of carrying life-giving oxygen to all our
organs, it’s this cell count doctors look

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:54.460
at when you lose blood. I talked to my dad,
Dr. Teitel, who is a haemotologist, about

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.119
what happens.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.100
So how much blood can you lose before it becomes
fatal? Well, Dr. Dad says it depends on how

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:25.879
much you lose, but also how FAST 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:37.250
you 
lose it.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:51.920
The important thing 
is haemoglobin.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:06.150
Basically, says Dr. Dad, your body can adapt
to slow blood loss like it does to high altitude.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.160
So the same way you can’t go from sea level
to the top of Everest in one go, you can’t

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.959
drastically change your blood volume and survive.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.220
So it gets messy, literally, but at the end
of the day our bodies are sort of like a thermostat

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.120
when it comes to blood -- they’re excellent
at keeping everything at the right level so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.880
we can go on living. Thanks, body!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.970
And speaking of adapting, sort of, snake venom
isn't always bad right here. So what’s your
