00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.660
 Hello internet, 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.089
 Here we are: 500,000 abbonees - well, actually by the time this video is online. 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.380
 Even a little more than that - But who would have thought that after I promised to do a Q&amp;A 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.340
 The pope would abdicate. 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.930
 Anyway... 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.730
 When I uploaded my first explanation video now just over 2 years ago, I never had one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.380
 Expected the following: More than half a million abbonees and 16 videos with more than one million views. Who 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 Did you know that quickly recorded eductive videos would be so popular? 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 Thank you, Internet. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
 Well, as promised - Just a little behind schedule - it's time for a few of you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.210
 Answer questions. 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.849
 ## "What is your study background?" Rodrigo, Campo Grande, Brazil 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.180
 I went to school in New York where I earned two high school degrees, one in physics and one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.770
 in sociology. Then I moved to London and got a PGCE in science education, and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.830
 I became a qualified physics teacher in England. 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.690
 ## "How much time does it take to make one video?" Tracey, Ohio 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.800
 I have kept time to find a precise answer and every minute of video costs 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.720
 Writing and animating me between 10 and 20 hours. So a typical 5 minute video 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.450
 is 50 to 100 hours of work. 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.870
 Although that is a lot, it is not including the research phase that is rather difficult to measure. 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.929
 - For some of the videos I made, I had been collecting notes for more than a year before I started. 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.680
 ## "What was your favorite video to make?" Brittany P, UK 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.810
 The 2012 video was by far the best. - mainly because I don't get a whole lot complicated 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.270
 had to do research and I could complain about things that I don't like. 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 ## "What kind of change would you make to the education system?" Lumba jacket Gangsta, Austin, TX 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.940
 Instead of sorting children by age, I would sort them by wealth. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.190
 The idea that just because a child is fourteen years old he is ready for trigonometry is strange. No 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.550
 only other part of human society organizes itself in this way and for good reason: 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.990
 delayed the best and the smartest. 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.680
 ## "What do you think should be in the box but not in it?" Jamaal, Arizona 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.570
 Computer programming. I was a bit shocked and horrified when I started teaching in it 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.799
 UK and discovered that there were no real programming lessons. 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.909
 Of course, there are only a certain number of lessons per day, and everyone wants their favorite subject 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.470
 in the roster, so an equally important question is what has to go to make room 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.990
 for programming and without a doubt I would 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.170
 removing foreign languages ​​- programming brings us closer 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.159
 the perfect translator. 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.990
 ## "What do you do when you get pennies?" johnjac, owasso 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.020
 I die a little bit inside, thinking about how political systems can contribute small costs over large 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 numbers of people to help the few. 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.200
 ## "What is your favorite element?" Rasmus, Denmark 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560
 I don't have a favorite but I have something with Tungsten, especially because of my 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.610
 wedding ring made of it. 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.270
 ## "What is the story behind your logo?" Joshua B. 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.820
 It is a personal flag for my love of science and technology. 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.830
 When I started this channel I thought I was mainly going to make videos about that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.610
 two things, but for several reasons that hasn't happened yet. 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.310
 And, it's not like there is a shortage of good science channels on YouTube. 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.760
 By the way, if you like the logo you can get it on T-shirts and now also coffee cups 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.620
 - which is quite logical since coffee is the fuel without 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.600
 these videos could not be made. 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.260
 ## "What do you do in your spare time?" Sam L, Higginsville, MO 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.830
 I like to ride a horse through the mountains. 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.480
 Nah, it's usually just Reddit. 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.310
 Speaking of Reddit ... 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.630
 ## "Would you rather fight 100 horses the size of a duck or 1 duck the size of a horse?" techtakular, 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.010
 Alex, from 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.290
 A duck the size of a horse. The square cube law says that the legs of a duck the size of a horse are likely 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.459
 not be very stable. Easy 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.440
 ## "Will there be more" Politics in the animal kingdom "videos?" Oli 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.170
 Yes, I'm sorry. I know that the playlist is not finished yet and if videos are important 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.220
 Then those are. 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.250
 I promise at least one more about the single transferable voice, but I don't make any promises 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.360
 when it comes. 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.459
 ## "Do you think third parties will ever get land in the United States?" Kerl, Florida 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.730
 No. 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.849
 The problem is not politics or voter indifference, it is the system that makes politics 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.599
 and tuner indifference. 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.520
 The US electoral system is pretty much the worst in the civilized world - vaka is voting 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.020
 for a third party not only a waste, it is also a vote 'against' your own interests. 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.100
 Third parties cannot really thrive under such circumstances. 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.660
 ## "What is a technology that you would like to see before you die?" zigonick, MO, USA 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.489
 Immortality. 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.510
 ## "Where do you get your ideas from?" 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.510
 It is my experience that creative projects are self-supporting. The more you write 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.950
 the more things you want to write and the more you program, the more programming ideas 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.510
 You get. 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.129
 In my case, each video provides more videos. For example, the daylight saving time video originally 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.269
 there were pieces in it for information about longitude, time zones and the season that cut out of sentence 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.530
 but eventually become their own videos. 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.390
 I also listen to a monstrous amount of audio books and pdocasts. If you are interested you can go here 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.790
 See a few of my favorites. They help me stay in touch with the wide world 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.400
 and to expose me to ideas and information that I would probably not bump into on my own. 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.890
 ## "If you could live anywhere in history, what would it be?" Bonnie, Scotland 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.670
 I would not do that. 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.690
 Allow me to list the entire human existence with this graph. 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.260
 ## "What is the best way to become successful on YouTube?" Joe Kowalski, 44074 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.930
 Make videos that people want to see. 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.440
 I am not trying to be smart but when asked this question I see many YouTubers talking about it 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.959
 the importance of regular uploads and the management of your social media and collaborations, and 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.430
 my experience says that it is completely the other way around. 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.129
 If your videos are not interesting, no one cares that you upload them regularly. 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.830
 And Twitter followers do not provide views. views provide Twitter followers and people 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.380
 who want to work with you. 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.900
 I know it's not helpful advice, but it's the most honest advice I can give you. 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.250
 ## "What is the most interesting fact that you have ever been told?" Stu1278, England 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.750
 It is difficult to find one from a whole life, but last year visited Veritassium 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.100
 me in London and walked with me through the process by which trees water from their roots to theirs 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.060
 bring leaves. 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.680
 That sounds boring but it was one of the most mind-blowing conversations I had 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.340
 in years. 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.750
 ## "How often do you work with professionals on your research?" theLarom, 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.000
 DC 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.630
 For me, being confused and frustrated with a topic is an important part of figuring out how 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.570
 it should be explained to others, so I would say that I do 95% of my research alone. 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.530
 If a subject really does not suit me - such as the debt video and the pope video - I try 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.880
 very hard to find an expert who can check the end result but lacks time 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.590
 and the difficulty of finding a good expert often gets in the way. 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.630
 ## "What is your favorite internal organhat is your favorite internal organ?" trint99, DFW, TX 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.280
 The brain - because they are me. 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.020
 ## "Is there a science that you wish was wrong?" Jrod N, Massacusetts 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.840
 Yes, the current interpretations of the ultimate fate of the Universe make me sad. 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.020
 ## "Can you answer 10 questions in 30 seconds?" YouReadMeName 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.220
 ## 1: "What is your favorite scientific study ever published" Marie, Reno, NV 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.199
 Unskilled Are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.630
 Self-Insight Among the Incompetent 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.370
 Link in the description. 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.810
 ## 2: "Hogwarts house?" Zeinoun Awad, Lebanon 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.530
 Ravenclaw. (I would hope) 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.729
 ## 3: "Celsius or Fahrenheit?" Kubez 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:18.979
 Fahrenheit. 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.750
 ## 4: Kirk or Picard 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.000
 Picard. 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.470
 ## 5: "Are you wearing glasses?" Spartacus McFancy Pants 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.840
 Uh, yes. 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.949
 ## 6: "Favorite empire?" Caleb Glickman, USA 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.310
 The second. Those monks were amazing. 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.910
 ## 7: "How can a country be completely self-sufficient - if in no import or export?" Amberjack1973 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.510
 Simple, go back to medieval technology. 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.660
 ## 8: "Favorite sport?" soccernhlfan, Canada 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.910
 No. 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.720
 ## 9: "Should science play a greater role in politics?" Dip, London, UK 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.430
 What do you mean the way of finding out the truth? Yes, I think it should. 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.300
 ## 10: "Can you answer 10 questions in 30 seconds?" YouReadMeName 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.759
 Apparently. 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.669
 Okay, thanks everyone who asked questions - it was fun, Internet.
