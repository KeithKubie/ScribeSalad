is I would have seen I guess these are

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:23.149
is I would have seen I guess these are
 

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:24.249
is I would have seen I guess these are
the years but I would have thought maybe

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:24.259
the years but I would have thought maybe
 

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:26.710
the years but I would have thought maybe
these with years yeah well but it works

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720
these with years yeah well but it works
 

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.419
these with years yeah well but it works
either way but yeah we would have to

00:11:28.419 --> 00:11:28.429
either way but yeah we would have to
 

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:30.309
either way but yeah we would have to
take hands down initially I just have

00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:30.319
take hands down initially I just have
 

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:31.910
take hands down initially I just have
these and then the day

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920
these and then the day
 

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.500
these and then the day
stands like it needs something else some

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:33.510
stands like it needs something else some

was fine was I kind of had these already
 

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.650
was fine was I kind of had these already
made up I just didn't know how to attach

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660
made up I just didn't know how to attach
 

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.699
