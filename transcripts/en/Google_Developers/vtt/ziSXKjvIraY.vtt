MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.710
Welcome to Root Access, the show
for startups on Google

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.840
Developers Live.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.470
I'm Martin Omander and I'm
joined by Don Dodge, Googler

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.540
and longtime investor and
startup evangelist.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.840
Today we're going to talk
about getting funded.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.610
So Don, I hear a lot of startups
asking me, what

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.040
should a good pitch to
investors contain?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.170
DON DODGE: Several things.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.290
The first thing that investors
are interested in is the team,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.530
the team that's going
to build it.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.680
So they want to know about you,
where you came from, what

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.530
experience you have, and sort of
what domain experience you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.280
have to make this company
successful.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.410
So they want to know about you,
and they want to know

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.360
about your co-founders.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.650
Co-founder is important.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.220
Very, very, very, few companies
get funded with a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.280
single founder, so they want to
know what is the team, you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.960
and your co-founders.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.560
Also, advisers.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.290
So do you have advisers with
domain experience in this

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.000
industry who can give you good
advice, who have been

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.290
successful at this before and
are willing to help you?

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.320
So team and advisers
number one.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.200
Product, number two.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.440
So what is it you're building?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.270
Who is the user?

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.860
Who is the customer?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.560
How will they use it?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.070
So some use cases about how a
customer or user will use your

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.590
product, what problem does it
solve, or what does it make it

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.180
easier to do.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.000
The third thing is the
revenue model.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.160
So you don't need to have
revenue and you don't need to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.730
have all of the answers, but
you at least need to have

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.150
thought about, what are the
revenue models I could

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.170
employee here?

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.330
How would they work?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.200
Who would pay?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.780
How much would they pay?

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.210
How does that compare
to some competitors?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.590
Which leads to the fourth
thing-- competition.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.430
What does the market
look like?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.200
How big is the market?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.420
How big could it be?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.830
Who are the competitors?

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.230
What are their weaknesses?

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.350
What are you doing better?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.460
The fourth thing-- fifth thing--
is the milestones that

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.169
you'll achieve.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.930
So you tell them, I need a
million dollars and it will

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.670
last me 12 to 18 months, and
in this time frame, I'll

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.500
accomplish these milestones.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.980
And there should be two or
three milestones, interim

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.740
milestones, so that they can
measure the success.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.240
So those are the basic
components of a pitch.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.720
You can put other things in, but
those are the sort of five

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.920
things that investors
are interested in.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.340
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.780
So team, including advisers,
product, including use cases,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.640
revenue model, market and
competitors, demo, how much

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.680
money you're asking for,
and milestones--

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.990
DON DODGE: That's right.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.120
MARTIN OMANDER: --could hit.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.460
I think it's a good point,
especially around use cases.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.520
I sometimes hear about we're
going to simplify X, and then

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.940
it's kind of hard to understand
what the startup's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.980
really doing.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.550
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.200
It's important for investors to
understand what is it that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.100
you're doing, because they don't
live this every day.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.790
So you're passionate about your
idea, but they don't live

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.430
this every day, so they don't
know what the use cases are or

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.740
what the problems might be
that you're solving.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.230
So use cases help explain that
in a way that everyone can

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.640
understand.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.200
MARTIN OMANDER: I think in the
book called "Made to Stick"

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.140
about presentations, they call
it the curse of knowledge.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.195
You are the expert.

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:31.500
You know far more than the
others in the room and that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.360
means that you think they know
as much and then you don't

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.060
tell them enough.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.075
DON DODGE: Or that they
care as much.

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:38.945
And they don't.

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:39.380
MARTIN OMANDER: Yes.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.820
And they don't.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.850
DON DODGE: Passion is important
in a pitch.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.920
It's more than words on paper.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.690
It's investors are looking in
your eye and seeing if you

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.870
have passion about this idea--

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.200
not only that you understand
it and that you have

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.070
experience, but do
you have passion

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.630
about making this happen.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.915
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:57.700
DON DODGE: Important
component.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.710
MARTIN OMANDER: Because then
even if your first idea

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.830
doesn't completely work out,
you can reuse some of what

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.070
you've done and pivot a little
bit and keep going with the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.000
same team and same passion
and do something similar.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.690
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.610
That's why investors say they
invest in teams, because they

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.900
know that the idea will pivot
and change slightly as you go

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.470
along and learn more.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.880
But it's important that the team
be strong and passionate

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.170
and listen to ideas
and advice.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.150
MARTIN OMANDER: And maybe it's
easier to judge passion then

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.310
to judge particular
ideas as well.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.690
DON DODGE: It is for
investors, yes.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.120
MARTIN OMANDER: For
investors, right.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.640
OK, so I hear a lot of startup
founders from very early

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.300
startups saying that, I need to
polish it a little better,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.910
my product.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.120
I don't want to release it,
get in the hands of users,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.770
give them a poor experience.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.730
I want it to be just right
before I release it.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.020
When should a startup get
off their butts and get

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.220
their app out there?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.220
DON DODGE: As soon
as possible.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.090
Remember, software
is never done.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.060
You're always improving
software.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.850
So Google is 14 years old,
and we're improving the

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.550
software every day.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.670
So don't think that you need
to continuously polish it

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.920
before you give it to
users or customers.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.380
You've heard the MVP--

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.280
minimum viable product.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.940
What that means is as soon as
you have something that's

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.860
demonstrable of the idea--

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.170
it doesn't have to have all
the bells and whistles and

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.160
work-- but get it into the hands
of some beta customers,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.850
some beta users, so that
you can get feedback.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.010
That feedback will guide your
priorities and how you develop

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.630
the product going forward.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.210
It's never done, and you might
never be totally satisfied

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.760
with it, but get it out there
and start getting feedback.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.110
It's OK that your first 50 users
or 100 users don't get

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.930
the optimal experience.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.040
You're going to have thousands
or tens of thousands of users,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.080
so learn from those initial
users, get the feedback as

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.730
quickly as you can.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.110
MARTIN OMANDER: Launch
early, launch often.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.740
Is that it?

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.010
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.750
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.240
Very good.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.430
Thank you, Don.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.670
That's all for today.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.020
Please leave your comments and
questions under this YouTube

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.180
video, and we'll get back to
them in future episodes.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.000
Thanks for joining us
and see you at the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.440
same time next week.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.690
Bye.
