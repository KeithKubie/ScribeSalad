00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.280
- [Instructor] What we have
here is a free response

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.470
question that you might
see on an AP microeconomics

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.750
type exam that deals with game theory,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.900
and it tells us Breadbasket and Quicklunch

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.510
are the only two sandwich
shops serving a small town.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.210
So, we're in an oligopoly situation

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.170
where we only have a few firms.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.320
Each shop can choose to set a high price,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.090
or a low price, for sandwiches.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.740
The payoff matrix below shows
the daily profits for each

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.670
combination of prices that
the two shops could choose.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.500
The first entry shows
Breadbasket's profits,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.530
and the second entry shows
Quicklunch's profits.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.090
Assuming that both shops
know the information

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.130
shown in the matrix, answer the following.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.160
So, just to make sure I
understand what's going on here,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.100
this is saying that for example
if bread, Breadbasket can

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.630
either choose to charge
high prices or low prices.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.950
Quicklunch can either
choose to charge high prices

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.150
or low prices.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.993
If Breadbasket chooses high prices

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:00.940
and Quicklunch also chooses high prices,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.850
then what this tells us is the first one

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.680
is Breadbasket's profit
per day would be $105,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.680
while Quicklunch's profit
per day would be $110,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.130
and then this is a
situation where Breadbasket

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.500
is low and Quicklunch is high price,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.437
and then Breadbasket would make 120,

00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:19.830
and Quicklunch would make
80, and then when Quicklunch

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.560
has low prices we can see
what are the profit of either

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.360
when Breadbasket charges high prices

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.400
or Breadbasket charges low.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.233
So, with that out of the way,

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.120
let's try to answer these questions.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.200
Does each shop have a dominant strategy

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.430
to set a high price, a dominant
strategy to set a low price,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.320
or does it have no dominant strategy?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.210
So, pause the video and
try to figure that out,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.860
and just as a bit of
a hint, or a reminder,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.830
a dominant strategy is
a strategy of regardless

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.944
of what the other player
does you would still

00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:55.220
be better off to make that choice.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.500
So, a dominant strategy
of setting a high price

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.140
would be regardless of
whether the other player

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.830
decides to set a high or
low price a high price

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.560
would always make sense for you.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.353
So, pause the video and try
to see if you can answer that.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.810
All right, now let's see what

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.420
Breadbasket's situation is here.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.810
So, if we think, Breadbasket
of course can either choose

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.440
to go high or low.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.420
Now, if Quicklunch goes high,
what should Breadbasket do?

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.800
Well, then we are in
this column over here,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.810
and these two numbers are for Breadbasket,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.810
and so if Quicklunch goes
high then Breadbasket

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.550
could go high and charge
105, or it could go low

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.250
and charge 120.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.350
So, if Quicklunch goes high,
Breadbasket should go low.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.870
So, let me write this,
Quicklunch, Quicklunch,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.870
if it chooses to go high, then Breadbasket

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.850
should go low.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.100
Now, what happens if
Quicklunch chooses to go low?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.040
Well, if Quicklunch chooses to go low,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.060
the two options for Breadbasket
are either $40 of profit

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.060
per day if they have a high price,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.700
because a lot of their
business would go to Quicklunch

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.370
in that situation, or
they could go low price

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.120
and make $75 per day.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.660
So, even if Quicklunch goes
low it still makes sense

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.100
for Breadbasket to go low.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.690
So, Breadbasket goes low.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.090
So, we see that Breadbasket,
no matter what Quicklunch does,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.710
it makes sense for Breadbasket to go low.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.810
So, Breadbasket has a dominant strategy

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.340
to set a low price.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.860
So, the dominant, dominant strategy

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.770
to set, let me write that
a little bit clearer,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.200
set low price.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.470
All right, now, Quicklunch,
so, we could do the same type

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.770
of analysis based on what
Breadbasket might choose to do.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.250
So, if we see, okay, if
Breadbasket goes high,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.280
what should Quicklunch do?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.240
Well, let's see, then Quicklunch should,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.340
so, if Breadbasket goes high, Quicklunch,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.950
should it go high or low?

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.860
So, it would have the option of $110,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.550
or it would have an option of $130.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.920
So, if Breadbasket goes high,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.670
Quicklunch is better off going low.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.850
So, let me write that down.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.460
Quicklunch should go low.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.460
And if Breadbasket goes low
what should Quicklunch do?

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.840
So, if Breadbasket goes low,
Quicklunch can either make

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.760
80 if it goes high or 70 if it goes low.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.130
So, in this situation
if Breadbasket goes low

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.930
it makes sense actually
for Quicklunch to go high

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.340
and make the 80.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.160
So, Quicklunch would go high.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.680
So, Quicklunch has no dominant strategy.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.690
It doesn't make sense for
them to always go low,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.200
or always go high regardless
of what Breadbasket is doing.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.890
Depending on Breadbasket,
it might make sense

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.720
for them to go low if
Breadbasket goes high,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.850
or high if Breadbasket goes low.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.783
So, no dominant, dominant strategy.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.270
If the two shops do not
cooperate on setting prices,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.624
what will be the profit for each shop?

00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:07.550
Well, actually, just pause the video.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.793
See if you can answer that
before we work through it.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.780
Well, we already know that Breadbasket has

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.590
a dominant strategy to set a low price.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.250
So, Breadbasket is gonna
go low, regardless.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.490
So, that we're going to end up
in this row right over here,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.090
and if we are in that situation
where Breadbasket goes low

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.760
regardless we know that it
makes sense for Quicklunch

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.540
to go high, because they
could either make 80 or 70.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.480
Well, they're gonna go high,
and so we're going to end up

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.900
in this column right over here.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.420
So, if the two shops do not
cooperate on setting prices,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.957
the profit of each shop would
be Breadbasket would be making

00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:46.957
$120 a day and Quicklunch
would be making $80 a day.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.160
And this is a Nash
equilibrium, because on its own

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.100
no firm can change its decision
to optimize its prices more,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.140
because if you are in this,
if you are in this cell

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.330
right over here, Quicklunch can't

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.640
change Breadbasket's decision.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.640
So, Quicklunch could say
I'm either gonna make 80

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.890
or I'm gonna make 70, so,
it wouldn't make any sense

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.610
for them to switch away,
and then Breadbasket,

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.120
they can't make the
decision for Quicklunch.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.040
They can say, hey, we're
either gonna make 120

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.350
or we're gonna make 105.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.880
And so, since we can't change
what Quicklunch is doing,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.720
well, of course we're going
to choose to make 120.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.224
So, people will stay in
this bottom left cell

00:06:23.224 --> 00:06:25.210
(mumbles) a Nash equilibrium.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.010
All right, so the next part
they ask us, or they tell us,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.900
the town government is concerned that

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.740
food prices are too high.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.000
It decides to give a daily
subsidy of $20 to any shop

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.390
that chooses to set a low
price for its food items.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.540
Redraw the payoff matrix under

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.150
the government subsidy system.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.460
So, like always, pause this video,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.500
and go through that exercise.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.550
It'll be interesting.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.470
All right, now, let's do this together.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.960
So, we have Breadbasket,
and I'll try to write bread,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.550
actually, let me draw
my little matrix first.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.893
So, it's a two by two.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.343
So, almost done with my matrix.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.910
And one more.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.090
That wasn't near the middle.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.950
There you go, right around there.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.840
Still, maybe there.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.740
And then we have that there.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.630
And then we have high, low, high, low,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.043
and then you have Quicklunch.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.530
If I were actually doing this on the test

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.920
maybe I'd write this a little bit lower

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.363
so it's a little bit neater,
and then this is Breadbasket.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.360
And let's see.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.630
It's giving a daily subsidy of $20.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.500
So, if we could just do
that, that adds to the profit

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.740
of a firm that is selling at low prices.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.210
So, if they're both at high prices,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.270
that's not, they're not going to be able

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.230
to get that subsidy from the government.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.633
So, we're still going to be at 105 and 110

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.300
for Breadbasket and
Quicklunch respectively.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.400
Now, if Breadbasket stays
high in this situation,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.857
well then, they're still
only going to make $40.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.460
But in this situation right over here

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.980
Quicklunch is going to get a $20 subsidy

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.910
because they are choosing to go low.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.130
So, they're going to make 130 plus 20.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.550
So, I'll write that in a different color.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.890
So, I will put that in
and I'll put this in red.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.500
So, 130 plus 20.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.200
They're going to make $150
because they're choosing

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.240
to go low price here.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.170
That's what qualifies you for the subsidy,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.940
and in this situation if
Breadbasket goes low price

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.340
they're going to make 120,
what they would have made

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.140
in that situation, plus 20.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.170
So, this is going to be 140.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.950
But this is a situation
where Quicklunch is charging

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.220
a high price.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.090
So, they're not going to get the subsidy.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.530
So they're still going to make $80.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.440
And then this cell is both
of them charging a low price.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.800
So they're both gonna get
$20 more than what you see

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.860
right over here.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.480
So, Breadbasket would make $95, $95,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.480
and Quicklunch is going to
make $90 in this situation.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.980
And let's see, they ask us more questions.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.070
They say using your redrawn payoff matrix

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.430
answer each of the following.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.230
Would Quicklunch choose to set
a high price or a low price?

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.870
Explain using specific values
from your redrawn matrix.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.603
So, pause the video and
see if you can answer that.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.420
All right, so we're going
to look at Quicklunch now,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.650
and we could do the same type of analysis

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.950
to see if they have a dominant strategy.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.950
We could say, okay, if
Breadbasket goes high, goes high,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.400
what is Quicklunch going to do?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.740
So, if Breadbasket goes
high, now in this situation

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.870
Quicklunch will either
go high and make $110

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.000
or it could go low and make 150.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.460
So Quicklunch is going to
go low in this situation,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.536
and if Breadbasket goes
low Quicklunch canmake $80

00:09:57.536 --> 00:10:00.460
if it goes high or it could
make $90 if it goes low.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.220
So once again, Quicklunch
is going to go low.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.817
So, Quicklunch, Quicklunch now has

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.980
dominant, dominant strategy

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.860
for low price, for low price.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.020
And I could try to explain this out.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.630
If Breadbasket goes high,
I'll write it out here.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.320
Normally you have a little
book to write this in, but,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.017
if bread, I'll abbreviate,
Breadbasket goes high

00:10:42.695 --> 00:10:47.695
Quicklunch is rational to
make $150 instead of 110,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.807
would want to make

00:10:58.167 --> 00:11:02.850
$150 versus 110

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.233
by going low.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.677
If Breadbasket goes low,

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.830
goes low, Quicklunch makes

00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:26.993
$90 versus, versus $80

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.670
by going low.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.110
All right, would the profits
for Breadbasket increase,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.100
decrease, or stay the same?

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.010
Explain with a comparison to
your answer in part B one.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.640
Use specific values.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.710
So, before subsidy,
actually pause this video

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.620
and try to do this as well.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.370
Before subsidy, oh, now
we'll do it together.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.370
Before subsidy, Quicklunch,
or I should say Breadbasket,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.020
Breadbasket was making,
and we have it up here.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.500
So, if the two shops do not
cooperate on setting prices,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.730
what will be the profit of each shop?

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.330
We saw Breadbasket would make $120,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.320
'cause that was that
Nash equilibrium state.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.763
After subsidy, after subsidy,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.810
so, let's look at it.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.810
We still have, Breadbasket
still has a dominant strategy

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.830
to go low, because if Quicklunch goes high

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.530
Breadbasket would wanna
make the 140 instead of 105,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.400
and if Quicklunch goes low
Breadbasket would wanna make 95

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.290
instead of 40.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.980
But now they both have a
dominant strategy for going low.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.530
So, we're going to end
up in this bottom right,

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.630
this bottom right cell.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.630
After subsidy, both have
dominant, dominant strategy

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:03.200
to go low, resulting

00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:08.063
in $95 profit

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.430
for Breadbasket.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.730
And so, $95 is less than $120.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.390
So, Breadbasket's profit goes,
or I should say it decreases,

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.313
decreases, and we are done.
