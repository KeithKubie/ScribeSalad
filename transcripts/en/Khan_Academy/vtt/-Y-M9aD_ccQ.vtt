00:00:00.614 --> 00:00:02.885
- I took some screen captures from the

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:07.464
Khan Academy exercise on
correlation coefficient intuition.

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:09.600
They've given us some
correlation coefficients

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.428
and we have to match them to the various

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.670
scatterplots on that exercise.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.901
There's a little interface
where we can drag

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:15.763
these around in a table to match them

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:17.667
to the different scatterplots.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.572
The point isn't to figure out how exactly

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:22.405
to calculate these, we'll
do that in the future,

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:25.279
but really to get an intuition
of we are trying to measure.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.422
The main idea is that
correlation coefficients

00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:31.626
are trying to measure
how well a linear model

00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:35.965
can describe the relationship
between two variables.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:37.827
For example,

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:43.348
let me do some coordinate axes here.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.724
Let's say that's one variable.

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:47.675
Say that's my y variable

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.230
and let's say that is my x variable.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.019
Let's say when x is low, y is low.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.831
When x is a little higher,
y is a little higher.

00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.294
When x is a little bit
higher, y is higher.

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:00.845
When x is really high, y is even higher.

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:05.333
A linear model would
describe it very, very well.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.304
It's quite easy to draw a line

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.635
that essentially goes
through those points.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.489
So something like this
would have an r of 1,

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:15.560
r is equal to one.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.629
A linear model perfectly describes it

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.742
and it's a positive correlation.

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:22.273
When one increases, when
one variable gets larger,

00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:24.114
then the other variable is larger.

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:26.258
When one variable is
smaller then other variable

00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:28.167
is smaller and vice versa.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:30.572
Now what would an r of
negative one look like?

00:01:30.572 --> 00:01:32.195
Well, that would once again be a situation

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:34.006
where a linear model works really well

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:35.424
but when one variable moves up,

00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:37.510
the other one moves down and vice versa.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.742
Let me draw my coordinates,

00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:43.525
my coordinate axes again.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.222
I'm gonna try to draw a dataset where the

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:49.821
r would be negative one.

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:53.495
Maybe when y is high, x is very low.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:57.093
When y becomes lower, x become higher.

00:01:57.093 --> 00:01:58.788
When y becomes a good bit lower,

00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:00.901
x becomes a good bit higher.

00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:04.691
Once again, when y decreases,

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.987
x increases or as x
increases, y decreases.

00:02:07.987 --> 00:02:10.216
They're moving in opposite directions

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:13.162
but you can fit a line
very easily to this.

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.596
The line would look something like this.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:21.365
This would have an r of negative one,

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:24.221
and r of zero, r is equal to zero,

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:26.752
would be a dataset which a line

00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:29.144
doesn't really fit very well at all.

00:02:29.144 --> 00:02:30.557
I'll do that one really small,

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.395
since I don't have much space here.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.410
An r of zero might look

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.157
something like this.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.505
Maybe I'll have a data point here,

00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:41.734
maybe have a data point here,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.336
maybe I have one there.

00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:46.556
There, there.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.660
And it wouldn't necessarily
be this well organized

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.178
but this gives you a sense of things.

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:54.491
How would you actually
try to fit a line here?

00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:57.370
You could equally justify
a line that looks like that

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.228
or a line that looks like that,

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:01.498
or a line that looks like that.

00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:06.336
A linear model really does not describe

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:08.982
the relationship between
the two variables that well,

00:03:08.982 --> 00:03:10.377
right over here.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:12.048
So with that, is a primer.

00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:14.721
Let's see if we can
tackle these scatterplots.

00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:15.815
The way I'm gonna do it is I'm just gonna

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.556
try to eyeball what a linear
model might look like.

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:21.017
There's different methods of
trying to fit a linear model

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:22.969
to a dataset, an imperfect dataset.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.201
I drew very perfect ones, at least for the

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:26.130
r equals negative one and r equals one

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.695
but these are what the real
world actually looks like.

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:31.846
Very few times will things
perfectly sit on a line.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:35.282
For scatterplot A, if I
were to try to fit a line,

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:39.185
it would look something like that.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.090
If I were to try to
minimize distances from

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.379
the points to the line,
I do see a general trend

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.529
if we look at these data points over here,

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.629
when y is high, x is low.

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.270
When x is larger, y is smaller.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.296
Looks like r is going
to be less than zero,

00:03:56.296 --> 00:03:58.179
and a reasonable bit less than zero.

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.268
It's going to approach this thing here.

00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:02.056
If we look at our choices,

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:04.171
it wouldn't be r equals 0.65.

00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:06.982
These are positive so I wouldn't
use that one or that one.

00:04:06.982 --> 00:04:08.979
And this one is almost no correlation.

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.531
R equals negative 0.02, this
is pretty close to zero.

00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:17.451
I feel good with r is
equal to negative 0.72.

00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:22.173
I wanna be clear, if I didn't
have these choices here,

00:04:22.173 --> 00:04:23.370
I wouldn't just be able to say,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.660
just looking at these data points without

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.937
being able to do a calculation,

00:04:25.937 --> 00:04:28.237
that r is equals to negative 0.72.

00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:30.350
I'm just basing it on
the intuition that it is

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.439
a negative correlation,
it seems pretty strong.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.663
The pattern kind of jumps out at you,

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:37.669
that when y is large, x is small.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.643
When x is large, y is small.

00:04:39.643 --> 00:04:41.407
So I like something that's approaching

00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:42.475
r equals negative one.

00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:44.299
I've used this one up already.

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.415
Now scatterplot B, if I were
to just try to eyeball it,

00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:48.737
once again this is gonna be imperfect.

00:04:48.737 --> 00:04:50.432
But the trend, if I were
to try to fit a line,

00:04:50.432 --> 00:04:52.032
it looks something like that.

00:04:52.032 --> 00:04:54.562
It looks like a line
fits in reasonably well.

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:56.645
There's some points that
would still be hard to fit.

00:04:56.645 --> 00:04:58.692
They're still pretty far from the line.

00:04:58.692 --> 00:05:00.726
It looks like it's a positive correlation.

00:05:02.076 --> 00:05:05.373
When y is small, x is
relatively small and vice versa.

00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:09.608
As x grows, y grows and
when y grows, x grows.

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:11.573
This ones going to be positive

00:05:11.573 --> 00:05:13.219
and it looks like it would
be reasonably positive.

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:14.335
I have two choices here.

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:16.536
I don't know which of
these it's going to be.

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:19.928
It's either going to be r is equal to 0.65

00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:24.009
or r is equal to 0.84.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.568
I also got scatterplot C,
this ones all over the place.

00:05:26.568 --> 00:05:28.952
It kinda looks like what we did over here.

00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:30.685
What does a line look like?

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:31.767
You could almost imagine anything.

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:34.033
Does it look like that?

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.201
Does a line look like that?

00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:39.170
There's not a direction
that you could say,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.071
"Well, as x increases, maybe
y increases or decreases."

00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:43.627
There's no rhyme or reason here,

00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:46.251
so this looks very non-correlated.

00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:48.688
So this one is pretty close to zero.

00:05:48.688 --> 00:05:49.755
I feel pretty good that this is the

00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:53.680
r is equal to negative .02.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.489
In fact, if we tried
probably the best line

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:57.161
that could be fit, would be one with

00:05:57.161 --> 00:05:59.365
a slight negative slope.

00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:01.216
It might look something like this.

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:04.471
And notice, even when
we try to fit a line,

00:06:04.471 --> 00:06:06.584
there's all sorts of points
that are way off the line.

00:06:06.584 --> 00:06:08.860
So the linear model did
not fit it that well.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.593
R is equal to negative 0.02,

00:06:13.224 --> 00:06:14.757
So we'll use that one.

00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:16.220
Now we have scatterplot D.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.008
That's gonna use one of the
other positive correlations

00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:21.351
and it does look like there
is a positive correlation.

00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.146
When y is low, x is low.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:27.107
When x is high, y is high and vice versa.

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:28.987
We could try to fit something that looks

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:31.281
something like that.

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.817
But it's still not as good as that one.

00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:36.253
You can see the points
that we're trying to fit,

00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:39.178
there's several points that
are still pretty far away

00:06:39.178 --> 00:06:41.518
from our model.

00:06:42.197 --> 00:06:44.029
The model is not fitting it that well,

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.698
so I would say scatterplot
B is a better fit.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.136
A linear model works
better for scatterplot B

00:06:49.136 --> 00:06:50.577
than it works for scatterplot D.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.827
I would give the higher r to scatterplot B

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:58.076
and the lower r, r equals
0.65, to scatterplot D.

00:06:58.076 --> 00:07:01.256
R is equal to 0.65.

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:03.092
Once again that's because
with a linear model

00:07:03.092 --> 00:07:06.382
it looks like there's a
trend but there's several

00:07:06.382 --> 00:07:09.510
more data points are way off the line

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.534
in scatterplot D than in
the case of scatterplot B.

00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:14.206
There's a few that are
still way off the line

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:17.776
but these are even more
off of the line in D.
