In conclusion...

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:09.075 align:start position:0%
the evidence clearly
points to guilt.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.044 align:start position:0%
The prosecution rests.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.951
(TV sitcom theme music playing)

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:32.031
Whoo!
(music stops)

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:35.068
That was already fun,
wasn't it? Right?

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
Did everybody feel
happy just now?

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:39.505 align:start position:0%
You remember?

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.707
I know I did.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.177
We've heard an awful lot
from the prosecution

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.812
over the last few weeks,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.347
about stuff that may

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.850
or may not have happened.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.686
(scoffs)
All these women.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.557
Same story.
Same facts.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.926
(chuckles)
Repetitive.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.361
And how'd that feel
to listen to?

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.564
Bleh, right?

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:07.801 align:start position:0%
But how do you feel
when I play this?

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.705 align:start position:0%
("Dr. Huxtable")
<i>Theo, did you get
your ear pierced?</i>

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:13.906 align:start size:41% position:59% line:83%
("Theo")
<i> Uh, nope.</i>

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:13.906 align:start position:0%
<i>So, I guess</i>

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start position:0%
<i>you're just doing an
amazing impression</i>

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.409 align:start position:0%
<i>of Swiss cheese?</i>

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.844
(laughter)

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:23.850
Did anyone feel
raped by that?

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.051
How 'bout drugged?

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.919
No?
Me neither.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:30.556
I felt comforted by a
familiar father figure.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.658
Nostalgia.

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.262
Happiness.
Laughter. Not guilty!

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.064
Let's break this
down logically.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:41.334
I am a good person.
I like this good show.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.003
Like, last time I checked,
good plus good

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.571
did not equal guilty.

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.740 align:start size:59% position:41%
Objection, what did
she even check?

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.675 align:start position:0%
I just checked!

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:52.678 align:start size:75% position:25%
Defense is talking about
a TV show she likes.

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.082
I'm talking about a
beloved show that<i> we</i> love.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.950
Overruled.

00:01:57.983 --> 00:02:00.920
I mean, I'm basically talking
about Dr. Huxtable, right?

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:01.954
We are not!

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:03.322 align:start position:0%
I said "basically."

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:04.557
Overruled.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.058
(scoffs)

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.593 align:start size:69% position:31%
Seems like we're gonna
be here a while

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.530 align:start size:44% position:56%
with all these
objections.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.798
Would anybody like...

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:13.966
a pudding pop?

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.134 line:85%
(jurors gasp)

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.134 align:start position:0%
Oh, wow.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.137 align:start position:0%
Would you look at that?
It's unanimous.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.839 align:start size:66% position:34%
How could the face of
such a yummy treat

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start size:66% position:34%
even do anything bad?

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:23.309
I mean, how would
that even work?

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.744
Objection!

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.846
Overruled.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.949
(sighs)
Delicious treat, right?

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.017
Cold though.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.519
Look under
your seats.

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:36.522
What a fun snack.
What a fun sweater.

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:38.357 align:start size:66% position:34%
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this point,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.127 align:start size:78% position:22%
Bill Cosby probably can't
get in any legal trouble.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.728 align:start position:0%
That's not what
this is about.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:46.532
This is about us
not punishing ourselves

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:49.202
for loving great comedy.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:53.005
This is a court of
public opinion, right?

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:55.141
Let's remind ourselves
what's at stake here.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:58.077
If convicted, the next time
you put on a rerun

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.614
of "The Cosby Show,"
you may wince a little.

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.950
You might feel
a little pang.

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.718
And none of us
deserve that.

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.386
We don't deserve
to feel that pang.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.123
We deserve to dance like
no one's watching.

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:15.862
And watch like
no one's raping.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.933
The defense rests.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:23.336 align:start size:72% position:28%
(judge)
All right, I think,
um, before we adjourn--

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.205 align:start position:0%
Uh, excuse me, I got
a delivery for the jury.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.873 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh!

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.873
It's from a B. Cosby.

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:30.076 align:start position:0%
You can put it right here.
Nobody minds.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.779
Oh, my God.
It's chocolate cake.

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:35.915 align:start position:0%
Huh, do we all feel like
going a little nuts right now?

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:37.583
I know I do.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:41.387
