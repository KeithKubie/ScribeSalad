00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.900
What I want to do in this
video is review what we

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.540
learned from our chemistry
classes about oxidation and

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.450
the opposite of oxidation,
reduction.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.510
And then see how what we learned
in our chemistry class

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.100
relates to the way that a
biologist or biochemist might

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.960
use these words.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.270
And hopefully we'll see that
they're the same thing.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.450
So just as a bit of review, if
you watched the chemistry

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.490
playlist. Oxidation, you can
view it-- and actually there's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.955
a famous mnemonic for it.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:35.980
It's: OIL RIG Where the oil
tells us that oxidation is

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.940
losing-- I put it in quotes
because you're not necessarily

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.430
losing the electrons; I'll
show you what I mean-- is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.380
losing electrons.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.630
This is what you should
have learned in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.650
your chemistry class.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.020
And then you also learned that
reduction is gaining.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.920
And I'll put that in
quotes as well.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.870
Is gaining electrons.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.180
And I put that in quotes because
you're not necessarily

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.400
gaining electrons.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.860
You're more hogging it.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.180
And the reason why it's called
reduction, is because if you

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.400
are gaining electrons your
notional charge, if you really

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940
were gaining them,
is being reduced.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.390
And the reason why this is
called oxidizing is because

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.000
you tend to lose electrons
to oxygen.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.920
Although it doesn't
have to be oxygen.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.820
It could be any molecule
that will hog

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.840
electrons away from you.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.150
And I think a nice example would
be fair to kind of make

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.760
this a little bit
more concrete.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.770
Let's say I took some molecular
hydrogen, it's in a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.180
gaseous state, and I were to
combust that with some

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.030
molecular oxygen.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.950
This is what happened
on the Hindenburg.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.470
They filled a balloon full of
hydrogen and you get a little

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.630
bit of spark, expose it to
oxygen, and you're going to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.050
have a big explosion.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.040
But in the process, for every
mole of molecular oxygen, if

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.060
you have two moles of molecular
hydrogen-- I'm just

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.070
making sure the equation is
balanced-- you're going to

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.070
produce two moles of H2O
plus a ton of heat.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.440
This thing is really
going to blow.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.229
What I want to do, I mean
we could talk about the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.190
Hindenburg but really, the whole
reason why I even wrote

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.530
this is, I want to show you what
is getting oxidized and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.600
what is getting reduced.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.760
So in this situation right
here on the hydrogen, the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.630
molecular hydrogen just
looks like this.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.660
You have a hydrogen-hydrogen
bond.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.540
They're each sharing an electron
with the other one so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.840
that they both can pretend
their 1s orbital

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.260
is completely filled.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.180
So they're not losing electrons
to each other.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.490
They're not hogging electrons
one from the other.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.500
So we say that they have a
neutral oxidative state.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.410
They haven't gained
or lost electrons.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.530
They're just sharing them.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.690
And the same thing is true
for the molecular oxygen.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.920
And here you actually
have a double bond

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.890
with the two oxygens.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.310
But they're both oxygens, so
there's no reason why one

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.240
would gain or lose electrons
from the other.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.590
But when you go on this side
of the equation, something

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.440
interesting happens.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.080
You have, for every oxygen is
connected to two hydrogens.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.780
And the way to think about is
that oxygen is hogging each of

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.640
these hydrogen's electrons.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.280
So hydrogen has this one
electron on its valence shell.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.910
The deal with most covalent
bonding is, hey, I give you an

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.910
electron, you give me an
electron and we both have a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.930
complete pair.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.160
But we know, or hopefully we
can review, that oxygen is

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.510
much more electronegative
than hydrogen.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.190
This is a little bit of glucose
that's left over from

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.150
our cellular restoration
video.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.060
You can ignore it for now but
I'm going to connect all this

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.870
in a future video.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.990
But if we look at our periodic
table, if you remember from

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.510
the chemistry playlist,
electronegativity increases as

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.470
we go to the top right of
the periodic table.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.210
These are the most
electronegative elements over

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.680
here, these are the least
electronegative.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.240
And all electronegative means
is, likes to hog electrons.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.190
So even though oxygen and
hydrogen are in a covalent

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.950
bond in water-- they're sharing
electrons-- oxygen is

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.580
more electronegative, much
more electronegative than

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.740
hydrogen, so it's going
to hog the electrons.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.019
And actually if you take some
elements on this side and you

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.890
bond them with some guys over
here, these guys are so much

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.080
more electronegative than these
left-hand elements that

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.100
they'll actually completely
steal the electron, not just

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.130
hog it for most of the time.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.990
But when you talk
electronegativity, it just

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.410
means, likes the electrons.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.800
So when you look at this bond
between hydrogen and oxygen,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.300
we saw from the periodic table,
oxygen is a lot more

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.280
electronegative, so the
electrons spend a lot more

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.880
time on oxygen.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.190
We learned about hydrogen
bonding.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.780
We learned that it creates a
partial negative charge on

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.630
that side of the water molecule
and creates partial

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.810
positive charges on this side.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.760
And electrons still show
up around the hydrogens

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.930
every now and then.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.460
When you talk about oxidation
and reduction you say, look

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.130
there's no partial charge.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.110
If one guy is kind of hogging
the electron more, for the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.890
sake of oxidation states, we're
going to assume that he

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.470
took the electron.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.580
So for an oxidation state, we'll
assume that the oxygen

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.220
in water takes the electron
and we'll give him an

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.740
oxidation state of one minus.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.600
Or the convention is, you write
the charge after the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.960
number for oxidation states.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.680
So you don't confuse it
with actual charges.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.210
So this has a one minus because,
from an oxidation

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.110
state point of view, it's
taking the electron.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.620
It's gaining the elctron.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.950
That's why I put it in quotes.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.360
Because you're not really
gaining it.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.160
You're just gaining it
most of the time.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.190
You're hogging electrons.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.370
And likewise, this hydrogen--
let me be careful, this

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.440
isn't-- he got one electron from
this hydrogen and you got

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.950
another electron from
this hydrogen.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.890
So instead of saying one minus,
it should be two minus.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.590
It should be two minus, because
he's hogging one

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.140
electron from here and one
electron from there.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.570
And in general, when oxygen is
bonding with other non-oxygen

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.980
atoms or non-oxygen elements,
it tends to have a two minus

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.050
or a negative two
oxidation state.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.850
So if this guy's two
minus, because

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.250
he's gained two electrons.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.870
Let me write that in quotes.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.710
Gained two electrons.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.920
We know that he really didn't
gain them, that he's just

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.840
hogging them.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.790
These guys lost an
electron each.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.240
So this guy's oxidation state
is going to be one plus.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.840
And this guy's oxidation state
is going to be one plus.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.930
So you could say, by combusting
the hydrogen with

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.060
the oxygen, that the hydrogens--
before they had a

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.120
zero oxygen state, each of these
hydrogens had a zero

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.410
oxygen state-- now they have
a one plus oxidation state

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.660
because they lost their
electrons when they bonded

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.660
with the oxygen.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.540
So we say that these hydrogens
have been oxidized.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:05.270
So, due to this reaction,
hydrogen has been oxidized.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.880
Why has it been oxidized?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.720
Because before, it was
able to share its

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.240
electrons very nicely.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.210
But then it bonds with oxygen,
which will hog its electrons.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.780
So the hydrogen is losing its
electrons to the oxygen, so

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.320
it's been oxidized.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.270
Similarly, the oxygen, due to
this combustion reaction, has

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.070
been reduced.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.130
Why has it been reduced?

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.850
Here it was just sharing
electrons.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.330
It wasn't losing
or gaining it.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.590
But here when it's bonded with
an element with much lower

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.460
electronegativity, all of a
sudden it can start hogging

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.450
the electrons, it
gains electrons.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.785
So this hypothetical charge
is reduced by two.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.050
And if I wanted to actually
account for all of the

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.170
electrons, because we're talking
about losing electrons

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.710
and gaining electrons, we can
write two half reactions.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.280
This should all be a little
bit of review from your

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.030
chemistry class.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.780
But it never hurts to
see this again.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.000
I'm going to throw this in the
biology playlist so that you

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.270
biology people can hopefully
refresh your

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.010
memory with this stuff.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.440
We can write two
half reactions.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.840
We could say that we started
off with two moles of

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.150
molecular hydrogen.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.150
And they have no oxidation
states, or they're neutral.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.010
So I could write a zero
there if I want.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.020
And then I end up with-- on the
other side-- I end up with

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.340
two moles of H2.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.760
But each of the hydrogens
now, have a plus

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.010
one oxidation state.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.580
Or another way to think about it
is, each of these-- there's

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.940
four hydrogens here.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.380
This is molecular hydrogen has
two hydrogens and we have two

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.050
moles of this.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.650
So there are four
hydrogens here.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.480
Each of the four hydrogens
lost an electron.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.160
So I can write this.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.530
So, plus four electrons.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.460
That's the half reaction
for hydrogen.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.640
It lost four electrons.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.300
So this is another way of
saying that hydrogen is

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.000
oxidized because it
lost electrons.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.200
OIL: oxidation is losing.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.470
And then the other half
reaction, if I were to write

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.750
the oxygen.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.640
So I'm starting with a mole of
molecular oxygen and I'm

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.570
adding to that four electrons.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.970
I can't make electrons
out of nowhere.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.040
I'm getting the electrons from
the hydrogen, I'm adding to

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.240
the oxygen.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.560
And so the half reaction on this
side, I end up with two

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.650
moles-- I could write it like
this-- two moles of oxygen.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.840
And each of them have an
oxidation state of two minus.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.080
So these are the
half reactions.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.630
And all this is showing is that
the hydrogen, over the

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.310
course of this combustion
reaction, lost electrons.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.830
And that the oxygen gained the
electrons that the hydrogen

00:09:53.830 --> 00:10:02.370
lost. So this tells us that
oxygen is reduced.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.120
Now this is all fair and good
and this is all a bit of

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.410
review of what you learned
in chemistry class.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.520
But now I'm going to make things
even more confusing.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.770
Because I'm going to introduce
you to how a biologist

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.730
thinks about it.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.350
So-- and it's not
always the case.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.440
Sometimes the biologist will use
the definition you learned

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.720
in your chemistry class.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.710
But a biologist-- or many
times in many biology

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.915
textbooks-- they'll say-- and
this used to confuse me to no

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:39.220
end, really-- that oxidation is
losing hydrogen atoms. And

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:52.210
reduction is gaining
hydrogen atoms.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.570
And at first when I got exposed
to this, I was like, I

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.190
learned it in chemistry class
and they talk about electrons.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.280
Hydrogen atoms, you know it's a
proton and an electron, how

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.130
does it relate?

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.550
And the reason why these two
definitions-- this is really

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.460
the whole point of this video--
the reason why this

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.580
definition is consistent with
this one is because in the

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:21.190
biological world hydrogen
is what tends

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.230
to get swapped around.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:27.970
And it tends to bond with
carbon, oxygen,

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.500
phosphorous, nitrogen.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.570
And if we look at the periodic
table, and we see where

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.840
hydrogen is, and we see where
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.700
phosphorous and really all this
other stuff is, you see

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.840
that all of the stuff that in
biological systems, hydrogen

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.570
tends to bond with, the things
it tends to bond with are

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.920
much, much more electronegative.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.270
So if a carbon is bonding with
a hydrogen, the carbon is

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.740
hogging that electron.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.610
And then if that hydrogen gets
transferred to an oxygen,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.260
along with the electron, the
carbon will lose the hydrogen

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.220
atom, but it really lost
the electron that

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.450
it was hogging before.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.940
And now the oxygen can
hog that electron.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.990
So these are really consistent
definitions.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.690
And the whole reason why I
showed you this example is

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.760
because the biological
definition doesn't apply here.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.900
I mean, you could say, well,
oxygen is definitely gaining

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.650
hydrogens in this reaction.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.000
So we can definitely say that
oxygen is being reduced still,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.110
according to the biological
definition.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.780
But you can't really say
that hydrogen is

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.740
losing hydrogens here.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.840
In this situation, hydrogen
is just losing electrons.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.290
It's not losing itself.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.120
I guess you could say it's
losing itself because it's

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.090
being taken over.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.920
But the biological definition
just comes

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.830
from the same notion.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.450
That when hydrogen bonds with
most things in biological

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.520
compounds, it tends to
give the electrons.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.740
So if a carbon loses a hydrogen
and gives it to an

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.940
oxygen, the carbon will lose
that hydrogen's electron that

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.170
it was able to hog.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.850
And now the oxygen
is hogging it.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.500
So the carbon would be oxidized
and the oxygen would

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.370
be reduced.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.310
Hope that doesn't confuse you.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.820
In the next video I'll show you
a couple more examples.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.630
And the whole reason why I'm
doing this is to apply this to

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.090
cellular respiration.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.350
So that you don't get confused
when people talk and say that,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:20.710
oh the NAD is being reduced when
it picks up the hydrogen.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.310
Or it's being oxidized when it
loses the hydrogen, and so

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.980
forth and so on.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.030
I wanted you to see that these
are the same definitions that

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.540
you learned in your
chemistry class.
