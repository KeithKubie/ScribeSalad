00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 276, and I hope you didn't work this out

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
by counting them all.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's an easy way to solve the value of the totient when n is prime,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and that is if n is prime, that means that all of the positive integers

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
less than n are relatively prime to n,

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so the totient of n is n-1 for prime number n.
