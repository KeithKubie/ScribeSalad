1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,830
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N Y s t e

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,350
n n p r I am Jad Abumrad.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,440
I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and
today my name is Peter Lang Stanton.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,280
My name is Nick Faraga. Well we're gonna
get a story from two reporters. Um,

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,270
I'm a freelance film
maker, freelance reporter,

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,180
writer slash radio
producer to many slashes.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,240
It's a story that goes
back about 70 years. It's,

8
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,360
it all feels like unreal in some way,

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,860
but there's something about
this story that just is,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,420
you hear it and you can't help but think
about now. Yeah. Should we start with,

11
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,340
with air currents or like go with,

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,080
I mean I I want to start with can we go
to Thermopolis Wyoming cause that was,

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,330
that was one of the first really well
documented landings. Thermopolis, Wyoming.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,420
Well it's the first week of December, 1944

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,200
this is Ross Cohen. He's a
historian and he wrote a book.

16
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,960
That's pretty much the definitive account
of the story you're about to hear.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,930
Any health Thermopolis,
Wyoming, December, 1944

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,440
and there are three liners at a
place called the highline coal mine,

19
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:11,730
which is outside of Dimopoulos. They
step outside the mine one evening.

20
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:16,690
It's just about dusk and just
as they step out of the mind,

21
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:20,600
they hear this whistling sound over
their heads and then a moment later,

22
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,543
yes,

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,400
a tremendous explosion and they see this
rising cloud of dust about a mile away

24
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:35,300
across the valley. They turn and look.

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,210
It's dusk and so in the fading twilight,

26
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,490
they can't be sure exactly
what they're looking at,

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,470
but above them there's sort
of this fluttering white
circle just floating there.

28
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,050
They made sense of it by thinking it was

29
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,430
parachutists. They watched this parachute
as it's drifting away from them.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,110
They get in their car and they chase
after it until eventually they lose sight

31
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:57,880
of it in the dark.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,550
Yes. Right around that same time,

33
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,520
about 500 miles away in Colorado, a boy
and his dad are working in the barn.

34
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,920
When they hear an explosion, they
run outside and in their yard.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,140
There's just this smoldering crater

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,100
in Wyoming, a nine year old
boy playing in his front yard.

37
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:21,390
Here's an explosion all throughout
the winter of 1944 in Burwell,

38
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:26,280
Nebraska. Strange parachute thing.
Native residents here, a loud explosion,

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,730
just start appearing in

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,200
the skies all over America, Napa,
California, lame deer, Montana,

41
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:36,880
20 or so miles from downtown Detroit
over farms, Nogales, Arizona,

42
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,260
slipping behind hills, Rigby, Idaho.
Everybody who sees these things,

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,220
all of them have different explanations
for what they think they're witnessing.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,550
They think it's a plane
crash, an oil tank exploding.

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,000
The U s military sends out an APB
to local police station saying,

46
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,030
we need information. What are these
things? Try again. Testing, testing. Ah,

47
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,850
there we go. Okay. Hello. Hello.
Enter Sheriff Warren. Hide. Uh,

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,700
my name is Marianne hide.

49
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,800
Warren hide actually died in 1989
so I'm the oldest son of sheriff.

50
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,920
We talked to his son. He had
a presence about him, the to,

51
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,120
he kind of commanded a room. Sheriff
Hyde was a big guy, black wavy hair,

52
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,110
brought out the shoulder,

53
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:21,700
narrow at the hips that's in gun on
his hip and one day he's at his office,

54
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:26,200
north of Salt Lake City. When his
phone rings, from what I understand,

55
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,110
a dry farmer called, he said,

56
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:31,540
there's this strange
contraption in my field,

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,050
some kind of balloon parachute
looking thing floating around.

58
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:38,190
So he jumped in the car and uh,

59
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,830
went hell bent for leather
out into the Blue Creek area.

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,940
There's this crazy story where he rushes
out to this farm to investigate hops

61
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,630
out of his car,

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,630
rips off his belt with this 38 pistol
because a man can run with a 38 pistol on

63
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,100
his waist and took off after the bloom.

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,760
Here's what he sees in that field. It was,

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,180
I mean if you look at a picture of
this thing, it's this huge globe,

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,150
30 feet in diameter. Oh Wow. Paper, White,

67
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,660
and then coming down from this globe
or these thick 40 foot ropes and at the

68
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,410
bottom attached to it is a,
is a heavy metal chandelier

69
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,960
with bombs hanging off the
bottom and sheriff hide.

70
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,510
He sees this thing,
runs out into the field,

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,390
grabs onto the ropes to maybe tie it down,

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,400
but just as he grabbed
that Augusta wind comes by,

73
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,940
lifts him up off the ground like he was
papered off and so he's dangling from

74
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,380
the ropes of this thing.
The balloon is above him,

75
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:41,381
the explosives or are below him and it
takes him across this canyon and he's

76
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:45,980
holding on just dangling from it,
still trying to wrangle it like,

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,740
like some bucking Bronco. He lands again,

78
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:51,500
he tries to tie it to a
juniper Bush or something,

79
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:55,790
but the wind catches it again and goes
back over the canyon back to the first

80
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,360
time, back to the first sign they
started to float around the field.

81
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,000
He kept wrestling this
balloon for a long time.

82
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,000
He's nauseous from being
spun around on this balloon.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,690
His Vision's getting blurry, his
hands are becoming raw from the rope,

84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,210
but he feels this like sense of duty.

85
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,810
He knew that the government wanted
one of these balloons, his territory.

86
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,610
So he's got to take it down. That's ride.

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,810
He finally lets himself free
fall so he can grab it again.

88
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,420
So his weight will jerk
the balloon to the ground.

89
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Then finally the balloon came down in
kind of a little ravine where a sage rush

90
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,190
were growing and a root had been
exposed on the side of the ravine from a

91
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,040
sagebrush and he hooks his
arm around this, this route.

92
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,960
Then he was able to hold the balloon
without being carried into the air here.

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,820
So we actually captured the thing. Yeah.

94
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,970
J Edgar Hoover wrote him a
personal letter of thanks.

95
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:50,971
They ended up shipping all of the evidence
off to the Aberdeen Military Research

96
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,180
Facility where they had gathered all
this different evidence from all over the

97
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:59,720
country. And after looking
at this stuff for awhile,

98
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,040
they were able to tell that apparently
this bomb was not of any particular, uh,

99
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,080
American make and match known
characteristics of Japanese bombs.

100
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,660
So it's Japanese. Yeah,

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
but it's impossible to send a balloon
across the Pacific Ocean at this point.

102
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,560
I mean, it's never,
never been done. I mean,

103
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,350
it's basically an intercontinental
ballistic missile,

104
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,570
so they're trying to figure
out where it's coming from.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,420
They thought maybe they were
being launched from submarines.

106
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,220
Maybe they were coming from beaches
in North America from saboteurs.

107
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,190
There was even speculation at one
point that maybe they were coming from

108
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,770
Japanese internment
camps in North America.

109
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,350
Then two days before
Christmas, 1944 in Alaska,

110
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,490
a native Alaskan trapper tracks went down
and it has two sandbags still attached

111
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,500
to the bottom most ring,

112
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,830
and that turns out to be the key to
the mystery sand. Yeah. Well, just Sam,

113
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,850
there's a lot in there. My
name is Elisa, Berks Lynne,

114
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,680
and I am a forensic geologist.

115
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,140
We call the Balisa to help
us understand this next part.

116
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,030
What happened was the sand from the
balloons was sent to Washington DC to some

117
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,610
scientists at the US Geological Survey.

118
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,730
Right away they discover
that there's no coral,

119
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,630
so you don't have finding no coral.
You know you're talking cold water.

120
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:25,631
Now they look at the
diatoms marine [inaudible]
microscopic fossils mollusks by

121
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:31,040
compiling all of these different
characteristics, put that all together.

122
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,690
Where would you find these diatoms,

123
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,800
these minerals that you wouldn't find
coral though all those different pieces of

124
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,180
information all together,

125
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,210
the geologists are able to determine that
there are two or perhaps three beaches

126
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,110
in the world that fit all
of these qualifications
where they believe this sand

127
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:52,240
could have come from and all of which
are on the east coast of Honshu,

128
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,590
the largest of Japan's four main islands.

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,750
You can get that kind of specific
from sand. Yup. That kind of specific.

130
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:00,620
Pretty incredible. All right,

131
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,800
so they came all the way from these
particular beaches on the coast of Japan?

132
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,530
Yeah. Six thousands of miles
across the Pacific Ocean.

133
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,740
And why would the Japanese choose to
s to deliver bomb payloads by balloon?

134
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,220
But it's a strange choice in
particularly after Pearl Harbor, they,

135
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,450
we know where, you know
they can do planes. Farragut
planes. Yeah. Why balloons?

136
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,643
Well,

137
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,930
I would can be told history in the making.

138
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,180
It grew directly out
of the Doolittle raid.

139
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,070
Back in April of 1942 United States Navy
aircraft carrier haunted deems westward

140
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,770
across,

141
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,640
represented Jimmy Doolittle and his
Raiders took off from an aircraft carrier

142
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,070
deep in the Western Pacific and dropped
bombs on Tokyo and Yokohama and Kobe and

143
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,260
a number of other cities across Japan.

144
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,830
Great as the fries raid in the
history of aerial warfare. Now,

145
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,200
they didn't do a lot of damage physically,

146
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,420
but it was such a shock to the Japanese

147
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,370
to think that their
homeland could be invaded,

148
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,450
that these planes could actually
fly over the imperial palace.

149
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:05,960
The home of the emperor and do little
went over the palace head is you realize

150
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,860
that? Yeah. He went all the way downtown
in Tokyo. Oh yeah. Right over the city.

151
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,520
And so immediately after the
Doolittle raid, an order went out,

152
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,740
it was just find a way to bomb America.

153
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,383
[inaudible]

154
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,090
no, Japan's navy is stretched so
thin at this point in the war.

155
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,780
There's no way they can pull off
something like the do little rate.

156
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,410
They didn't have aircraft carriers that
could get their planes close enough to

157
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:34,960
the US mainland. But what they did have

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,550
was the wind. Today we
call this the jet stream.

159
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,430
That name didn't come along until
after the war. At that point,

160
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:47,780
we barely knew about the jet stream,
but prior to and during the war,

161
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,740
the Japanese did a extensive
research into these wins. Okay, so

162
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,770
in 1924 there's this meteorologist named
Watson Burrow Ichi and he goes to the

163
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:02,771
top of a mountain and he releases a bunch
of these little paper weather balloons

164
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,310
and he discovers

165
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,780
that at about 30,000 feet up,

166
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,290
there's this river of fast moving air
speeds up to 175 miles an hour carrying

167
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:18,460
anything in its Miss Pollen, insects all
the way to North America within days.

168
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,060
And after the Doolittle raid,

169
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,600
they thought maybe if we were to release
a bunch of balloons in just the right

170
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,430
place at just the right time,

171
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,080
maybe this jet stream of air could push
these balloons across the Pacific Ocean.

172
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,870
[inaudible] so this is Tesco Tanaka.

173
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,960
She was interviewed in this independent
documentary called on-paper wings

174
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,440
[inaudible] in 1944 she says she was a
teenager when the Japanese military came

175
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:49,920
to her school and basically
turned it into a factory.

176
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,560
[inaudible].

177
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,790
She and hundreds of other schoolchildren
were conscripted to begin making this

178
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,840
special kind of paper out of
mulberry wood called [inaudible].

179
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,520
Was she handmade? This traditional paper?

180
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,300
This is my host Sheena, who now works
at the new Burrito Institute in Japan.

181
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,670
Huge amount of paper was required.

182
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,640
My host says that girls would work
12 hour days making thousands,

183
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,860
tens of thousands of these
sheets and gluing them together.

184
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,270
Why didn't they have
adults in the factories?

185
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:21,500
They were all fighting the war or what

186
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,770
young girls have either been
good for that boat. [inaudible]

187
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,090
the girls had a certain
dexterity for the name Burmese,

188
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,260
Nimble fingers.

189
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,390
I think I read that song somewhere
and after they finished producing the

190
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:40,420
balloons and after the balloons
were strapped with bombs,

191
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,510
they were shipped off to
those beaches and just let go.

192
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,980
People from the Japanese side watching
them take off said they like huge

193
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,440
jellyfish swimming
through a pale blue sky.

194
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,650
These perfectly silent vehicles.

195
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:04,700
The only sound was the rustling
of the paper as they took off

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,560
[inaudible].

197
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,610
How many were launched from November,

198
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,930
1944 to April, 1945 they
launched 9,000 balloons. Wow.

199
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,313
[inaudible] no,

200
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,110
the engineers in Japan who designed
this faced a very serious problem.

201
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,260
Once they got the balloons up into the
jet stream and they were cruising along

202
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,800
there floating at speeds from
50 to a hundred miles an hour,

203
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,690
but every night temperatures are going
to fall to minus 40 centigrade and the

204
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,680
fixtures volume of hydrogen inside
that envelope is going to contract.

205
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,130
The balloon is going to lose altitude
drop out of the jet stream and down into

206
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:56,280
the ocean altogether. So to
solve this says Ross, they,

207
00:12:56,281 --> 00:13:00,720
what they did was this, they took 32
sandbags, hung them on the balloon,

208
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,960
and then connected those sandbags to an
altimeter set to a preset and minimum

209
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,710
such as 30,000 feet in the nighttime.

210
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,510
When the balloon loses altitude,
the altimeter will engage,

211
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,740
trigger a fuse,

212
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,430
which cuts off one of those sandbags
and drops it into the ocean.

213
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,490
And now the vehicle will reascend back
into the jet stream because it's lighter

214
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,110
because it's lighter. So these balloons,

215
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:29,040
they're riding the jet stream and then
every night they start to descend.

216
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,630
But then off would go a sandbag and
they'd go back up and whenever they cooled

217
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:38,100
off enough to drop, same
thing drop, then rise, drop,

218
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,310
then rise over and over 32 times
until every sandbag was gone.

219
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,380
Once all the sandbags have been dropped,

220
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,560
now you have only the bombs remaining
and the bombs are held in place with the

221
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:56,670
exact same mechanism as the sandbags.
And now by the very same system,

222
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,680
the bombs are the last to go.

223
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,280
And presumably the balloon is
now somewhere over North America.

224
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,250
Okay, I see. So it's a sandbag countdown,

225
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,460
30209208432 one I hope I'm in Oregon.

226
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,133
Right.

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,750
And when it was in Oregon or wherever
the idea was that it would drop its last

228
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:21,900
bomb Floataway in basically self destruct.

229
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,660
They, I guess figured it would be,

230
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:30,661
it would be more terrifying to have bombs
raining down silently from above with

231
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:34,210
no calling card at all. Then
with a Japanese calling card.

232
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,600
Damn, that was the last sandbag is la.
Now only the central payload is left.

233
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,390
This is audio from a declassified navy
instructional video made about these

234
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,920
balloon bombs in 1945

235
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,010
in the advanced. One of units is found.

236
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,570
Do these two things to render at
Armas explains to soldiers how to,

237
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,750
what to do if they find one of these
bombs and how to diffuse the bomb. No,

238
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,650
but I think the most interesting thing
about the video is this text that's

239
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:08,120
written in huge block letters. Right
at the bottom of the screen it says,

240
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,570
do not aid the enemy by publishing
or broadcasting or discussing

241
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,983
information.

242
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,480
Information can be a powerful tool.

243
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:21,720
It can be a powerful tool for
good and a powerful tool for evil.

244
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,380
This is professor Mike Sweeney and I'm
a historian. I've wartime censorship.

245
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,320
And he says that immediately
after those first balloons landed,

246
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,650
there are a few stories that appear in
the local newspapers in the far west,

247
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,710
stories about a Japanese attack on
the mainland of United States time.

248
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,290
And Newsweek even picked it up
saying, we're not sure what these are,

249
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:44,100
but you know, are these Japanese
spies coming in on these balloons?

250
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,210
Is this a large scale attack?
What is going on? And then

251
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,500
very shortly thereafter, just three days
after those time and Newsweek articles,

252
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,860
the office of censorship
initiated a press blackout.

253
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,770
This blackout on news.

254
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,490
They sent out memos and telegraphs
to all the major wire services,

255
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,010
the UPD P in the ins saying,

256
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,040
keep any news of these Japanese balloons
off the wires and out-of-print any

257
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:14,250
stories about these bombs will have to
be approved by the appropriate authority

258
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,580
or the U s army if you wish to
publish or broadcast news about them.

259
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,230
And why would they want
to keep this secret?

260
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,700
So the government's ideas about why
balloon bombs should be censored.

261
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:26,880
In particular, the army's ideas
were number one, to avoid panic.

262
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,340
These things are instruments
of terror, right?

263
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,910
You can't be afraid of
something you don't know exists.

264
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,210
Number two is a avoid helping Japan.

265
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,390
It was thought then that if we printed
exact coordinates of particular bomb

266
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:47,151
landings that this would help Japan
better target the bombs and what are the

267
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:51,120
reporters think about this. They grumbled
some times, but they complied. Really?

268
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,080
Yup. Everyone in the news industry was
as patriotic as the rest of the country.

269
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,630
That is the vast majority of
journalists supported the war.

270
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,710
And of course if you screwed up and you
sent out a story that got American lives

271
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:04,680
killed, you can be prosecuted under
the espionage act. Furthermore,

272
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,530
can you imagine what your listeners
would do if you're the radio station

273
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:09,990
identified as killing a
hundred American sailors?

274
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,713
Yeah.

275
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,530
So the newspapers and radio
stations kept their mouth shut,

276
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,000
which meant that most Americans
never even heard this was happening.

277
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,830
And more importantly,

278
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,670
the Japanese weren't really hearing
about whether their bombs made it or not.

279
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,070
So they probably concluded that it
was basically a failed experiment,

280
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,100
which largely it was of the 9,000
released virtually none cause any damage.

281
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,660
And certainly not any terror

282
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,753
except

283
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
for this one balloon that's coming up.

284
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,700
Hi, this is well calling

Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

289
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,970
We continue now with our story
from reporters, Peter Link,

290
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,520
Stanton and Nick Farago about, uh,

291
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,550
the 9,000 or so balloon bombs Japan sent
to America in 1944 and 45 that rained

292
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:32,040
down on American soil and created nothing.

293
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,830
Really nothing happened,
no damage, no terror,

294
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,470
nothing. But then we get to this tiny
little town called [inaudible]. To me,

295
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,320
there's no place like old Bli.

296
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,500
Bli Is this sleepy little
logging town at the base of your

297
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,680
Heart Mountain in South Central
Oregon. A lot of pretty scenery.

298
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,040
And Cora Connor, who you just
heard was born and raised there.

299
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,390
You know everybody in here,

300
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,540
they're just like a big family
out there in the forties,

301
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,110
when Cora was a young girl, there were
about 700 people living there. Yeah.

302
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,830
But we did all kinds of fun things.
We had a fish fry up at dog lake,

303
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,240
huge cat fish fry up there. The
whole town stayed all night,

304
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,820
went back home the next
day, and the winner,

305
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:16,500
the canals would freeze over and we to
have bonfire in ice skating parties and

306
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,480
it was a fun place to
live. Tell me about, um,

307
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,230
uh, the morning. Was it a Sunday? Let's
see what happened. I am trying to think.

308
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,970
Saturday, I think May 5th
that's all I can remember. Yup.

309
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,600
That was May 5th, May 5th, 1945.
I thought it was a beautiful day.

310
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:41,601
The Sun was shining bright
and the Reverend Archie
Mitchell and his wife Elsie,

311
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,110
who was five months pregnant with her
first child doing very well at Sunday

312
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,870
school. I went to church
occasionally up there.

313
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,350
They took their Sunday school
class out for a picnic.

314
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,540
There were five children
that went along on that trip,

315
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,770
ages 11 to 14 and one of the
kids, we called him Dickey.

316
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,240
He had a crush on my sister who has
little younger than me and they wanted her

317
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:04,560
to come on this picnic.

318
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:08,880
So Nate came by and stopped the pastor
and his wife stopped and the kids all

319
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:12,140
piled out. They stopped when they
went up. Yeah, trying to talk,

320
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,660
convinced my mom to let my sister
go or both of us or whatever,

321
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,760
but mom didn't want us to go because
Saturday was our Chore Day and my day at

322
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,970
work, the switchboard, which
usually made me pretty angry,

323
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:28,860
but that was my job and
she said, no, I'm no way.

324
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,071
Well,

325
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:34,071
my sister didn't really want to go
because she really wasn't encouraging this

326
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,100
relationship too much. Yeah, Dickey. Yeah.

327
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,103
No.

328
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,620
So Archie and LZ and the five kids get
back into the car and they drove up to

329
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,140
Gearhart mountain a couple
of miles up a logging road.

330
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:48,070
They passed some forest
service guys working

331
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,670
on the road.

332
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,990
They go a little further to where the
road comes near Creek and Archie pulled

333
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,630
the car around and parked the kids,

334
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,170
jumped out of the car and started
running down toward the creek.

335
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,870
Elsie who was pregnant, as I mentioned,
and she was feeling a bit car sick.

336
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,040
She jumped out to get some fresh
air and to chase after the kids.

337
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,240
While Archie went around to the trunk of
the car to get up the fishing poles and

338
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,770
the picnic baskets, et cetera.

339
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,150
One of the children saw
something on the ground,

340
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,190
a large canvas, white,

341
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:27,820
gray balloon of some kind
spread out on the ground,

342
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,670
called her the other
children to come have a look.

343
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,840
The children and Elsie apparently gathered
in a tight circle around the balloon.

344
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,460
Archie later reported that while he was
getting the picnic basket out of the

345
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:46,870
trunk, his wife called to him, honey,

346
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,700
come look at what we found.

347
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,270
He turned and just took a few steps
toward them and at that moment we'll never

348
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,560
know exactly what happened,

349
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,730
but apparently one of the children
reached down to pick up the device.

350
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,560
The bomb detonated.

351
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:03,920
Yeah.

352
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,880
All five children and Elsie
Mitchell were killed instantly.

353
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,950
The forest service guys down the road,
we're close enough to hear the blast.

354
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,980
They come running when they hear the
explosion and they see Archie Mitchell has

355
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:23,991
run to the site and his wife's clothes
were ablaze and Archie was kneeling over

356
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:29,610
his prostrate wife beating up
the fire with his bare hands.

357
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:43,960
[inaudible]

358
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,470
on our last day in GLI, we went to
visit the site where the bomb went off

359
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,770
in the middle of nowhere.
It's just a chain,

360
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,560
just a little chink fenced off area.

361
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,300
It's a little pen and there
are these tall pine trees.

362
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,580
It's just huge. Cuts in the tree is a
shrapnel cuts in the tree. Yeah. Yeah.

363
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:08,890
They still, it hasn't a,

364
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,040
has not healed

365
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,723
eerie place.

366
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,330
Of course. I didn't know since
dwindle what was going on?

367
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,220
This is Cora Connor again.

368
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,720
At the time she was at her job watching
the switchboard when the guy that was

369
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:40,220
working up there for the forest service
in Russian and to the telephone office

370
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:44,750
and I mean he was scared, pure white
and scared and I thought, my God,

371
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,340
what's on what's happening?

372
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,340
And he came in and made
the call to Lakefield,

373
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,120
the naval base in lake view and about
a half an hour later this, you know,

374
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,310
big imposing military guy comes in.

375
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,540
He was on metals and all and
he's full uniform, you know,

376
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,340
and he must have made it, it seemed like
in a blink of an eye. And I thought,

377
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,640
my God, what has happened? And
then when he talked over the phone,

378
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:08,900
I knew what was going on.

379
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:13,850
He said they'd had a bomb explode
up there with the casualties.

380
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,680
And then he talked to me. He said,

381
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,660
do you not talk to anybody about
anything that you've heard here?

382
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,850
Not your mother, not anybody. He says,
now you're not to leave this office.

383
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,960
By then I was just jelly.
I was still terrified.

384
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,270
He leaves and the word is is trickling
around, spreading around town.

385
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,130
They knew something had gone wrong and
they gathered at the phone office because

386
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:43,640
the phone office knows everything
in the whole valley. Then they knew,

387
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:48,560
I knew what was going on
and that's when it all hit.

388
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,570
Pretty soon there was a crowd
outside screaming and yelling at me.

389
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,470
And, yeah, yeah, yeah. We
know. You know what's going on.

390
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:01,160
You better come out and tell us we're
coming in there and you're going to tell

391
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:05,930
us what's happened and all
your neighbors and things like,

392
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,470
yeah, no, you, they're
saying and they know. Yeah.

393
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,640
Cause blinds is very tiny place.
I probably knew every one of them.

394
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,650
I was about,

395
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,120
you could imagine the
state I was in and uh,

396
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,820
Mr Passkey Dickey's father Dickey was
the boy who had a crush on Cora's sister.

397
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,610
I can tell you exactly how
he has dressed that day.

398
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,180
He had on a red and black
checkered hunting shirt and
his red hunting cat at the

399
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,130
time, all he knew is
that his son was missing.

400
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,240
He stood out there and they shook his
fist and he yelled and he scared me half

401
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:45,110
to death, threatening to come
in and all that. He says,

402
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,810
you know what's happening?
Let us know what's happening.

403
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,090
And I couldn't do anything.
I sat there all day.

404
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,880
Okay 16 you know, it really,

405
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:00,920
really tore me apart.

406
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,420
That was just in a
complete fog for days. No,

407
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,360
I'd never, never talked
too much about it. Nope.

408
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,620
Within a day or so,

409
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:17,850
the military told most of the town what
actually happened that day and then a

410
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:21,980
short time after that,
a big army truck. Well,

411
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,530
it was two big army trucks. They
stopped right out in front of our house.

412
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,550
We wondered what was going on. You
know your little town like that.

413
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:30,450
Anything different.

414
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:35,310
Everybody goes to the window
and bakers look and here come,

415
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,020
okay, this is awfully hard for me.

416
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,560
A woman and a little kid jumped
out of the back of truck.

417
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,420
She was Japanese. They run
their way to the, to lake,

418
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,510
the Japanese interment camp nearby and
she's screaming and crying and praying,

419
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,720
please, we need water. We
need water. It was hot.

420
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,430
It was really hot that day and they
were in a canvas covered truck jammed in

421
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,020
there and

422
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,450
I grabbed a picture of a bucket or
whatever was there in the kitchen,

423
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,760
filled it with water and
stuttered it out the door.

424
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:15,420
By that time they were throwing
rocks at that lady and her kid,

425
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,780
people in that town were so terribly
upset and they were throwing rocks at her

426
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,730
and mom would let me go and I screamed
and cried at my mother because she

427
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:28,490
wouldn't let me go. She
goes, you can't go out there.

428
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,110
They'll throw rocks at
you. I won't let you go.

429
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,400
And do they stay that pictures in my
mind and I have prayed to the Lord to

430
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:42,570
forgive the people that
were doing that and try to,

431
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,520
I can't accept it. There's no, nothing
could make me accept what had happened.

432
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,300
I thought that was the most
horrible thing in the world.

433
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:56,110
People could do a woman and child.
They had nothing to do with the bomb.

434
00:27:56,111 --> 00:27:57,820
Nothing to do with the war. Nothing.

435
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,173
Okay.

436
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,140
It does. It's still hard.

437
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,430
How can people be that way?

438
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,693
Hmm.

439
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,610
It upset me so horribly bad,

440
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,070
but didn't want to talk about
it. I couldn't talk for 40 years.

441
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,593
[inaudible]

442
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,290
it's weird, like it's a kind of weird,

443
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,320
scary symmetry to this whole thing.

444
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:43,790
Like the Japanese military was
trying to create terror, right?

445
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,690
Like what they felt after too little
and so they wanted to make the situation

446
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:50,450
where like bombs were falling
silently from the sky.

447
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:52,220
We couldn't even tell where
they were coming from.

448
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,230
Almost like the gods were dropping them,

449
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,100
but we kept it quiet so nobody
panicked except by not saying anything.

450
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,990
At least in this one small instance,

451
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,920
it created exactly the situation
that the Japanese military wanted.

452
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,130
I mean not on the scale that they
wanted, but like in it's effect,

453
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,760
it's like a concentrated version of the
thing they're trying to create. Right.

454
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,600
That's the problem. That's not a problem.

455
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:21,160
Five is five is a sacrifice in
war. What is it? Five six people?

456
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,810
Yeah. There were, there were. There
were 125 million people in America then.

457
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,680
Hmm. I think there actually might
have been a little bit more. Yeah,

458
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,470
well you can see what
it would have been like.

459
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,980
Listen to this story. You
could see what a room like if,

460
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,370
if this story had been well known and
had been told from person to person.

461
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,250
If everybody was looking

462
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,030
up and wondering where the next
strange thing was coming from.

463
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,193
Well they wouldn't,

464
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,960
there might've been panic but those kids
wouldn't have talked on the balloons.

465
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:52,660
That's that's the choice cause
they would have known. Yeah. Hey,

466
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,620
I'm sorry to jump in here.

467
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:57,670
I just know that we don't have Ross much
longer in order to respect your time.

468
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,360
Um, separate. Is there any males who
worked with Nick and Peter on this,

469
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,700
on the story before they kick you out?

470
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,200
The only last question I kind of
was had on my list is I'm like,

471
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,570
why is it that we don't know about this?

472
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,440
Like I've never heard of this
before. I don't know if Robert,

473
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,370
if you've heard this before,

474
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,760
like why like why the hell
is this not a thing we know.

475
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,570
I think it's directly an outgrowth
of that censorship policy.

476
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,930
At the end of the war, the war
department destroyed all of the evidence.

477
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,420
They didn't want these, any
evidence of these balloons.

478
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,780
I'm just out there in
general circulation. Huh?

479
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,490
This is one of those footnotes
to the war that you know,

480
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,790
at the end of the war, just never people,

481
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,650
people forgot about something that
they didn't know about anyway. Wow.

482
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,750
Ross, are there any more out there?
That is a very interesting question.

483
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,720
It's estimated by the war department
that of the 9,000 release,

484
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,750
they thought that maybe seven to 10%
of the total would have survived the

485
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,420
transoceanic crossing and
arrived in North America.

486
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,520
That's 900 300 are confirmed as
having arrived in North America,

487
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,560
so that means there are dozens,

488
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,800
perhaps hundreds that arrived in North
America but were never accounted for in

489
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:21,950
the 10 or 12 years. Immediately
after the end of World War Two,

490
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,110
a couple dozen of these things were
found several in Oregon in 1948 when in

491
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:32,111
Alaska in 1955 one in Idaho in the
early 1960s and then the recoveries stop

492
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,120
where the, where they live.
Like the one in Oregon,

493
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,540
like if you touched them
with the blow of them.

494
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,170
Well, some of them were. Now
here's the fascinating part.

495
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,640
Last October, October
of 2014 I kid you not.

496
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,970
Dave was ahead of me and
he'd stopped and said,

497
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,680
I think I saw, I'm the bomb.

498
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,240
A couple of loggers.

499
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,640
Yeah. My name is Preston Linger.
His name's Dave Bridgeman

500
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,130
in Lumby, British Columbia,
who are doing some survey work.

501
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,430
You know, this is the middle of nowhere.

502
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,490
Found the remnants of a Japanese balloon
that had been on the ground for 70

503
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,210
years.

504
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,120
Definitely work in remote
areas and in general,

505
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:13,900
and we don't see much except trees
and rock. But, uh, you know, there,

506
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,570
there are those odd
special days where you,

507
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,680
where you see things that
no one else gets to see.

508
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,730
This happened just a few months
ago. I tell you, if you're hiking,

509
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:27,530
if you're out in the woods in the
Pacific northwest, watch where you step.
