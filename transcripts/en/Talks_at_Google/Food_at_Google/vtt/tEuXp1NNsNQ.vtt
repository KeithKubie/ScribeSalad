[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.950
STEPHANIE: I have the honor
of welcoming Katie Parla today

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.080
to Google.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.480
Katie Parla is a food
and beverage educator

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.254
and a journalist.

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:17.170
She has been featured
in the "New York Times,"

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.320
"The Guardian," countless
food and travel publications.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.572
She's written and
edited over 20 books,

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:24.280
including "Tasting
Rome," which she'll be

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.400
signing for those of you today.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.200
And she's actually
in the Bay Area

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.330
working on a new cookbook
about Southern Italy.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.330
I'm most excited to have
Katie here, because she

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.050
is my personal hero.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.290
She is someone who has
found passions in her life

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.990
and has built a life and career
around those passions, namely

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.300
Roman food and drink.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.500
So very excited to
have her here today,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.860
so please join me in welcoming
Katie Parla to Google.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.635
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.030
KATIE PARLA: That was so kind.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.640
I have really high
cholesterol, so it's

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.650
the product of eating
lots of carbonara

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.390
on all of your behalves.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.180
And so don't be-- note
you're here on the health

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.480
sense of the word.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.840
But I am really excited, because
15 years ago, I moved to Rome,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.870
and somehow managed
to sort of craft

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.590
a career talking
about food and drink.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.617
And my path started to veer
towards food and beverage

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.200
at a super young
age, so I was sort of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.080
naturally attracted
to these things

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.971
growing up in New Jersey.

00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:31.220
And although I went to Rome
originally for art history

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.670
reasons, I was almost
instantly distracted

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.675
by pizza, pasta, wine, and
later, Italian craft beer.

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:41.800
So Stephanie, thanks so
much for inviting me today.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.310
I'm so psyched to see
all you guys out here.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.180
And hey, livestream people.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.390
So the city of Rome--

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.190
well, if we trust
Roman sources--

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.000
was founded on
April 21st, 753 BC,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.540
a date for which there is
zero archaeological evidence

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.920
but is celebrated.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.980
If you visit Rome on the
21st of April next year,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.890
you'll find all sorts of
historical re-enactors

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.070
marching down Via dei Foro
Imperiali doing all these

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.200
really bizarro
reenactments in the Circus

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.300
Maximus and these areas that
legend tell us were developed

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.030
27 centuries ago.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.620
Archeology says the cities look
a little bit older than that.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.360
But what this sort of tension
between myth and history shows

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.080
us, and something that repeats
over and over in Roman culture,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.130
is that Romans love to craft
their own notion of themselves,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.210
and they market their
food accordingly.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.710
So we're going to be talking
about the history of Roman food

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.209
today.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.530
I want to talk to you about
some of the ingredients

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.540
and techniques that are typical.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.800
You're going to start
seeing a lot of those things

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.216
aren't native to
Rome, but they're

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:53.360
the product of people
coming from all over Italy

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.430
and, indeed, all over
the world and creating

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.770
this really wonderfully
contaminated cuisine.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.557
The photo on the left
shows the Roman Forum.

00:03:06.557 --> 00:03:08.390
I'm standing-- when I'm
shooting this photo,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.830
I'm standing on mint
and mallow and arugula.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.590
These all grow wild
all over the city.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.650
These are some of the
millennial flavors

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.896
of Rome, things that people
have had in their foods

00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:24.020
and now even to a greater
extent in their digestive

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.480
liqueurs for a very long time.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.330
And in the background,
you have some

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.750
of the ruins of a first
century warehouse,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.110
and then even further
beyond, the magnificent ruins

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.090
of the Tabularium and
temples in the Forum.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.680
In the very far distance
is the Vittoriano,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.880
and although maybe
on another date,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.090
I'll talk to you about the 27
centuries before unification.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.290
But today I really want to focus
on Italian unification, so 1870

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.940
when Rome becomes
the capital to today,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.820
and how the food developed
and continues to evolve.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.260
So at the top, you see
what some people in Rome

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.050
call the national calamity.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.830
Others, the typewriter
or the wedding cake.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.400
It goes by other
names-- the altar

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.875
of the fatherland,
the Vittoriano,

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.250
and it's name for
Victor Emmanuel

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.230
II, so the king of
Italy, who claimed

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.300
Rome as his capital in
1870 after this massive

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.760
philosophical and
military battle

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.490
to unite disparate cultures
under a unified crown.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.400
The monument obstructs
the view of the Forum

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.040
really, taking over
the center of town

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.630
and asserting this new
regime and its presence,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.480
but, of course, plucking
different images from Roman

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.750
culture, so lots of marble
reliefs and sculptures

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.150
and things that evoke antiquity.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.490
When Victor Emmanuel II
came to Rome in 1870,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.720
there were 150,000
people in town.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.790
That number grew to about
1.4 million by 1935,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.900
and so in that
interim period, one

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.630
of the major responsibilities
of both the national

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.760
as well as the local
governments was

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.300
to streamline the food system.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.300
So how do you feed
all these people?

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300
By the way, the huge
increase in population

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.290
was not the product of Romans
being very amorous and fertile.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.230
It was, in fact, the
product of people

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.260
leaving, especially
the south of Italy

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.780
and rural places in Tuscany,
Le Marche, the Veneto,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.695
and going to Italian
cities, especially Rome.

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:33.445
This is also the time that many
people of the south of Italy

00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:36.070
and came to United States.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.632
And so you have all of
these different influences

00:05:38.632 --> 00:05:40.090
coming from the
north and the south

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.770
and converging on
the Italian capital,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.400
bringing their food techniques
with them, their ingredients.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.254
We'll talk a little
bit about that.

00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:49.420
The government created all
sorts of these major food

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.630
spaces like in the bottom,
that black and white photo,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.740
the Mattatoio, or
the slaughterhouse.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.720
So when I moved to
Rome 15 years ago,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.000
I imagined that
I would find lots

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.900
of farmers selling the things
directly to the people.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.290
This is actually a market
very close to the Vatican.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.850
In about 1925,
you could actually

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.870
go get freshly plucked chickens
or recently slaughtered lambs.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.720
But now the food supply has
really, really transformed,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.840
and that's the
product of the Mercati

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.590
Generali and the Mattatoio.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.810
These are the two
major food halls.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.900
The Mercati Generali was where
a lot of produce would come in,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.710
so the government wanted
to elongate the food supply

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.630
or elongate the
supply chain in order

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.920
to generate all sorts
of jobs along the way.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.970
This is one way to build
employment in the capital.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.870
And this sprawling complex that
employed thousands of people

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.440
and fed hundreds of thousands
of people at its peak

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.080
was built on a flood plain in
the southern part of the city,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.170
so the Ostiense district.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.630
If you've ever seen
that pyramidal tomb

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.990
next to the Lido
station, it's just

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.480
past that very close to Eataly.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.590
The Mercati Generali
was where farmers

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.390
would bring in their goods,
and then this wholesale market

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.090
is where goods would be
distributed to businesses,

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.150
restaurants, and markets.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.050
Eventually, this huge
complex became surrounded

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.796
by the metro area of Rome.

00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:23.920
And so that complex has
now been moved further away

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.220
from the city, and this
is a general custom.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.480
The wholesale markets move
further and further away

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.735
from the center of town, which
really reduces the access

00:07:31.735 --> 00:07:33.610
to food and sort of
limits ingredients, which

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.910
we'll talk about momentarily.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:41.260
This is what the Mercati
Generali looks like today.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.180
The building is this
sort of wonderful example

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.330
of decaying urban archeology.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.270
It is, I guess, for
trespassers only.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.520
Sometimes you'll see
people tagging up

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.250
the complex, which
sprawled over thousands

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.845
and thousands of square
meters and now is

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.380
in different states of repair.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.800
The current plan is
to transform this

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.400
into a cultural and shopping
like Xanadu of sorts,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.380
and that is a work in progress.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.540
They were in progress
when I moved to Rome

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.725
a decade and a half ago.

00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:16.850
This is more or less what
the place looks like now.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.560
So maybe in a few
years we'll know more.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.740
So while produce went
into the Mercati Generali

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.700
and then was distributed
to restaurants

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.800
and to marketplaces, animals
would come in, instead,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.580
to Testaccio, which is not
far from the Mercati Generali.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.860
Testaccio now is a really
popular destination

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.799
for eating all sorts
of carnivorous dishes,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.900
a lot of offal dishes.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.040
And the real predominance
of organ meats and poor cuts

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.170
that you find in the restaurants
and home tables of Testaccio

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.110
is indebted to
the slaughterhouse

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.200
being in operation in that
neighborhood from 1888

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.030
to about 1970.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.530
And this is a really,
again, sprawling complex

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.120
that was built in
the unification era

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.040
in order to really streamline
a food system to feed

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.060
lots and lots of people.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.940
Now when you're slaughtering
thousands of animals a week

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.360
and discarding various
parts of their bodies

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.170
into the Tiber River, this
generates a less than appealing

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.400
set of olfactory experiences.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.666
So as Trastevere was
developing on the other side

00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:27.040
of the river, not the beautiful
medieval part, of course,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.500
but the 1960s
development, it started

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.030
to become a hygienic issue
to have all this slaughter

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.820
happening in town.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.153
So just like the Mercati
Generali moved out of town, so,

00:09:35.153 --> 00:09:39.770
too, did the Mattatoio,
or the slaughterhouse.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.160
And it starts to be repurposed
after a period of decay,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.705
and today, you can walk through
the ruins of the ex-Mattatoio,

00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:53.040
this former slaughterhouse, and
find modern art installations,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.800
the area and southern
part has been turned

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.300
into an organic supermarket.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.760
There is a cafe.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.980
There's like a fixie bike shop.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.120
There's a university
department for the University

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.380
of Rome's architecture school.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.810
So actually, in the halls
where the tripes used

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.630
to be harvested from
grazing animals,

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.450
you can sit in on lectures
about architectural development,

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.762
which is kind of spectacular.

00:10:19.762 --> 00:10:22.220
So this is a great example of
how food spaces, decayed food

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.490
spaces are now being repurposed.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.510
So where do people shop?

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.330
How do people get their food?

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.410
There are two main sources.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.550
The majority of Romans
shop at supermarkets,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.990
but we have, especially people
skewing towards the older

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.080
end of the demographic spectrum,
go to the Mercati Rionali.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.130
So there are about 125
of these markets in Rome.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.920
This is the Nomentano
Market, which

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.570
was built during
the fascist era,

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.690
has these really
wonderful sort of almost

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.710
basilica-like aisled halls
with light streaming in,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.770
and each of these
stalls is often

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.310
staffed by middlemen
who go to the Mercati

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.420
Generali or its analog,
and then resell produce.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.370
So these aren't
farmers' markets,

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.540
but there is this custom in
Rome of going to the markets

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.530
and purchasing things
that are from Italy.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.060
Now in the past seven years
or so, since about '09, now we

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.150
have a lot of farm direct
sales in specific markets.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.150
So some farmers
lobbied the government

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.990
in order to sell
directly to the consumer.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.670
So if you visit the Trionfale
Market near the Vatican,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.490
you'll find these
green banners that

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.640
announce that the produce
is coming from a farm,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.970
often in Rome, not, perhaps,
next to the Colosseum,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.680
but certainly not far.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.470
And it's a 20-minute
drive from that market

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.130
to the field from which the
artichoke is so beautifully

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.710
pruned or plucked.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.210
Supermercati are another
source of shopping for people.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.280
This is the Eataly supermarket.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.300
The largest in the world
is actually in Rome.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.060
It's about three and
1/2 times the size

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.120
of the Chicago or the
New York locations,

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.870
and so Despar or Eataly or any
of these larger supermarket

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.010
chains often draw from
some of the visuals

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.510
of the local markets, especially
in the hanging prosciutti

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.550
and cappocoli and
all of these things

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.920
to create atmosphere, where
the goods are actually

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.710
sold from the refrigerated
case, as the law requires.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.940
So we've got a little bit
of a historical basis.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.530
What is Roman food?

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.590
It is vastly different than
the food of Venice or Florence

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.490
or even Frosinone or Latino,
which are cities near Rome.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:52.750
Roman cuisine is the product of
its ingredients, its geography.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.570
Rome is located 13
miles from the sea

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.600
and 13 miles from
former volcanoes

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.710
with very rich soil, which
have historically grown grapes

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.750
and all sorts of produce.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.730
It's divided by a river,
and we talked a bit

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.650
about the spontaneous
greenery that you

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.580
find in Rome-- mint and all of
these sort of like herbaceous

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.100
greens that can be
used to flavor foods.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.690
So in antiquity, Romans
may have eaten lamb

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.400
and had lots of local greens,
but in the 20th century,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.240
we saw the arrival
of dried pasta,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.150
especially from the area
around Gragnano, Naples,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.100
so when you visit
a Roman restaurant,

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.220
you find pasta shapes
like spaghetti,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.340
rigatoni, pasta that's
extruded through bronze dye,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.080
dried slowly, boiled, and
dressed with condiments.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.510
But you can find that all over.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.840
Those shapes are available
in all of Italy's regions.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.587
What's really typical of
Rome are potato gnocchi.

00:13:53.587 --> 00:13:55.420
Potatoes, of course,
come from the New World

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.035
but are introduced to the
southern Italian peninsula

00:13:59.035 --> 00:14:03.040
in the 1500s, and
then sort of absorbed

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.900
throughout the
succeeding centuries.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.670
And in Rome, potato gnocchi
are a Thursday dish,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.350
so we don't need
them on Wednesday.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.620
We don't eat them on Friday.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.265
We eat them on Thursdays
for a specific reason.

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:15.640
I've been talking
all about Rome,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.620
but there's another really
important nation in that part

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.880
of Italy-- the Vatican.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.120
And so the Catholic calendar
influences some of the things

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.530
that we eat on certain days,
and Friday, being a lean day,

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.280
it's a day that you
really want to prepare

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.910
for, ideally with a
caloric potato-rich pasta,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.390
so potato gnocchi are
a Thursday tradition

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.080
as a direct result of this.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.510
Another great calorie
source that we enjoy in Rome

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.240
is guanciale, cured pork jowl.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.250
This is used as a fat source.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.370
It's also a flavor source
for our classic pastas--

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.040
amatriciana, carbonara, gricia.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.380
Although we're so close
to the sea, we don't--

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.920
well, historically, we haven't
eaten a lot of fresh fish

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.680
in Rome.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.610
Now since the '60s onwards,
people have refrigeration.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.860
Ice is readily available.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.520
But before that, people relied
on salted fish, specially

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.610
salted cod, baccala coming
from the north of Europe,

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.410
sometimes processed in
the north of Europe,

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.340
other times processed
in Compiano or Calabria,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.540
and then salted anchovies.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.070
The river perch, the
eel the sturgeon,

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:29.890
catfish, all these Tiber
fish are really not

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.637
consumed in any
significant way any longer.

00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:35.220
So if you were looking for any
of those things on Roman menus,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.470
you're not going to find them.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.200
Sorry.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.830
The sort of symbol of
Rome is the artichoke,

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.200
and carciofo is the
Italian word for artichoke.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.929
The artichokes that we have
that are growing locally

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:48.220
are called carciofi romaneschi.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:53.080
Similarly, our pale green
strident zucchini are zucchine

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.250
{} romanesche, and so things
that are highly local are given

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.130
the adjective to define
their provenance,

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.910
although I would footnote that
artichokes are probably from

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.660
coming into Rome from the
south of Italy in the 1500s,

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.580
and zucchini arrive
from the New World.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.689
So there is this custom of
adopting things from elsewhere

00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:14.230
and giving them a
Roman name in order

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.880
to provide them with a
sense of authenticity.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.249
Pecorino Romano is an
ancient type of cheese.

00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:21.790
The way that it's
produced now is now

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.219
defined by 20th
century law, but Romans

00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:25.760
have been salting
sheep's milk cheese

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.530
and aging it for millennia.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.050
The byproduct of
cheese production

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.020
is all this very protein-rich
whey, which can be reheated

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.480
and sort of coagulated proteins
can be skimmed off and drained

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.084
to make a ricotta, which
is often, obviously,

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:44.500
sheep's milk ricotta, because
there's so much sheep's milk

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.580
cheese.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.970
Lambs still graze near Rome.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.010
If you're like an avid
runner, I recommend

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.530
starting in the Circus Maximus,
running down the Appian Way

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.020
through the Caffarella Park
on your next trip to Rome,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.510
and the earth gets
softer and softer

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.790
as you move outside
the city center

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.890
and get all of these
beautiful grazing

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.510
lands, where sheep are grazed.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:08.349
And it's really, really
lovely, a reminder that Rome

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.230
was a really rural city
until quite recently,

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.430
and you still do find
these pockets of rural life

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.710
throughout town.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:22.569
The pork tradition in Rome
is an ancient one as well,

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.960
though our sort of
dominant pork ingredient

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.250
is the guanciale that
I referenced earlier.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:34.210
Offal, so things like heart,
lungs, liver, trachea stew,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.600
AKA coratella, tripe
simmered in a tomato sauce--

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.360
really classic Roman dishes--

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.100
and mint, pepperoncino, and
salt are our main seasonings.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.000
So a lot of what I've been
sort of discussing today

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.770
is derived from library
research and archival research,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.930
but let's get into the streets.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.990
These are things that you'll
actually encounter in Rome,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.720
especially if you are staying
around the Prati district

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.400
or Trionfale district,
which has really

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.580
become a hub for street
food and different types

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.110
of traditional foods in Rome.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.750
So street food and
fast food are foods

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.730
that are consumed on the fly.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.580
Street food might be a
little bit of a misnomer,

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.830
because we don't have a
lot of food trucks in Rome

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.720
like you guys have out here.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.910
Street food, or strit fud
as we sometimes say in Rome,

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.510
spelled S-T-R-I-T F-U-D--

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.370
I'm not kidding.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.220
It's a real thing.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.670
Street food is often consumed
at brick and mortar places, so

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.930
rather than going to a
little food truck, which

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.760
for a variety of legal reasons
is a little bit complicated

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.650
to set up a business like that.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.630
We go to a pizza al
taglio spot, a pizza

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.490
by the slice place,
which often has

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.827
slices of pizza and fried rice
balls and all of these things

00:18:51.827 --> 00:18:53.410
that you can eat and
that are portable

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.050
and that are, above
all, are cheap.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.610
There's this myth
that Romans sit down

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.430
to long luxurious
lunches lasting hours

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.930
and that we start
with an antipasto

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.620
and then move on to a pasta and
a main course and a vegetable

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.960
side dish and then dessert, and
this is all fueled with wine.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.650
And then it's punctuated
by dessert and amaro.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.370
I mean that's a
holiday meal, but it's

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.700
a ritual that is so
long, takes so long, it's

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.920
impractical in the modern
day business rhythms.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.720
And it's, above all,
far too expensive

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.570
for most Roman residents.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.230
So we ate a lot of
food on the fly,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.490
and pizza al taglio
is a Roman classic.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.000
So visit Florence or Naples,
you might find Roman style pizza

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.490
by the slice, but this is really
an indigenous mid-20th century

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.190
food that we consume daily.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.844
Well, at least I do.

00:19:43.844 --> 00:19:45.927
But remember, I have very
high cholesterol, so not

00:19:45.927 --> 00:19:49.250
the best to follow my diet.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.050
There are these sort
of canonical pasta

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.790
dishes in Rome--

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:58.250
carbonara, gricia, amatriciana
being sort of consolation

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.500
that's related to
gricia as the base.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.400
So has anyone had gricia?

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.051
Yeah, awesome.

00:20:05.051 --> 00:20:05.550
Cool.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.150
So gricia is essentially
the pasta dish

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.280
upon which amatriciana
and carbonara are based,

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.140
so you've got pasta, black
pepper, Pecorino, guanciale,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.950
some people put garlic in it,
some people put onion in it.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.720
There are very
passionate debates

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.790
about whether this
should be allowed.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.190
In essence, there are no
original gricia recipes,

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.500
and some people have
sort of freestyled

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.720
based on the sort
of flavor profile

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.310
that they're looking for.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.330
But generally speaking, it's
those sort of building blocks

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.080
that I mentioned.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.640
So pasta, guanciale, black
pepper, Pecorino Romano,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.600
and the sort of fat source there
is the rendered guanciale fat.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.370
It provides not just
fat, but also flavor.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.180
If you add egg to this,
the product is carbonara.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.160
If you add tomato instead,
the product is amatriciana.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.660
And although there
is a very long

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.240
and another passionate
debate about the origins

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.300
of amatriciana, the
town of Amatrice

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.820
claims to be the
birthplace of this dish.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.400
In fact, the first
recorded recipes

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.650
that we have of a
amatriciana is actually

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:13.610
gricia, a tomato-less
pasta dish.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:18.230
Cacio e pepe is related in
sort of the salty Pecorino

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.390
aspect and the fact that it
does have black pepper in it.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.180
But this is a separate
food altogether.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.820
It is not related to gricia
or carbonara or amatriciana.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.960
It was drunk food.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.750
This is the food that you would
eat after a long alcohol-fueled

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.870
meal, like in the pre-'50s
era, when Romans would go out,

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.080
and food was cheap, and you
could eat and drink for many

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.100
hours.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.290
And after dessert,
you would drink more

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.490
and continue drinking.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.230
And you would need something
to soak up all the alcohol.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.700
There's this really
wonderful place

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.091
in the center of Rome
called Armando al Pantheon,

00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:54.340
and this place used to be
sort of like half trattoria,

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.470
casual dining area,
half tavern, and cacio

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.260
e pepe wasn't on their menu.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.450
You would order
it after dessert,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.510
after all your wine was done
so that you could stumble home

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.640
without sort of feeling ill.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.770
Soak up the-- mac and
cheese soaks up booze,

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.310
like this is not a
revolutionary idea.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.650
And this sort of pasta dish
is along the same lines

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.050
as aglio e olio,
peperoncino, spaghetti

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.980
with garlic, chili, and oil.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.880
Now in the post '50s era,
both aglio olio, peperoncino,

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.090
and cacio e pepe have
merged and are now

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.390
sort of welcome into the
pasta canon on the home

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.550
table and the restaurant table.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.840
Often, we sort of separate
the cucina ebraica

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.280
or the Jewish tradition of Rome
when we talk about Roman food,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.850
and, in fact, it, of course,
follows the laws of kashrut,

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.980
so no guanciale.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.760
None of the dishes
combine dairy and meat,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.830
but there are a lot of
similarities in the Roman

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.880
Jewish tradition with respect
to the flavor profiles

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.970
and ingredients of
the Roman tradition.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.890
Jews arrived in Rome in
the second century, BC.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:08.710
There are now around
13,000 Jews in Rome.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.580
A small number of
these are logically

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.190
descended from the first
arrivals of free Jews

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.350
during the republic,
but now we also

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.320
have this really rich,
small but very rich

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.880
Jewish culture in Rome.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.210
Remember that in 1492, Jews were
expelled from Spanish dominion.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.620
That included the
south of Italy.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.596
So imagine Jews being expelled
from Calabria, Sicily,

00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:32.470
and fleeing either to
Rome or to the Balkans,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.530
bringing a lot of their
cooking traditions with them.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.120
This dish is called concia.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.965
In the south of Italy, it's
called zucchine alla scapece.

00:23:39.965 --> 00:23:41.590
So it's basically
fried zucchini that's

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.590
been marinated in garlic
and basil or mint,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.170
depending on your
preference, with vinegar.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.940
And this is the most
classic Roman Jewish dish.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:57.279
Perhaps globally, the twice
fried artichoke, carciofo alla

00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:59.320
giudia is the most famous,
but in the local Roman

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.070
Jewish tradition, concia
is far more prevalent

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.650
and sort of defines
the very strong flavors

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:10.000
and seasonal vegetal aspects
of this local cuisine.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.200
In 1967, the Roman
Jewish community

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.870
was enriched by the arrival
of around 4,000 Jews

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.020
from mainly Benghazi,
Tripoli, Misrata,

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.440
refugees escaping
pogroms in North Africa.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.630
About half of the
refugees stayed, and now

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.180
a significant portion
of Rome's 13,000 Jews

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.830
are, in fact, of Libyan descent.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.496
So if you visit the
Jewish ghetto, which

00:24:31.496 --> 00:24:34.180
is the historical district,
about four city blocks

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.530
today, where Roman Jews were
confined to a squalid slum

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.500
by order of the pope, you'll
find a lot of the menus feature

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.370
concia and carciofo
alla giudia, but also

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.550
grouper or other white flaky
fish simmered with spices

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.050
and served with couscous.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.350
There are phyllo pastries
soaked in syrup, things

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.470
that would be quite at home
on a North African table,

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.420
and, indeed, they were until
the Libyan community, which

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.340
is called the
comunita tripolina,

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.840
escaped and landed in Rome.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.150
Quinto quarto.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.430
Does anyone recognize the
like little ring up there,

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.065
in the foreground?

00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:15.259
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:15.925
KATIE PARLA: Hm?

00:25:15.925 --> 00:25:16.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.820
KATIE PARLA: Nailed
it, intestine.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.910
Specifically, it's the intestine
of a milk fed Veal that still

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.380
has its mother's milk inside.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.460
When you simmer the intestines
and the milk together,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.806
the milk-- don't make that face.

00:25:29.806 --> 00:25:34.650
[LAUGHING] The milk makes a
sort of curdled creamy ricotta

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.379
like substance,
and it beautifully

00:25:37.379 --> 00:25:39.670
pairs with rigatoni, because
the rigatoni are basically

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.840
the same diameter
as the intestines.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.700
I'm getting so hungry
just thinking about this.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.950
And you simmer the
intestines that

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:52.870
have been sort of cut into
segments and tied into rings,

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.670
and you cook those
in tomato sauce.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.700
And then, of course,
season with salty Pecorino.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:03.460
It's called pajata, and rigatoni
pajata is a Roman classic.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.060
And it's not just pajata that
defines the quinto quatro,

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.380
or the offal tradition of
Rome, but tripe Roman style,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.330
which denotes tripe,
honeycomb tripe in particular,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.690
simmered in tomato
sauce, seasoned

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.580
with Pecorino and mint.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.430
Coratella, which I
referenced earlier,

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.740
heart, lungs, liver,
and trachea that

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.287
are diced up and cooked with or
without artichokes, depending

00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:28.870
on the season.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.760
Our artichokes are in
season from February

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.670
until about April, May.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:38.080
And Romans eat a
lot of fried food.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.320
It's almost sacrilegious
to extract this

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.142
from the sort of
starters section,

00:26:45.142 --> 00:26:46.600
or the sort of
street food section,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.520
because so much of our
street food is deep fried.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.360
But fried food is
something that we consume

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.800
at every festive meal,
whether it's battered

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.420
and fried vegetables, or
floured and fried zucchini,

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.820
all sorts of
croquettes, especially

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.440
rice croquettes suppli--

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.050
so rissoto balls
breaded and fried--

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.140
and, in the center of it
all, the carciofi alla

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.000
giudia that I
referenced earlier.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.577
So although this talk and
the cookbook, "Tasting Rome,"

00:27:16.577 --> 00:27:18.160
break things down
into segments, there

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.870
is so much overlap between
these categories in the Roman

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.950
tradition.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.440
So tradition and evolution.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.750
We've seen the sort of
classic ingredients,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.562
lots of meat and awful, and the
seasonings like pepperoncino,

00:27:33.562 --> 00:27:36.020
Pecorino-- which, although it's
a cheese, it's a seasoning.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.280
It brings a lot of salty,
savory flavor to Roman foods.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.070
The Cucina Romana as a
defined series of dishes

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.970
is constantly an evolution.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.270
We didn't have carbonara
in Rome in the 1940's.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.940
Now it is one of the
symbols of the city,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.474
and so you have all
these dishes and customs

00:27:53.474 --> 00:27:55.640
that are slowly introduced
and then absorbed in them

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.440
become part of the canon.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.390
Well, there are
other things that

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.430
are now coming into the canon.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:06.350
This sort of stack
of fried disks

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.160
is what I call nduja in carozza.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.890
Mozzarella en carrozza is
like the classic snack food.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.430
It's basically like battered
bread with mozzarella

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.070
and little anchovy
or anchovy paste.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.870
Super, super savory.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.600
So, in this case,
you've got mozzarella

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.820
that becomes like the
bread, and then nduja, which

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.460
is a spicy Calabrian salami,
that becomes a sort filling,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.050
then it's breaded and fried.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.270
And this was invented
by Gabrielli Bonacci,

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.050
one of the premier food
artisans and innovators in Rome.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.740
And it's an acknowledgement in
the form of the spicy Calabrian

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.130
salami nduja that not
every Roman is from Rome.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.380
In fact, there are
450,000 Calabrians

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:51.200
in Rome, which is a pretty
significant portion of the 4.3

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.360
million residents.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.480
You'll see like a little--

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.520
frying is a bit of a theme here.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.540
Suppli, for about a
century, were sort of

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.660
defined as a risotto
with meat sauce,

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.820
packed around some
mozzarella, deep fried.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.730
So you get the sort of
melty mozzarella heart.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.960
Food innovators like Stefano
Calagari and Gabrielli Bonacci,

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.645
and others, decided
like, what if we

00:29:13.645 --> 00:29:15.020
put different
stuff in the rice--

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.019
and make the suppli,
which is this egg shaped

00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:18.560
parcel that everyone
will immediately

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.090
recognize from the
outside, but when

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.548
you break it open
there's something

00:29:21.548 --> 00:29:23.270
interesting inside,
in this case,

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:29.174
porchetta with frascati wine,
a nod to the Costelli Romani.

00:29:29.174 --> 00:29:30.590
It's just southeast
of Rome, where

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.570
you find a lot of
porchetta makers,

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.360
and the village of
Frascati is located.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.170
If you have one
bite in Rome, let

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.400
it be the brisket
sandwich at Mordi e Vai.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.730
Those are the hands
of Sergio Esposito.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:50.410
He opened his stall in the
Testaccio market in July 2012.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.720
It was the hottest day
of the year that year.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:58.330
Imagine Romans walking past
this hot meat sandwich stall

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.850
and just being repulsed by
the idea of eating a hot meat

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.740
sandwich.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.500
So it took them a little bit
of time to build a clientele,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.750
but he started giving away
little bits of his simmered

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.333
brisket-- brisket which is now
almost completely vanished from

00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:11.260
Roman tables--

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.550
used to be a specialty
of his family.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.960
He grew up the son of a
butcher based on in Testaccio.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.610
He grew up in the
Testaccio Market,

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.568
and then went to work in
the organ's department

00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:22.840
at the mattatoio,
slaughterhouse.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.110
And as an employee of
the slaughterhouse,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.990
he and his family had access
to a lot of poor cuts.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.840
And that included
brisket, of course.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.150
Now, he simmers brisket
with lots of aromatics,

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.830
and then puts it on a sandwich.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.640
This is a radical innovation
by Roman standards.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.310
Dishes like tripe
or brisket or pajata

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.770
would be served in a
defined way, on a plate,

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.330
at home, or at a restaurant.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.000
The idea of having a
portable version of that

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.540
was a huge break with tradition.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.620
But leave it to Sergio Esposito,
who is like 80 years old,

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.970
to make this really bold
decision to change the way

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.290
that we eat.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:07.051
In 2009, we see the beginning of
this horrible financial crisis.

00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:08.300
People can't afford to go out.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.100
They start cutting corners
when it comes to food purchases

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.240
at home.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.407
So Sergio, who's actually
retired at the time,

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.740
starts thinking about how he
can come out of retirement.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.490
He was super depressed,
not talking to people,

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.760
not interacting with people.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.600
So he and his wife opened
this stall in 2012.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.240
But when you see a lot
of these fast food,

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.750
street food stalls opening
to provide Roman flavors

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.570
repackaged in a way that is
so respectful of tradition

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:39.940
and so much a part of the
natural flow and evolution

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.260
of dishes and his stall-- which
is box 85 at the Testaccio

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:44.860
Market--

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.690
now is packed, even during
the so-called Lucifer heatwave

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:50.230
that we had.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.100
You couldn't get near the place.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.599
People are all about
hot sandwiches,

00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:53.800
even in July in Rome now.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.850
The Trapizzino.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.910
Tramezzino is triangular
sandwich made with white bread

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.760
with the crust cut off-- pizza.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.480
So when you combine the name
tramezzino and the word pizza,

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.560
you get trapizzino.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.750
It's pizza stuffed with things.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:16.280
In this case, tongue with
green sauce in the middle--

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.700
green sauce is this
very herbal parsley

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.270
sauce with garlic, capers,
anchovies-- really typical

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.260
of Piedmont.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.720
So this is a reminder
that the King of Italy

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.360
came from Piedmont in 1870.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.750
And it's dressed over
this beautifully seasoned

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.230
simmered tongue.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:38.150
And so here again, you've got
this Roman pizza innovation

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.120
or sandwich innovation that
merges an accepted form--

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.260
the pizza by the slice--

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.880
with local flavors.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.730
And it makes a really
portable, really inexpensive,

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.480
new packaging for Roman food.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.900
So let's end on a bitter note.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:59.190
Cocktails used to be
really limited in Rome.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.670
Certainly, when I first
started visiting in the '90s,

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.090
you could get a mojito
or a caipirinha.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.650
There were a lot
of liquor companies

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.200
that were investing
in Roman nightlife.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.280
But in 2009, a team of Romans--

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.660
after spending time in
the Caribbean and Mexico,

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.740
Northern Europe--

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.160
decided to create this
new space for cocktails,

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:29.380
one that, at first, was modeled
on London and New York cocktail

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.196
culture.

00:33:30.196 --> 00:33:31.820
It was called the
Jerry Thomas Project.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.180
So the first
celebrity bartender.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.890
Pre-prohibition is
the namesake there.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.700
And then, over the course
of the past several years,

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.046
the team behind the Jerry
Thomas Project has started to,

00:33:44.046 --> 00:33:45.670
not just acknowledge,
but really invest

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.790
in the bitter flavors
that define the spirits

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.300
tradition of Central Italy.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.250
So there's a lot of amaro,
all sorts of herbal infusions.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.680
They now are involved in a
distillery in Piedmont that

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.270
makes very classic
turn-of-the-20th century

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.560
cordials and aperitifs
and even vermouths.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.090
And so at the Jerry
Thomas Project

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.124
today, you might have
to knock on the door

00:34:09.124 --> 00:34:10.540
and have to do the
whole speakeasy

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.030
thing that's very familiar
to you guys in the Bay Area.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:19.380
But the flavors in the glass
are fully Italian, fully Roman.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.080
So thank you guys so much.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.732
I'm happy to answer any
questions that you have.

00:34:25.732 --> 00:34:27.440
SPEAKER: So we have
a question from Luke.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.440
Italians are increasingly
concerned about long term

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.989
residents in places like
Rome's historic center being

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:36.350
pushed out by Airbnb
and similar services.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.070
What should be done about it?

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.280
And what can well-meaning
American tourists

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.070
do to be part of the solution?

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.380
KATIE: That is such
a good question.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.159
I can provide an anecdotal
response to this.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:52.085
Rome's historic center
before Airbnb was--

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:58.040
it was really dis-inhabited.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.760
And I don't recall
the exact figure,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.676
but I think somewhere
between like a quarter--

00:35:01.676 --> 00:35:04.790
or maybe even up to a 1/3 of the
real estate was not lived in--

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.330
but instead was possessed
by family groups that

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.030
for a variety of
inheritance laws and things

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.990
might have disproportionate
shares of the apartment

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.420
ownership and might not
agree what to do with it.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.050
So many families
I know today have

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.040
agreed that they do want the
income that Airbnb allows them.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.260
And in a complex
economy, a little bit

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.480
of extra money flowing into
Roman pockets is appreciated.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.240
There are a lot of
legal problems in Rome

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.560
about this and tax issues.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.350
And I know that the
discussion will be ongoing.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:49.170
But I would say when it comes
to what some people think

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.450
is like the controversial
Airbnb economy,

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.160
I would say stay
outside of the center.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.150
Rome's historical center
is, from an area standpoint,

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.720
10% of the city or less.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.730
Stay in neighborhoods like the
Ostiense district, Trionfale,

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.700
where your presence isn't
going to be contributing

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.220
to the degradation
of neighborhoods.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.450
I used to live in Monte.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.616
I couldn't get out of that
neighborhood fast enough,

00:36:17.616 --> 00:36:20.340
because it was
purely Airbnb B and

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.300
tourist-oriented businesses.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.530
What I do love is
that many people--

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:30.600
and I suggest this when people
contact me on Twitter or via

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.290
my website--

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.032
stay in Testaccio or stay
in Southern Trastevere

00:36:36.032 --> 00:36:37.740
away from all the
tourists, if you really

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.194
want to be in Trastevere or
stay in Monteverde Vecchio

00:36:41.194 --> 00:36:43.110
So you're close to the
center, but you're also

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.040
close to markets.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.980
And you can contribute to
the local economy by cooking.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.310
And I've got a lot of resources
on how you can purchase

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.820
from people rather
than corporations, when

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.760
it comes to doing food
shopping and things like that.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.360
SPEAKER: There's a great food
market in Monteverde Vecchio,

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.490
which is really convenient.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.850
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that
the whole pasta course followed

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:06.560
by the main course thing isn't
really what people do everyday

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.349
anymore.

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:09.140
Do restaurants still
assume that people do,

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.098
because I still see many
is organized that way?

00:37:11.098 --> 00:37:13.940
KATIE: Great
question-- menus still

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.350
are structured in the anti
pasto, primo, secondo,

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:23.840
cantorno, dolce order, but
restaurants in the center

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.480
and beyond the center
both acknowledge

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.540
that Romans and visitors
alike are not going

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.430
to eat all of those courses.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:36.800
And there are few signals
that demonstrate that.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.410
Now, when you make a booking
at a Roman restaurant,

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.390
you have to tell them
what time you're coming--

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.690
used to just say, I'm going
to be at whatever [ITALIAN]

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.160
at 8PM.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.740
And now, you have
to say 7:30 or 9:30.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.770
So they acknowledge that locals
and visitors are both spending

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.300
less time at the table.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.060
They're definitely buying less
wine, lingering shorter amount

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.020
of time.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.457
And the pasta
portions have grown,

00:37:58.457 --> 00:38:00.290
and this is not just
in the tourist centers,

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:01.570
but everywhere.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:06.200
Let's say pre-2006, 2007, the
pasta portions at restaurants

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.690
were like 65 to 85 grams.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:14.000
Now, there are 125 to
150 grams, because people

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.100
need to fill tables
at the restaurants.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.322
So many restaurant
owners have started

00:38:18.322 --> 00:38:19.780
to grow the portions
that they know

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.430
people are going to
invest in and that

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.820
provide them a larger margin--

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.360
more margin on a big plate
of pasta than on a big steak.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.970
SPEAKER: Somewhat
related-- for folks

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.939
who are going to Rome, what
would be the perfect dinner?

00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:36.730
Where would you go?

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.970
What would you order?

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.730
KATIE: OK, so can I say
the whole perfect day?

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.270
OK.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.040
SPEAKER: Yes, please.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:49.500
KATIE: I would start with
coffee at Sciascia in Prati.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.900
I would go over to
the Trionfale Market

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.170
and do a little shopping there.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.720
That's, by the way, just three
blocks north of the Vatican

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.660
but a profoundly Roman district
not destroyed by tourism.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.130
It's really wonderful.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:05.250
I would have a slice of pizza,
potato pizza with mozzarella

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:06.120
at Pizzarium.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.580
And then, head over
to Panificio Bonci

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:13.890
for either a tomato filled
with rice or roasted chicken--

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.400
both really, really
excellent at that bakery

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.080
still in the Trionfale district.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:25.645
I would then go to the gym
and go for a cocktail at Litro

00:39:25.645 --> 00:39:31.800
in Monteverde Vecchio, before
heading to dinner at Cesare al

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.480
Casaletto where I would have all
the fried starters and pajata

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.160
and I would have
the figatelli, which

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.310
are the roasted pork livers.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.280
And then, I would go
for an amaro at Roscioli

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.230
back in the center of Rome.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.180
SPEAKER: One more
question from the Dory,

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.490
you've busted the myth
that Romans are all

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.200
devoted to local produce.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.920
California cuisine started
with chefs like Alice Waters,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.890
importing the Italian
and French tradition

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.720
of fresh local ingredients.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.220
Is it time for Italy
to re-import this?

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.670
Any tips for finding high
quality local ingredients

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.200
in Rome?

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.720
KATIE: The economy
is complicated now.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.450
And the way that supermarkets
and big box places like Italy

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:20.270
have managed to make
certain food systems really

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:22.520
efficient for those
larger businesses

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.910
has undermined the
economic stability

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:29.510
of the local marketplace.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.270
In 09', we started to have
our first farmers markets.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:34.760
Now, in the center of Rome,
we have almost no farmer's

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.390
markets.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.630
It was just something
that wasn't sustainable.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:42.890
Farms weren't able
to really do business

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.750
in a way that
justified them spending

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:49.010
their weekends in the
[SPEAKING ITALIAN],, which

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:53.144
is where there was really
a wonderful market.

00:40:53.144 --> 00:40:54.560
I have a lot of
resources on where

00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:00.080
you can go to purchase
awesome local produce,

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.690
but I would say the
Trionfale Market is

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.420
the best, most concentrated
number of farmers

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.220
that have direct sales.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.090
The southern part of the market,
close to the fishmongers,

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.580
has a couple of
dozen farmers stalls

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.350
labeled with those
big green banners

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.650
that let you know this
is vendita diretta--

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.110
direct sale of produce.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:26.180
Places like La Tradizione
for Italian cheeses--

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.820
Romans haven't really embraced
their local cheese production.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.870
A place like Dol
di Origine Laziale

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:37.070
is one really amazing place
that acknowledges that Lazio

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.620
has really wonderful food.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.280
Whereas, if you inquired another
deli, they'll be like oh,

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.900
no one wants
anything from Lazio.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.360
What about something
from Emilia Romagna?

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.060
Is it time for Rome and
other parts of Italy

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:55.150
to start focusing on local,
seasonal, sustainable things

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.530
again?

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.610
Yeah, but it's a very expensive
endeavor by Rome standards.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.290
I don't know the
Romans statistics,

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.799
but the average Italian
family spends 400 euros--

00:42:07.799 --> 00:42:08.590
a little bit more--

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.520
412 euros a month on groceries
for a family of three.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.630
That may not seem like a
lot in Bay Area figures,

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.390
but that is a huge
amount in terms

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.410
of Italian or Roman incomes.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.850
There are lots of urban
gardens, especially

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.810
affiliated with more
left-wing political groups,

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:34.870
especially in urban areas
that have been systematically

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:37.636
disregarded by the local
governments of Rome--

00:42:37.636 --> 00:42:38.760
the various municipalities.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.470
So that's another way to
rejuvenate those things.

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:45.490
But until the city itself, which
is really involved in the food

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.910
system, starts investing
in food spaces that

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:52.450
are accessible to everyone,
I'm not super optimistic

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.750
that there's going to be a huge
Alice Water-style revolution.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.370
We do have an Alice
Water-style revolution in Rome.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.970
It's called the Rome
Sustainable Food Project.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:05.040
It's really unusual for
Rome because the kitchen,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.340
which is in the
American Academy,

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.067
is mostly teaching kitchen.

00:43:09.067 --> 00:43:11.150
Most of the people that
work in there are interns.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.024
A lot of them actually
come from Chez Panisse

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:14.600
or are destined
for Chez Panisse.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.760
And all of the food
that is cooked there

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.360
comes from a really
small number of farms.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:25.040
And maximum distance
is like 150 miles.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.962
Some of the things
come from Tuscany,

00:43:26.962 --> 00:43:28.670
but most everything
is coming from Lazio.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.170
It's so expensive
to source things

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:34.430
locally, that it takes
a well-funded benefactor

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.140
to do something like that.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.650
And take a walk around Rome in
the morning, like at 10:00 AM.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.200
There's a ton of frozen
food truck traffic.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.957
It's cheaper to have junk.

00:43:44.957 --> 00:43:47.040
AUDIENCE: I'm originally
from Rome and sometimes--

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.260
Chao!

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.940
And sometimes, my
American friends

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.500
ask me what's the
dish from Rome?

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.310
I struggle to answer
that question,

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.840
because there's so
much that I like.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.640
What would your answer be?

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.910
KATIE: What's the Roman dish is
such a hard question to answer,

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.461
because I think it depends
on the time of year.

00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:05.960
If your friends are
going in August,

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.670
you probably don't want to
tell them to eat carbonara,

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:09.980
because then they will
dislike you afterwards.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.950
It will be really uncomfortable
to eat that heavy food.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.650
But I think that there
are a set of dishes.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.800
I'll tell you my five bites.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.140
You have to have a pasta
dish, so like cacio

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.020
e pepe or carbonara at
a place like Roscioli.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.470
Pizza by the slice is as
Roman as any other dish.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:32.150
So for a really classic
one, Aintoco Forno Roscioli,

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.420
or for like a more
evolved one, Pizzarium.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.890
That brisket sandwich at the
Trionfale Market is amazing.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:44.150
Some offal, either
pajata or figatelli

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.850
tripe at Cesare al Casaletto.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.870
And then, a gelato--

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:53.880
that's a meal-- come on.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.540
Um, by the way, my website
has all these resources

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.897
like top pastas.

00:44:57.897 --> 00:45:00.230
If you only want eat pizza--
let's say your friends only

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.521
care about pizza-- there's
the Lucky Peach Pizza Guide.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.090
Just warn them-- bring
their Lipitor or whatever

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:12.740
cholesterol-busting medication
they have access to.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.380
But yeah, I see Rome
really as a combination

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.634
of different types of foods.

00:45:16.634 --> 00:45:18.300
And if you're just
going to restaurants,

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.940
you're only getting
a small fraction

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.294
of what the city has to offer.

00:45:22.294 --> 00:45:23.960
AUDIENCE: I had just
one other question.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.730
That's more like a
selfish question.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:28.730
It's hard here in the US
to find some products--

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.660
or at least in an
affordable way--

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.660
I'm just thinking five
slices of prosciutto

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.630
at the supermarket are
$6, so that's crazy.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.110
What do you think of Italy as
a grocery chain, like quality,

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:40.520
price, and all that?

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.640
Is that something that you
find decent all over the world

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.490
or is it just marketing?

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:52.110
KATIE: I find the products
at Italy really vary.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.170
When it comes to
prosciutto and things,

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:59.430
there's this really wonderful
family-run salami business,

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:00.450
Salumeria Biellese.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.700
As the name implies, they
are from Biella, originally,

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.790
but they're based in like
New Jersey or New York.

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:08.910
So you can find really
awesome stuff there.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.220
I would say when it comes
to cooking or eating

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.230
in a Roman spirit, I
don't think you always

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.170
have to go to an
Italian source for that.

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:21.010
There are country
hams in Appalachia,

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.050
that when you
taste them, they're

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.215
like ethereal and
really exquisite.

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:26.590
And they taste
like they could be

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:30.780
from San Daniele or some
really refined prosciutto

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.140
maker in Friuli.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.320
Eating everything in
this book is expensive.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.130
So if you want to recreate
those things at home,

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.920
grow your own stuff if you can.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.510
There's a whole
resource section that

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:49.390
has different suggestions
on where to find things.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.340
Italy is listed
there but then, also,

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.390
Bonne Italia in Chelsea
Market, Formaggio Kitchen,

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:59.350
in Cambridge,
Zingerman's in Michigan.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.450
And know that some things
are worth investing in

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.180
and others not so much.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.370
Invest in pasta.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:10.900
Make pasta the meal.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.700
And it feels so
bad to say this--

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.770
buy that $10 packet of pasta,
because the grain that's

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.050
in there, the way it's
dried, the way that it's

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.290
been conceived is a
vastly different product

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:26.710
than the Barilla packet.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:30.440
SPEAKER: So you are in town
working on your next cookbook

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.360
about Southern Italy.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.410
Can you tell us a
bit more about that?

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:36.940
KATIE: Absolutely, so
the creatively titled,

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.460
untitled South
Italy cookbook will

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.900
be published by Clarkson
Potter in February 2019.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.690
So we're shooting it very early.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.580
But something that has
been really amazing

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.270
is cooking Southern Italian
style in the Bay Area,

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.640
where you have these
spectacular tomatoes

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.900
and peppers and all sorts
of octopi and sardines

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.600
and great things that I
probably couldn't even

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.580
find that high quality in
Rome to be quite honest.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.290
So that's been really cool.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:12.440
The book is 85 recipes and
focuses on the south of Italy,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.492
which I define as the southern
peninsula, excluding Sicily.

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:17.200
There are a lot of
great books on Sicily.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.490
I can recommend some of those.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:22.780
But my book is going to focus
on Molise, Campania, Basilicata,

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.480
Calabria, and Puglia.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.700
And the dishes are mostly
the vanishing, lost,

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.700
and disappearing dishes.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.949
Remember when I talked about
all those people escaping

00:48:32.949 --> 00:48:35.050
from the economy of the south.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.940
It happened actually
in two phases

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.780
in the late 19th, early 20th
century, and then in the 60s.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.480
And that left a lot
of villages vacant.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.660
It left a lot of
farms abandoned.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:52.780
And so the recipes seek either
to specifically document

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.140
a lost dish or a vanishing
dish or traditional dish

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.600
or to modify a dish, so that
you'll actually cook it.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.141
So for example,
there's this one dish

00:49:00.141 --> 00:49:01.870
that has 16 different
types of beans,

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.500
that have to be soaked
separately and cooked

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.170
separately and no one
is going to do that--

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.150
not anymore, especially
in like a cauldron

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.850
in their backyard in
the middle of Mattera--

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:13.990
not going to happen.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.600
But you can cook some things
together, soak some things

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.141
together, and then
marry the flavors,

00:49:18.141 --> 00:49:20.710
so actually make something
that you'll make at home--

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.450
honor these traditions.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.690
That's just one example,
but the cookbook

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:27.910
is supposed to be
like a travel guide

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:31.090
and a document and a cookbook.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.480
And I really am desperate
for all of you guys

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.460
to go to South Italy.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.520
It's super amazing
in all the ways.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.000
And its vast, so if
you like archeology,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.580
you've got the whole Bay of
Naples area that's awesome.

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.550
If you're into hiking, the
awesome alpinine things.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.545
If you like the sea,
Cilento is super rad.

00:49:52.545 --> 00:49:53.920
There's like all
this cool stuff.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.580
So the book will come
out in early 2019,

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.420
but I'll be putting out all
sorts of free resources,

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.360
so that like--

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.480
oh, I really want to eat this
Gallipoli-style sardine dish.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.290
Oh, I know exactly where
to go, where to rent a car,

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:12.299
and what else to do in Gallipoli
based on those free resources.

00:50:12.299 --> 00:50:13.840
AUDIENCE: At the
start, you mentioned

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.090
that you've also
been exploring some

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:17.914
of the beer culture in Italy.

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.330
Can you talk some
more about that?

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:25.570
KATIE: Of course, beer has
ancient roots in Italy.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:26.850
The Etruscans brewed beer.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:28.724
And then, there was a
really, really long gap

00:50:28.724 --> 00:50:30.760
that the Romans
weren't so into it.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.880
And we really start
to see a rebirth

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.210
of beer culture, industrial beer
culture, in the north of Italy

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.430
and in Rome, by
the Peroni factory

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:41.350
in the late 19th,
early 20th century.

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.390
And for the next
century or so, it's

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:48.190
industrial pilsners, lagers,
and stuff that dominate.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:51.460
And then, as all
things Italian, there

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.910
is this like Genesis story,
which is not totally accurate,

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:55.980
but it is a fun one.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:59.000
And it states in like 1996, Teo
Musso of the Baladin Brewing

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.890
Company founded craft
brewing in Italy.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.290
There already was some
craft brewing going on,

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:07.660
but he's this very
compelling figure

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:12.950
who does not feel limited
by traditional style.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:15.490
So some of his beers
are like archeo beers,

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:18.070
which study with this
awesome dude, Dr. Pat

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.590
McGovern from the
University of Pennsylvania--

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:24.430
the remnants of beer
excavations, fermentation

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:26.200
exclamations from ancient times.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.380
And recreates flavors for
a modern Italian public

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.080
based on historical traditions.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.070
There was also, not just Teo
Musso, but also Leonardo da

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.240
Vincenzo and all
sorts of brewers--

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:44.050
Birrificio Italiano,
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]..

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.360
They're sometimes
style-based, like drawing

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.890
from your Northern
European styles

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.050
and, sometimes,
ingredient-based.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:53.030
My favorite brewer, in
fact, uses a lot of fruit

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.910
and a lot of wine grapes to give
the beer a sense of terroir.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.804
In Rome, the brew is, by
the way, called Loverbeer.

00:51:59.804 --> 00:52:01.720
Which is also the funniest
brewery name ever--

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.450
Loverbirra.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:08.200
So there is this new--

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.040
let's say, in 2009
onwards, we see craft beer

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.430
is mainstream in Rome.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.120
And that's when Open Baladin
opens in the center of town.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.730
There's already stuff going
on as early as 2001 at

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.260
[SPEAKING ITALIAN].

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.930
By the way, all of these
places are listed somewhere

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:23.870
in the book.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.130
I know I'm throwing out
a lot of Italian words.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.160
But Rome is the craft beer
consumption capital of Italy.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.960
Milan is a close second.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.540
And it's one of those few
businesses, food or otherwise,

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.330
where there is
innovation and creativity

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:44.070
and where it's not exactly
cheap to enter the industry.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.320
But a lot of people
start as home brewers.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.280
They're engineers.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.100
They don't want to
be engineers anymore.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.100
They want to be brewers.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.170
They get some money,
pool resources,

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.210
and then open breweries.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:57.400
So now, we've got well over
1,000 craft breweries in Italy,

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.650
including some in the
outskirts of Rome.

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.370
And one craft--
well, one brewpub--

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:06.030
it's not a craft pub--
but one brew pub in Prati.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:08.400
SPEAKER: Thank you so much,
Katie, for joining us.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.540
Such a pleasure.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.790
And thank you all
on the live stream

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.260
and those of you attending.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.160
KATIE: Thanks, guys.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.310
[APPLAUSE]
