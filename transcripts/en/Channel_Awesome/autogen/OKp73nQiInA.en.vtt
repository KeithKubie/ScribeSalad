00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.440
and they kind of move like that so
there's times where they move really

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450
there's times where they move really
 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.150
there's times where they move really
fluently and really beautifully at other

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
fluently and really beautifully at other
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.039
fluently and really beautifully at other
times they'll move really choppy but

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049
times they'll move really choppy but
 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.690
times they'll move really choppy but
it's intentional well they did a really

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700
it's intentional well they did a really
 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.150
it's intentional well they did a really
neat trick which was they made it look

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
neat trick which was they made it look
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.920
neat trick which was they made it look
like a stop-motion film a by giving the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
like a stop-motion film a by giving the
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.020
like a stop-motion film a by giving the
Legos like real texture so really looks

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030
Legos like real texture so really looks
 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.720
Legos like real texture so really looks
like somebody just built all this stuff

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730
like somebody just built all this stuff
 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.920
like somebody just built all this stuff
and the second thing they did was they

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
and the second thing they did was they
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.350
and the second thing they did was they
dropped the frame rate so it feels like

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360
dropped the frame rate so it feels like
 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.000
dropped the frame rate so it feels like
a stop-motion film it doesn't feel like

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010
a stop-motion film it doesn't feel like
 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.460
a stop-motion film it doesn't feel like
fluid CGI animation and so when you're

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
fluid CGI animation and so when you're
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.780
fluid CGI animation and so when you're
watching it it just looks like you're

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790
watching it it just looks like you're
 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.370
watching it it just looks like you're
watching a Lego stop-motion film it's

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380
watching a Lego stop-motion film it's
 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.680
watching a Lego stop-motion film it's
skipping frames like a stop-motion movie

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690
skipping frames like a stop-motion movie
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.180
skipping frames like a stop-motion movie

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100
feels like some of it was almost improv
 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.880
feels like some of it was almost improv
you know I'm sure most of it was just

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890
you know I'm sure most of it was just
 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.460

yeah the dialogue sounds very improvised
let's very quick improv and even the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870
let's very quick improv and even the
 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.270
let's very quick improv and even the
stuff they put together you'd almost

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280
stuff they put together you'd almost
 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.530
stuff they put together you'd almost
where they just sort of made up on the

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540
where they just sort of made up on the
 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.580
where they just sort of made up on the
spot but of course they can't they have

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590
spot but of course they can't they have
 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.140
spot but of course they can't they have
animated and a lot of this stuff is very

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150
animated and a lot of this stuff is very
 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.790
animated and a lot of this stuff is very
complicated to put together uh

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800
complicated to put together uh
 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.490
complicated to put together uh

anyways but the way they did it I'm like

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770
anyways but the way they did it I'm like
 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.160

probably could because they did it with

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770
probably could because they did it with
 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.370
probably could because they did it with
individually rendered Legos yeah so it's

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380
individually rendered Legos yeah so it's
 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.990
individually rendered Legos yeah so it's
which I'm sure the programmer was having

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000
which I'm sure the programmer was having
 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.150
which I'm sure the programmer was having
a field day with that like some fish

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160
a field day with that like some fish
 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.770
a field day with that like some fish
it's impressive from an animation

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780
it's impressive from an animation
 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.710
it's impressive from an animation
standpoint surprisingly uh and then I

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720
standpoint surprisingly uh and then I
 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.660
standpoint surprisingly uh and then I
think it's impressive from an animation

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670
think it's impressive from an animation
 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.240
think it's impressive from an animation
and it's impressive from a community

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250
and it's impressive from a community
 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.190
and it's impressive from a community
standpoint because I mean I can think of

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200
standpoint because I mean I can think of
 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.250
standpoint because I mean I can think of
uh and like I said the story actually

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260
uh and like I said the story actually
 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.380
uh and like I said the story actually
does work to but we can't

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390
does work to but we can't
 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.030
does work to but we can't
again we can't say why without ruining

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040
again we can't say why without ruining
 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.400
again we can't say why without ruining
it uh but even if you're watching like

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410
it uh but even if you're watching like
 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.930
it uh but even if you're watching like
that getting into the story the comedy

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940
that getting into the story the comedy
 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.650
that getting into the story the comedy
is so funny uh in

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660
is so funny uh in
 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.260
is so funny uh in
just how energized and positive and fast

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270
just how energized and positive and fast
 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.140
just how energized and positive and fast
well yeah you know it just anywhere but

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150
well yeah you know it just anywhere but
 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.470
well yeah you know it just anywhere but
kind of an without the twist it's still

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480
kind of an without the twist it's still
 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.760
kind of an without the twist it's still
one of them far it's go would have been

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770
one of them far it's go would have been
 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.260
one of them far it's go would have been
fun the twist gives it sort of a sense

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270
fun the twist gives it sort of a sense
 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.540
fun the twist gives it sort of a sense
of meaning to it that elevates it a bit

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550
of meaning to it that elevates it a bit
 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.920
of meaning to it that elevates it a bit
but I mean even if I'm thinking like

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930
but I mean even if I'm thinking like
 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.360
but I mean even if I'm thinking like
what if you remove the twist this is

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370
what if you remove the twist this is
 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.380
what if you remove the twist this is
just straight-up story I'm like I still

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390
just straight-up story I'm like I still
 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.210
just straight-up story I'm like I still
