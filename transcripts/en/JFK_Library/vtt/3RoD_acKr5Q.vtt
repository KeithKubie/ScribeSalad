00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.342
- He grew up in the 1930s.

00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:06.594
To some extent, he has this
kind of Manichean worldview

00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:11.378
that sees the rise of fascism
and Nazism on one side,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:15.437
Stalinism on the other side,
and kind of Rooseveltian

00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:18.689
democracy as a kind of
a beacon in the middle.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.784
So by the time you get to the '40s,

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:22.563
having worked in a recess,

00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:25.806
seen penetration by people
like Maurice Halperin,

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:30.359
who he worked with, who most
certainly was a Soviet agent.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.203
He recognizes that you have to find a way

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:38.485
for the non-communist left
and the non-fascist right,

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:42.568
to work together in a way
that excludes extremes.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:46.835
I think it's one of the
reasons that there's been

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:50.423
a lot more interest in that
book, The Vital Center,

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:54.064
recently because there's a
sense in which it resonates

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:57.930
because it speaks so strongly
about the Democratic project.
