00:00:00.262 --> 00:00:02.358
In the last two videos, we've been slowly

00:00:02.358 --> 00:00:05.779
building up our aggregate
demand-aggregate supply

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.153
model and the whole point of us doing this

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:09.420
is so that we can give

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.613
an explanation of why we have these

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:14.667
short run economic cycles
and we don't just have

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.535
this nice steady march
of economic growth due to

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:20.872
population increases and
productivity improvement.

00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:22.864
It's important to
realize and it's probably

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:25.074
important to realize this
for all of what we study

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:27.653
in micro and macro economics
that this is really

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:30.584
just a model.

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:33.336
In order for to use
these models, we have to

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:37.489
make huge, huge
simplifications and you really

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.572
should always view these models with a

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:40.307
critical eye.

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:41.744
This is just one way to view it.

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:42.873
You might not agree with it.

00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:44.606
You might think it's
an over simplification.

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:46.429
You might want to modify it in some way.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.271
It's very important that
you just view it only

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:51.095
as a model and the reason
why we do that is so

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.834
that we can start to
describe very, very, very

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:56.774
complicated things with
fairly simple graphs

00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:58.749
and mathematics so that
we can get our brain

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.132
around something as
complicated as the economy.

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:03.747
Something that has hundreds
of millions of actors,

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:06.080
each of them with tens
of billions of neurons

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.809
in their brain and doing
all sorts of crazy things.

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:10.866
We're able to distill
it down to simple lines

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.347
and curves and equations.

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:15.935
Now in the last video,
we looked a little bit at

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.850
the long run aggregate supply.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.068
Aggregate supply in the long run.

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:26.519
In the ADAS model, we
assumed that in the long run,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.476
the real productivity
of the economy really

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.483
doesn't depend on price,
that price is really just

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:33.270
a numeric thing and in
the long run, people will

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.068
just adjust to producing
or the economy will

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:38.069
just adjust to producing
what it's capable of

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.406
comfortably producing.

00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:42.867
Now there's one thing
I want to stress here.

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:46.338
This is not the maximum
productivity of the economy.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:49.140
You could view this as the natural;

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.472
let me put it this way.

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:53.469
You could view this as the,
so this right over here,

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.293
you could view it as the natural output.

00:01:56.293 --> 00:02:00.374
Natural, the natural real
output of the economy.

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:02.739
When I say natural, it means that there's

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.631
always going to be some
inefficiencies in the

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.555
economy; people are going
to be switching jobs.

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:09.353
They might have to retrain.

00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:11.666
There's always going to
be turnover in things.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.875
Some people pass away
in a job and then they

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:15.474
have to hire other people.

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:17.541
There's some normal or natural rate of

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:19.475
unemployment.

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:21.676
In most economies, people aren't working

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:22.671
night and day.

00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.669
They want to take some time off.

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.903
They want to be able to rest.

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:28.198
Because of other
interventions, there aren't

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:31.334
perfect efficiencies in
the economy as a whole.

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:34.813
This is just a natural
healthy level of output.

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:37.272
There is some theoretical level of output.

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:39.567
I'll draw that here.

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:42.265
This is maybe some
theoretical level of output

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:44.823
that you could maybe
view as maximum output.

00:02:44.823 --> 00:02:47.669
Maybe I'll draw it right over here.

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.067
This right over here
might be maximum output.

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.562
Maximum, given the population and the

00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:56.277
technology that the population has,

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:58.295
this is some type of
theoretical thing and it

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:00.477
would be very hard to actually quantify.

00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:04.303
People were just working all out.

00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:05.765
They weren't taking vacations.

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:08.031
They weren't sleeping properly.

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:11.663
Every person was working in the place that

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:14.151
they could be the most
productive, then maybe

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:16.737
you would have some
output over here which is

00:03:16.737 --> 00:03:19.071
kind of impossible to achieve.

00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:20.811
This is something below
that, kind of a nice

00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:24.532
healthy level of output for the economy.

00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:26.482
Now what we're going to
talk about in this video

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:29.817
is aggregate supply in
the short run and what

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:32.340
we're going to see is
for this model to work,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.943
for the aggregate
demand-aggregate supply model

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.611
to work, we have to
assume an upward sloping

00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:41.151
aggregate supply curve in the short run.

00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:43.266
It might look something like this.

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:46.946
It might look something
like this and obviously,

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:49.879
it would; actually let me do it this way.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.802
Let's assume that this
is our current level of

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:55.629
prices are sitting right over here.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.430
This is our long run aggregate supply.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.000
It's not depending on
prices; it's just a natural

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.884
level of output, but in
the short run it might

00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:03.475
look something like this.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.802
I'll do it in pink.

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:08.632
In the short run, it might
look something like this.

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:11.739
As I'm toting it up
because obviously we can

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.557
never get past that
optimal, so what's going on

00:04:14.557 --> 00:04:17.882
here, what's going on in this curve -

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.960
I drew a dotted line because
it's easier for me to

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.541
draw something as a
dotted line when I draw

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.936
it as a straight curve.
My hand always shakes too

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:28.669
much - so this is the
aggregate supply in the

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.010
short run.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.038
We'll see we need it to
be upward sloping for

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:36.066
this model to provide
a basis of explanation

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:39.019
for economic cycles
and there's a couple of

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:41.134
explanations or a couple
of, you could really

00:04:41.134 --> 00:04:43.807
view them as theories,
for why we can justify

00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:47.392
an upward sloping aggregate supply curve.

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:49.073
The one way to think
about it and before I even

00:04:49.073 --> 00:04:51.269
justify why it could be
upward sloping, what an

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:52.943
upward sloping curve is
saying is look, this is

00:04:52.943 --> 00:04:57.174
just when people are nicely
... They're producing

00:04:57.174 --> 00:04:58.474
at their natural rate.

00:04:58.474 --> 00:05:00.209
There's going to be
some unemployment in the

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:02.542
economy at this level right over here.

00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:05.138
For whatever reason, this
upward curve is saying

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:10.141
if prices go up, if prices go up, then the

00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:12.877
economy as a whole is
going to produce beyond

00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:14.212
that natural rate.

00:05:14.212 --> 00:05:18.204
Maybe it's going to bring
in people from other

00:05:18.204 --> 00:05:19.802
parts or I guess you
could say it's going to

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:21.871
suck people in to the
labor pool who might not

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.540
have been in the labor
pool to work a little

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.469
bit harder.

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.207
Maybe they feel they can
do a little bit better now.

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:29.212
It might convince factories
to run a little bit

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:30.135
longer.

00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:32.934
It might convince people
to take fewer vacations.

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:36.137
The opposite might be
true if prices go down.

00:05:36.137 --> 00:05:37.956
An upward sloping curve
is saying that if prices,

00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:40.602
aggregate prices - Now
this isn't just prices

00:05:40.602 --> 00:05:43.060
in one good or service
- if aggregate price is

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.370
going down, it's saying
in the economy as a whole

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.136
people might be incented
to work a little bit less.

00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:50.820
People might drop out of the labor pool.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.166
In the short run, remember
this is all in the

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:55.294
short run, they might drop
out of the labor pool.

00:05:55.294 --> 00:05:56.960
They might not run
their factories all out.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.544
They might take more
vacations, whatever else.

00:05:59.544 --> 00:06:01.879
Now let's think about what our plausible

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.073
justifications for an
upward sloping aggregate

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.999
supply curve.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.331
The first one is often
called the misperception

00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:13.246
theory; let me write it in white.

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:19.740
It's the misperception
theory and it kind of makes

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.534
sense to me that if the
aggregate; let's think

00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:23.709
about a situation where
the aggregate prices are

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:24.962
going up.

00:06:24.962 --> 00:06:26.674
Aggregate prices are going up.

00:06:26.674 --> 00:06:28.545
If I'm an individual
actor there, maybe I run

00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:31.735
a firm of some kind, I
might not notice immediately

00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:34.134
that it's aggregate
prices that are going up.

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:36.473
I might just think that
prices for my goods or

00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:37.871
services are going up.

00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:39.795
I might think that it's actually a micro

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:42.039
economic phenomenon going on.

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.287
I'm misperceiving it
as a micro phenomenon.

00:06:45.287 --> 00:06:48.379
That's something that's
going on in my market.

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.409
If I think and this goes
back to the micro economics,

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:53.936
if I think that prices for
my goods and services are

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.763
going up relative to others and remember

00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:57.003
this is a misperception,

00:06:57.003 --> 00:06:59.165
all prices are going up,
but if I think this is

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:01.407
happening in the short run then the law of

00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:03.120
supply kicks in.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.944
Then the law of supply kicks in which is a

00:07:06.944 --> 00:07:09.243
micro economic concept that if I feel that

00:07:09.243 --> 00:07:11.913
real prices - And it's
not real prices. It's

00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:13.337
actually nominal prices
- but if I think my

00:07:13.337 --> 00:07:17.852
relative prices are
increasing, I'm motivated

00:07:17.852 --> 00:07:18.803
to produce more.

00:07:18.803 --> 00:07:21.080
I think I'm going to be more profitable.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.408
It only takes a little
bit of time for me to

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.797
realize that all my costs are going up,

00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:26.337
what I can purchase
with my profits are all

00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:27.408
going up.

00:07:27.408 --> 00:07:29.492
In real terms, I'm actually
not getting any better

00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:32.756
and then I'll probably
settle in back to my

00:07:32.756 --> 00:07:34.310
regular level of productivity.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.087
While I think people are
demanding more of Sal's

00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:39.076
sprockets or whatever
I'm seeing, I'll start

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:40.157
working over time.

00:07:40.157 --> 00:07:43.939
I might want to hire more
people, run the factories

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:47.736
beyond even a level that
I might defer maintenance

00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:49.913
so that I can run the
factories longer and all

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:51.823
the rest, but then over
time I'm going to realize

00:07:51.823 --> 00:07:54.202
that I was just misperceiving things.

00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:55.540
Everything has gotten more expensive.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.210
I'm not making in real
terms an outsized profit

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.141
right now.

00:07:59.141 --> 00:08:04.464
Then my level of productivity
might actually go back.

00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:06.954
When I talk about me,
it's not me by myself

00:08:06.954 --> 00:08:08.705
that's moving this whole economy.

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:10.343
Remember I'm just talking
about one actor, but this

00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:13.141
might be true of many,
many, many actors in

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:15.547
acting in aggregate so
as a whole, they might

00:08:15.547 --> 00:08:18.062
want to increase productivity
and then when they

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:19.871
realize that in real
terms they're actually not

00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:22.379
making any more money and that this isn't

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:24.820
sustainable, they'll go
back to their natural

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.542
level of output.

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:28.856
The other theory that you'll read about in

00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:31.460
economic textbooks, another
theory or explanation

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.809
or justification why
we would have an upward

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:37.685
sloping aggregate supply
curve in the short run

00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:40.913
is sometimes it's called
the sticky wages theory.

00:08:40.913 --> 00:08:42.802
Sticky wages.

00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:47.204
I like to extend it to sticky cost theory.

00:08:47.204 --> 00:08:49.075
Sometimes they'll
articulate a separate one

00:08:49.075 --> 00:08:51.672
called sticky prices,
but in my mind these are

00:08:51.672 --> 00:08:54.538
all very similar, so sticky
wages, sticky costs and

00:08:54.538 --> 00:08:55.631
sticky prices.

00:08:55.631 --> 00:08:58.539
Sticky, sticky prices.

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:01.906
It's the general idea
that even if in aggregate

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:04.008
prices are increasing,
so in the whole economy

00:09:04.008 --> 00:09:06.881
prices are increasing, in
all parts of the economy

00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:09.209
they all won't increase at the same rate.

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:10.361
There are parts of the economy

00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:13.045
where the prices might
be stickier than other

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:14.660
places and there's multiple reasons why

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.960
prices could be sticky.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.343
You could have wage
contracts or people might

00:09:19.343 --> 00:09:21.745
just be slow to realize
prices are going up

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:23.951
and then renegotiating their contracts.

00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:28.142
You might have long term
agreements with suppliers

00:09:28.142 --> 00:09:30.741
that you're going to
pay a fixed price over

00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:31.998
some period of time.

00:09:31.998 --> 00:09:33.378
You've already agreed for the next year

00:09:33.378 --> 00:09:35.227
to pay it so even if aggregate prices

00:09:35.227 --> 00:09:37.076
are going up, it's
going to take a while in

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.929
different parts of the
economy, for contracts

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:42.595
or for transactions in
those parts of the economy,

00:09:42.595 --> 00:09:44.136
to actually reflect those things.

00:09:44.136 --> 00:09:47.071
Another reason why in
parts of the economy you

00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:50.073
might not have everything
move in tandem or

00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:52.469
everything move as quickly
as you would expect

00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:56.171
is because of something called menu costs.

00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:58.543
Menu costs.

00:09:58.543 --> 00:10:01.421
Menu costs are just the
idea that if prices are

00:10:01.421 --> 00:10:05.473
changing, if prices move
up in the next hour 5%,

00:10:05.473 --> 00:10:07.877
it's not actually trivial to increase your

00:10:07.877 --> 00:10:09.730
prices by 5%.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.543
For example, if you were
running a restaurant,

00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:14.139
you would have to reprint
new menus, so that's

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:15.878
where the name comes from,
but it's not just true

00:10:15.878 --> 00:10:17.548
of a restaurant; it's true of anything.

00:10:17.548 --> 00:10:20.660
It would be true if you're
any type of supplier.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.179
You would have to change your brochures.

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:24.469
You might have to change
your computer systems.

00:10:24.469 --> 00:10:26.672
You have to do a ton of
things to actually make

00:10:26.672 --> 00:10:29.129
things; you have to tell your sales force

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.870
how the pricing might be different.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.742
There's a ton of things
that you have to do to

00:10:32.742 --> 00:10:34.135
actually change costs.

00:10:34.135 --> 00:10:36.860
These menu costs actually
might slow down the

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.140
ability for all prices to move in tandem.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.852
Some of them will be
stickier than others and

00:10:41.852 --> 00:10:44.938
the reason why this is can be a rationale

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:47.544
for an upward sloping
aggregate supply curve

00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:49.958
in the short run is if I'm in one of these

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.030
industries, let's say
my sales I am able to

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.666
raise the prices but
let's say the wages and my

00:10:56.666 --> 00:10:57.388
costs are sticky.

00:10:57.388 --> 00:10:59.880
I've already got into a
long term wage contract

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.071
and all my suppliers
can't raise their prices

00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:07.531
as fast, so in the short
run I'm going to say gee,

00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:09.081
I'm making a lot of profit now.

00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:12.070
Even in real terms
because my costs are being

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.296
relatively sticky, while
the money that's coming

00:11:14.296 --> 00:11:17.404
in the door I'm able
to raise the prices so

00:11:17.404 --> 00:11:18.545
I'm going to produce more.

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.007
I'm going to run the factories longer.

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:21.742
Maybe I'll defer maintenance so that I can

00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:23.014
produce more.

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:25.539
Maybe I'll try to hire
more people under these

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:26.284
agreements.

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:28.706
Maybe I'll try to buy
more goods and services

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:30.906
under these long term costs.

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:32.470
The reason why I say
these are really the same

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.693
side of the same coin
is you can imagine here

00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:41.374
you have company A that
is able to increase

00:11:41.374 --> 00:11:44.402
its prices so its revenue
starts going up and

00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:47.403
let's say its supplier is company B.

00:11:47.403 --> 00:11:50.961
It's company B and this
right over here is sticky.

00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:52.681
This is sticky.

00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:55.338
Maybe A buys lemons from B and then sells

00:11:55.338 --> 00:11:56.128
lemonade.

00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:57.669
It's able to raise the price of lemonade,

00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:00.140
but it has a fixed price
contract on the lemons

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.903
in the short run.

00:12:00.903 --> 00:12:03.460
Eventually that will expire,
in the long run B will

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.953
be able to renegotiate it upwards.

00:12:05.953 --> 00:12:07.944
A's costs are sticky, but this is B's

00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:09.268
prices are sticky.

00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:12.140
These are really the same
thing that one's costs

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.000
are really the other's prices.
