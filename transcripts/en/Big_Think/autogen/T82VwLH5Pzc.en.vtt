00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.320
I think executive compensation ought to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
I think executive compensation ought to
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.109
I think executive compensation ought to
be set by the market place boards do

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:15.119
be set by the market place boards do
 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.269
be set by the market place boards do
make mistakes sometimes in the executive

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
make mistakes sometimes in the executive
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.700
make mistakes sometimes in the executive
compensation process I think there's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
compensation process I think there's
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.040
compensation process I think there's
been some obvious abuse of executive

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050
been some obvious abuse of executive
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.800
been some obvious abuse of executive
compensation in a few cases but I think

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
compensation in a few cases but I think
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.830
compensation in a few cases but I think
the more generic problem is not that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
the more generic problem is not that
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.870
the more generic problem is not that
people can be paid well but the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
people can be paid well but the
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880
people can be paid well but the
measurement of performance is not right

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
measurement of performance is not right
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.979
measurement of performance is not right
and I think the two errors that have

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
and I think the two errors that have
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740
and I think the two errors that have
been made one a lot of times performance

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
been made one a lot of times performance
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840
been made one a lot of times performance
is measured to linearly it doesn't

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
is measured to linearly it doesn't
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.180
is measured to linearly it doesn't
include the comprehensive performance

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
include the comprehensive performance
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.189
include the comprehensive performance
and secondly a lot of times performance

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199
and secondly a lot of times performance
 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.790
and secondly a lot of times performance
is too short term so i think that boards

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
is too short term so i think that boards
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590
is too short term so i think that boards
should be setting compensation i think

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
should be setting compensation i think
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.380
should be setting compensation i think
highly performing people are be paid

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
highly performing people are be paid
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.959
highly performing people are be paid
very well based on market conditions but

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
very well based on market conditions but
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450
very well based on market conditions but
i think boards should do a good job and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
i think boards should do a good job and
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.739
i think boards should do a good job and
I think frankly I think our board has

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749
I think frankly I think our board has
 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.119
I think frankly I think our board has
done a good job being sure the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
done a good job being sure the
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.040
done a good job being sure the
compensation is not just linear and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
compensation is not just linear and
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.139
compensation is not just linear and
being sure it covers a long period of

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
being sure it covers a long period of
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.180
being sure it covers a long period of
time not just what happens over a short

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190
time not just what happens over a short
 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.920
time not just what happens over a short
period

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990
I think that the shareholders have to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
I think that the shareholders have to
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.430
I think that the shareholders have to
select the board members and the board

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440
select the board members and the board
 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.750
select the board members and the board
members have to make those kind of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
members have to make those kind of
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.430
members have to make those kind of
operating decisions I don't think

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440
operating decisions I don't think
 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.770
operating decisions I don't think
shareholders have enough information to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
shareholders have enough information to
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.230
shareholders have enough information to
make concrete operating decisions they

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
make concrete operating decisions they
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.790
make concrete operating decisions they
could put the board in the position they

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800
could put the board in the position they
 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.140
could put the board in the position they
simply couldn't attract the kind of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
simply couldn't attract the kind of
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910
simply couldn't attract the kind of
talent that they need to operate we're

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
talent that they need to operate we're
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310
talent that they need to operate we're
seeing that right now is some of the the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
seeing that right now is some of the the
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200
seeing that right now is some of the the
interference by the government in any

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
interference by the government in any
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660
interference by the government in any
setting executive compensation I do

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
setting executive compensation I do
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580
setting executive compensation I do
think shareholders should be very

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
think shareholders should be very
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.240
think shareholders should be very
careful in selecting the board members I

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250
careful in selecting the board members I
 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.469
careful in selecting the board members I
would say this though I don't think

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
would say this though I don't think
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.820
would say this though I don't think
shareholders have been unduly

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830
shareholders have been unduly
 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.070
shareholders have been unduly
particularly institutional shareholders

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080
particularly institutional shareholders
 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.440
particularly institutional shareholders
in what's been going on recently because

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
in what's been going on recently because
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880
in what's been going on recently because
a lot of shareholders are very

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
a lot of shareholders are very
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.889
a lot of shareholders are very
short-term oriented and so they

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
short-term oriented and so they
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.320
short-term oriented and so they
encourage short-term performance and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330
encourage short-term performance and
 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.910
encourage short-term performance and
they get executives that act in the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
they get executives that act in the
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.380
they get executives that act in the
short-term manner so I think if

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
short-term manner so I think if
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.030
short-term manner so I think if
shareholders want a different long-term

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
shareholders want a different long-term
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.520
shareholders want a different long-term
result then they need to invest with a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
result then they need to invest with a
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.400
result then they need to invest with a
longer-term perspective and that's a

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410
longer-term perspective and that's a
 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.650
longer-term perspective and that's a
really important responsibility versus

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660
really important responsibility versus
 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.040
really important responsibility versus
micromanaging the board process
