Alright so it's time for you to try flying solo with NSUserDefaults

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.559
by implementing them on this recording app called PickYourPitch.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.189
we can see that the first page allows us to record a sound file.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:17.100
“Testing testing” And the second page allows us to play back that sound file

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.528
as well as adjust the pitch with a slider.

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:24.809
“Testing testing” “Testing testing”

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.618
But we can see that when we close the app and restart it the pitch information

00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:30.000
that we set is gone.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.250
Test again. Instead of the slider being off to the left where we left it,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.238
it's now back in the middle in its default position. Your challenge is to

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.789
make the position of the slider persistent.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.969
Think of it as a simple version of a user preference. If you're making an app

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.000
for playing podcast, you might have a settings page where the user sets their

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.689
preferred playback speed. And users often expect apps to remember that kind of

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.198
preference. So check out the following instructions and see if you can make

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:56.549
this recording a persistent.
