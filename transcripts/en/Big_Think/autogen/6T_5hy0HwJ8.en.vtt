barrel that's a carbon constraint so

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240
barrel that's a carbon constraint so
 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.120
barrel that's a carbon constraint so
that's one question it's a point of view

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130
that's one question it's a point of view
 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.039
that's one question it's a point of view
about energy prices and how energy

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049
about energy prices and how energy
 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.160
about energy prices and how energy
prices will change will they migrate

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170

second is will there be cap-and-trade
 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.669
second is will there be cap-and-trade
mechanisms and the third is will there

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679
mechanisms and the third is will there
 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.309
mechanisms and the third is will there
be carbon taxes and the fourth is will

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319
be carbon taxes and the fourth is will
 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.559
be carbon taxes and the fourth is will
there be other government things like

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569
there be other government things like
 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.240

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.080
lead you know LEED standards for
buildings for example these are not this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
buildings for example these are not this
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.400
buildings for example these are not this
wouldn't this simply says you're going

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410
wouldn't this simply says you're going
 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.110
wouldn't this simply says you're going
to have to meet this kind of a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
to have to meet this kind of a
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.450
to have to meet this kind of a
regulatory standard in terms of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460

efficiency for for power plants or so on
 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.620
efficiency for for power plants or so on
and so forth so if you look at those

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630
and so forth so if you look at those
 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.630

four things price regulation cap and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640
four things price regulation cap and

trade or taxation you've got to sort of
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.010
trade or taxation you've got to sort of
get a get a point of view and then I

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020
get a get a point of view and then I
 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.420
get a get a point of view and then I
think you simply have to be aware of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
think you simply have to be aware of
 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.070
think you simply have to be aware of
what's going on obviously there's a big

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080
what's going on obviously there's a big
 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.100
what's going on obviously there's a big
thing up a big international group under

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110
thing up a big international group under
 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.970
thing up a big international group under
the auspices of the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
the auspices of the
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.970
the auspices of the
un climaxing in Copenhagen in November

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980
un climaxing in Copenhagen in November
 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.180
un climaxing in Copenhagen in November
which is looking at this you know what

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
which is looking at this you know what
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.520
which is looking at this you know what
will happen to the basically rewriting

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530
will happen to the basically rewriting
 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.830
will happen to the basically rewriting
the Kyoto Protocol the next that you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840
the Kyoto Protocol the next that you
 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.420
the Kyoto Protocol the next that you
know the next treaty there so there will

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
know the next treaty there so there will
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.830
know the next treaty there so there will
be international stuff and there will be

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
be international stuff and there will be
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.479
be international stuff and there will be
national stuff and you basically have to

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
national stuff and you basically have to
 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.699
national stuff and you basically have to
just sort of get people looking at that

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
just sort of get people looking at that
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.050
just sort of get people looking at that
systematically so that you have a point

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
systematically so that you have a point
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.100
systematically so that you have a point
of view you have the opportunity to know

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110
of view you have the opportunity to know
 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.039
of view you have the opportunity to know
what discussions are going on and can

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049
what discussions are going on and can
 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.660
what discussions are going on and can
start making the investments that you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670
start making the investments that you
 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.280
start making the investments that you
need to make bearing in mind that a lot

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290
need to make bearing in mind that a lot
 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.569
need to make bearing in mind that a lot
of these are long-term investments you

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579
of these are long-term investments you
 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.460
of these are long-term investments you
can't just turn on a dime around the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
can't just turn on a dime around the
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.440
can't just turn on a dime around the
building's you occupy you can't just

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
building's you occupy you can't just
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.390
building's you occupy you can't just
turn on a dime around some of the fuels

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400
turn on a dime around some of the fuels
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.000
turn on a dime around some of the fuels
you use so you're going to have to start

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010
you use so you're going to have to start
 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.039
you use so you're going to have to start
making plans now because when the rules

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049
making plans now because when the rules
 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.229
making plans now because when the rules
come down you and they're going to come

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239
come down you and they're going to come
 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.839
come down you and they're going to come
down you're going to have advantage will

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849
down you're going to have advantage will
 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.640
down you're going to have advantage will
come to those people who were who were

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
come to those people who were who were
 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.950
come to those people who were who were
ahead of the curve

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960
