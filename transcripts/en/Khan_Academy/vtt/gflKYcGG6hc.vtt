00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:01.547
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can evaluate

00:00:01.547 --> 00:00:06.547
the indefinite integral of tangent x dx.

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:09.748
Like always, pause the video and see

00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:11.512
if you can figure it out on your own

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:15.009
and I will give you a hint,
think reverse chain rule.

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:17.258
Alright, so you have attempted it

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:18.777
and you would say well reverse chain rule,

00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:20.370
that's kind of your seeing a function

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.392
and your seeing it's derivative

00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:22.692
and you can integrate with
respect to that function.

00:00:22.707 --> 00:00:26.345
All you see here is a tangent
of x, what am I talking about?

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:28.464
Well, whenever you see a tangent of x

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:31.654
or a cosecant or a secant,
at least in my brain,

00:00:31.654 --> 00:00:34.259
I always like to break it
down into how it's defined

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.973
in terms of sine and cosine because we do

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:39.363
at least have some tools at our disposal

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:41.734
for dealing with sines and cosines.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.700
Or at least our brains, at least my brain,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.300
has an easier time processing them.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.632
We know tangent of x is
the same thing as sine of x

00:00:47.632 --> 00:00:50.963
over cosine of x so let
me rewrite it that way.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.200
This is equal to the indefinite
integral of sine of x

00:00:56.447 --> 00:01:01.119
over cosine of x dx and you
could even write it this way

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.672
and this is a little bit of a hint.

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:06.939
You could even write it as sine of x

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:10.959
times one over cosine of x.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:12.800
If you couldn't figure
it out the first time,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.811
I encourage you to pause the video again

00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:19.100
and, once again, think reverse chain rule.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:21.533
So, what am I talking about when

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.553
I keep saying reverse chain rule?

00:01:23.553 --> 00:01:27.919
Let's just review that before
I proceed with this example.

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:30.515
If I were to just tell you, well what's

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:34.480
the indefinite integral of one over x dx?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.017
We know that, that's going to be

00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:39.687
the natural log of the
absolute value of x plus c.

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:43.306
Now, if I were to ask you what is

00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:47.379
the indefinite integral of f prime

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:52.379
of x times one over f of x dx.

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:55.164
What is that going to be?

00:01:55.164 --> 00:01:57.758
Here's where the reverse
chain rule applies.

00:01:57.758 --> 00:02:02.505
Where I have one over f of x,
if only I had it's derivative

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:04.389
being multiplied by this
thing then I could just

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.067
integrate with respect to f of x.

00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:08.151
Well, I do, I have it's
derivative right over here.

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.828
It's multiplying times this thing.

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:12.855
I can use the reverse chain rule to say

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:14.083
that this is going to be equal

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:17.722
to the natural log of the absolute value

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:19.895
of the thing that I
have in the denominator,

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:24.766
which is f of x plus c
and that is exactly...

00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:27.940
I've made it too wide so
you can't see everything...

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.228
but that's exactly what's
going on right over here.

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:35.186
I have, if I say this
thing right over here,

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:38.401
cosine of x is f of x,

00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:42.000
then sine of x is not quite

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.831
the derivative, it's the
negative of the derivative.

00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:47.915
F prime of x would be negative sine of x.

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:50.388
How do I get that, how do I engineer it?

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:52.483
What if I just threw a negative there

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.590
and a negative there so it is essentially

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.552
multiplying by negative one twice

00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:58.851
which is still going to stay positive.

00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:01.592
Negative sine of x, right over here,

00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:04.450
I'm trying to squeeze it in
between the integral sine

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.784
and the sine of x, this right over here,

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:08.307
now that I put a negative sine of x,

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.420
that is the derivative of cosine of x.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.927
This is f prime of x so I can just

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.015
apply the reverse chain rule.

00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:18.970
This is going to be, we deserve

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.820
a little mini drum roll
here, this is going

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.004
to be equal to the natural
log of the absolute value

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:28.500
of our f of x, which is
going to be cosine of x.

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:31.275
Then, of course, we have our plus c

00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:34.967
and we can't forget we
had this little negative

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:36.542
sitting out here so we're going

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:39.156
to have to put the
negative right over there.

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:42.020
And we are done, we just figured out

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.931
that's kind of a neat result because

00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:45.312
it feels like that's something we

00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:47.296
should know how to take
the indefinite integral of.

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:49.939
The indefinite integral
of tangent of x is,

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.514
and it's neat they're connected
in this way, is the negative

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:57.166
natural log of the absolute
value of cosine of x plus c.
