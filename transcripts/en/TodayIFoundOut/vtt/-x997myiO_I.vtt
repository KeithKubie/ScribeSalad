00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.860
To many climbers, mountaineers, and general
fans of low oxygen environments, summiting

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.000
Mount Everest represent the literal peak of
physical achievement.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.950
But while an impressive feat for a human,
it turns out vultures can happily survive

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.920
exposed to altitudes of 40,000 ft or 12,200
meters above sea level and, indeed, have been

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.980
seen flying around at this height.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.460
(For reference, this is about 11,000 ft or
3,350 meters above the peak of Everest.)

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.110
Meanwhile tardigrades laugh in the face of
the conditions on Everest, able to survive

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.210
even nakedly exposed to outer space for quite
some time with no ill effects.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.620
(Although, note: humans can actually survive
exposed to the near vacuum of space for about

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.250
90 seconds without long term damage, but we
have nothing on the tardigrade for durability

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.079
in just about any environment.)

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.989
And let’s not even talk about microbes…

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.820
In the end, there are creatures that can outdo
even the best of humans at pretty much any

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.080
physically intensive task we feel like setting
our minds to, no matter how hard we train

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.119
and how good our genetics.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.120
But you know what no other known living thing
can do?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.840
Use their minds to create machinery to do
an otherwise extremely arduous and dangerous

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.160
task in about a half an hour, all while kicking
back in a very comfy chair.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.509
And that’s exactly what French fighter pilot
Didier Delsalle did when he conquered Everest

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.720
in a product of human ingenuity- the Eurocopter
Ecureuil AS350 B3 helicopter.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.649
Humans 1, Animal Kingdom 0.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.830
Although Delsalle is the first and so far
only person in history to land a helicopter

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.050
on the summit of the world’s highest peak,
likeminded daredevils and pilots have been

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.630
trying to do exactly that since at least the
early 1970s.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.509
One of the most notable of these individuals
is Jean Boulet who still holds the record

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:03.630
for highest altitude reached by a helicopter
at 40,820 ft (12,442 meters), at which point

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.210
his engine died, though he did manage to land
safely.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.239
(Yes, contrary to popular belief, helicopters
don’t just drop like a rock when the engine

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.360
dies, and they are relatively safe in this
condition.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.230
In fact, you have a better chance of surviving
in a helicopter when the engine fails than

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.010
you do in an airplane where the same happens.)

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.170
Like Boulet before him, Delsalle broached
the subject of landing a helicopter on Everest

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.989
with the company he flew helicopters for (in
this case Eurocopter) and was similarly stonewalled

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.340
by killjoy executives who didn’t want to
deal with the negative PR if he crashed.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.420
Delsalle didn’t let the subject drop and
repeatedly badgered higher ups within the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.650
company, using the better-than-expected results
from the test of a new engine in 2004 to convince

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.609
Eurocopter that landing their Ecureuil AS350
B3 helicopter on Everest was entirely possible.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.010
The company executives finally relented and
gave Delsalle some time (and a helicopter)

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.519
to test his hypothesis.

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.239
After all, while a failed attempt would create
a lot of negative press, a successful one

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.590
would be a fantastic marketing move, with
their helicopter doing something no other

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.590
had ever done.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.879
Or as Delsalle himself would state,

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.840
The idea was to prove to our customers all
the margins they have while they’re using

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.370
the helicopter in the normal certified envelope,
compared to what the helicopter is capable

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.140
of during the flight test.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.849
Delsalle then took the helicopter and flew
it to 29,500 feet, about 6,500 feet above

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.510
the helicopter’s listed maximum operating
altitude and around 500 feet higher than the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.769
peak of Everest.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:31.790
No problem.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.189
After a number of additional tests proved
that the helicopter would in theory have no

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.269
trouble landing on Everest’s peak, Delsalle
and his trusty helicopter headed to Nepal.

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.109
Once there, while conducting recon on the
mountain, Delsalle cemented his reputation

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.010
as an all round awesome guy by taking the
time to rescue two stranded Japanese climbers.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.750
When he wasn’t saving lives, he could be
found jogging around the hanger in an attempt

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.530
to drop every gram possible from his body
weight.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.379
Likewise, he lightened the helicopter slightly
be removing the passenger seats- the point

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.610
of all this was to be able to extend flight
time slightly.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.379
However, as part of the purpose of this publicity
stunt was to show off what the Ecureuil AS350

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.499
B3 could do, other than this marginal lightening
of its load, no other modifications were made.

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:17.769
And so it was that on the morning of May 14,
2005, Delsalle slipped on two pairs of thermal

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.269
underwear under his flight suit and took off.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.420
As for his choice of under attire, this was
needed as he flew the entire distance with

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.680
his window open…

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.419
He did this rather than keep things more climate
controlled as he was concerned his windows

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.590
would have iced up in the -31 F (-35 C) temperatures
had he not kept the temperatures equalized

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.430
on both sides of the glass.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.970
As for the ascent, this was not quite as easy
as simply rising to the necessary altitude-

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.800
Delsalle had to deal with some pretty remarkable
up and down drafts, which is one of the reasons

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.569
even today helicopter rescues at extreme altitudes
on Everest are a rarity.

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.569
As he stated,

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.169
On one side of the mountain, on the updraft
side, I wasn’t able to approach the mountain

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.080
because even taking out all of the power of
the aircraft, I was still climbing.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.560
But of course on the other side you had the
downdraft side, and on this side even with

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.240
maybe 60 knots on the airspeed indicator I
was going backward . . . and the helicopter

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.710
at full power was not powerful enough to counteract
that.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.350
“Landing”, or more aptly touching down,
also wasn’t an easy task.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.560
When you reach the summit you reach the updraft
point, and of course the updraft winds have

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.580
enough force to throw you away as soon as
you put the collective down.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.169
I had to stick my skids on the summit and
push into the mountain to stay on the summit.

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.150
Another big problem there is that you have
no visual of the summit, and you have no specific

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
cues, because you are on the highest point.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.419
You are in free air in fact, and you have
to try to find where is the summit exactly.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.349
After keeping the skids pressed against the
tiny area of land that is the summit for 3

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.580
minutes and 50 seconds, Delsalle decided it
was time to go, which turned out to be quite

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.580
simple thanks to the strong updraft: “I
had just to pull a little bit on the collective

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.389
and I went to flying very easily.”

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.509
Amusingly, nobody climbing the mountain that
day had any idea that Delsalle was planning

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.879
on doing this and reports later flooded in
to Nepalese authorities about a random helicopter

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.740
seen flying around the summit.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.610
But here’s the best part- when Delsalle
landed and went to check the recordings documenting

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.949
his amazing accomplishment, the computer showed
zero files where the recordings should have

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:15.949
been.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.610
Yes, he had no hard evidence he had actually
done this, invalidating his record attempt.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.080
Rather than waiting to see if the data could
be recovered (and presumably not wanting to

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.990
endure doubters for any longer than absolutely
necessary), Delsalle instead opted to just

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.370
do it all over again the very next day- this
time making sure the recording equipment was

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.370
functioning.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.150
(It should also be noted here that some of
the urgency was because no one was summiting

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.160
on the day in question, but were after.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.190
For safety reasons, he could not attempt the
touch down if anyone was climbing around the

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.190
summit.)

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.470
If at this point you’re now doubting his
May 14th story actually happened, we should

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.919
probably mention that they were later able
to recover the first day’s logs and video,

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.830
proving he had done what he said.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.830
Of course, doubters will persist no matter
if you slap them in the face with video evidence,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.669
data logs, several Everest climber accounts
of spotting the helicopter flying around the

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.909
summit, his helicopter skid marks that for
a time existed in the snow at that hallowed

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:09.419
peak, etc.

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:14.159
But as for the Federation Aeronautique Internationale
and a few other such official bodies, as his

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:19.319
evidence of the two touch downs on the summit
was incontrovertible, they officially ratified

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:24.849
his remarkable achievement, much to the chagrin
of many an Everest climber, who almost universally

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:30.479
lamented the accomplishment owing to the supposed
ease at which summiting the mountain was achieved.

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.060
But here again, we feel compelled to point
out that humans compiling the knowledge and

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.479
expertise needed to design/construct a machine
that was then extremely skillfully landed

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:43.349
on this hallowed, tiny patch of snow covered
land isn’t actually easy at all when you

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:44.349
think about it.

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:47.259
(And don’t even get us started on what it
took to compile the knowledge and expertise

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:50.509
to make the tools that made the parts for
the machine in question… or the tools that

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:55.259
made the parts for the more advanced tools,
such as mind boggling complex computers used

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:57.670
along the whole process…)

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:02.449
One might even posit that summiting Everest
in the more traditional way is orders of magnitude

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:30.249
easier than the way Delsalle did it, when
looking at the big picture.
