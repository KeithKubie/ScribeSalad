I'm<00:00:00.210><c> interested</c><00:00:00.690><c> in</c><00:00:00.780><c> the</c><00:00:00.930><c> twin</c><00:00:01.110><c> prime</c>

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in the twin prime
 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.789 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in the twin prime
conjecture<00:00:01.760><c> so</c><00:00:02.760><c> this</c><00:00:03.449><c> is</c><00:00:03.689><c> asking</c><00:00:04.680><c> about</c>

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
conjecture so this is asking about
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.550 align:start position:0%
conjecture so this is asking about
consecutive<00:00:05.670><c> prime</c><00:00:05.850><c> numbers</c><00:00:06.270><c> P</c><00:00:06.540><c> 1</c><00:00:07.049><c> as</c><00:00:07.350><c> the</c>

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
consecutive prime numbers P 1 as the
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.530 align:start position:0%
consecutive prime numbers P 1 as the
first<00:00:07.589><c> prime</c><00:00:08.099><c> which</c><00:00:08.400><c> would</c><00:00:08.550><c> be</c><00:00:08.610><c> equal</c><00:00:09.240><c> to</c><00:00:09.269><c> 2</c>

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
first prime which would be equal to 2
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
first prime which would be equal to 2
and<00:00:09.990><c> there'll</c><00:00:10.170><c> be</c><00:00:10.200><c> the</c><00:00:10.410><c> second</c><00:00:10.769><c> climb</c><00:00:10.980><c> P</c><00:00:11.910><c> 2</c>

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 align:start position:0%
and there'll be the second climb P 2
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270 align:start position:0%
and there'll be the second climb P 2
which<00:00:12.360><c> would</c><00:00:12.509><c> be</c><00:00:12.599><c> equal</c><00:00:12.780><c> to</c><00:00:12.929><c> C</c><00:00:13.170><c> and</c><00:00:13.500><c> you</c><00:00:14.130><c> can</c>

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
which would be equal to C and you can
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.099 align:start position:0%
which would be equal to C and you can
look<00:00:14.370><c> at</c><00:00:14.490><c> the</c><00:00:14.610><c> gaps</c><00:00:14.820><c> between</c><00:00:15.089><c> the</c><00:00:15.360><c> times</c><00:00:15.630><c> so</c>

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 align:start position:0%
look at the gaps between the times so
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.370 align:start position:0%
look at the gaps between the times so
the<00:00:16.260><c> gap</c><00:00:16.410><c> between</c><00:00:16.710><c> 3</c><00:00:17.220><c> &amp;</c><00:00:17.369><c> 2</c><00:00:17.609><c> is</c><00:00:17.960><c> 1</c><00:00:18.960><c> this</c><00:00:19.199><c> is</c><00:00:19.260><c> the</c>

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
the gap between 3 &amp; 2 is 1 this is the
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
the gap between 3 &amp; 2 is 1 this is the
only<00:00:19.710><c> time</c><00:00:20.070><c> you</c><00:00:20.189><c> can</c><00:00:20.279><c> possibly</c><00:00:20.760><c> have</c><00:00:21.000><c> two</c>

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 align:start position:0%
only time you can possibly have two
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 align:start position:0%
only time you can possibly have two
prime<00:00:21.869><c> numbers</c><00:00:21.900><c> which</c><00:00:22.500><c> differ</c><00:00:22.740><c> by</c><00:00:22.830><c> exactly</c><00:00:23.279><c> 1</c>

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 align:start position:0%
prime numbers which differ by exactly 1
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.609 align:start position:0%
prime numbers which differ by exactly 1
and<00:00:23.820><c> so</c><00:00:23.970><c> the</c><00:00:24.090><c> next</c><00:00:24.359><c> smallest</c><00:00:24.840><c> possible</c><00:00:25.199><c> gap</c>

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
and so the next smallest possible gap
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.730 align:start position:0%
and so the next smallest possible gap
would<00:00:26.400><c> be</c><00:00:26.609><c> a</c><00:00:26.820><c> gap</c><00:00:27.269><c> of</c><00:00:27.449><c> size</c><00:00:27.599><c> 2</c><00:00:27.900><c> it's</c><00:00:28.410><c> only</c><00:00:28.590><c> not</c>

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
would be a gap of size 2 it's only not
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.370 align:start position:0%
would be a gap of size 2 it's only not
the<00:00:28.800><c> case</c><00:00:29.039><c> that</c><00:00:29.070><c> all</c><00:00:29.429><c> gaps</c><00:00:29.760><c> become</c><00:00:30.570><c> size</c><00:00:31.109><c> to</c>

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
the case that all gaps become size to
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
the case that all gaps become size to
you<00:00:31.529><c> but</c><00:00:31.890><c> the</c><00:00:31.980><c> question</c><00:00:32.250><c> is</c><00:00:32.340><c> how</c><00:00:32.550><c> many</c><00:00:32.610><c> of</c>

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 align:start position:0%
you but the question is how many of
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
you but the question is how many of
these<00:00:33.030><c> gaps</c><00:00:33.300><c> of</c><00:00:33.840><c> size</c><00:00:34.230><c> 2</c><00:00:34.530><c> so</c><00:00:34.980><c> for</c><00:00:35.460><c> example</c><00:00:36.170><c> 101</c>

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 align:start position:0%
these gaps of size 2 so for example 101
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
these gaps of size 2 so for example 101
and<00:00:37.380><c> 103</c><00:00:37.950><c> are</c><00:00:38.610><c> two</c><00:00:38.910><c> rather</c><00:00:39.270><c> large</c><00:00:39.420><c> prime</c>

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 align:start position:0%
and 103 are two rather large prime
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139 align:start position:0%
and 103 are two rather large prime
numbers<00:00:40.290><c> which</c><00:00:40.829><c> differ</c><00:00:41.160><c> by</c><00:00:41.250><c> exactly</c><00:00:41.730><c> two</c><00:00:41.790><c> and</c>

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 align:start position:0%
numbers which differ by exactly two and
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.020 align:start position:0%
numbers which differ by exactly two and
then<00:00:42.540><c> the</c><00:00:42.660><c> twin</c><00:00:42.899><c> prime</c><00:00:43.170><c> conjecture</c><00:00:43.670><c> so</c><00:00:44.670><c> that</c>

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 align:start position:0%
then the twin prime conjecture so that
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060 align:start position:0%
then the twin prime conjecture so that
this<00:00:45.510><c> having</c><00:00:46.079><c> two</c><00:00:46.260><c> points</c><00:00:46.649><c> which</c><00:00:46.739><c> differ</c><00:00:46.980><c> by</c>

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 align:start position:0%
this having two points which differ by
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
this having two points which differ by

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
exactly two happens instantly after if
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 align:start position:0%
exactly two happens instantly after if
the<00:00:50.070><c> twin</c><00:00:50.280><c> prime</c><00:00:50.370><c> conjecture</c><00:00:50.489><c> was</c><00:00:51.000><c> false</c><00:00:51.270><c> at</c>

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 align:start position:0%
the twin prime conjecture was false at
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
the twin prime conjecture was false at
some<00:00:52.199><c> point</c><00:00:52.440><c> you</c><00:00:52.649><c> go</c><00:00:52.800><c> along</c><00:00:52.980><c> the</c><00:00:53.100><c> number</c><00:00:53.190><c> line</c>

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 align:start position:0%
some point you go along the number line
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090 align:start position:0%
some point you go along the number line
and<00:00:53.699><c> then</c><00:00:54.090><c> all</c><00:00:54.629><c> prime</c><00:00:55.110><c> gaps</c><00:00:55.350><c> would</c><00:00:55.559><c> always</c><00:00:55.829><c> be</c>

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
and then all prime gaps would always be
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 align:start position:0%
and then all prime gaps would always be
bigger<00:00:56.340><c> than</c><00:00:56.520><c> 2</c><00:00:56.840><c> but</c><00:00:57.840><c> we</c><00:00:57.960><c> don't</c><00:00:58.199><c> believe</c>

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 align:start position:0%
bigger than 2 but we don't believe
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900 align:start position:0%
bigger than 2 but we don't believe
that's<00:00:58.590><c> the</c><00:00:58.680><c> case</c><00:00:58.920><c> we</c><00:00:59.219><c> believe</c><00:00:59.550><c> that</c><00:00:59.730><c> it</c>

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 align:start position:0%
that's the case we believe that it
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 align:start position:0%
that's the case we believe that it
should<00:01:00.270><c> be</c><00:01:00.390><c> the</c><00:01:00.510><c> case</c><00:01:00.719><c> the</c><00:01:00.989><c> twin</c><00:01:01.199><c> prime</c>

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 align:start position:0%
should be the case the twin prime
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.420 align:start position:0%
should be the case the twin prime
conjecture<00:01:01.469><c> is</c><00:01:01.920><c> correct</c>

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 align:start position:0%
conjecture is correct
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 align:start position:0%
conjecture is correct
so<00:01:02.850><c> no</c><00:01:03.030><c> matter</c><00:01:03.239><c> how</c><00:01:03.359><c> far</c><00:01:03.809><c> you</c><00:01:03.960><c> go</c><00:01:03.989><c> along</c>

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 align:start position:0%
so no matter how far you go along
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.649 align:start position:0%
so no matter how far you go along
there's<00:01:04.860><c> always</c><00:01:05.189><c> going</c><00:01:05.580><c> to</c><00:01:05.640><c> be</c><00:01:05.729><c> some</c><00:01:06.330><c> bigger</c>

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be some bigger
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.250 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be some bigger
primes<00:01:07.020><c> and</c><00:01:07.380><c> in</c><00:01:07.590><c> fact</c><00:01:08.030><c> infants</c><00:01:09.030><c> that</c><00:01:09.750><c> differ</c>

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
primes and in fact infants that differ
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.310 align:start position:0%
primes and in fact infants that differ
by<00:01:10.530><c> just</c><00:01:11.460><c> exactly</c><00:01:11.820><c> two</c><00:01:12.180><c> so</c><00:01:12.630><c> you</c><00:01:12.689><c> can</c><00:01:13.020><c> test</c><00:01:13.170><c> this</c>

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
by just exactly two so you can test this
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 align:start position:0%
by just exactly two so you can test this
on<00:01:13.470><c> a</c><00:01:13.500><c> computer</c><00:01:13.650><c> and</c><00:01:14.250><c> we</c><00:01:14.490><c> found</c><00:01:14.700><c> pairs</c><00:01:15.509><c> of</c>
