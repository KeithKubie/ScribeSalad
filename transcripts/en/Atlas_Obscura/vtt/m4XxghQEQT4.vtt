00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.140
- In this time period, people
couldn't just drink water.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.010
There was a lot of, sort
of, disease in the water,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.920
so in order to avoid cholera,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.060
you could make small
beer, which would have

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.910
a small amount of alcohol content in it,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.520
enough to kill the bacteria,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.570
and then you could drink it to be hydrated

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.630
without getting drunk. So
small beer was really important

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.520
in order to keep a group of people,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.300
say, a group of soldiers, hydrated,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.280
when they were out in the woods, you know,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.180
patrolling the frontier.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.740
I'm Thomas Lannon, I'm
the assistant director

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.320
of manuscripts, archives, and rare books

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.810
at the New York Public Library,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.330
and today, we're looking at

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.630
George Washington's recipe for beer

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.080
in his journal from 1757,
and by taking a closer look,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.570
we might learn that it wasn't
as delicious as we think.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.260
We call it the "Notebook
of a Virginia Colonel,"

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.520
because it was maintained by Washington

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.700
as he was a captain of
the Virginia Regiment.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.930
This document is
important because it shows

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.210
the personality of George
Washington, which then

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.580
becomes the personality of
the United States of America.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.713
Washington's notebook includes
a lot of things crossed out.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.100
He did that in order to
prove they were done.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.490
This helps build the myth
about the type of person

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.710
George Washington was.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.710
He was exacting, deliberate,
and wanted to succeed.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.500
So when we actually look at the journal,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170
you'll sort of see why the recipe for beer

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.330
is separated from his sort of, goings on,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.590
as a Virginia colonel.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.290
Washington is known as a real draconian,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.920
he lashed people for deserting,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.760
we know of at least two times

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.778
where he hung people for desertion.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.100
The beer recipe appears
at the end of the journal

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.060
and also upside down,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240
which suggests that it was added later

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.663
because it's on page one of the
journal on its reverse side.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.750
In this time period,
there's not as much stigma

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.600
around drinking.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.880
Everyone drinks.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.810
Children drink, women
drink, you drink to survive,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.840
and you drink beer because it's clean,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.410
so the drinking of beer was a sort of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.310
everyday occurrence that all people did

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.420
in order to be hydrated.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.650
The beer recipe also is unappetizing.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.720
Take a large siffer full
of bran hops to your taste.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.350
Now, there's lots of types of hops.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.860
Bran ones don't sound most appetizing.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.170
Boil these three hours, then strain out

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.690
30 gallons into a cooler. Put
in three gallons of molasses.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.320
Okay, so now you've boiled bran hops,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.600
you're adding molasses, so you have,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.710
a kind of syrupy elixir.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.340
Then, while the beer is scalding hot,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.270
draw the molasses into a cooler,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.620
let this stand until it is
little more than blood warm,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.000
then put in a quart of yeast.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.400
If the weather is very cold,
cover it with a blanket

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.840
and let it work in the cooler 24 hours,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.760
then put into a cask,
leaving the bung open

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.670
until it is almost done working.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.670
Bottle it that day, as it was brewed.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.170
So, you're not aging it.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.210
Today's beer makers would
never make this beer.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.230
Even the most, sort of,
dedicated craft brewer

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.166
would call this beer sort of, like,

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.833
"(beep) water."

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.693
Sorry.

00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:34.913
- [Off camera] No, it's good, it's good.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.170
- There's been a lot of
focus on the beer recipe,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.060
and the reason why might be
because the military history

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.620
of the French and Indian
Wars is not as exciting

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.940
as the recipe for beer, which
humanizes George Washington.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.090
He has this sort of dual personality

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.540
of being a sort of militaristic person,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.260
but also a benevolent Founding Father

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.970
and so the beer recipe, I think,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.840
can be used to show his human side.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.320
This document has told different stories

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.400
to different people at different times,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.100
and that's what makes it
so alive and interesting

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.480
is that there's different
ways to read the document

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.563
and there's different ways to see it.
