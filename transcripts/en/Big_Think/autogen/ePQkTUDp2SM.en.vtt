I think any gynecologist will tell you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.220
I think any gynecologist will tell you
 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.560
I think any gynecologist will tell you
that it's an ovary and ovarian cancer

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
that it's an ovary and ovarian cancer
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.050
that it's an ovary and ovarian cancer
we're kind of at a loss really the only

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060
we're kind of at a loss really the only
 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.670
we're kind of at a loss really the only
thing we have to rely on is our patient

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680
thing we have to rely on is our patient
 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.179
thing we have to rely on is our patient
symptoms and being vigilant in our

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189
symptoms and being vigilant in our
 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.940
symptoms and being vigilant in our
annual exams there's no real good test

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950
annual exams there's no real good test
 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.750
annual exams there's no real good test
out there ca125 which is a blood test

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760
out there ca125 which is a blood test
 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.490
out there ca125 which is a blood test
which there's an email going around for

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500
which there's an email going around for
 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.740
which there's an email going around for
years now that it's a great cancer

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750
years now that it's a great cancer
 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.140
years now that it's a great cancer
screener it's almost like a PSA test for

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150
screener it's almost like a PSA test for
 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
screener it's almost like a PSA test for
four women and the same as the PSA is

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160
four women and the same as the PSA is
 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.580
four women and the same as the PSA is
for men and it really hasn't shown to be

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590
for men and it really hasn't shown to be
 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.079
for men and it really hasn't shown to be
that in fact there's a lot of false

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089
that in fact there's a lot of false
 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.570
that in fact there's a lot of false
positives to it so you end up kind of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580
positives to it so you end up kind of
 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.280
positives to it so you end up kind of
chasing a lot of lab results and coming

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290
chasing a lot of lab results and coming
 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.020
chasing a lot of lab results and coming
up with nothing and creating a lot of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030
up with nothing and creating a lot of
 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.090
up with nothing and creating a lot of
anxiety for patients so we really don't

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100
anxiety for patients so we really don't
 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.460
anxiety for patients so we really don't
have anything that we can offer as good

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470
have anything that we can offer as good
 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.350
have anything that we can offer as good
screening so basically just having a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360
screening so basically just having a
 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.149
screening so basically just having a
high vigilance is all we can offer right

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159
high vigilance is all we can offer right
 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.539
high vigilance is all we can offer right
now but I think being on the birth

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549
now but I think being on the birth
 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.010
now but I think being on the birth
control pill is the best thing you could

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020
control pill is the best thing you could
 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.980
control pill is the best thing you could
do as far as prevention over the course

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990
do as far as prevention over the course
 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:21.350
do as far as prevention over the course
of two years

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.370
well I think it will help you know in

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380
well I think it will help you know in
 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.870
well I think it will help you know in
counseling our patients regarding

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880
counseling our patients regarding
 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.880
counseling our patients regarding
diseases they might anticipate when they

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890
diseases they might anticipate when they
 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.120
diseases they might anticipate when they
have children I think like any

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130
have children I think like any
 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.880
have children I think like any
technology it's always going to be far

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890
technology it's always going to be far
 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.010
technology it's always going to be far
ahead of our ability to deal with it you

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020
ahead of our ability to deal with it you
 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.090
ahead of our ability to deal with it you
know as anything the nuclear power or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100
know as anything the nuclear power or
 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.490
know as anything the nuclear power or
whatever what have you we always seem to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500
whatever what have you we always seem to
 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.889
whatever what have you we always seem to
be able to do stuff before we really

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899
be able to do stuff before we really
 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.109
be able to do stuff before we really
know how to ethically and morally deal

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119
know how to ethically and morally deal
 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.880
know how to ethically and morally deal
with it so I think the biggest play is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
with it so I think the biggest play is
 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.950
with it so I think the biggest play is
going to be on predicting cancers in

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960
going to be on predicting cancers in
 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.290
going to be on predicting cancers in
women with the BRCA gene which we have

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300
women with the BRCA gene which we have
 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.870
women with the BRCA gene which we have
already for the breast my hope is that

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880
already for the breast my hope is that
 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880
already for the breast my hope is that
we'll see that you know for the ovary

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890
we'll see that you know for the ovary
 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.660
we'll see that you know for the ovary
that's probably something that's not as

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670
that's probably something that's not as
 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:18.440
that's probably something that's not as
far down the road

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.690
well partly because the ovaries are well

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700
well partly because the ovaries are well
 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.030
well partly because the ovaries are well

what they do or cells that grow and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
what they do or cells that grow and
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.660
what they do or cells that grow and
don't recognize their neighbors so they

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
don't recognize their neighbors so they
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.459
don't recognize their neighbors so they
pile up on each other and they grow

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469
pile up on each other and they grow
 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.119
pile up on each other and they grow
rapidly they're allowed to grow and they

rapidly they're allowed to grow and they
 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.520
rapidly they're allowed to grow and they
have the open kind of relative open in

initially and it's only when the cancer

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659
initially and it's only when the cancer
 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.229
initially and it's only when the cancer
gets to a very large state where they

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239
gets to a very large state where they
 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.220
gets to a very large state where they
start to feel symptoms of other organs

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230
start to feel symptoms of other organs
 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.259
start to feel symptoms of other organs
being compressed and things like that so

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269
being compressed and things like that so
 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.390
being compressed and things like that so
that's why it's so so sinister there's

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400
that's why it's so so sinister there's
 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.129
that's why it's so so sinister there's
there's nothing obvious like a melanoma

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139
there's nothing obvious like a melanoma
 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.959
there's nothing obvious like a melanoma
you kind of see it and it grows and he

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:03.969
you kind of see it and it grows and he
 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.030
you kind of see it and it grows and he
changes so you pick those up early the

uterus uterine cancer sends you a
 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.349
uterus uterine cancer sends you a
literal red flag you know after the

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359
literal red flag you know after the
 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.000

menopause if a woman sees bleeding

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010
menopause if a woman sees bleeding
 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.649
menopause if a woman sees bleeding
that's a sign that there's something

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659
that's a sign that there's something
 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.800
that's a sign that there's something
wrong and uterine cancer is often picked

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810
wrong and uterine cancer is often picked
 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.869
wrong and uterine cancer is often picked
up early and cured because we have a

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879
up early and cured because we have a
 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.740
up early and cured because we have a
warning so the ovaries don't give us

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750
warning so the ovaries don't give us
 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.750
warning so the ovaries don't give us
much in the way of warning so bloating

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
much in the way of warning so bloating
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.059
much in the way of warning so bloating
is really the the one symptom that we

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069
is really the the one symptom that we
 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.860
is really the the one symptom that we
hear from patients that we always

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870
hear from patients that we always
 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.140
hear from patients that we always
respect and of course most times when

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150
respect and of course most times when
