00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.600
You are listening to radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.780
N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.610
Do you want to get out? Is this a, is this us? Yeah, this is okay.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.873
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.700
<v 0>this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.880
Since our program today deals with stumbling upon the past in unlikely places,

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.910
we thought we'd begin this part of the show. Well,

8
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.190
not at a place we'd normally visit,

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.870
so I feel like we're standing on the top of a mountain. But how high up are we?

10
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.220
Right here? I believe we're about 180 this, by the way,

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.480
it's chief Dennis Diggins.

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.510
I'm an assistant chief from the New York City Department of sanitation and when

13
00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:50.950
he says 180 he means feet at 180 feet high. Wow.

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.200
So that's about 18 stories. Correct.

15
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.190
18 stories up into the Staten island sky. That's where we're standing,

16
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.650
where we're standing on a hill, basically like a big dirt hill.

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.730
And in a glance you'd never know that this hill was made from anything other

18
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:05.740
than dirt. What did this used to be?

19
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.170
Unless of course you dug about a few feet down.

20
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.730
This is the whole garbage underneath this. Up until March of 2001,

21
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:15.130
we were taking in all of New York city's garbage.

22
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.560
All the boroughs were coming here, all the boroughs were coming here.

23
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.850
So we were probably taking it on average, 11,000 tons a day.

24
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.840
Fresh kills used to be the biggest dump on the planet.

25
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.050
That's all in the past with a little engineering help.

26
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.960
It's gotta be a great park. Absolutely. This will be a park.

27
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.660
And just look at how much property have you told these mounts are getting

28
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.640
wrapped in plastic and covered with grass. There'll be a restaurant.

29
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.850
Can almost imagine that I've in a golf course,

30
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.250
I would love to be the first ones to tee you off for this.

31
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.470
But underneath it all the garbage will still be here.

32
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.060
50 years of trash waiting patiently

33
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.250
until someone comes to look for it. And someone always does.

34
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.690
I know years ago we, there was a, uh,

35
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.280
a garb at arc arc yet, how do I say it right?

36
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.350
Archeological garbage shove man, the came here and he did some core sampling,

37
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.341
meaning with a special tool.

38
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:15.010
This guy board a hole deep into the center of the mound.

39
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.210
Actually came up with a a hotdog landfill.

40
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.020
10 years previously. Kidding.

41
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.850
The hot dog that was 10 years old and it was still hot. Still hot though.

42
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.110
Recognizably a hotdog.

43
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.040
That's amazing and disgusting.

44
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.190
I still like hotdog so I'll eat it. Seriously.

45
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.890
Do you ever consider the history that's contained in this?

46
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.140
In this big chunk of garbage? Oh yeah.

47
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:44.800
Well this is one big time capsule time capsule time, capsule time,

48
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:49.630
capsule time caps, cap time, capsule time, capsule time, steel time,

49
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.410
kept steel time gap. You can sound good. Stop saying that now. Thank you.

50
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.460
I'm Jad Abumrad.

51
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.270
This is radio lab series about science and discovery and that exactly what we

52
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:01.001
have for you today.

53
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.920
Three detective stories and each one begins with a rather peculiar clue clues

54
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.930
that leads you back into the past time capsule time capsule and now that we've

55
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.870
got that phrase in our minds and garbage as well,

56
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.920
let's go to a different part of the world and get things started for real to

57
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.780
different time. Also 1898 Egypt, Oxford, Rinkus,

58
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:27.250
Egypt. You with me? Where's Oxa? Rinkus Egypt. It's in the south,

59
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:31.750
in the desert south of uh, of Cairo I think. And let me show you a picture.

60
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.040
You see the desert? Oh yeah. It's a big flat sort of sandy place.

61
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.740
And he's, who is this guy? Well, you should see two guys. They are,

62
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.760
they're two Oxford archeologists with a pit helmet and sort of standing high on

63
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.520
a mountain looking down. Yeah. One guy is on top of the mountain,

64
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.930
the other is toward the bottom that's Grenfell and hunt to Oxford archeologists.

65
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.810
They were in Egypt in 1898 looking for treasure.

66
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.420
And they find those sand dunes,

67
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.060
which don't look quite like the other sand dunes really.

68
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.060
They're sort of strange and irregularly shaped,

69
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.850
which is why when they saw those Sandana that you're looking at,

70
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.540
they hired a team of workers and they started to date the mission and the

71
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.103
immediately right

72
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.010
<v 2>to find things. Huge quantity of pottery flows, shoes of baskets,</v>

73
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.010
rope. That's Derek Obinc, a scholar from Oxford.

74
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.460
He tells the story of what they found and what they found was basically the

75
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.133
motherload,

76
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.730
a huge circle of rubbish mounds over 20 of them that were completely

77
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:33.100
undisturbed. Awe.

78
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.730
This was no piddly little trash sheep that was 50 years old like you might find

79
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.180
in Staten Island. These mounds, when you hear the,

80
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.470
these were rubbish mounts that had built up over the course of 10 centuries,

81
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.830
10 centuries of trash.

82
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.320
That's a a thousand years of trash. Yeah,

83
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.710
and that included a lot of ancient paper.

84
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.530
That's what they were really interested in.

85
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.630
Any scraps or squirrels they could find,

86
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.720
and one of the first ones that they pulled out of the ground was last sayings of

87
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.200
Jesus. Wow. Oh, that was the first one that they pulled out of the ground.

88
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.190
He who knows the all but fails to know himself,

89
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.410
lacks everything. If they say to you once, have you come, okay,

90
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:21.620
forget the 10 year old hot dog here we have come from the light.

91
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.580
We have sayings of Jesus cell phones,

92
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.680
which have not been seen read or even heard about for almost 2000 years.

93
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.530
A long list of sayings that are not in the canonical books of the Bible.

94
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.960
He who seeks let him not cease seeking until he finds this is a different Jesus

95
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.560
than the one in the Bible. It's almost to will not eastern in tone.

96
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.130
He says low heaven. There is here.

97
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.740
The Kingdom of the father is spread out upon the earth.

98
00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:56.660
It's all around us and men do not see it. If we just opened our eyes.

99
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.860
[inaudible] today is known as the log ear fragment

100
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.830
<v 0>and there was buried in the trash. Wow. Anyhow,</v>

101
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.440
the team pulled as much paper as they could from the mounds,

102
00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:10.060
separated out all the shoes and stuff and just took the paper

103
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.060
<v 2>and then they packed those up into hundreds of boxes and ship them back to here</v>

104
00:06:15.061 --> 00:06:15.894
to Oxford.

105
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.580
This is the Sacrad library in Oxford and we're still today 107 years later.

106
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.980
We're going upstairs now. We're still today opening those boxes,

107
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.920
pulling out the fragments,

108
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.090
piecing them back together and decipher in them

109
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.983
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

110
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.460
<v 0>this is what 2000 year old paper sounds like.</v>

111
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.783
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

112
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.720
<v 0>sounds just like paper and it looks like dried leaves and not really much to</v>

113
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:53.160
look at or listened to,

114
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.780
but knowing that it's 2000 years old in theoretically could have been written on

115
00:06:57.781 --> 00:07:00.770
by Jesus himself on that makes it a little

116
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.783
<v 2>more special,</v>

117
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.900
which is why we visited Oxford England where the dump now lives packed away and

118
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.490
700 boxes.

119
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.250
The suboxone contains about 600 unpublished with clarity. Nick Ganas,

120
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.310
one of the collections curators popped one open for us

121
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.340
just opening.

122
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.660
I know official document sometime early fourth century

123
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.490
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

124
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.380
<v 2>Of course it's full of holes probably caused by little worms and there's the sad</v>

125
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:41.150
part. There are enough secrets in these boxes to rewrite the past.

126
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.530
The problem is much of this is very hopelessly fragmented.

127
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.130
Reading it is almost impossible. Some of the smaller fragments,

128
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:53.930
if you see lots of them, they look like and conglomeration of cornflakes.

129
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.460
There will be a few hundred years before we even the most substantial of these

130
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:03.890
fragments come to light.

131
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.810
We're talking about the reconstruction of, of works that the work on,

132
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.160
which is beyond the scale of a single human lifetime. Way Beyond.

133
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.200
<v 0>In the past 107 years,</v>

134
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.210
the Oxford team has worked their way through a whopping 1% of the collection.

135
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.810
It may take another 10 centuries to get through the rest.

136
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.230
Here's how it usually goes. Nick scours the boxes each day, finds a new scrap,

137
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.530
tiny little scrap and brings it into the lab for cleaning.

138
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.870
<v 2>What I do now is I renewed some ancient mud with the help of a brush</v>

139
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.160
<v 0>here. He wipes ancient mud from a torn page of Homer's Iliad.</v>

140
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.340
After it's mud free. Each piece is catalog the computer for various

141
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.270
<v 2>features like type of hand writing, size and style</v>

142
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.730
<v 0>piece seems to match the other pieces. Dirk and maybe a Grad student,</v>

143
00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:07.820
spread them all out on a long wooden table and basically from there it's a

144
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.920
classic jigsaw.

145
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.820
<v 2>How about this one? Just met with click.</v>

146
00:09:10.821 --> 00:09:14.690
These might be the vine beginnings of move one here.

147
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.500
I think that that looks like it's promising that see if the words match up cause

148
00:09:18.501 --> 00:09:23.501
they seem to line up pretty exactly with the lines of the verge of fragment.

149
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.700
<v 0>May take five minutes, it may take five years.</v>

150
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.580
We take five lifetimes, but eventually they will have,

151
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.590
well not the whole story, not even a page or the whole story.

152
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.240
<v 2>Something</v>

153
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.520
I've put the parties on to an electronic microscope.

154
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.690
Maybe just a few Greek words from the deep past Jose pawn pro,

155
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.230
yet a criterion tapey boost on the shoulder and contact about 10 part

156
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.860
[inaudible]. Don't loan it to get

157
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.790
[inaudible] a bet.

158
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.850
We missing a bet from the upper right corner.

159
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.040
Sometimes a sentence breaks off just when you need it to tell you what you need

160
00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:14.740
to know.

161
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.720
We have to be satisfied with knowing of little rather than a lot amount.

162
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.850
Make sure I understand this as,

163
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.330
is each of these fragments just a teeny like is it a

164
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.260
<v 0>to B or it's more like to, what was that smell?</v>

165
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.940
Some of them are tiny, tiny.

166
00:10:30.941 --> 00:10:34.200
I mean there was about a half a million in total and uh,

167
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.980
and they've only got through about 5,000 is do you have in your own list of

168
00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:41.470
things like a, a sort of fever hits list? I do. I do.

169
00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:43.900
I've narrowed it down to uh, to my top three,

170
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:49.450
my top three ancient garbage greatest hits, if you will, which was difficult.

171
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.410
But here are three that are really interesting. First number three,

172
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.400
ancient garbage, greatest hits. Number three, you being a death metal fan,

173
00:10:57.401 --> 00:11:01.390
I'm sure are familiar with these three in auspicious number

174
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.830
<v 3>[inaudible] absolutely.</v>

175
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.960
<v 0>Six six, six sign of the beast. Right.</v>

176
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.850
Just to explain that the number of the beast, six 66 is what you use to others,

177
00:11:21.851 --> 00:11:25.780
some of the beast or to keep the beast away because you can't say his name

178
00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:29.400
directly. That would be bad. Yeah. All this comes from the New Testament. Okay.

179
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.090
Derek showed me a piece of a virus that he found in the dump.

180
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.180
It's about the size of your palm. So what are we looking at?

181
00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:39.460
This looks like there's maybe 30 letters,

182
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.860
a copy of precisely that passage in the new testament where the number is

183
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.690
staying him. Who? Half on the stabbing.

184
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.070
Reckon the number of the beast for it is a human number.

185
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 2>It's number is 666, six,</v>

186
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:01.060
six six which was the traditional number.

187
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.540
<v 0>The bees. Here's the thing,</v>

188
00:12:02.541 --> 00:12:07.100
this little scrap of Papaya is the Dirk turned up is the earliest known copy

189
00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:10.490
that we have of that passage. He showed me. Can you,

190
00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:11.960
can you point to the letters again and, and,

191
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.980
and show me what his three numbers are. Smack in the center of the piracy,

192
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.920
clutters kind, Yoda Sigma Chi, Yoda,

193
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.210
Sigma Chi Yoda Sigma should say six six, six, right? Yep.

194
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.400
But in fact, Chi, Yoda, sigma, don't say six six, six they don't,

195
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.370
what do they say? Six six one one six.

196
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.590
No, sort of six six, six really? Yeah.

197
00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:42.530
Does that mean all the bibles are wrong or maybe, I mean,

198
00:12:42.531 --> 00:12:47.531
all we really know is that the number of the beast had versions and at six one

199
00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:51.890
six, maybe the original,

200
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.220
how long does it take this to filter into the King James Bible or something

201
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:56.410
like,

202
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:56.711
<v 2>oh no.</v>

203
00:12:56.711 --> 00:13:01.120
It will appear in the next standard edition of the New Testament in a note on

204
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:05.710
that page representing it as a viable variant that is now appeared in a puppy.

205
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:11.020
<v 0>Totally. What does the biblical scholars excepted? Did they do? Oh,</v>

206
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:15.790
so it, you should just probably be very careful about six blank six from them.

207
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.140
If you want worrying about the beast,

208
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.660
well you should probably change your tattoo

209
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.730
shit. All right, let's move on to number two garbage.

210
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.980
Greatest hits number two. Did you see the movie Troy? Yes.

211
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.750
You remember the scene?

212
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.120
<v 4>Good job.</v>

213
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.970
<v 0>Big Bold, muscular men fighting big bold,</v>

214
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:42.880
muscular fights with big bowls and muscular enemies.

215
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.383
<v 4>John [inaudible]</v>

216
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.830
<v 0>the film and I know how big bold and muscular blocks.</v>

217
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.500
What did your scrap tell you? Well, they've been very flux recently.

218
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:56.380
This is big news in the, in the world of the pup biologists,

219
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.840
they got their hands on this special camera.

220
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.040
So we have this digital set up here, a camera on a uh,

221
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:04.570
on an assertive easel.

222
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.230
This camera uses infrared filters to photograph text.

223
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:12.670
It's so faded that you can't really see it with the naked eye. Take a

224
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.930
quite a long exposure. In any case,

225
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:21.880
the first thing that they read with that camera is a poem about the Trojan War,

226
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.020
new poem of our killer Co's. This poem, our gay own F,

227
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.940
our base pollution strut on Hoyt or peppontone comes from the six hundreds,

228
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:32.890
not homer. It's our silicosis version.

229
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.130
It's precisely not homer because whereas the Homeric version,

230
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:41.080
the Brad Pitt version, it goes, uh, you know, Grayson VAYD, Troy falls, harass

231
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.140
this version goes Greeks invade, get their butts kicked,

232
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.250
and then run, run like sissies.

233
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.370
<v 2>Oh, so it completely turns the Homeric account on its head. Wait, wait, wait.</v>

234
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.593
This was great.

235
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.400
<v 0>At the same time as homework a little bit later, but in response to that,</v>

236
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.850
<v 2>oh, and the Greek goes like this. Here, listen.</v>

237
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:09.851
Hey to tell you craft one doesn't have to call it weakness and cowardess having

238
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:15.460
to retreat note at trip. No, it does exist at proper time for flight.

239
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.900
<v 0>See, Homer's notion was that like the hero stands and fights to the end, but,</v>

240
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.470
but this poet was saying, you know what? No, we ran away.

241
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.380
We turned our backs to flee quickly and that's okay.

242
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.070
<v 2>He actually celebrated it as something that he was proud of because sometimes</v>

243
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.690
you had to turn and run.

244
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:35.940
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

245
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.270
<v 0>running away is a good thing. Running away is a good thing. That's good one.</v>

246
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.390
See what's interesting about the past you find in the trash is that it's messy.

247
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.180
It's complicated. There's not just a story.

248
00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:52.680
You know there's contradictions to that story. Competing accounts of that story,

249
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.230
which can be disconcerting. I mean,

250
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.570
you know who wants to have different bibles floating around.

251
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.030
That can be weird for people, but to me to know that way back when,

252
00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:06.810
even then there were different ideas about what it means to be a hero.

253
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.440
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

254
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.820
<v 0>that I find comforting,</v>

255
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.700
which brings us to my first choice. I last but hardly least ancient garbage.

256
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:22.970
Greatest hit none. Well, the greatest hit.

257
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.790
What do you think people in the first century were reading?

258
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.110
What do I think they were reading?

259
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.140
[inaudible] what do you think they were really reading?

260
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:36.170
<v 2>Okay. When the, when the tech starts, she's saying, Oh, I'm terribly on fire,</v>

261
00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:41.110
and that goes in Greek. Do know, flag of my realm.

262
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.890
A May a k, d, I'll say the translation.

263
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.260
Oh, it's thick and big as a roof B,

264
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.060
and then she goes on [inaudible]

265
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:56.930
<v 0>hard. That's what they were reading.</v>

266
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.490
This filthy satire turned up enough times in this and other dumps for Dirk to

267
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:04.100
suspect that it may have been a bestseller.

268
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.740
So there was more than one version of yes, it appeared over and over and over.

269
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.860
<v 2>I'm burning. I'm on fire. I'm terribly on fire.</v>

270
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.280
A stream runs over me. Do you understand?

271
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.970
<v 0>And I'm being a bit [inaudible].</v>

272
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.310
You're listening to radio lab

273

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.370
creators at honesty,

282

285
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.530
this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. I,

286
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.540
our show today is about finding clues to the past and the weirdest places and

287
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.670
there is no weirder place to find the past than in the story you're about to

288
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:53.990
hear.

289
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.960
It comes to us from Laura Star Chesky who herself likes to get in the whole

290
00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:58.330
thing. Yeah.

291
00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.790
<v 7>This my mom,</v>

292
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.720
my mom kind of fostered that like when we were a little one of our hip outings

293
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.820
so that we would do,

294
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:08.870
would be to go to this toxic dump near my house where I grew up.

295
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.790
It's like on top of a mountain.

296
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.670
They sealed off this mountain and they made all the people move off of it.

297
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.970
So you're just walking along a trail and then you see all these old abandoned

298
00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:21.770
houses full of stuff. So we would go into the houses and we find pay stubs,

299
00:19:21.771 --> 00:19:26.540
we find dishes, we'd find paintings and we try and figure out why.

300
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:29.030
Like even though we knew really why the people had left,

301
00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:31.850
we would try and make up other stories about why they left. Like,

302
00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:35.780
maybe they were fighting in the middle of dinner and they just had all of their

303
00:19:35.781 --> 00:19:36.980
dishes on the table.

304
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.450
<v 0>All right. Fast forward many years.</v>

305
00:19:38.451 --> 00:19:42.620
Laura is in New York and one day she gets a call from her sister who tells her,

306
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.020
I just heard the most amazing story.

307
00:19:45.021 --> 00:19:48.470
I was at my writing class and the teacher told us this story.

308
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.730
You should call him Eric Gordon is his name.

309
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.640
Take your tape recorder over to his office in Manhattan.

310
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.210
Make him tell it to you. So that's what she did.

311
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.660
<v 7>I just said at first, you know, I just want to record you telling this story.</v>

312
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.770
<v 8>Hey Dude,</v>

313
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:11.230
<v 7>how he had found all these letters and photos and created a character</v>

314
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.550
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

315
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.140
<v 7>I had no idea that I would become so,</v>

316
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.290
<v 8>okay. So do you want to talk about that day?</v>

317
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.130
Get the story took place? Sure. That day,

318
00:20:24.131 --> 00:20:27.460
let me see if I can put my self back in that day. Uh,

319
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.140
so I was living in Oakland at the time.

320
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.200
This is about 1994 and decided to go on a weekend camping trip with a friend and

321
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.800
we're driving south on route one oh one through the central part of the state.

322
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.230
And my friend starts to frantically shout, look, look.

323
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.420
And she's pointing out to this field, she can't even get the words out.

324
00:20:46.421 --> 00:20:49.210
She's saying, look looking. She shouting. So he tries to look.

325
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.750
I turned my head very quickly and you can't see because its view is blocked by

326
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:56.230
an overpass or a hill and he just has no idea what she's talking about.

327
00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.090
And she is stuttering her words and she says there's,

328
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.770
and she's still stuttering. [inaudible] standing there,

329
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.790
the cows back in that field. Oh,

330
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:11.791
what a goat standing on top of a cow goat standing on top of a cow.

331
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.870
Yeah. And you know, of course my reaction is, is this,

332
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.950
that's absurd. And she's saying, pull this truck over, pull over.

333
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:22.540
And she's getting really angry. And I said,

334
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.450
I'm not backing up three quarters of a mile and one oh one she said,

335
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.630
they argue for a little while. And Eric finally relent.

336
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.120
20 minutes later they arrived back at the field.

337
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:35.320
So we pull over and she just gets the hugest grin on her face.

338
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.210
There is in fact a goat standing on a cow's back still there.

339
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.480
We sit in the truck for a minute watching this cow who's close enough to the

340
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:47.470
fence that we got a very good view of it and every time he takes a step to graze

341
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.340
the goats kind of shifts from side to side balancing.

342
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.010
So they're kind of this unit, I mean really amazing.

343
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:59.011
You actually could see that goats hooks kind of bunch up in the cow's skin and

344
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.570
we get out of the truck slowly get out of the truck to get a better left and

345
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.090
right as I shut the door, I go jumps off and go jumps off

346
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.360
and you just, you know,

347
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:12.730
we're standing there kind of dumped on and we move up to the,

348
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.530
to the fence and just believe it or not, the story gets weirder really?

349
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:17.920
Yeah.

350
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.570
So Eric and his friend are standing totally still hoping that if they just wait,

351
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.840
maybe the Godel jump back onto the cow and all of a sudden Eric's friend notices

352
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:32.290
something at her feet. She bends down and picks up a letter,

353
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.680
a letter right in front of the fence and it's an old man.

354
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:38.830
It's kind of like 50 years old, Chris Brown.

355
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.720
Then we looked at the post-market us in 1952 an open this thing up and read it

356
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:46.930
and it's almost about nothing. My dear.

357
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.570
I wrote you up card after receiving the first one. Yeah. See,

358
00:22:50.571 --> 00:22:51.890
some of these are so tough to read,

359
00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.010
so I looked down on the ground and there's another letter.

360
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:59.810
I've been slowly getting on my feet again and another and it is so much better.

361
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.050
It looks like that's her loop to that f another.

362
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.470
Albertine sings very well indeed since you ask.

363
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.850
She told politically they were blown literally in this line down the side of the

364
00:23:10.851 --> 00:23:14.630
highway and we looked at each other and frantically started gathering these

365
00:23:14.631 --> 00:23:16.400
letters, filling our arms with them.

366
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:21.550
Letters from the 1920s I see at 1937 postmark and then she shouts from a couple

367
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:26.600
feet away. 1897 1890 I'm gathering, my arms are getting full.

368
00:23:26.601 --> 00:23:30.740
I run to the truck and grab a garbage bag and I start filling it up and then I

369
00:23:30.741 --> 00:23:34.880
start to notice Ella chase, Ella chase, Ella chase, Ella chase.

370
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.170
These letters are all written to the same woman.

371
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:42.480
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

372
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.370
<v 8>over 300 letters, all written to one woman,</v>

373
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.700
Ella Chase, you know, forget the goat and the cow.

374
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.090
Now we're standing in the middle of the somebody's whole life correspondence

375
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:58.091
spread out on the side of Highway One oh one and we just read and we read and we

376
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:01.400
read into the night.

377
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.980
Let me see if I can find this. A really,

378
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:13.370
soaps that day back in 1994 began a 12 year obsession with Ella chase.

379
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.530
These letters are maybe Eric's favorite thing in the whole world.

380
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.420
He keeps them in this big archival box in his closet.

381
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:27.890
Now what's really interesting is there are a ton of letters that are written to

382
00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:29.840
her as mother or mom.

383
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.600
And first thing Eric pulls out is this big stack of letters written to Ella

384
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:36.470
during World War II.

385
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.500
Probably have 40 letters from boys in the navy to La Chase with that red by

386
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.890
sensors stamp on the letter where they're calling her mom.

387
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.310
I'll read you one and this is one that I act

388
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.510
April 2nd, 1941 from a GI named w Murphy and he writes,

389
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.613
<v 9>well mom,</v>

390
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.040
I hope you don't mind me calling it this cause you were swelled to me and just a

391
00:25:02.041 --> 00:25:05.880
mother to me and I hope I can be seeing you again and keep writing to me if you

392
00:25:05.881 --> 00:25:07.380
will. I sure enjoyed hearing from you.

393
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.870
Hope you received the letter that I wrote a few days ago,

394
00:25:09.871 --> 00:25:13.890
but mail is a little slow going and coming out here. I'm feeling fine.

395
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.000
Only a little tired,

396
00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:17.680
but that's nothing unusual as we are pretty busy all the time.

397
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.200
Oh my better clothes and say a prayer for me if you will. And God bless you.

398
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.240
Love W

399
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.200
<v 8>Murphy, August 3rd, 1945 somewhere.</v>

400
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.670
Do your mom with these kids? No, they're not our kids, they're boys.

401
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.760
1820 years old who were so attached to her just by writing to her that they

402
00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:43.761
started to call her mom and there were like 40 of these letters and a number of

403
00:25:43.771 --> 00:25:47.730
them, from what I can tell in the letters, I have never actually met her.

404
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:52.410
So she became this matriarch to all of these men in the war.

405
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.460
I had never seen anything like that before. Yeah. There's so much.

406
00:25:56.461 --> 00:26:00.300
Something like this. I mean I was just amazed by the reach of her personality.

407
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.740
You know, he showed me dozens of letters thanking her. You look at this,

408
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.470
I am so very grateful. Thank you for what you did for my husband.

409
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.310
He is, thank you for changing the way that I think about my life. Whoa.

410
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:19.390
And these tend to be from people who I'd only met her once. Really? Yeah.

411
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.820
The reverence that people just speak to her. Um,

412
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.270
and you know, I can't figure out when she was married,

413
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.310
I can't figure out where she was married. She ran for political office.

414
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.480
I mean this is a fascinating woman. She ran for political office in the 1940s

415
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.780
but I don't know what office

416
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.160
and that's where the story ends. That's where the story ends. Yeah.

417
00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.010
You mean Eric has never tried to find out anything more?

418
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.870
Remember how I told you he was a teacher before? Yeah.

419
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.050
He started bringing all these letters into his classroom and ended up designing

420
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:01.500
this whole curriculum around them. I collaborated with the history teacher.

421
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:04.890
The kids would each get a photograph, you have to put it in a plastic sleeve.

422
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.970
Each one of the kids, whenever they handled them,

423
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.900
had to put on surgical gloves in history.

424
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.300
The students with research that time period,

425
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.600
and then ultimately they'd bring that work back to my classroom,

426
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:19.260
my English classroom, and they would start writing historical fiction.

427
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:24.650
Eric would ask each student to create that ghost biography of LFA swollen s

428
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.350
history, using her letters as a springboard. And some of the, you know,

429
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:31.230
some of the pieces were wonderful. He just incredible.

430
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.830
He even had them title their papers. My ELA.

431
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.820
That's what's been much more meaningful to me.

432
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.590
So the way Eric sees it,

433
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:46.050
the real Ella was abandoned and he's given her new life.

434
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.390
You know, I feel like a guardian of,

435
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.410
of this person's moment on the earth.

436
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.350
<v 10>Okay. By that you can generally [inaudible] announcement for one 69</v>

437
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.350
<v 7>so here's the thing,</v>

438
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.560
I was already going to California to visit a friend and I couldn't leave things

439
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:11.160
the way they were like the whole time when I would look at these letters and

440
00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:14.270
look at the pictures, I would feel like there's more here.

441
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.420
And find time to San Jose will be approximately five hours and 56 minutes.

442
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.980
How did someone who reached out to all of these people end up with their life on

443
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:26.170
the side of the highway in [inaudible]?

444
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.210
I really wanted to know, do you want to see some of this stuff?

445
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.660
Cause I brought it and brought some, I knew I needed help.

446
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.650
So I contacted this friend of a friend, Marina Cole.

447
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.860
She's this amateur expert in genealogical research and I showed her the letters.

448
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.330
Wait, you had the letters to Derrick give them to? Yeah.

449
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:51.150
Even though he was convinced that they were abandoned. He told me, you know,

450
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.180
I would love to find family that this would truly mean something to do.

451
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:59.700
Your mom? Yes. It's not her son. It's,

452
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:04.530
I'm one of these letters from the World War Two soldiers who all called her mom.

453
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.820
Oh Wow. Soon as I started showing marina the letters,

454
00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:12.060
her face kind of lit up. Oh shoot. It's amazing.

455
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.630
The first thing we decided to do is to go to a historical society. Um,

456
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.470
this woman, we know that she lived in Lomita Park.

457
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.230
Since this is for Daly City,

458
00:29:23.231 --> 00:29:28.120
I assume that I went back and looked at census records to find out a little bit

459
00:29:28.121 --> 00:29:28.954
more about her.

460
00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.930
We found out that Ella had two granddaughters who are still alive.

461
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.150
So we sent letters to our granddaughters,

462
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.833
<v 10>but</v>

463
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.900
<v 7>they'd never respond day to stay street to go Napa Valley highway.</v>

464
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.680
My idea, my fantasy this whole time has been, we'll go to her house,

465
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.900
the address that's on the letters. I know. Maybe bring one of the letters.

466
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.930
It was a single story house. Little Rose Garden.

467
00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.930
I think houses have a strong history. Yeah. Someone there.

468
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.300
We'll be able to tell us something about her. Are they coming or anything?

469
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.480
No answer. So we tried a neighbor.

470
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.960
What is it you want? Hi, I'm sorry. Rather you.

471
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.530
I'm looking to find information about a woman. [inaudible] idea.

472
00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:25.200
We're new here on them. Okay. Well thank you so much.

473
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.433
<v 11>Yeah,</v>

474
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.240
<v 7>the missing husband. I can't find anything on him at all.</v>

475
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.780
He's a complete mystery. I mean there were a lot of unanswered questions,

476
00:30:34.781 --> 00:30:37.840
so we knew that we had to find Ellis obituary.

477
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.310
Day three, the Napa Public Library

478
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.503
<v 3>right</v>

479
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.230
<v 7>in front of the microphone. We're scrolling through dates.</v>

480
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:51.400
August 22nd this was kind of our last hope.

481
00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.673
<v 3>Fuck Huh?</v>

482
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.700
<v 7>The death notice comes up on this screen. Chase in Napa Monday,</v>

483
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.230
July 4th,

484
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:09.230
1915 we scan it as fast as we can just for any new names that we haven't seen

485
00:31:09.331 --> 00:31:14.040
before. Rexford see green, no brain. Almost right away we notice Robert,

486
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.570
Robert Lilee. That's a great saying. There was a cancer, her grandson. Yeah.

487
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.640
We had never seen this name before.

488
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:28.160
<v 10>He was listed. Bob Carol were either down at the store,</v>

489
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.440
uh, give me some milk or we don't know where I am or worse. I'm a lawyer.

490
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.640
<v 7>Hi, I'm, this is a message for Robert Lilee.</v>

491
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.740
My name is Laura Star Chesky.

492
00:31:39.741 --> 00:31:43.400
I'm a reporter and I'm doing a story about a woman, um,

493
00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.440
who I believe is your grandmother.

494
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.800
<v 12>I wanted to hear a voice. I wanted a voice.</v>

495
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.540
Marina returned to Los Altos to get back to her life. And um,

496
00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:02.120
I waited one day past and another,

497
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.010
<v 7>I didn't get a call back from him.</v>

498
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.843
<v 11>Day Six.</v>

499
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.023
<v 7>It was marine</v>

500
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.050
<v 13>marina. Ah,</v>

501
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.360
<v 7>she hadn't been able to start researching. Okay.</v>

502
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.880
<v 13>It's really sad. What is it? Well, in 1938,</v>

503
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.380
she filed for divorce

504
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.850
and there was a series of articles

505
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.110
where he denies that they were married.

506
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.673
<v 7>Really?</v>

507
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.630
<v 14>She pleaded with me to marry her. Ella did,</v>

508
00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:37.350
but we couldn't get along and I refused to do it. He

509
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.070
<v 13>was desperate for money. He to sell the house.</v>

510
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.660
She couldn't do that without divorcing her husband.

511
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:47.880
<v 15>Trial of sensational. I'm not married. Case expected in June.</v>

512
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.920
<v 7>It went on for like a year. The huge headlines Ellis had.</v>

513
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:55.520
They were married Bellman. Her husband says that they never were.

514
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.390
Ella couldn't produce a marriage certificate and then finally the whole thing

515
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:02.900
ended with her just sitting in the courtroom refusing to answer questions.

516
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.930
<v 15>Chase of Lomita park still adamant and defiant,</v>

517
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.800
but this time alone steadfastly refused to answer questions

518
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.080
<v 7>that really wasn't the worst of it.</v>

519
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:19.910
<v 13>There's this really sad article from a few years later, you can find this</v>

520
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:22.550
[inaudible]

521
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.301
<v 16>Christmas,</v>

522
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:28.301
1942 death took no holiday on Christmas eve bellman,

523
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:33.140
chase wandered along, dimmed out south of market.

524
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.880
He had been drinking heavily. He was separated from his wife and family.

525
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.510
Perhaps he was trying to erase thoughts that come to men at such time.

526
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.780
Christmas Day sprawled on his back on a sidewalk.

527
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.900
He died for warm sun,

528
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.640
shone clear on the fractured nose and the Blue Bruise on his chin.

529
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.670
Looks like the bomb is dead. Someone said

530
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.110
<v 13>a couple of days later, it says that his body was left unclaimed in the morgue.</v>

531
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.180
Really they were not able to locate his. A strange Dwight

532
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.310
<v 7>really, it suddenly made sense.</v>

533
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:17.630
It was right after that that she started writing to World War II soldiers.

534
00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:24.780
She probably needed them as much as they needed her day.

535
00:34:26.671 --> 00:34:30.420
Seven Holy Cross cemetery in South San Francisco.

536
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.140
Oh, look, look.

537
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.340
<v 1>Wow.</v>

538
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.940
<v 7>It's a nice headstone. It's a really nice, had snow.</v>

539
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.740
It was gray and unpolished and she was buried with her mother and father.

540
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.270
I wish I had brought flowers.

541
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.330
I know I could go pick some flowers right over there.

542
00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:56.950
<v 1>Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Okay.</v>

543
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.790
<v 7>[inaudible] they're at right a hop position. As soon as I got back,</v>

544
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:09.800
I went to Eric's office.

545
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:17.120
I had all these newspaper clippings in my bag and I was ready to show him.

546
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.090
How were you feeling at this point? I was feeling a little nervous. Yeah.

547
00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:26.091
Some of it is kind of sad and I just want to make sure that you're ready for

548
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:27.020
that.

549
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.730
It's not necessarily positive enlightenment about her family,

550
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:33.380
so let me get it up.

551
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.160
As I'm taking the stuff

552
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.210
<v 8>out of my backpack,</v>

553
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:48.150
she stops me right before I hand it to him.

554
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.340
There's a part of me that's not sure that I want to see it.

555
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.470
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

556
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.681
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

557
00:35:59.681 --> 00:36:04.681
I think if there's no one that would receive these artifacts ultimately or that

558
00:36:05.891 --> 00:36:08.500
we have some sort of connection and appreciation to them,

559
00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.620
I'm not sure I want to say it.

560
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:18.800
You don't want to know any of it. I don't

561
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.460
if there's, don't want to take them over. Um,

562
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.320
I want to live with them as a mystery.

563
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.980
<v 7>I couldn't blame Eric.</v>

564
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:34.850
I was even a little bit jealous of him at that point because he got to choose

565
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:40.880
whether or not to look at this stuff. So with that, hey

566
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.073
<v 8>went home.</v>

567
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.390
But as soon as I got home there was a message on my answering machine.

568
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:50.100
<v 17>Hi, this message is from Laura. My name is Bob [inaudible],</v>

569
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.720
grandson of the Ella Chase and he called him up to message for me,

570
00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.470
try and get ahold of you regarding some of the pictures and letters and stuff

571
00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:00.030
that was found along the road site.

572
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.470
I take action to help fill in the pieces for the puzzle cause they probably came

573
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:07.500
out of my truck on the way from San Jose to southern California.

574
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.430
<v 7>I have some pretty big news for you. Okay. As soon as I got home.</v>

575
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.440
After I talked to you on Friday, I got a message from Ellis grandson.

576
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.630
He's the one who dropped the box

577
00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:25.140
<v 17>during the course of driving down highway one oh one taking these boxes home in</v>

578
00:37:25.141 --> 00:37:28.350
the back of my pickup that several of them blew out. Okay.

579
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.750
<v 7>He tried to pull over and get it right.</v>

580
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.880
<v 17>Stopped alongside the road and my wife was with me and we picked up everything</v>

581
00:37:34.881 --> 00:37:35.670
we could.

582
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.450
<v 7>Yeah. But as soon as he started to collect it,</v>

583
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.710
the California highway patrol pulled over and told them that he had to keep

584
00:37:42.711 --> 00:37:43.220
going.

585
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.140
<v 17>They were going to give me a ticket for littering</v>

586
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.800
<v 7>because the stuff's scattered everywhere.</v>

587
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.660
<v 17>This stuff was just blowing everywhere</v>

588
00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:52.700
<v 7>and he has a whole bunch of boxes like the one that fell off.</v>

589
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.210
<v 17>I'm still going through this stuff and it's been 1213 years.</v>

590
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.400
<v 7>I love that you actually found who dropped this stuff and did you sound sad</v>

591
00:38:05.421 --> 00:38:09.620
about it? What was his reaction? He just seemed the happy go lucky about it.

592
00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:12.590
He was like, I think I can solve your mystery. Cause I,

593
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.950
when I was talking to Bob, I told him about Eric of course.

594
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.450
And I told him how much Eric cared about all this stuff and he was really

595
00:38:20.451 --> 00:38:23.390
relieved. He didn't think it was weird at all.

596
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:28.570
He just was glad that someone had cherished this stuff and he came up with the

597
00:38:29.061 --> 00:38:33.140
idea right away of sending Eric kind of a replacement.

598
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.280
<v 17>I have another group</v>

599
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.240
<v 0>of pictures, this Bob, all of Ellis stuff.</v>

600
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.660
Bob Sent Eric this mystery box full of photos that he couldn't explain.

601
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.000
I still can't get over the timing though. Like, okay,

602
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:52.900
so Bob passes by in the truck, the box flies out and then what?

603
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:53.740
Like a couple of hours later,

604
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:57.430
this goat jumps on a cow's back and causes these two people to stop and get the

605
00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:02.410
letters basically. Do you think the goat on a cow was a sign?

606
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.770
What do you mean Zeus saying, stop Derek. Stop.

607
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.180
I think you could tell it that way, but goats like to stand on top of cows.

608
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.740
Really? Yeah. Goats like to stand on top of anything high.

609
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.730
If there's a fence to the jump on top of it. There's a house,

610
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:26.560
they'll try and climb it. That's what goats do you think so?

611
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.820
How do you know all this? I've seen goats. You know,

612
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.870
my mom used to send me up the road to buy eggs from this woman who had all these

613
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:39.400
goats and they had a little goat shack and all the goats would be clustered on

614
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:40.450
top of the goat shack.

615
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.870
Although they had a whole yard full of scraggly grass and grazing.

616
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.600
Did you ever say to Eric, Eric goats just kinda like to do this?

617
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.990
No, I never said that to him. I mean, okay, good.

618
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.850
It's like the stand on tall things, but since when does a cow not care?

619
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.140
The goat's not extraordinary. It's the cow. It's a nonchalant cow.

620
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.890
Yes. Hmm.

621
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:10.680
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

622
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.300
<v 0>Laura Starecheski is a producer. She lives in New York and non chalant cow.</v>

623
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.850
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.

624
00:40:17.851 --> 00:40:21.870
Our next detective story begins with a drop of blood and from the blood we

625
00:40:21.871 --> 00:40:26.550
discover 16 and a half million baby boys. This is Radiolab.

626
00:40:26.551 --> 00:40:29.880
I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich, which, and I will continue in a moment.

627
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.670
You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio.

628
00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:42.160
[inaudible], e. N. N. P. R.

629
00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.870
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad up. I'm Rod and I'm Robert Krulwich.

630
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.220
Today on our program,

631
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:51.960
stories about stumbling onto the past and finding surprises.

632
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.380
Strange things which brings us to DNA.

633
00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:00.600
DNA is used to track crimes. This we know from police dramas like CSI,

634
00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:03.870
far less glamorously but no less. Interestingly,

635
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:09.170
historians and geneticists use DNA to go way back in time and answer basic

636
00:42:10.411 --> 00:42:13.290
questions about who we are and where we came from.

637
00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.710
And that is an unlikely development if you think [inaudible].

638
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.220
<v 18>Yeah, cause usually when you know, if someone has sex with someone else,</v>

639
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:20.330
the DNA gets mixed.

640
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.630
So the DNA is always changing from one generation to the next.

641
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.070
It's always getting jumbled up.

642
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.810
One would think it would be hard to keep track of across time. Yeah, but

643
00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.240
<v 0>and here's what you need to know. For our next segment,</v>

644
00:42:31.241 --> 00:42:34.460
there are patches of DNA which don't change.

645
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.920
The y chromosome is the one of these places.

646
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.520
This is the chromosome that men have that women don't have.

647
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.200
And when a father has a son,

648
00:42:42.201 --> 00:42:46.640
he gives his son an exact copy of his y chromosome,

649
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.820
<v 18>sort of like xerox.</v>

650
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.920
<v 0>Then when many years later, the boy has a boy of his own</v>

651
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.160
<v 19>[inaudible].</v>

652
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.290
<v 0>Nothing happens in exact copy of the why</v>

653
00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.640
<v 19>on and on and on down the male line. Now</v>

654
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:02.700
<v 0>here's where it gets interesting.</v>

655
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.880
Every so often the cellular xerox makes a mistake,

656
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.080
a tiny mistake, sort of like at work.

657
00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:14.220
When you put the paper on the copier in the copy, it's spits back out at you,

658
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.480
has a little smudge on it, little Spec, maybe some dust got in there. Who knows?

659
00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.080
It's not a big deal. I mean you can still read that text,

660
00:43:22.081 --> 00:43:25.660
but this new Munchie copy is in its way

661
00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:31.270
Munich. It's no longer just to copy cause it's got that Spec on it.

662
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.580
[inaudible] this is where the analogy breaks down a bit.

663
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:37.390
Granted because a paper with the SPEC is not a very interesting thing,

664
00:43:37.391 --> 00:43:42.391
but a y chromosome with a mutation is useful cause geneticists can look at that

665
00:43:43.761 --> 00:43:47.780
little Spec, that little mutation on the y and say that right there.

666
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.800
That came from one man somewhere in time.

667
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.770
It's a clue and since they know that little mutation will get copied and yeah,

668
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.703
<v 19>you got me,</v>

669
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.040
<v 0>they know that everyone else who shows up with it is descended from that man.</v>

670
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.351
<v 18>Now,</v>

671
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:07.880
this principle that a particularly mutation on the y chromosome comes from an

672
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:12.050
individual back in time brings us to a wonderful story that I want to tell you.

673
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:16.020
Once upon a time a group of scientists led by this guy. Yeah,

674
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.700
I am a Spencer wells. I'm a population geneticists.

675
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:24.530
Got into a Land Rover and headed off to Asia on what they call a blood sampling

676
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:25.070
tool.

677
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:30.070
<v 0>He set off in April of 1998 on a six month odyssey and it was literally four</v>

678
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:32.130
guys

679
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.120
<v 18>and that it wasn't just four guys, so my name is [inaudible].</v>

680
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:40.470
I'm an Italian researcher. Yeah. She flew over for about three weeks.

681
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:43.560
I joined them in Ashkelon. She came with us to Kyrgyzstan,

682
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:48.030
taking samples on the caucuses to the Altai mountains,

683
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.760
driving all over centrally. Each said 10 hours.

684
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.110
Hinton come from place to place weeping like 10 we sampled.

685
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.800
It was a thousand people. It was really an adventure.

686
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.710
So here's what they do. Each village they'd come to,

687
00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:04.800
they'd find out who was in charge and then they'd sit down with him or her.

688
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.410
Describe the project. Simple terms,

689
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:09.960
basically make sure that we had permission to do the airplane.

690
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:15.090
They'd say to the chief, okay, we are here. Tell good story.

691
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.350
The history of your people, your family.

692
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:23.490
Because by looking closely at the DNA in an ordinary blood sample,

693
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:27.570
we can discover where your ancestors came from, where they went,

694
00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:29.130
who they conquered, who conquered them.

695
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:34.560
Or we can go back hundreds of generations and typically most people would

696
00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.180
willingly give us blood sample.

697
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.073
<v 10>Awesome.</v>

698
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.400
<v 18>Well, what were they looking for exactly? Or I guess what were they,</v>

699
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.260
what do they expect to find? Well,

700
00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:47.560
this same group had done this in Europe and when they did it in Europe,

701
00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:51.520
when they took blood from people, they found lots and lots of very distinct,

702
00:45:51.521 --> 00:45:55.180
separate families with very separate ancestors. That makes sense.

703
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:58.750
That's what they were expecting to find in Asia, but that's not what they found.

704
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:02.103
<v 10>Wow.</v>

705
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.310
<v 18>Any case, Spencer,</v>

706
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.990
it gives Tatyana a batch of the DNA samples almost 2017 it goes back to her lab

707
00:46:07.991 --> 00:46:11.110
in London. And the goal again was, was very kind of open ended.

708
00:46:11.111 --> 00:46:13.000
What are the genetic patterns in Central Asia

709
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.130
that China gets all her DNA,

710
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:21.630
lays it out and begins to investigate and right away something's a little odd.

711
00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:23.283
[inaudible]

712
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.203
<v 3>uh,</v>

713
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:28.290
<v 18>I really thought we've made a mistake in sample after sample after sample.</v>

714
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:33.350
She could see a specific mutation and we knew that everybody that presented that

715
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.630
mutation come from one individual, sometimes in the past,

716
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:44.660
meaning all those modern Asian guys from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and Mongolia

717
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:45.690
and China,

718
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:49.770
people who came from very different ancient tribes and should have only the most

719
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.710
distant family connections. Weirdly,

720
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.150
they shared a fairly recent Greek Greek, Greek, Greek, Greek, great,

721
00:46:57.151 --> 00:47:01.510
great grandparents. No one ever seen anything like this before. No.

722
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.390
She asked for her boss to come. Yeah, I'm Chris Titus Smith.

723
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.970
And she showed him the data. As soon as we saw that,

724
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.760
we knew that that couldn't happen by chance so low.

725
00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:18.910
So the first thing she wanted to know was when did this mysterious person,

726
00:47:18.911 --> 00:47:22.980
when did he live? So using some statistical programs,

727
00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:26.770
she plugged the data into a computer program and asked it to count backwards to

728
00:47:26.771 --> 00:47:30.010
the first moment when the mutation appeared in the program.

729
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:34.540
Saving roughly 1000 years, a thousand years ago, give or take 200 years.

730
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:36.760
This person live now. Now this is interesting.

731
00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:40.900
If you are alive a thousand years ago and you had a son and that son had a son,

732
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:45.220
so forth, you would have right now about 800 living descendants.

733
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:46.510
This person,

734
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:51.750
whoever he was has right now like 16 millions of 16 million descendants.

735
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.220
Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah. Yes, absolutely.

736
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:00.483
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

737
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:05.520
<v 18>now here's where it gets interesting, Tatyana. I got herself a map. Yeah.</v>

738
00:48:05.521 --> 00:48:07.950
I had the map of the region and I spread on a map.

739
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.680
The frequency of these linens.

740
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:14.230
She began putting pins where ever she saw heavy concentrations of the mutation

741
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:18.990
in Mongolia, put a pin in Mongolian China, China's Iberia, Siberia.

742
00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:23.610
Pakistan has exten Pakistan and then she stood back and looked at this map.

743
00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:28.050
These pins spread all across Asia and she's like, now wait a second.

744
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.280
So then you had realized that the spread of this lineage was perfectly matching

745
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:38.070
the spread of the Mongol Empire. As soon as she saw it,

746
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.430
they went to Greece and Tatiana said to him, you know Chris,

747
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.710
I think I found kings county.

748
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.413
<v 1>Ooh,</v>

749
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:53.110
that's pretty interesting.

750
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.890
<v 18>I knew just what I studied when I was at high school,</v>

751
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.670
if I didn't really know much about it, but she knew the basics.

752
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:27.200
In the 13th century Gangas Kahn United the tribes of Mongolia into a massive

753
00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:29.330
army and they rode west,

754
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.570
literally killing thousands and thousands of men.

755
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:36.810
So that means removing competitors if you kill them and you

756
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.170
[inaudible]. And then with all those men and their y chromosomes out of the way,

757
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.230
Gingiss slept with a whole lot of ladies.

758
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:51.020
It's true. He, I believe he slept with many, many women. That's what she read.

759
00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:53.120
Wild, fantastic tales.

760
00:49:53.121 --> 00:49:56.150
Myths really have harems that numbered in the hundreds.

761
00:49:56.151 --> 00:49:59.480
I mean the stories when they were getting into new village,

762
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:04.990
he was the one picking up the youngest women and keeping them for himself.

763
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:09.590
Shingles undoubtedly had a number of quite a number of sexual partners.

764
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.530
We want to just be a little careful here, so we called up an expert. Yeah.

765
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.080
Ms Maurice for Sabi,

766
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:19.370
a professor of Mongolian history from Columbia University and arranged for

767
00:50:19.371 --> 00:50:23.940
breakfast. Can I get a couple of scrambled eggs? Yes. I have read accounts. I,

768
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:28.040
I don't know how a wheelie are, where the mangoes would come conquer

769
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.660
<v 9>territory and there was a save the pretty ones for the boss kind of rule.</v>

770
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.760
Is that true at all? Yes, that's true.

771
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:40.090
One story is that he was murdered by one of these women who had sex with that

772
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:44.780
she placed a knife in her vagina and as they were having sex,

773
00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:48.080
he was stabbed and killed. Whether that's true or not,

774
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:50.690
that's an interesting story.

775
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.590
<v 18>Well, whatever.</v>

776
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:57.590
If gangas did have the power to command any woman he wanted and if the dates

777
00:50:57.601 --> 00:51:00.270
were right for history and the places were right geographically,

778
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.120
all the evidence points in the same direction,

779
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:05.600
that looks like a duck and it walks like a duck. Yeah.

780
00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:06.990
The inference was that it was a dock.

781
00:51:06.991 --> 00:51:09.180
This was this Kangaskhan is y chromosome lineage.

782
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:14.300
And so 23 scientists from all over the world together announced in the American

783
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:15.210
Journal of human genetics.

784
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:20.450
That gang is Khan was very probably the most successful biological father in

785
00:51:21.061 --> 00:51:24.960
human history. Human history. Yes. Which in all of time, in all of time.

786
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.360
And the thing about this story is it really,

787
00:51:27.361 --> 00:51:30.840
really it caught people's attention because this is one of those things where

788
00:51:30.841 --> 00:51:35.260
you can actually do something about it. You can take those DNA tests. Sorry,

789
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.960
I just lost my earphones. I got so excited. Yes, I know. The DNA test,

790
00:51:39.961 --> 00:51:42.240
the swab, your growth cheeks. Put it in a vile.

791
00:51:42.241 --> 00:51:43.470
Send them back to these companies.

792
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.710
I may send you big tell you whether you have Gingiss con's marker.

793
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.850
How much are these tests? How much about not? I don't know.

794
00:51:50.851 --> 00:51:55.800
I know it depends on 300 bucks. 300 hundred bucks. Your check for 300 bucks.

795
00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:59.280
I can find out if I'm related to gangs cause yeah, I bet I am.

796
00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.093
I bet you Nah,

797
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.810
cause his conquest routes ended sort of near Lebanon where my folks are from.

798
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:07.690
[inaudible] come on.

799
00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:11.910
Look at suckers like you who were perfect marks for businesses

800
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.740
<v 9>like this. We found this restaurant in London</v>

801
00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:22.490
called shish called call what? Shish. Shish because for short,

802
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:23.480
for Shish Kebab,

803
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:29.590
they announced a major Gingiss con promotion 10 when is had DNA testing done and

804
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.830
Oxford find out if they were ancestors of Kangaskhan.

805
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.780
This was a very unique and the response was just people came carrying demand.

806
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.360
There were lines around the block phone call. The phones were ringing all day.

807
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.930
I mean I never thought that would have been that interest cause after,

808
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.010
I'll put this in your own mind, if you're sitting there thinking, well,

809
00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:53.180
if I'm related to Gangas Kahn, that explains my extraordinary backhand.

810
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:55.990
<v 18>See you weren't the only one.</v>

811
00:52:55.991 --> 00:53:00.150
There were a lot of people working under strange illusions like you a lot.

812
00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:02.350
Let me ask you this though. If I,

813
00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.810
let's say I had taken a test and came up positive,

814
00:53:04.811 --> 00:53:07.510
I am so it seems related to gangs, Khan,

815
00:53:07.511 --> 00:53:12.340
does that really mean anything definitively? I mean, is that marker for sure.

816
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.340
Gangs, cons, marker. Do we know that? In fact, no.

817
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:19.060
The only way you ever know for sure that it's anybody's mutation is you've got

818
00:53:19.061 --> 00:53:23.320
to go to the body, pluck some DNA from the body, see if it matches the mutation.

819
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:28.350
So you got to find Gingiss cons body. Yeah, that would be the ultimate proof.

820
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:31.850
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

821
00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:36.620
<v 18>and by the way, there's a lot of people looking, oh my God. Oh,</v>

822
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.880
found a human skull buried in the England barrier.

823
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.960
I have been doing this now for going on to eating the half years and we've dug

824
00:53:46.611 --> 00:53:50.810
up with some very nice fellas so far. That guy is Maury cravats.

825
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:55.070
This voice you hear is a direct result of screaming for years.

826
00:53:55.071 --> 00:53:57.530
He was a commodities trader in Chicago. Yeah,

827
00:53:57.531 --> 00:54:01.370
I was a warrior of the trading pits. He got just enough money actually.

828
00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:06.110
He made quite a bit of money to sponsor annual summer trips looking for Gangas

829
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.640
cons corpse. Why is he looking for gangs? Con Valuables? Great.

830
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:14.330
Well cause he knows that for all the sacking and pillaging that the Mongols did

831
00:54:14.331 --> 00:54:19.070
back in the 12 hundreds chis this day. Not One virtual dagger,

832
00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:23.330
not one necklace, not one diamond studded Tiara,

833
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:28.390
which could be identified from the 13 gentry has ever sugarfish suggesting that

834
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.190
might be all under the surface of the ground.

835
00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:35.900
Similar to suggesting that it all went south with the old man.

836
00:54:35.901 --> 00:54:38.210
So there might be two treasures here.

837
00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.140
Here's the physical treasure and the biological treasure.

838
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:44.180
Well that's where a scientist,

839
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:48.770
I am a different sort of Genghis Khan man,

840
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:53.950
but you're not going to be able to do a proper DNA search unless the guy like me

841
00:54:54.201 --> 00:54:56.480
find the tomb boy says if there is a treasure,

842
00:54:56.481 --> 00:55:00.380
he will happily hand it over to the Mongolian government officials are a little

843
00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:03.830
leery excavation. So he continues to plead his case.

844
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:09.410
<v 9>Okay. If we FG you must, sorry. Exactly. Must be [inaudible]</v>

845
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.410
<v 18>what do you mean no?</v>

846
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.910
And he keeps digging up bodies always with the same result. Well,

847
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.160
<v 5>it's not [inaudible] not</v>

848
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.880
[inaudible] [inaudible]

849
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.720
<v 18>the problem is nobody knows where Gangas Kahn is buried.</v>

850
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:29.360
They don't even know if he was buried.

851
00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.000
They don't even know if there's any place there thing to find.

852
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.690
<v 9>Uh, it appears unlikely.</v>

853
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:39.850
Professor Mushavi says no looking for Gangas is uh, I don't know.

854
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:44.940
He died in 1227 and they had no tradition of tumor culture at that point.

855
00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.380
The body was just left word.

856
00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.750
So does that mean we'll never know? No,

857
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:53.770
<v 18>there may be a way out of this.</v>

858
00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.840
Gingiss con he had a grandson who bla con

859
00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.880
the famous emperor of China.

860
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:05.320
Cuba has the same exact mutation that his grandpa had.

861
00:56:05.321 --> 00:56:06.154
That's the nature of [inaudible].

862
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:10.140
<v 9>And I think more likely discovery will be of cougar cons. Joe,</v>

863
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.570
why not look for coop? We're use [inaudible].

864
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.620
Would you get, well,

865
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:21.060
we know as stated in the sources as somewhere in Mongolia when it is discovered,

866
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:24.040
it'll be a real bonanza. Yeah. So you talked to Marie,

867
00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:26.110
<v 20>everybody, it seems to me you can go on the funds that you idiot.</v>

868
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:29.810
You're looking for the wrong guy. Well wait,

869
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:34.240
<v 18>I'm going to cut you off. Morris or Sabby is going to say,</v>

870
00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.760
I'm looking for the wrong guy. You know it's true.

871
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:40.030
He happens to Kubelet con as the, his, his, his pitch and speakers.

872
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:42.940
He wrote a book on Coupla Con. Okay. Okay.

873
00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:47.830
The point is both gangas and Kubelet con have the same genetic markets.

874
00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:49.420
If you find either one, either one,

875
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.080
we'll do pluck a hair from either guy's body, look up the DNA,

876
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:57.010
and then you will know for sure if gangas and his family not only conquered the

877
00:56:57.011 --> 00:57:01.570
ancient world, but fathered the modern world one day we will know

878
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.970
<v 21>[inaudible].</v>

879
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:08.250
<v 20>And I guess the neat thing about all of these tales is you know,</v>

880
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.110
you think when you're going to tell a story from the past at the sensible place

881
00:57:12.111 --> 00:57:15.830
to go is you go to the library, you go to a fossil, you go to were ruined.

882
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.630
The truth is you can go anywhere.

883
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:22.010
The blood coursing through your veins tells you, I have a story for you.

884
00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:24.860
Same with a little bit of garbage that sits next to an ancient shoe.
