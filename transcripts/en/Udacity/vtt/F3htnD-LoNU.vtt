In the last lesson, we looked at the logs that I had written here, and I asked

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:08.448
you to see if you could come up with any links between the numbers. Now that

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:11.044
you've had a chance to think about that for awhile, I'd like to give you a

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:15.445
chance to document your thoughts. Please write in this box any ideas you have

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:19.166
about the connection between the numbers we've input into the logs in the

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:24.316
numbers that are output. Also just to remind you, these three numbers right

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:27.768
here are rounded. So this is just a chance for you to make a guess and it's not

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:29.289
going to be graded.
