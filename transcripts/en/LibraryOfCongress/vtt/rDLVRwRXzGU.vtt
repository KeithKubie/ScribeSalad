00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.510
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Hi.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.210
Welcome. Have any of you been to
the Young Reader's Center before?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.950
Well, we're glad to have you
and we hope you come back.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.420
And today we have a very special
person whose name is Molly Idle.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.390
And she is an author and
an illustrator of books

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.360
for young children your age.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.460
And she has come all
the way from Arizona.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.760
So I am going to turn the
program over to Molly and then,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.670
at the end of the program,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.490
the schools that have
ordered books can pick them

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.270
up at the reference desk.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.240
There is a bag -- in one case, two
bags -- with your names on them.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.680
Okay? Thank you.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.980
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Thank you.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.160
Miss Karen, could I get a
copy of each of the books

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.120
up here so that I can read them?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.420
May I get a copy of
each of the books?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.720
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Oh, sure.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.020
The book is right there.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.320
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: So we can read.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.620
Oh, perfect.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.920
Good morning.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.220
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]:
Good morning.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.520
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: How are
you guys doing today?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.820
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Good.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.120
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: It is very
rainy outside today, isn't it?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.420
[Children voice agreement]

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.720
I am really -- thank you.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.020
Can I have The Flamingo, too?

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.320
Thank you.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.620
I am really enjoying the rain.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.530 position:56%
Because, you know, I come from
Phoenix, Arizona, and it is a desert

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.000
and we don't often get
rain in the desert.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.190
So to me, this is a real treat.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.830
Water falling from the sky.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.130
It's different for me.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.710
Do you -- does it rain here often?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.250
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.920
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Is it fun -- Oh, no!

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.050
Oh, that can be hard.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.890
Unless -- it can be fun to
splash in the puddles, can't it?

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.190
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.050
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Standing in the
water, making splooshing noises.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.350
&gt;&gt; Child 1: No.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.520
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Do you know,
some birds like the water, too.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.400
I thought maybe we
could draw one together.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.510
Hmm. I'm going to get
out some markers,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.510
and let's see if you can
guess what I am going to draw.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.230
Hmm. You know, when
I do my drawings,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.020
I always start with simple shapes.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.060
Now, you are all in
preschool and kindergarten,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.990
so you have already learned
your shapes haven't you?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.290
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.890
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: So you
know -- [Inaudible].

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.190
First grade?

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.490
Oh, my gosh!

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.790
You're so big.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.060
So, circles and triangles
and rectangles.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.390
I'm going to start
drawing with an oval.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.690
How about this?

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.190
I'm going to put a small
oval right up here.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.080
And then I'm going to
add another oval here.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.000
Hmm.... Maybe.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.300
Let's see.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.990
What if I do two lines?

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.530
One here and here?

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.830
What do you think?

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.130
[Children Guessing Aloud]

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.430
A flamingo.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.730
You guys are good guessers.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.030
Shall we finish drawing him?

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.330
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.630
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: All right.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.830
I'm going to add another oval
here, and maybe one here.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.550
Have you guys learned about
three dimensional shapes?

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.490
Like spheres and pyramids
and cylinders?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.660
&gt;&gt; Child: And like cubes.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.140
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: You got it -- cubes.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.850
Cubes -- very good.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.690
Well, I'm going to draw a cylinder.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.990
&gt;&gt; Child: In circles?

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.450
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Circles
are good, too.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.470
Let's see -- what if I
now add some triangles?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.750
I could put one here to show
us where his beak would be,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.700
and maybe here for a tail.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.630
I could put one here.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.850
Does anybody know what shape you
get when you put one triangle

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.900
on top of another triangle?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.200
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Diamond.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.500
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Very good!

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.310
You also get a fabulous
flamingo knee.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.990
And then we could put
a triangle down here.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.290
But that's just one leg.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.260
And flamingos have two, don't they?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.490
But they always stand on one.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.570
&gt;&gt; [Child]: Are you going
to do a statue of it?

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.170
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Hmm --
kind of like a statue.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.400
Have any of you ever done a
Connect the Dots puzzle before?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.700
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.000
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Yes.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.300
Well then you will
know what this is like.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.180
This is like Connect the Dots, but
instead of connecting the dots,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.220
I am going to connect the shapes
to help finish this flamingo.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.180
And I just use all of our
simple shapes like a guide.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.170
You know, flamingos stand on
one leg because they stand

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.120
in cold water trying to catch
their food and they have

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.750
to warm up their other leg.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.150
Don't they?

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.110
Does anybody know what
flamingos eat?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.410
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Fish.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.710
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Fish?

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.580
They love shrimp.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.480
And that is what makes them pink.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.090
That is what makes flamingos pink.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.190
So what if shrimp were blue?

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.840
Would flamingos be blue?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.540
Exactly. Do you know?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.160
I think flamingos have lovely --
look at that long straight leg.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.470
Do you think maybe flamingos
would be good dancers?

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.770
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.140
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: I think so, too.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.090
And in fact, I've got a story
about a flamingo who likes

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.370
to dance, who makes friends.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.920
Yes! I thought we could
read that one today.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.500
&gt;&gt; Child: I already read it.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.380
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: You have read it?

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.860
Well, maybe there is
somebody who hasn't.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.160
&gt;&gt; Child: I haven't.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.460
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: I have.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.800
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Well, let's see.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.450
Did you know that there are some
stories you can read without words?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.750
&gt;&gt; Child: Pictures?

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.530
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: You can read the
pictures and you can read --

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.750
I bet you guys didn't already know
you could read another language.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.130
You can read body language.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.910
So, like, if your friend walks
into the classroom and looks

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.710
like this, how are they feeling?

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.010
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Happy.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.310
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: What if
their face looks like this?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.610
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Sad.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.580
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: And they didn't
have to say a word, did they?

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.670
Hm-mm. You could read
their body language.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.150
Hang on. So let's see if
we can read this book.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.430
And I will try not to talk much.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.910
Flora and the Flamingo.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.050
Is he alone?

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.350
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.650
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Is he?

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.950
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.120
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mmm.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.420
Let's see who it is.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.480
Flora. They look alike
-- kind of -- don't they?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.290
&gt;&gt; Child: Yeah.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.260
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Watch this.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.560
Hmm. [Whistles].

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.380
Hmm. Hmm.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.490
What do you think?

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.820
Does the flamingo want to play?

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.120
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.040
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Maybe.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.340
Flora does.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.390
Yep. Ooh -- tricky.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.690
Mmm.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.790
I bet you guys know
what this game is.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.630
Hmm. Peek-a-boo.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.930
Oh!

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.240
Oh, that is tricky, isn't it?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.480
Ooh!

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.920
&gt;&gt; Child: Peek-a-boo.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.500
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Uh-oh.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.800
He's laughing.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.760
Hmm.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.980
Aww. How does Flora feel now?

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.550
&gt;&gt; Child: Sad.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.460
&gt;&gt; And maybe he feels bad?

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.310
Maybe he'd help her up?

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.120
Hmm. I think she's not sure.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.730
Do you think the flamingo
wants to make it up to her?

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.030
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.710
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Aww.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.300
And then, look at this, they
could help each other dance,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.180
couldn't they?

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.050
Whoo-hoo. Hmm-hmm.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.080
Hmm-hmm.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.450
Plies are tricky for flamingos.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.860
Their knees bend the wrong way.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.170
Oooh! Very fancy.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.810
[ Humming ]

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.570
Oh, look at this.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.970
And a leap.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.480
Oh.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.700
Splash.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.410
And a bow.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.090
Do you think they ended up friends?

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.390
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.480
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Me, too.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.910
I brought another story to
share with you today, too.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.250
&gt;&gt; Child: You brought three.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.380
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: I did, but
I'm going to read two.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.000
I think this book is
about making a friend.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.200
But I brought a book today
that is about what happens

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.520
when three friends
get together to play.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.810
Have you ever played with more
than one of your friends and it --

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.220
and it can be hard for
everyone to get along, right?

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.520
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.280
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: It can be
hard to decide what to play.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.190
Mm-hmm. It's right there.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.530
Flora and -- do you know
what kind of birds these are?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.570
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Peacock.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.870
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Yes.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.870
Peacocks. Peacocks raise
their tail feathers

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.770
to get attention, don't they?

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.070
Tell me one thing.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:45.040
&gt;&gt; Child: Not all -- do you know
only the boy are called peacocks?

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.340
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: That is true.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.260
And the girls are called
peahens, aren't they?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.700
And they don't have
the fancy feathers.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.840
&gt;&gt; Child: And the baby
is called peachicks.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.120
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: They would
be adorable -- like you!

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.420
All right.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.320
So shall we read this
book and see what happens

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.800
when three friends get together
and have to cooperate to play?

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.100
Look who is here?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.110
Flora! Hmm?

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.410
&gt;&gt; Child: Peacock.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.210
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Just one?

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:29.070
Two. So how many friends are there?

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.100
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Three.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.400
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mm-hmm.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.740
Does Flora want to play?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.040
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.340
&gt;&gt; Child: No.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.640
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mm-hmm.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.190
Do both the peacocks want to play?

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.200
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.500
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mmm.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.800
This guy?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.100
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.400
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: What about him?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.700
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: He's not sure, is he?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.590
Not sure if he wants a new friend.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.050
Well, these guys look happy.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.670
But how does he look?

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.510
&gt;&gt; Child: Not happy.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.170
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Not happy.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.470
Look at this.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.670
These guys are having
fun playing together.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:22.130
One. Two.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.420
Does he feel left out maybe?

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.720
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.380
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: And he says, Humph!

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.680
Don't want to play.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.890
Oh, dear. Hmmm.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.700
Oh. Now they realize,
oh, we left him out.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.000
Oh, dear.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.330
I think Flora wants to
make him feel better.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:05.150
Yes? But if she wants to play
with him, how does this one feel?

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.950
[Inaudible] Mm-hmm.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.740
What will happen?

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.640
What will happen?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.940
Now they are having fun.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.320
But what about him?

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.760
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.060
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Hmm.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.240
Sad. Like his feelings are
hurt a bit, maybe, huh?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.080
And when you feel sad, sometimes

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.710
that makes you feel
something else, too.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.370
Angry.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.670
&gt;&gt; Child: Or jealous.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.970
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Or jealous.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.160
That's -- those are both true.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.350
And sometimes when you are
angry you do not nice things.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.230
Uh oh! Huh!

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.320
Uh oh! Oh, dear.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:52.900
I don't have a good feeling about
how this is going to end, you guys.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.890
Uh oh. They're pulling on her fan.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.590
What's going to happen?

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.670
Uh oh. They ripped her fan.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.680
Does anybody look happy now?

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.980
&gt;&gt; Children [Together] No.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.370
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mm-mm.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.730
Does Flora still want to play?

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.030
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.330
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mm-mm.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.630
&gt;&gt; Child: They broke the fan.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.950
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: They broke the fan.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.690
Do you think maybe they
could make it up to her?

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.990
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.290
No.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.590
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: No?

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.890
I hope they can.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.190
I hope they can.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.900
I like a happy ending.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.200
Let's see.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.200
Maybe if they work together.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.210
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Whoa!

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:47.180
Oh! Wow! [Inaudible]

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.720
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: There you go.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.150
So, is everyone happy now?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.810
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.110
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Yeah.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.410
&gt;&gt; Child: That was funny.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.600
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Three friends now.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.950
And that's the end.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.860
There we go.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.160
&gt;&gt; Child: Another one?

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.750
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Another one?

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.050
&gt;&gt; Child: Yeah.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.350
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: I do have one more.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.650
Should we do a third?

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.950
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.250
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Okay, one more!

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:22.090
What kind of bird is this?

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.840
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Penguin.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.140
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Yes.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.440
A penguin.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.010
Do penguins live where
it is hot, hot, hot?

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.310
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.610
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: No.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.910
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]:
Where it's cold.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.210
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Where it's cold.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.760
And what happens to
water when it gets cold?

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.060
What does it turn into?

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.730
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Ice.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.030
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Ice.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.530
And do you know what
you can do on ice?

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.850
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Ice skate!

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.150
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Skate.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.760
I think penguins would
be good ice skaters.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.020
They might even be good friends.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:57.490
This book is about what happens
when two friends have an argument.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:04.060
Have you ever had an argument
with one of your friends?

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.360
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.660
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: And then,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.960
4 if you're a good friend,
you have to figure out how

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.130
to say you're sorry
and make it up, right?

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.430
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.200
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: So let's
see what happens when Flora

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.780
and the penguin get together.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.080
She's got her skates.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.380
Who's coming?

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.680
&gt;&gt; Child: A penguin.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.980
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Ooh!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.280
Somebody else, too.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.650
What's in the water swimming?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.390
&gt;&gt; Child: Fish

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.690
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Fish.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.650
I think she says, hey.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.950
Huh -- more fish.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.880
And more fish.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.480
&gt;&gt; Child: And more fish.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.290
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: And now
they can skate together.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:51.780
Back and forth and back and forth.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.740
Oh, look at this.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.040
They can get tricky.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.920
Ah! And skate backwards.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.800
Uh oh. But's what's behind them?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.960
Look out. Ah!

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.970
Sploosh.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.150
Does anybody know what
penguins like to eat?

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.940
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Fish.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.240
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Fish.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.670
Look out, fish.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.130
Penguins love to fish.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.050
But what about Flora?

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.340
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.980
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Hmm -- where
is he, she's wondering.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.480
&gt;&gt; Child: Under water.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.440
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Do you
think he'll catch the fish?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.740
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.040
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Oh!

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.780
He got it.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.270
He looks very pleased with himself.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.380
Oh, look. He gave -- who
did he give the fish to?

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.690
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Flora.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.640
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Does
she like the fish?

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.890
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.190
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mmm.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.660
But if you're a penguin,
wouldn't you like to get a fish?

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.150
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.450
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mm-hmm.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.290
He thinks he gave her
a very nice present.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.650
But what does she do with it?

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.740
&gt;&gt; Child: Toss it in the water.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.510
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Look at his face!

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.050
How could you?

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:26.630
Oh, look. He's sticking
out his tongue at her.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.130
And says --

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:35.760
He is mad, isn't he?

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.150
He says, Hump -- hmm-hmm-hmm.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:43.280
Aww. Now she knows
she hurt his feelings.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.410
She's taking off her skates.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.710
&gt;&gt; Child: Uh oh.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.040
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Do you
think they're done?

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.990
Do you think they're done playing?

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.290
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: No.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.770
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Is she going to go?

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.190
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.730
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Wait.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.510
What is she doing with her laces?

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.050
She's fishing.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.400
Do you think she could
catch a fish for him?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.520
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.770
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Maybe.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.090
There's one left.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.810
I think they got a bite.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.110
Let's see.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.410
See if they can pull it out.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.710
Ooh -- pull!

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.010
Oh no. Oh, no -- pull, pull, pull.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.870
This is a tough fish.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.600
One more time.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.040
Pull. Oh! They got him.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:45.550
Look out. Oh, yes!

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.050
They got him.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.350
Happy penguin?

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.910
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.280
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Happy Flora.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.450
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.750
No.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.050
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Yeah.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.430
And now, where do you
think the fish is?

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.730
&gt;&gt; Child: In his mouth.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.030
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Mm-hmm.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.330
He ate the fish all up.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.630
&gt;&gt; Child: It's in his tummy.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.050
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: In his tummy.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.670
And off they go.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.270
Do you guys know what
this symbol is?

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.570
&gt;&gt; Child: Figure eight.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.870
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: It's a figure eight.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.140
It is also the infinity symbol.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.320
Infinity means things go on forever

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.740
and I think they will
be friends forever.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.490
The end. [Inaudible]

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.010
That's right.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.700
Because good friends
are always there.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.780
That's true.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.040
Thank you guys for being
such good listeners today.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.790
Can you please give yourselves
a big round of applause

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.510
for being such good listeners?

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.270
[ Applause ]

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.170
&gt;&gt; Child: Can we do one more?

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.290
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: That's
all I brought for today.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.690
But I'm glad you want one more.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.510
That makes me happy.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.890
It's so nice to visit
with you guys today.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.740
Should we make one
more drawing, maybe?

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.040
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yeah.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.340
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: One more drawing?

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.640
All right.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.940
Let's see.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.940
What if we draw a peacock?

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.240
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes!

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.540
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Yes?

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.880
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Yes!

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Let's draw a peacock.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.290
&gt;&gt; Child: Why not a penguin?

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:24.210
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: We could draw a
penguin, but I like peacocks, too.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.910
Do you know, we could start
with simple shapes again?

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.210
We could. We could.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.860
&gt;&gt; Child: I can see your shadow.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.160
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: You can?

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.460
We could make bunny ears.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.750
Or a bird.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.940
But -- oh, let's draw a bird
instead of making a shadow bird.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.240
We'll draw a peacock.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.790
I'm going to put another oval here.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.290
And an up and down oval here.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.830
&gt;&gt; Child: What are you doing?

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:01.260
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: I am
going to make a peacock.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.610
&gt;&gt; Child: And then
can we make a penguin?

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.440
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: [Laughs] Let's see,
so we have an oval and an oval.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.650
Let's put a triangle here.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Child: You'll see when it's done.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.910
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: That's right.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.300
And an oval.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.510
But you know what peacocks have.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.560
[ Multiple conversations ]

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.060
[Laughs] I like that.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.120
Let's divide things up.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.070
Now, there's our simple shapes.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.100
But now we can do connect
the shapes again, can't we?

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.500
And bring them all together.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.890
Little peacock feet.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.040
And they have little
top not feathers.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.110
Oh, we almost forgot his wings.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:16.280
Their wings have like a
checkerboard pattern on them, too.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.040
Very fancy.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.030
And they have on the
ends of their feathers.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.370
Child: And they have circles.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.600
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: They do and those
circle feathers are called eye

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.240
feathers, because they look like --

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.540
&gt;&gt; Children [Together]: Eyes.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.840
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Eyes.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.270
Let's add some now.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.310
&gt;&gt; Child: It scares away predators.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.860
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: It absolutely does.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:47.130
You are a very knowledgeable
group about your birds.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:53.150
Exactly. So it's like
we put all these ovals

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.100
and then we have to
put circles inside.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.400
&gt;&gt; Child: Like a butterfly.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.700
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: Like a butterfly?

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.640
Butterflies use that, too.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.050
You're absolutely right.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.430
&gt;&gt; Child: And some fish!

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.000
&gt;&gt; Molly Idle: And some fish.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.890
I don't know.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.010
Oh, some fish have that
kind of camouflage.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.310
You're right.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.410
And there's a peacock.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.710
Mm-hmm.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.360
