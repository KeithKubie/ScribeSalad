00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.500
What we're going to
try to do in this video

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.470
is approximate the
area under the curve y

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.940
is equal to x squared plus 1
between the intervals x equals

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.830
1 and x equals 3.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.270
And we're going
to approximate it

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.170
by constructing four rectangles
under the curve of equal width.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.960
So let's first think about what
those rectangles look like, so

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.470
four rectangles of equal width.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
So it looks like that,
like that, and like that.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.420
And I haven't really defined the
top of the rectangles just yet.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.410
But let's think about
what those widths have

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.118
to be if they're going
to be equal width.

00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:41.630
And we can call
that width delta x.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.840
So this distance
right over here,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.170
we're going to
call that delta x.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.720
So delta x is going to have
to be the total distance

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.010
that we're traveling in x.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.450
So we finish at 3.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.840
We started at 1.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.600
And we want four
equal-width rectangles.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.420
So it's going to
be equal to 1/2.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.660
So for example,
this first interval

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.800
between the boundary between the
first rectangle and the second

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.970
is going to be 1.5.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.420
Then we go 1/2 to 2.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480
Then we go to 2.5.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.505
And then we go 1/2 to 3.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:15.130
Now, let's think
about how we'll define

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.009
the height of the rectangles.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.300
For the sake of this video--
we'll see in future videos

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.030
that there's other
ways of doing this--

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.910
I'm going to use the left
boundary of the rectangle

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.450
to define the height-- or
the function, I should say.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.050
I'm going to use the function
evaluated at the left boundary

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.310
to define the height.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.470
So for example, for
the first rectangle,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.720
this point right
over here is f of 1.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.070
And so I will say that
that is the height

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.690
of our first rectangle.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.940
Then we go over here
to the left boundary

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.450
of the second rectangle.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.530
We're now looking at the
function evaluated at 1.5.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.980
So that is f of 1.5.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.200
That's the height.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.360
And so we get our
second rectangle.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.880
Then, we get-- I can keep
going like this-- we get,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.290
for this third
rectangle, we have

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.445
the function evaluated at 2.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.280
So that's right over here.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.100
That's f of 2.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.660
And so then we get
our third rectangle.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.950
And then, finally, we
have our fourth rectangle,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.760
the function evaluated at 2.5.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.810
So the function evaluated
at 2.5 is the height.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.160
So this is f of 2.5.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.430
Remember, in each
of these, I'm just

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.350
looking at the left
boundary of the rectangle

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.750
and evaluating
the function there

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.700
to get the height
of the rectangle.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.200
Now that I've set
it up in this way,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.880
what is the total
approximate area

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.970
using the sum of
these rectangles?

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.830
And clearly, this isn't going
to be a perfect approximation.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.404
I'm giving up on a
bunch of area here.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:57.320
Let me see if I can color
that in with a color

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.670
that I have not used.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.890
So I'm giving up.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.080
I'm giving up this area.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.760
I'm giving up this area.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.590
I'm giving up that area.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.774
I'm giving up that area there.

00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:08.190
But this is just
an approximation,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.080
and maybe if I had
many more rectangles,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.700
it would be a better
approximation.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.200
So let's figure out what the
areas of each of the rectangles

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.700
are.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.200
So the area of this
first rectangle

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.170
is going to be the
height, which is f of 1,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.660
times the base,
which is delta x.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.300
The area of the
second rectangle is

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.860
going to be the height, which
we already said was f of 1.5,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.050
times the base, times delta x.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.110
The height of the
third rectangle

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.270
is going to be the function
evaluated at its left boundary,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.820
so f of 2-- so plus f of 2
times the base, times delta x.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.660
And then, finally, the area of
the third rectangle, the height

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.660
is the function
evaluated at 2.5,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.710
so plus-- that's
a different color

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.710
than what I wanted to use.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.810
I wanted to use that
orange color-- so

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.030
plus the function evaluated
at 2.5 times the base.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.300
This is going to be equal
to our approximate area--

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.760
let me make it clear--
approximate area

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.940
under the curve, just the
sum of these rectangles.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.779
So let's evaluate this.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.260
So this is going
to be equal to f

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.520
of-- it's going to be equal to
the function evaluated at 1.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.680
1 squared plus 1 is just 2, so
it's going to be 2 times 1/2.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.830
Plus the function
evaluated at 1.25.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.690
1.25 squared is 2.25.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.910
And then you add 1 to
it, it becomes 3.25.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.570
So plus 3.25 times 1/2.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.580
And then we have the
function evaluated at 2.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.830
Well, 2 squared plus 1 is
5, so it's 5 times 1/2.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.910
And then finally, you have
the function evaluated at 2.5.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.760
2.5 squared is 6.25 plus 1.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.964
So that's 7.25 times 1/2.

00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:14.380
And just to make
the math simpler,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.660
we can factor out the 1/2.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.350
So this is going to be
equal to-- write 1/2

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:33.480
in a neutral color-- 1/2
times 2 plus 3.25 plus 5

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:43.360
plus 7.25, which is equal
to 1/2 times-- let's

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.140
see if I can do this in my head.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.500
2 plus 5 is easy.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.774
That's 7.

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:49.950
3 plus 7 is 10.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.680
And then we have 0.25
plus 0.25, so it's

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.910
going to be 10.5 plus 7 is 17.5.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:04.460
So 1/2 times 17.5,
which is equal to 8.75,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.036
Which, once again, gives
us an approximation.

00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:09.260
And clearly, the way I've
drawn it right over here,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.004
for the function
we're using, it's

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:13.170
going to be an underestimate,
because we've given up

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.360
all that pink area that
I had colored in before.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.890
It's an underestimate,
but it's an approximation

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.902
of the area under the curve.

00:06:19.902 --> 00:06:21.360
In the next few
videos, we're going

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.040
to try to generalize
this to situations where

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.540
we have an arbitrary
function and we

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.720
have an arbitrary
number of rectangles.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.110
And we'll also start--
in videos after that,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.480
we'll look at rectangles
where we define the height not

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.480
by the left boundary, but
by the right boundary,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.600
or by the midpoint.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.630
Or maybe we don't use
rectangles at all.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.010
Maybe we might use
things like trapezoids.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.230
Anyway, have fun.
