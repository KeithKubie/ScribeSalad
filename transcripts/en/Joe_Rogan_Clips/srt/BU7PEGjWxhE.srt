1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
Oh, any blinded. This is how
crooked the game was. He applied it.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,220
Ali Cassius clay.
So listen wasn't above,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,870
you know, cheating. Yeah. Do
you remember that fighter?

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,260
Oh my God, this is so frightening. He,

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,240
he wrapped something in his Louie
Resto. Yeah, with it cement sums junior.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,020
No, he took all the padding out of
his gloves back in the day. The,

7
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,500
they used to use horse hair
with the gloves and you could,

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,920
you could put a little hole in the
gloves and pull the padding out.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,900
And Louie Resto,

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,400
Panama Lewis was his trainer and Panama
Lewis was also the same guy that gave,

11
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,570
uh,
Aaron Pryor,

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,460
that little a jab of cocaine right
before he knocked out Alexis Arguayo

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,580
remember, I mean they think it was
cocaine. He said gimme the other bottle,

14
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,190
the one that I prepared,
he gives it to Aaron Pryor.

15
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,730
And then Aaron Pryor goes out
and starches Aleks, SARC way out.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,480
And they had a crazy war of a fight.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,790
And then he gives them
something in this little bottle.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,910
And then Aaron Pryor goes out like
a bat out of hell. And, and the,

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,710
the question was always what was in that
bottle cause there was no sophisticated

20
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,230
drug testing back then,
but Panama Louis,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,460
but there was one of them that actually
puts cement or something in their gloves.

22
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,540
Um, there was that, that was
a more recent one that was a,

23
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,250
that Mexican gentleman that fought,
uh, what did he do that too?

24
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,280
Is that the red hand? No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,660
He doesn't isn't fight anymore. Fuck,
I'm drawing a blank on his name.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,560
But he, he beat up some really
prominent fighters that way.

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,490
Who the fuck did he,
it was a one fight in particular.

28
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,910
Boy, I'm seeing the guy in my face. Yes.

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,080
Antonio Margarito who pull, pull up
his record because he did it to, uh,

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,280
he did it to some like
legit fighters and uh,

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,820
really beat them up and they were like,

32
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,360
it didn't even make sense how
hard he was hitting me because he,

33
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:58,050
he would put plaster of Paris apparently
inside the wraps and Miguel Cotto

34
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,720
that's who it was. Right. And then
Miguel Cotto beat the shit out of it.

35
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,010
And the rematch.
Shane Mosley,

36
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,940
sugar Shane Mosley beat the fuck out
of him when they found this seat.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,210
After he knocked out Miguel Cotto,
we beat him up in the 11th round.

38
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,540
He stopped him and was a horrible stoppage
too. He beat the shit out of them.

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,500
Then the Shane Mosley fight was the fight
that he lost. That was the next fight.

40
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,110
And during the wrapping of the gloves,

41
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,280
Shane Mosley's camp was go,
what the fuck is in his raps?

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,750
They recognized it and it had a Murray
wrap his hands and then Shane Mosley beat

43
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:32,220
his fucking ass and then he'd beat Robert
Garcia and then Manny Pacquiao fucked

44
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:36,900
him up. And then Miguel Cotto fucked
him up. Um, but the Miguel Cotto fight,

45
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,820
the first one, it was, it was bad.

46
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:43,821
I mean his face was busted up and
that's when people had suspicions,

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,310
but they didn't know until they
saw the wrapping of the gloves.

48
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,740
And then they looked at every one of his
fights before that. And then we'd go, oh,

49
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,720
this motherfucker had plans.
You go see the movie. Um,

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,700
that city fat city,
Stacy Keach.

51
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,370
It's about club fighters down at Stockton,
California.

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,300
Fantastic movie bridges.
First movies. Yeah.

53
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,430
And John used and directed it.
We one of the best fight movies ever.

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,420
This fight that I was talking about
earlier, the Louie Resto fight,

55
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,620
this Billy Collins junior guy was a,

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,910
he was an up and coming contender and he
was blinded in the fight and can never

57
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,510
fight again. Wow. This kid a
that he fought Louie Resto,

58
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:26,320
they pulled all the padding out of the
gloves and he just fucked up this guy's

59
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,000
face to the point where,
you know,

60
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:32,950
I had detached retinas and he couldn't
see straight came an alcoholic afterwards

61
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,640
when you're is right there, look at his
face. Wow. Yeah. And it became a, a,

62
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:41,980
a really big, a big store with
a deadly weapon right there,

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,660
I think at the end of the other guys
life or at some point he admitted that he

64
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,494
did it.

65
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,370
There was some documentary about it that
the guide finally admitted that he was

66
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:55,090
using. Oh, people have done that
forever. People have done that forever.

67
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,670
I was sparring with a guy once and I
want to touch his gloves and I was like,

68
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,060
what the fuck is in your gloves?
And His padding had all been,

69
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:03,430
it was those old style
old style boxing gloves.

70
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,430
The padding little putting
pushed back and it was like,

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,650
it was all like almost raw
knuckle people are assholes. Yeah,

72
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,090
I've,
I've experienced that before.

73
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:16,520
What's interesting now is that people
are actually fighting bare knuckle.

74
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,480
There's a whole bare knuckle
boxing organization out of Wyoming.

75
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:21,700
Do you have all your knuckle?
Yeah, they're all there.

76
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,750
They've been single in one broken up.
One note was broken. Yeah. Oh, wow.

77
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:28,930
Moves Weird cliques.
That was Bobby cell and he's knows

78
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,920
Bobby Salvey. Is there a more fucking
Boston named Bobby Saudi? Bobby Salvey.

79
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,580
I fucking hit him. What a fucking
over hand fucking lefty. Fuck.

80
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,580
I went down like this.
