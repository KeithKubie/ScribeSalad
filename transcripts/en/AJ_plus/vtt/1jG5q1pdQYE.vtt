00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.720
A New York Times report from 2018 claims that the Trump administration held

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.840
with Venezuelan military officers

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.120
to discuss their plans

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.760
That would not have been the first time

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.920
a U.S. administration has meddled in Venezuela's affairs.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.800
In fact,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.760
Well, it's not new, as the history record proves.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.680
The U.S. has sought regime change in Venezuela

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.440
since the election of Hugo Chávez.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.560
This has been going on a long time, I think the main difference

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.560
is that the Trump administration

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.920
is much more aggressive about it and open about it.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.880
But you can't talk about U.S. intervention in Venezuela

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.640
or even Latin America, without mentioning a nearly 200-year-old policy

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.280
called the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.040
To put it simply, it basically declared that the United States

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.160
had a kind of supremacy in this hemisphere.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.640
Originally designed to block European powers claiming colonies in Latin America,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.840
the Monroe Doctrine was later interpreted

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.320
to mean the U.S. also

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.360
on the continent through

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.320
The United States is an empire.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.080
And so if you're an empire,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.720
you want as many countries

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.040
as possible to line up with you.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.840
And so the pawns matter as well

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.360
in a chess game.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320
In 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.600
Many years ago, the United States

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.240
dictated a policy

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.960
that defined the hemisphere for many years after.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.880
But how true is that statement?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.800
In terms of foreign policy,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.280
there is very little difference

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.400
between liberal Democrats

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.160
and conservative Republicans

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.560
on the matter of exercise of U.S. foreign power

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.440
in Latin America.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.720
Venezuela also checks another key box of reasons

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.040
for U.S. intervention:

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.440
Venezuela's petroleum production reached

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.760
an all-time high in 1970.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.240
A few years later in 1976,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.640
Venezuela has some of the largest deposits

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.720
of oil in the world

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.160
and potentially,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.360
as Mr. Bolton has said,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.840
Venezuela was always seen as a

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.440
very willing ally

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.440
and also as a constant supply of oil.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.560
But beyond oil, the U.S. was desperate

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.080
to prevent this former ally

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960
from becoming a socialist state.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.360
Venezuela was the beginning of a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.960
in Latin America beginning in 1998.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.560
Venezuela went from being the model democracy,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.200
the preferred option that the U.S. promoted in Latin America,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.000
a pacted democracy that always supported the U.S.,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.800
to being its nemesis with the election of Hugo Chávez, who promoted

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.600
and an alternative

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.280
to the U.S. promotion of

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.760
in Latin America.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.520
Hugo Chávez's election was

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.560
particularly concerning for the U.S.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.240
He not only sought to use Venezuela's oil wealth

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.480
to fund healthcare, education

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.720
and other benefits for the poor,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.240
but he also aligned with Cuba's Fidel Castro -

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.360
Washington's longtime nemesis in Latin America.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.840
So in that sense, Venezuela becomes a thorn in the side of the U.S.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.520
and you add to that, that the election of Chávez in Venezuela was quickly

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.040
followed by Lula in Brazil,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.000
the Kirchners in Argentina,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.240
Correa in Ecuador,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.520
Morales in Bolivia,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.080
Bachelet in Chile.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.440
and [that] threatened the U.S.' hegemony.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.680
So that what's happening now, in many cases,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.760
is an effort to recoup that hegemony,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.040
and Venezuela is part of that effort

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.560
to recover the U.S.' control and power.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.400
Venezuelan military officers and opposition leaders

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.160
staged a coup to overthrow President Chávez.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.400
U.S. government officials serving under

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.320
George W. Bush at the time

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.800
denied having any prior knowledge of the coup.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.040
While American officials said they would not support

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.160
any extra-constitutional moves to oust Chávez ...

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.800
There were CIA documents that were made public that showed that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.120
the United States government had advanced knowledge of the coup.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.000
Intervention doesn't always rely on force.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.400
President Trump announced sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil industry

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.000
in an effort to press for change in the country.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.920
What we're focusing on today is disconnecting

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.240
the illegitimate Maduro regime from the sources of its revenues.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.120
I think that from the very beginning [of the Chávez era],

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.760
the U.S. policy towards Venezuela has been one of isolating Venezuela.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.800
This was under the Bush,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.600
Obama

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.640
and now the Trump administration.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.560
Venezuela depends on oil for about 95% of its export earnings.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.440
[Venezuela] takes all profits, purchases food, brings it back to the country for sale.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.960
That means it can be easily intervened and can be easily upended.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.240
So sanction means that the country no longer can, on many levels

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.840
be able to utilize its foreign assets to buy food and bring it home.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.720
Sanctions also mean it can't renegotiate its debt.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.040
Sanctions also mean it can't buy on the international market.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.120
After the death of Hugo Chávez in 2013,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.000
his former deputy Nicolás Maduro took power.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.360
Since then, Venezuela has been rocked by political, financial and 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.720
humanitarian crises.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.200
And ordinary Venezuelans are bearing the brunt of all of them.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.200
The country is facing

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.800
People are struggling to afford basic necessities, including medicine.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.160
like Colombia and Brazil.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.680
While Maduro blames the U.S.,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.000
critics, including many former supporters and officials of Hugo Chávez,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.400
blame

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.800
President Trump took advantage of the chaos and division in Venezuela

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.400
to throw his support behind the

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.360
Keep in mind that the U.S.' involvement in Venezuela

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.680
fits a long-term pattern of U.S. intervention in Latin American politics.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.200
So, you have a long history of U.S. intervention in the region,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.000
and it's very anti-democratic,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.200
very often supported dictatorships.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.880
And in the 21st century, it was mostly against these leftist governments

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.760
who were more interested in independence and self determination

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.360
than the prior governments that were close to the U.S.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.800
The Trump administration has now called on veteran foreign policy advisor

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.480
Elliott Abrams to act as special envoy for Venezuela

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.520
Abrams certainly has experience in the region,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.200
but that experience has not necessarily been in promoting democracy.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.920
Throughout the 1980s, he was a key figure in

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.320
organizing the Reagan administration's support for dictators and death squads

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.240
in El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama and Nicaragua.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.120
He pleaded guilty in 1991 to two counts of misdemeanor

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.480
for withholding information from Congress

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.320
about illegal U.S. funding

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.320
for right-wing Nicaraguan paramilitaries - the Iran-Contra affair.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.040
The selection of Elliot Abrams shows that it's very similar

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.760
to what they were doing in the 1980s when they were trying to overthrow

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.920
the elected government of Nicaragua.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.400
And there was so much resistance to it, by the way, in the United States

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.640
that the Reagan administration had to end up funding the contras illegally

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.080
with the arms sales to Iran.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.720
This is the neocons like John Bolton coming back and just trying to do

00:07:47.512 --> 00:07:51.760
Whatever the intentions of the United States, the opposition to Maduro is

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.600
growing - and popular.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.400
Years of economic mismanagement, corruption

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.240
and authoritarian repression of the media and political opposition

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.960
has drawn even many supporters of Hugo Chávez onto the streets

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.000
So, is it possible to want change in Venezuela

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.600
but oppose U.S. involvement in the country?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.560
I agree, there needs to be change in Venezuela

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.680
but the Venezuelans have to decide that.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.920
It's a very slippery slope when we go down having the U.S.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.920
become the arbiter of internal politics in any country.
