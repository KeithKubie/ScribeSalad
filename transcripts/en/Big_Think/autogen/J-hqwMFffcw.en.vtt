is under software control the locks are
 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.500
is under software control the locks are
under software controls so you can push

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510
under software controls so you can push
 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.090
under software controls so you can push
the key fob button and have your locks

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100
the key fob button and have your locks
 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.400
the key fob button and have your locks
open essentially all of the

thing having it be under software
 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.330
thing having it be under software
control means that you can get increased

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340
control means that you can get increased
 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.039

things better all that's really good
 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.280
things better all that's really good
the downside is that because it's

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
the downside is that because it's
 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.050
the downside is that because it's
controlled by software if an attacker

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
controlled by software if an attacker
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.580
controlled by software if an attacker
can come in and replace that software

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
can come in and replace that software
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.589
can come in and replace that software
then they can control the braking and

things right it costs money so the car

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340
things right it costs money so the car

industry could improve the security of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
industry could improve the security of
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.780
industry could improve the security of
their cars and hopefully they will

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
their cars and hopefully they will
 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.080
their cars and hopefully they will
eventually that improvement will cost

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090
eventually that improvement will cost
 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.180
eventually that improvement will cost
them money and the car industry doesn't

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190
them money and the car industry doesn't
 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.159
them money and the car industry doesn't
have huge profit margins they can't

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169
have huge profit margins they can't
 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.259
have huge profit margins they can't
really afford to invest in the security

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269
really afford to invest in the security
 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.150

associated with that investment by
 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.770
associated with that investment by
passing the cost on to the consumer so

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780
passing the cost on to the consumer so
 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.629

that means the price of the car is going

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639
that means the price of the car is going
 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.110
that means the price of the car is going
to be higher so then why is the consumer

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120
to be higher so then why is the consumer
 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.550
to be higher so then why is the consumer
are gonna go buy the car that's more

manufacturer well typically the answer

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370
manufacturer well typically the answer
 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.860
manufacturer well typically the answer
is well you do advertising you explain

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870
is well you do advertising you explain
 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.659
is well you do advertising you explain
to the consumer why they're getting more

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669
to the consumer why they're getting more
 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.750

most consumers these days probably think
their car was already cyber secure they

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620
their car was already cyber secure they
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.140
their car was already cyber secure they
didn't realize that their car could be

another reason why the car companies
 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.379
another reason why the car companies
can't advertise on the security is

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389
can't advertise on the security is
 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.450
can't advertise on the security is
suppose one car company actually did go

and invest a ton in making their cars
more secure and then they advertise

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970
more secure and then they advertise
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.570
more secure and then they advertise
their car was more secure that's kind of
