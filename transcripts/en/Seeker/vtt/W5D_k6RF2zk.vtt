00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.380
The Earth from space is always a stunning
sight, and as the technology develops it gets

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.860
even better, if a little voyeuristic.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.720
Hey guys, Amy here talking space with you
today on DNews, and specifically talking about

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.110
looking at space.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.180
Space-based photography wasn’t a top priority
when we first started leaving our planet but

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.600
it quickly became a boon to science and a
hugely popular spinoff, though the first images

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.300
weren’t exactly the stunning ones we’re
used to seeing today.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.620
The Earth was first imaged from space in 1946,
from a 35-millimeter motion picture camera

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.550
mounted on a recovered Nazi V-2 rocket launched
from the US Army’s White Sands Proving Ground

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.550
in New Mexico.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.040
It’s a grainy black and white image that
doesn’t look too impressive, but it’s

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.040
pretty historic.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840
Fast forward to the first manned spaceflight
program in America, NASA’s Mercury program,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.750
where photography was an afterthought.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.250
No one knew whether astronauts would be able
to function in microgravity let alone use

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.370
a camera, and there were concerns that astronauts
snapping pictures in orbit would be misconstrued

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.970
by the Soviet Union as spy photography and
start a new war.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.189
NASA gave John Glenn an Ansco Autoset 35mm
camera, manufactured by Minolta, that was

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.189
purchased in a local drug store.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.359
The only thing space-aged were the modifications
that made it possible for Glenn to actually

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:16.840
use it in a pressure suit, which he did during
his 1962 orbital flight.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.509
Finally thinking about imagery, NASA sent
its mid-1960s Gemini astronauts into space

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.850
with Swedish-made Hasselblad 550C medium format
cameras, again, standard technology of the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.850
day.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.840
The Hasselblads proved popular enough to fly
to the Moon on Apollo missions.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.909
The first mission to photograph the Earth
from the Moon, Apollo 8, took Hasselblad EL

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.310
electric cameras with them.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.950
The astronauts set the distance, lens aperture,
and shutter speed for the shot then let the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.110
camera shoot and advance the film itself.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.619
There were also multiple lenses on these cameras,
an 80mm normal lens and a 250mm telephoto

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.619
lens.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.770
Apollo 11, the first mission to land on the
Moon, added a Kodak stereo close-up camera

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.770
to the photography roster.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.780
Of course, none of these images could show
us any real detail of the planet.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.919
Major features could be resolved like mountains
and cloud formations, but we didn’t see

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:02.329
cars on freeways.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.520
More than 40 years later, some modern photography
experiments don’t show much more detail.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.860
NASA’s High Definition Earth Viewing experiment
uses commercial HD cameras mounted on the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.209
ISS to show a livestream of the planet, though
all we can really see is clouds and major

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.300
geologic features.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.030
And a lot of ocean.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.290
But UrtheCast has taken viewing the Earth
from space to new levels.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.330
Specifically, new levels of detail.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.170
The company’s cameras on the ISS don’t
show the majesty of our planet, they resolve

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.989
details up to three feet across.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.470
That’s enough detail to see individual cars,
and because it’s a streaming view, we can

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.930
actually see them driving along roads in full
colour, though the length of an individual

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.750
shot is limited to 60 seconds.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.980
It’s a stunning development that UrtheCast
hopes will highlight the things that draw

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.239
humanity together -- the living environment,
humanitarian projects, and social events.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.180
There’s another side to this, though, and
that’s the prospect that this technology

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.770
brings with it real-time monitoring, keeping
an eye on, say terrorist groups, which means

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.709
that terrorist groups could keep an eye on
targets, which is sort of the scary way to

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.370
look at this incredible tech.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.489
So what do you guys think about the evolution
of Earth photography from space?

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.190
Is it highlighting all that’s beautiful
in the world or becoming a little too much

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.890
like Big Brother is watching us?
