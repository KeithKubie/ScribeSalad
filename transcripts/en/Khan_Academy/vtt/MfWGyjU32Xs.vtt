00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.880
- [Instructor] Borderlands
Food Bank, an organization

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.860
in Nogales, Arizona rescue
millions of pounds of

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.420
slightly imperfect
imported food every year.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.890
And then they underline the verb rescue,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.060
and we see all of the choices
here are have rescued,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.440
are rescuing, rescues, so they're all

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.690
different forms of the verb rescue.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.523
So, let's just think about it.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.010
Let's first of all, what
is doing the rescuing?

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.090
So, we see the thing
that's doing the rescuing

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540
is Borderlands Food Bank.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.230
Borderlands Food Bank,
which is an organization

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.940
in Nogales, Arizona.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.130
Now, is Borderlands Food Bank
one thing or many things?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.410
Is it singular or is it plural?

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.340
Well, we're only talking
about one organization.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.410
We're only talking about one food bank,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.810
and so this right over here is singular.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.160
This is singular.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.080
It's not Borderlands Food Banks.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.010
Now, if you're not careful
when you see this S here,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.780
your brain might say, oh, I'm
dealing with something plural.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.450
But it's Borderlands Food Bank,
not Borderlands Food Banks.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.360
So, we have a singular subject here,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.410
and now what about the verb?

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.390
Is this the verb that we would
use for a singular subject?

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.070
Would you say, would you say,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.370
let's say, he, would you say he rescue?

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.770
He rescue, or would you say he rescues?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.190
Let me make those he
rescues, he rescues food,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.050
he rescue food, or would
you write he rescues food?

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.360
Rescues food.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.120
Well, if you have a singular subject,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.010
the singular form of the
verb rescue is rescues.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.360
So, since we have a singular subject here,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
we want to say Borderlands Food Bank,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.510
an organization in Nogales,
Arizona rescues millions of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.980
pounds of slightly imperfect
imported food every year.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.040
Rescue, this right over here,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.260
that is the plural form of the verb.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.270
So, you would say they rescue.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.490
They rescue food.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.760
If you have a plural subject,
if you have a plural subject,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.930
then you would go with rescue.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.330
So, this is the plural form,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.660
but you have a singular
subject, so you don't want that.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.690
You want the singular form of the verb.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.210
Singular form of the verb.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.580
You want rescues, so you
want rescues right over here.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.360
So, we already saw why we
definitely wanted to change it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.670
because it was the plural form.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.030
And actually, all of these
are also plural forms,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.630
but just in different tenses.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.070
If you say have, have rescued,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.170
have, you don't say he
have done something.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.240
You would say he has done something.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.070
You would say they have done something.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.340
So, this is still a plural form,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.980
and once again, you wouldn't
say he are rescuing,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.750
you would say they are rescuing,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.620
so this also is a plural form.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.260
So, the first three choices
are all the plural form

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.370
even though they're different tenses.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.800
Both plural form, even though
that the subject is singular.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.000
This right over here
has the appropriate verb

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.393
for a singular subject.
