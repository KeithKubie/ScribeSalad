00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:11.018
In 1996, 56 volunteers took part
in a study

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:14.653
to test a new painkiller called
Trivaricaine.

00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:18.773
On each subject, one index finger
was covered in the new painkiller

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:21.569
while the other remained untouched.

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.211
Then, both were squeezed
in painful clamps.

00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:29.526
The subjects reported that the treated
finger hurt less than the untreated one.

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.386
This shouldn't be surprising,

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:34.843
except Trivaricaine wasn't actually
a painkiller,

00:00:34.843 --> 00:00:39.066
just a fake concotion 
with no pain-easing properties at all.

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:43.073
What made the students so sure
this dummy drug had worked?

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:45.842
The answer lies in the placebo effect,

00:00:45.842 --> 00:00:47.286
an unexplained phenomenon

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:51.840
wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies
that aren't supposed to have an effect,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.405
and are often fake,

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:56.465
miraculously make people feel better.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:01:00.496
Doctors have used the term placebo
since the 1700s

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:05.175
when they realized the power of
fake drugs to improve people's symptoms.

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:08.086
These were administered when proper drugs
weren't available,

00:01:08.086 --> 00:01:11.371
or if someone imagined they were ill.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.522
In fact, the word placebo
means "I shall please" in Latin,

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:19.127
hinting at a history of placating
troubled patients.

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:23.026
Placebos had to mimic the real treatments
in order to be convincing,

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:25.270
so they took the form of sugar pills,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.625
water-filled injections,

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:29.492
and even sham surgeries.

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:33.871
Soon, doctors realized that duping people
in this way had another use:

00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:35.743
in clinical trials.

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:39.894
By the 1950s, researchers were using
placebos as a standard tool

00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:41.847
to test new treatments.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:43.687
To evaluate a new drug, for instance,

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:46.553
half the patients in a trial might receive
the real pill.

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:49.902
The other half would get a placebo
that looked the same.

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:54.213
Since patients wouldn't know whether
they'd received the real thing or a dud,

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:56.242
the results wouldn't be biased,

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.879
researchers believed.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:02.001
Then, if the new drug showed a significant
benefit compared to the placebo,

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.998
it was proved effective.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:09.501
Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos
this way because of ethical concerns.

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.038
If it's possible to compare a new drug
against an older version,

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:14.908
or another existing drug,

00:02:14.908 --> 00:02:18.645
that's preferable to simply giving
someone no treatment at all,

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:21.190
especially if they have a serious ailment.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.243
In these cases, placebos are often used
as a control to fine-tune the trial

00:02:26.243 --> 00:02:29.811
so that the effects of the new versus
the old or alternative drug

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:33.096
can be precisely compared.

00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:37.503
But of course, we know the placebos
exert their own influence, too.

00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:38.952
Thanks to the placebo effect,

00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:41.954
patients have experienced relief 
from a range of ailments,

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:43.273
including heart problems,

00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:44.422
asthma,

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.130
and severe pain,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.126
even though all they'd received
was a fake drug or sham surgery.

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.766
We're still trying to understand how.

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:54.765
Some believe that instead of being real,

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:58.625
the placebo effect is merely confused
with other factors,

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:03.129
like patients trying to please doctors
by falsely reporting improvements.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.123
On the other hand,

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:07.539
researchers think that if a person 
believes a fake treatment is real,

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:12.208
their expectations of recovery actually
do trigger physiological factors

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:14.241
that improve their symptoms.

00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:18.487
Placebos seem to be capable of causing
measurable change in blood pressure,

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:19.361
heart rate,

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.280
and the release of pain-reducing
chemicals, like endorphins.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.914
That explains why subjects in pain studies
often say placebos ease their discomfort.

00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:31.493
Placebos may even reduce levels
of stress hormones,

00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:32.974
like adrenaline,

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:35.995
which can slow the harmful effects
of an ailment.

00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:39.954
So shouldn't we celebrate
the placebo's bizarre benefits?

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:41.439
Not necessarily.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.975
If somebody believes a fake treatment
has cured them,

00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:48.586
they may miss out on drugs
or therapies that are proven to work.

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:51.774
Plus, the positive effects 
may fade over time,

00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:53.503
and often do.

00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:55.735
Placebos also cloud clinical results,

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.821
making scientists even 
more motivated to discover

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.491
how they wield such power over us.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.424
Despite everything we know about
the human body,

00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:07.450
there are still some strange
and enduring mysteries,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.184
like the placebo effect.

00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:13.404
So what other undiscovered marvels
might we contain?

00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:15.622
It's easy to investigate the world
around us

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:18.746
and forget that one of its most 
fascinating subjects

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:21.026
lies right behind our eyes.
