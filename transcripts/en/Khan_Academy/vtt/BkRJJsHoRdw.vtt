00:00:00.644 --> 00:00:04.292
- [Instructor] We're told
suppose that 15% of the 1,750

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:08.585
students at a school have
experienced extreme levels

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:10.643
of stress during the past month.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.844
A high school newspaper doesn't
know this figure, but they

00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:17.865
are curious what it is, so
they decide to ask a simple

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.824
random sample of 160 students
if they have experienced

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:25.523
extreme levels of stress
during the past month.

00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:30.160
Subsequently, they find that
10% of the sample replied "yes"

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.203
to the question.

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:36.313
Assuming the true proportion
is 15%, which they tell us

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:40.632
up here, they say 15% of
the population of the 1,750

00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:44.487
students actually have experienced
extreme levels of stress

00:00:44.487 --> 00:00:46.899
during the past month, so
that is the true proportion,

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.942
so let me just write that,
the true proportion for our

00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:52.723
population is 0.15, what is
the approximate probability

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:56.890
that more than 10% of the
sample would report that they

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.798
experienced extreme levels of
stress during the past month.

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:08.180
So pause this video and see
if you can answer it on your

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.835
own and there are four
choices here I'll scroll down

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:14.577
a little bit and see if you
can answer this on your own.

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.609
So the way that we're going
to tackle this is we're

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.776
going to think about the
sampling distribution of our

00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:25.604
sample proportions and first
we're going to say well

00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:29.499
is this sampling distribution
approximately normal,

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.666
is it approximately normal
and if it is, then we can use

00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:39.984
its mean and the standard
deviation and create a normal

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:43.340
distribution that has that same
mean and standard deviation

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.770
in order to approximate the
probability that they're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.940
asking for.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.365
So first this first part,
how do we decide this?

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:52.875
Well the rule of thumb we
have here and it is a rule

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:56.251
of thumb, is that if we take
our sample size times our

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:59.737
population proportion and that
is greater than or equal to

00:01:59.737 --> 00:02:03.904
ten and our sample size times
one minus our population

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.275
proportion is greater than
or equal to ten, then if both

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:11.579
of these are true then our
sampling distribution of our

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.259
sample proportions is going
to be approximately normal.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.707
So in this case the newspaper
is asking 160 students,

00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:21.874
that's the sample size, so
160, the true population

00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:26.939
proportion is 0.15 and that
needs to be greater than

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.248
or equal to ten and so let's
see this is going to be 16

00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:34.415
plus eight which is 24 and
24 is indeed greater than

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.443
or equal to ten so that
checks out and then if I take

00:02:38.443 --> 00:02:42.123
our sample size times one
minus P well one minus 15

00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:45.817
hundredths is going to be
85 hundredths and this is

00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:48.705
definitely going to be
greater than or equal to ten.

00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:51.628
Let's see this is going to
be 24 less than 160 so this

00:02:51.628 --> 00:02:56.425
is going to be 136 which is
way larger than ten so that

00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.750
checks out and so the sampling
distribution of our sample

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.987
proportions is approximately
going to be normal.

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:06.376
And so what is the mean and
standard deviation of our

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:08.349
sampling distribution?

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.481
So the mean of our sampling
distribution is just going to

00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:15.562
be our population proportion,
we've seen that in other

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.145
videos, which is equal to 0.15.

00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:23.777
And our standard deviation
of our sampling distribution

00:03:23.777 --> 00:03:27.944
of our sample proportions is
going to be equal to the square

00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:32.988
root of P times one minus
P over N which is equal to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.207
the square root of 0.15
times 0.85 all of that over

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:47.311
our sample size 160, so now
let's get our calculator out.

00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:51.478
So I'm going to take the
square root of .15 times .85

00:04:00.227 --> 00:04:03.977
divided by 160 and we
close those parentheses

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.053
and so what is this going to give me?

00:04:09.053 --> 00:04:13.184
So it's going to give me
approximately 0.028 and I'll

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:15.365
go to the thousandths place here.

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.948
So this is approximately 0.028.

00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:23.295
This is going to be approximately
a normal distribution

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:26.898
so you could draw your classic
bell curve for a normal

00:04:26.898 --> 00:04:30.287
distribution, so something like this.

00:04:30.287 --> 00:04:34.454
And our normal distribution
is going to have a mean,

00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:40.479
it's going to have a mean
right over here of, so this

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.348
is the mean, of our sampling
distribution, so this is

00:04:44.348 --> 00:04:48.047
going to be equal to the
same thing as our population

00:04:48.047 --> 00:04:51.755
proportion 0.15 and we
also know that our standard

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:55.922
deviation here is going to
be approximately equal to

00:04:57.572 --> 00:05:02.227
0.028 and what we want to know
is what is the approximate

00:05:02.227 --> 00:05:05.892
probability that more than
10% of the sample would

00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:08.531
report that they experienced
extreme levels of stress

00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.060
during the past month,
so we could say that 10%

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.951
would be right over here,
I'll say 0.10 and so

00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:18.760
the probability that in
a sample of 160 you get

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.053
a proportion for that sample,
a sample proportion that

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:26.220
is larger than 10% would be
this area right over here.

00:05:27.107 --> 00:05:31.107
So this right over here
would be the probability

00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:36.883
that your sample proportion
is greater than, they say

00:05:36.883 --> 00:05:41.050
is more than 10%, is more
than 0.10 just like that.

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:47.292
And then to calculate it, I can
get out our calculator again

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:51.458
so here I'm going to go to
my distribution menu right

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:54.164
over there and then I'm going
to do a normal cumulative

00:05:54.164 --> 00:05:58.530
distribution function, so
let me click Enter there.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.468
And so what is my lower bound?

00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:04.635
Well my lower bound is 10%
0.1, what is my upper bound?

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:09.415
Well we'll just make this one
'cause that is the highest

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:14.260
proportion you could have
for a sampling distribution

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.788
of sample proportions.

00:06:16.788 --> 00:06:20.955
Now what is our mean well
we already know that's 0.15.

00:06:22.124 --> 00:06:25.066
What is the standard deviation
of our sampling distribution?

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:29.233
Well it's approximately 0.028
and then I can click Enter

00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:35.934
and if you're taking an AP
exam you actually should write

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:38.788
this you should say, you
should tell the graders

00:06:38.788 --> 00:06:41.323
what you're actually typing
in in your normal CDF

00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:44.814
function, but if we click
Enter right over here,

00:06:44.814 --> 00:06:48.981
and then Enter, there we have
it, it's approximately 96%.

00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:54.390
So this is approximately 0.96
and then out of our choices

00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:57.597
it would be this one right over here.

00:06:57.597 --> 00:06:59.887
If you were taking this on
the AP exam you would say that

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:04.054
called, called normal normal
CDF where you have your

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:13.482
lower bound, lower bound, and
you would put in your 0.10

00:07:16.181 --> 00:07:20.651
you would say they use an
upper bound, upper bound

00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:25.028
of one, you would say that
you gave a mean of 0.15

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:29.831
and then you gave a
standard deviation of 0.028,

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:32.342
just so people know that you
knew what you were doing.

00:07:32.342 --> 00:07:34.202
But hopefully this is helpful.
