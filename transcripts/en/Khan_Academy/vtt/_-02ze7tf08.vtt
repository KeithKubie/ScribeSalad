00:00:00.863 --> 00:00:01.803
- [Voiceover] So here I'd like to talk

00:00:01.803 --> 00:00:03.487
about what the gradient means

00:00:03.487 --> 00:00:06.041
in the context of the graph of a function.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:09.134
So in the last video,
I defined the gradient,

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:10.680
but let me just take a function here.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.521
And the one that I had graphed
is x-squared plus y-squared,

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:17.681
f of x, y, equals
x-squared plus y-squared.

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.886
So two-dimensional input,
which we think about

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.325
as being kind of the xy-plane,

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:24.530
and then a one-dimensional
output that's just the height

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.748
of the graph above that plane.

00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:29.430
And I defined in the
last video, the gradient,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.287
to be a certain operator.

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:33.168
An operator just means
you've taken a function

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:34.527
and you output another function,

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:37.545
and we use this upside down triangle.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.483
So it gives you another
function that's also of x and y,

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:43.548
but this time it has a
vector valued output.

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:45.823
And the two components of its output

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:50.823
are the partial derivatives,
partial of f with respect to x,

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:56.326
and the partial of f with respect to y.

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:01.173
So for a function like this,
we actually evaluated it.

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:03.020
Let's take a look.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.010
The first one is taking the derivative

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.553
with respect to x, so
it looks at x and says,

00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:10.207
"You look like a variable to me.

00:01:10.207 --> 00:01:13.748
"I'm gonna take your derivative, your 2x."

00:01:13.748 --> 00:01:18.029
2x, but the y component
just looks like a constant

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:20.073
as far as the partial x is concerned.

00:01:20.073 --> 00:01:22.789
And the derivative of a constant is zero.

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.113
But when you take the partial derivative

00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:26.005
with respect to y, things reverse.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:27.364
It looks at the x component and says,

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:28.443
"You look like a constant.

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:29.872
"Your derivative is zero."

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:31.353
But it looks at the y component and says,

00:01:31.353 --> 00:01:32.874
"Ah, you look like a variable.

00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:36.636
"Your derivative is 2y."

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:38.586
So this ultimate function
we get, the gradient,

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:40.595
which takes in a two variable input, xy,

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:41.767
some point on this plane,

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.149
but outputs a vector,

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.448
can nicely be visualized
with a vector field.

00:01:45.448 --> 00:01:46.876
And I have another video on vector fields

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:48.130
if you're feeling unsure.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.893
But I want you to just take a
moment, pause if you need to,

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:54.387
and guess, or try to think
about what vector field

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:55.351
this will look like.

00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:56.210
I'm gonna show you in a moment,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.232
but what's it gonna look like,

00:01:57.232 --> 00:02:01.295
the one that takes in
xy and outputs 2x, 2y?

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:02.189
Alright, have you done it,

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.835
have you thought about
what it's gonna look like?

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:07.414
Here's what we get.

00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:10.630
It's a bunch of vectors
pointing away from the origin.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.290
And the basic reason for that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.716
is that if you have any given input point,

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:18.208
and say it's got coordinates x, y,

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:20.855
then the vector that that
input point represents

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.812
would, you know, if it
went from the origin here,

00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:24.194
that's what that vector looks like,

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:26.655
but the output is two times that vector.

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:29.627
So when we attach that
output to the original point,

00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:31.787
we get something that's two
times that original vector

00:02:31.787 --> 00:02:33.296
but pointing in the same direction,

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:34.770
which is away from the origin.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.789
We kind of drew it poorly here.

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.805
And of course, when we draw vector fields,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.603
we don't usually draw them to scale.

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:43.101
You scale them down

00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:44.680
just so that things
don't look as cluttered.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.479
That's why everything here,
they all look the same length,

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.023
but color indicates length.

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:50.183
So you should think of these
red guys as being really long,

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:52.365
the blue ones as being really short.

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:55.303
So what does this have to do
with the graph of the function?

00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:57.718
There's actually a really
cool interpretation.

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.725
So imagine that you are just
walking along this graph,

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:03.198
you know, you're a hiker
and this is a mountain.

00:03:03.198 --> 00:03:06.239
And you picture yourself at
any old point on this graph,

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.281
let's say, what color should I use?

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.859
Let's say you're sitting
at a point like this.

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.751
And you say, "What direction should I walk

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.760
"to increase my altitude the fastest?"

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.896
You want to get uphill
as quickly as possible.

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.022
And from that point,

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:22.551
you might walk what looks
like straight up there.

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:23.704
You certainly wouldn't go around,

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.388
and this way you wouldn't go down.

00:03:25.388 --> 00:03:27.571
So you might go straight up there.

00:03:27.571 --> 00:03:31.088
And if you project your point
down onto the input space,

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:34.223
so this is the point above which you are,

00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:37.462
that vector, the one
that's gonna get you going

00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:40.191
uphill the fastest, the
direction you should walk.

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:41.688
For this graph, it should
kind of make sense,

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.685
is directly away from the origin,

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:45.090
'cause here, I'll erase this

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.046
'cause once I start moving
things, that won't stick.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:51.529
If you were to look at
things from the very bottom,

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.967
any point that you are on the
mountain on the graph here

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.987
and when you want to increase the fastest,

00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:57.984
you should just go directly
away from the origin

00:03:57.984 --> 00:03:59.725
'cause that's when it's the steepest.

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.130
And all of these vectors are also pointing

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.872
directly away from the origin.

00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:05.612
So people will say the gradient
points in the direction

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:10.413
of steepest ascent, that might
even be worth writing down.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.916
Direction of steepest ascent.

00:04:18.963 --> 00:04:20.031
And let's just see what that looks like

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:21.889
in the context of another example.

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.652
So I'll pull up another graph here,

00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:27.044
pull up another graph
and its vector field.

00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:28.971
So this graph, it's all negative values,

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:30.608
it's all below the xy-plane,

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:32.907
and it's got these two different peaks.

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:34.567
And I've also drawn the gradient field,

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.141
which is the word for the vector field

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:38.800
representing the gradient on top.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.424
And you'll notice near the peak

00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:43.850
all of the vectors are pointing

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.267
kind of in the uphill direction,

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:48.100
sort of telling you to go
towards that peak in some way.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.188
And as you get a feel
around, you can see here,

00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:53.905
this very top one, like the
point that it's stemming from

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.470
corresponds with something
just a little bit shy

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.864
of the peak there.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:00.302
And everybody's telling you to go uphill.

00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:02.508
Each vector is telling
you which way to walk

00:05:02.508 --> 00:05:05.004
to increase the altitude
on the graph the fastest.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.268
It's the direction of steepest ascent.

00:05:07.268 --> 00:05:08.731
And that's what the direction means,

00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:11.041
but what does the length mean?

00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:11.589
Well, if you take a look,

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.609
take a look at these red vectors here.

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:16.441
So red means that they should
be considered very, very long.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.490
And the graph itself,

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.901
the point they correspond to on the graph

00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.247
is just way off screen for us

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:22.629
because this graph gets really steep

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.765
and really negative very fast.

00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:26.367
So the points these correspond to

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:28.364
have really, really steep slopes

00:05:28.364 --> 00:05:29.892
whereas these blue ones over here,

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:31.738
you know, it's kind of a
relatively shallow slope.

00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:33.421
By the time you're getting to the peak,

00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:35.082
things start leveling off.

00:05:35.082 --> 00:05:37.113
So the length of the gradient vector

00:05:37.113 --> 00:05:38.599
actually tells you the steepness

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.840
of that direction of steepest ascent.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.351
But one thing I want to point out here,

00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:46.343
it doesn't really make sense
immediately looking at it,

00:05:46.343 --> 00:05:49.415
why just throwing the partial
derivatives into a vector

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:53.106
is gonna give you this
direction of steepest ascent.

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:54.152
Ultimately it will.

00:05:54.152 --> 00:05:55.064
We're gonna talk through that

00:05:55.064 --> 00:05:57.583
and I hope to make that
connection pretty clear,

00:05:57.583 --> 00:06:00.346
but unless you're some
kind of intuitive genius,

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:03.806
I don't think that connection
is at all obvious at first.

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:05.281
But you will see it in due time.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.100
It's gonna require something

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.620
called the directional derivative.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.173
See you next video.
