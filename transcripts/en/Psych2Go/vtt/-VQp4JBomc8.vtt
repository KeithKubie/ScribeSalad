00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.620
Figuring out whether you're ready for sex,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.540
can be one of the hardest decisions in life.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.760
It doesn't matter whether you're someone wanting to

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.140
have sex for the very first time,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.040
or someone who's in a new relationship..

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.580
.. where sex hasn't happened yet.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.420
The thought process is pretty much the same.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.880
It's a big step,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.180
and something we should all think
pretty carefully about.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.720
So, how do you know if you're really ready for sex?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.560
First, you need to think about the risks,
associated with sex.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.320
And to be honest, there is a lot of them.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.940
We all know about the health and
pregnancy risks of sex.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.200
And these, are very important.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.720
But, what about the emotional risks?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.540
What do you start to lose?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.160
Will your relationship with that person be changed,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.420
in a way you're not comfortable with?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.140
Sex can make us form a strong, compassionate
connection with someone.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.420
Are you ready for those kinds of emotions?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.640
You might think that having sex is the right thing to do.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420
But is it really 𝙮𝙤𝙪, who wants sex?

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420
Or is it the world around you,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.640
pressuring you into doing something
you're not ready for?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.220
Peer pressure is a very real thing,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.980
especially when it comes to sex.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.160
Young people are under enormous pressure

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.860
to lose their virginities,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.460
and it kind of becomes a competitive thing.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460
Alternatively, even if you're not a virgin,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.260
people might still be pressuring you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.440
into having sex with someone new.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.200
In both situations,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.660
we really need to take a step back.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.660
And figure out what 𝙬𝙚 want.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.340
And whether we're actually ready for sex.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.620
This one is huge.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.220
Sex can change your relationship in pretty drastic ways.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.120
So it's important to know where you stand.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.400
Is it a serious relationship?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.220
Or are you two more friends than lovers?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.180
You need to make sure that both you,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.560
and your partner, are on the same page.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.780
If one person ends up falling in love,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.780
and the other isn't feeling it,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.340
it can lead to serious emotional
and psychological distress.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.860
And if you two are friends with benefits,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.380
ask yourself if you're willing to
lose that person as a friend.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.160
Because, believe us－

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.600
it can happen.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.780
Let's take a break from all the deep,
heavy emotional stuff

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.700
for some science coolness!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.140
Yes, we're talking about

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.440
figuring out when you're ready for sex.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.460
But, what if it's determined by your genes?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.620
That's right.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.620
Researchers at Cambridge University

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.700
found that genetics might determine about,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.860
25% of the differences,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.360
between when people lose their virginity.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.380
So what this means, is that losing our virginity

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.260
is something we can't rush,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.580
even if we want to.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.240
We have to wait for our bodies to be
biologically prepared,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.540
and for some,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.460
hormones don't start firing until later in life,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.500
simply because of the genetics we were born with.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.640
Sometimes, the best way to come to a decision,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.760
is to look into the past.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.540
What do your past experiences tell you?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.220
Learning from past relationships,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.980
is a natural part of developing,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.280
and maturing as an individual.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100
And the mistakes we make in the past

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.120
can help us improve our future romances.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.440
Did you have sex too early in past relationships?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.760
Maybe you felt like you could've had sex sooner
in your last relationship.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.500
Perhaps you felt like you should've had a discussion

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.200
with your partner before taking that next step.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.660
Obviously, this doesn't really apply to virgins.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.660
But if it's still your first time,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.880
you can still learn from the past.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880
We can all look back on times,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.760
where we rushed things too quickly.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.460
In conclusion,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.460
the most important thing to remember,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.780
is that you should definitely think long and hard about

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.580
having sex before going through with it.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.700
If you really ponder everything we just talked about,

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.820
we know you'll do the right thing.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.560
No pressure.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.380
